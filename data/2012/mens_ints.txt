_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Bonaventure  67  
Xavier ‑ 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mark Schmidt is on his way, we will dispense with the
opening statement, we will get to that when he gets here. We'll start with
questions for the players, Charlon Kloof and Andrew Nicholson.  
  
Q. Andrew, when it came to having a basket, and you needed to take a charge
you made key plays. Talk about being able to do that especially in a situation
like a Tournament Final.  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: It's a tournament, so we have to play every possession.
Every little thing counts, so those are just big plays, whether I block a
shot, take a shot, or prevent a big basket.  
  
Q. Andrew, when you were dribbling the ball out, 20 second left, what were
your thoughts? Was that when it hit you that you guys actually won this?  
CHARLON KLOOF: Before we got the ball, I saw the coach at Xavier telling his
guys to back off, and once I saw that I knew that that was the moment, and I
was so happy. I can't even describe it.  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: Yeah, that's why I came to St. Bonaventure for; that's what
I wanted to do, bring the Bonnie's back a Championship. When I saw that I
thought, we did it!  
  
Q. The feeling of climbing up the ladder and cutting down the net, what did
that feel like?  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: It's a good feeling, so much emotion, so much going through
your head. Played all season, intense, tough conference, just shows that hard
work paid off.  
CHARLON KLOOF: Um, I never imagined it, but I always, always knew that if we
worked hard, we could get somewhere, so we worked and‑‑ (Away from mic.)  
  
Q. Andrew, how aware were you about Camden, nine years ago, and what
happened here and at what point did it strike you about what you were a part
of in bringing things back?  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: I mean, I didn't really know what happened, as far as being
here, but I remember when Coach Schmidt recruited me, he said, "You are a
special player, you can do something," and I wanted to come to this school and
make a difference, and show everyone that we did it.  
  
Q. Andrew, you had ‑‑ St. Bonaventure had a bit of an issue closing out
Massachusetts yesterday, were you aware of that today when you‑‑ because you
seemed to step in and take charge at different points when Xavier was making
their push. Charlon, I noticed you stepped up and hit those shots today. Were
you thinking about yesterday at all?   
CHARLON KLOOF: Well, I didn't want‑‑ I didn't think about yesterday‑‑ (Away
from mic.)  
  
Q. Andrew, can you talk about the opportunity to play in the NCAA?  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: First time I've been there, something special, it's
exciting!  
  
Q. Can you talk about outside of your performance, can you talk about
different players stepping up, Charlon stepped up in the UMASS game and
yesterday Conger had a near triple ‑double and today you got a big
contribution from Eric off the bench, and yesterday Chris Johnson had a big
bench play, too.   
ANDREW NICHOLSON: Tournament play you need the whole team, it's not going to
be one guy who does it all. You need everybody to step up.  
  
Q. Andrew, today if you look at your numbers, 26, 14, 8, were you sitting
there going "I'm going to carry this team today"?   
ANDREW NICHOLSON: Yeah, I do that a lot, so, yeah, I basically said we need
everyone to just step up.  
  
Q. Charlon, can you talk about your play defensively. Tu Holloway and Mark
Lyons still get 33 points, but you slowed them down considerably. Can you talk
about that?  
CHARLON KLOOF: I was late on a couple of screens, but I wanted (Away from
mic.)  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the players? You guys can go. Thank
you. Mark, did you want to make a statement?  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, this is‑‑ I'm so excited for our players. It's a great
moment for the program, for the school, you know, I said it yesterday, from
where we've come, it's been a long, hard battle. A lot of times you work and
you work and you work and you still don't have success, but someone is looking
over us and I told the guys in the locker room, and we got lucky and we had
success and it worked out.  
Andrew was terrific, he talked about everybody playing their role and the
role, guys have to do what they're supposed to do, the point guard has to do
what he has to do, and your best player has to do what he does, and our best
player was the best guy on the court tonight, and that's the main reason why
we won.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. When you were hired to bring a program to this level, all of the hard
work for you personally, the impact to get to this point what does that mean
for you, Coach?  
COACH SCHMIDT: It's gratifying. You put so much hard work and you spend‑‑ it's
hard to say but you spend more time with your team than you do with your
family at times.  
Sometimes when you lose, you question if you have your priorities in order.
But when you have success like we had success today, it makes it worthwhile.  
It's a gratifying moment and satisfying, but it's still the players' win. They
won the game, they won the Tournament, they had a great season.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think the players right now have any idea what they've done
for the University ‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: No idea. No idea. They know they won a game, but it hasn't sunk
in yet and we'll get back to the hotel, and I think once we see it and when
our school comes across that board, I think that will be the time where they
realize what really happened.  
In terms of the impact it has on the University, no. When I was 18, 19, 20, I
didn't either.  
  
Q. Schmitty, when you took the job, did you ever any second thoughts ‑‑
Robert Morris took off after you left and you initially struggled. Did you
have any thoughts about that?   
COACH SCHMIDT: The late, great Skip Prosser told me it was better to leave one
year too early than one year too late. But he told what happens if your best
player blows his ACL? Not that Robert Morris was a bad job; I could probably
have been there for 20 more years, but that made my decision for me. There is
no second‑guessing. You never know whether you made the right decision or not
until you're there four, five months and I got a wife, three boys and it a
terrific place for us. It's been terrific.  
No second guessing. You can't look back, and we knew it was going to be
difficult in the very beginning when we took over. Robert Morris was 321 out
of 324 in the rpi, and we built that program, and we thought we had the
confidence to do the same at St. Bonaventure.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously the biggest stage of everyone's career, the first time
playing if a A ‑10 Championship game and there seemed to be in nerves
whatsoever, especially the way that you guys set the tone‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: We were playing with house money, nobody expected us to be
there, and we went out and played. I told the guys, we don't have to do
anything different, we've got to defend, rebound and take care of the ball and
play harder and smarter than the other team and we will win. It's a bigger
stage, CBS and all that stuff but our guys went out and played.  
We were always on the attack, we didn't play not to loose and I think someone
asked that question yesterday, I think we learned a great lesson in the UMASS
game where we stopped attack and go we played not to lose and today that
didn't happen, they made a run at us and we answered.  
  
Q. Mark, Andrew was saying when you recruited him you told him he could make
a difference. What did you see in him and now that it's all over ‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: When I first saw him, Coach Massey has the Toronto area, and he
went up there in the fall and saw this kid and called me up and said, "Coach,
you've got to get up here" and I said, "Who does he remind you of?" and he
said, "Greg Oden," and I said, "Really?" So the next week I saw him walk out
of the locker room, this 185‑pound kid, and I'm like, "That's him?" And as
soon as he started playing, I got goose bumps and I was like, oh my God how
does nobody know who this kid is?  
We knew he was going to be good, and the adjustment from Canadian basketball
to American basketball, and the first game he struggled and the second game he
played against Marist, we knew right then we had a player. After his freshman
year his mom and dad came down to pick 'em up and I told all three of them ‑‑
and at that time he was a chemistry major, and I said, "I want you to get your
chemistry degree, but if you do what you are supposed to, you have a chance to
be a pro," and he looked at me with those big eyes, and he said, "I had no
idea." And he's worked and worked and you see the results of that.  
  
Q. You coached David West. Is Andrew Nicholson the best player you've ever
coached?  
COACH SCHMIDT: That's a hard question, but he's the best player I've coached
as a head coach. (Chuckles.) David was a terrific player, but Andrew is
everything for us. David probably had more help around him and nothing against
our players now but we had pro's other than David on that team. But Andrew
was‑‑ someone asked me before I got up here, is he better than Bob Lanier, and
I said, "I can't tell you if he's better than Bob Lanier, but he's 'our' Bob
Lanier."  
  
Q. I asked Coach Mack whether this is the best performance he's ever seen,
and he said maybe on television he's seen better but not on the sidelines. Can
you comment on that?  
COACH SCHMIDT: That's Andrew. He has great touch, great feel, great feet, and
great mannerisms about him. You looking at the stat, 26‑14‑8 in the biggest
game of his career. He just goes out and plays. This is probably the most he's
ever talked in his life up here. He's a pleasure to coach. I can't say enough.
I'm lucky to have the opportunity to coach a kid that encompasses everything
you want in a player and in a student and most importantly as a kid.  
There is not enough words to describe what Andrew Nicholson is and what he
means to our program and what he means to me.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a good amount of buzz before the season started about
the NCAA Tournament and you were always quick to say one game at a time, we're
trying to get into the top ‑4, we have to earn things before we can talk about
that, and here you are now going to the NCAA Tournament.   
COACH SCHMIDT: It's a miracle. We lost two of our better players to injuries,
one the first second of the first game, Marquise Simmons, Michael Davenport,
we lost him, a potential 1,000 point scorer, so two of our top‑seven out for
the year and you look at each other and you say "what are we going to do?" But
the bench grew up. Youssou grew up, Jordan grew up, we got more from Da'Quan
and Eric, they stepped up and stepped into those positions and personally‑‑
especially Jordan and Youssou, wouldn't have played nearly as much but when we
had those two injuries early in the season they grew and one of the reasons
why we're here today is because of our bench.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about different players stepping up, on Friday it was
Charlon and yesterday, Chris, and ‑‑ Conger got a triple‑double yesterday.   
COACH SCHMIDT: That's the definition of a good team, it's not always going to
be one or two guys, guys coming off the bench, Chris did it yesterday, Eric
came off especially in the first half and hit shots and that's what you need.
It's not going to be such a competitive game, you're going to have your up's
and down's, but having a strong bench is critical too.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Bonaventure  67  
Xavier ‑ 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mack, opening statement.  
COACH MACK: It's a difficult moment. We came here as a group that wanted to
win our first Tournament Championship since 2006 and we fell short. I give St.
Bonaventure a lot of credit, they really hurt us on the offensive glass.  
Even when I felt like we were getting stops defensively, especially early in
the second half, they had what would seem like a minute and a half
possessions, because we could not get a defensive rebound and it's deflating
and I give those guys a lot of credit. They were men on the boards this
afternoon.  
We had done a good job leading up to the finals of blocking out and not giving
up second shots, to me that was the difference of the game. Their ability to
make free‑throws sealed it.  
I am proud of how this group came together. It's been a difficult year, a lot
of up's and down's, but this group of guys, the way we were able to come
together at the end of the year, get to the point where we played in the
Atlantic 10 Tournament Championship, as I told them in the locker room I loved
coaching this group this weekend.  
We have more basketball to play, it's a tough pill to swallow, but at the same
time for me personally it's very, very bitter sweet, because one of my best
friends, if not my best friend in the business, is the guy coaching the
Bonnie's. I know where he brought that team from, the depths they were in when
he took over, so as tough of a moment as this is for my team, our program,
myself, I could not be happier for Mark Schmidt and what he has accomplished,
and I wish him and those guys the best as they play next weekend.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, Kenny Frease and André Walker.  
  
Q. André, can you talk about your strategy coming into the game on Nicholson
and if it was different from when you played them in the regular?  
ANDRÉ WALKER: No, it was pretty much the same, get him out of the area where
he was most comfortable.  
  
Q. Was it too much of a deficit to come back from, was it too much of a hole
to climb out of?  
KENNY FREASE: We have been able to climb out of deficits like that all seen.
We sort of made it a habit of getting down in games, but I don't think when we
were down 17 we were‑‑ even 10 or 11 with 10 minutes to go we never counted
ourselves out of the game. I personally wanted to make plays down the stretch
for my team and like Coach said, we weren't able to rebound and get possession
and that's what ended up helping them win the game.  
  
Q. Kenny, what kind of challenges did Andrew present today on both ends of
the court for you guys?  
KENNY FREASE: Obviously offensively is he was able to withstand our defense
with his shooting abilities and offensive rebounds. Defensively, tough to
shoot over because he makes sure he keeps away from your body so it hard to
get shots over him. I personally didn't feel I met the challenge today and I
take personal responsibility with that.  
  
Q. Kenny can you talk about the first half and your shoot and go what they
were doing to you guys?  
KENNY FREASE: Everybody has off shooting nights. I don't know if it was
anything that they were particularly doing, a lot of the shots that we were
taking we usually make.  
I don't think it's anybody's individual fault, or anything like that, I think
we were just missing shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Okay, you guys can go. Questions
for Coach Mack?  
  
Q. Can you speak to that? Did you think it was a cold shooting start?  
COACH MACK: Well, their size had a lot to do with it. They're a very physical,
strong team. We hurt 'em in the first game and, un, really came out and shot
the ball well, we were out in transition and today you know when you play your
third game in three days it's a little bit tough on the legs to push the
basketball and get as many transition looks but we needed to do that.  
But they're long around the basket, and we just had a tough time gettin' open
looks. I thought we did a better job in the second half but we were impatient
in the first half and their size had a lot to do with that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the play of Charlon Kloof on the defensive
end?  
COACH MACK: He's a muscular, strong, physical guard. He does a great job when
he's defending a ball screen. He doesn't even make his post partners work.
They don't have to because he does a great job of blowing it up, he's
physical, he gets into the ball handler and it's as though there is no ball
screen.  
He's got quick hands, he's tenacious, he took it to our perimeter players.
He's a good defensive player, he really is.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Nicholson's performance? Have you seen a
performance like that this year?  
COACH MACK: Maybe I've seen it on television, not on the sidelines, he is an
NBA player, he is a pro. Man is he good. 26 points, 14 rebounds, he doesn't
meet the free‑throws, 6‑9, shoots the ball from the free, blocks eight shots.
We had a good plan that we were able to execute in game one and really crowd
him and make it difficult.  
He did a better job, he outexecuted our plan. He's unselfish, he gives it to
you any way you want it. He's a poor man's Tim Duncan, by far the best player
in our league and an NBA team needs to take him in the first round, period.
Glad he's gone, great kid, though.  
  
Q. Coach, what are your plans after this, where you're going to be watching
the show?  
COACH MACK: Back at the hotel, we won't have enough time to get back to
Cincinnati, so we're going back to the hotel, eat, and huddle around and watch
the selection show.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay, thanks, Coach.

THE MODERATOR: From UMASS, Terrell Vinson and Chaz Williams, Coach?  
COACH KELLOGG: I was happy with the way they continued to fight and claw and
come away with a loss against a St. Bonaventure team that I thought played
well.  
We never totally got the game into our flow until the last six, seven minutes
of the game where it was more up and down. So at that point I thought they
controlled tempo and did a very good job, but like I said I thought the kids
continued to fight and claw and gave ourselves a chance to win. We were a
small bounce from winning the game after‑‑ I would say after we didn't control
the game for the majority of it.  
I'm proud of the team, they've competed, and out of our 33 games I think they
have competed in just about every one of them and never quit until the end.
Sometimes you go home earlier than you like.  
  
Q. Did they do a better job especially early of attacking your press and
turning it into easy baskets?  
COACH KELLOGG: I thought they did a very good job, and it's one of the things
that is a double‑edge sword, where, as an opposing coach, do you take those
baskets or pull it out, and I thought they did a good job of attacking, and we
weren't as sharp as we have been in our press until the second half, and that
could be attributed to their press attack and making us pay at times.  
Sometimes I live with them scoring and getting the game moving a little bit so
we can get the game going and, unfortunately, I think they scored a few too
many.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see the last six or seven minutes that got your
pressure going and got you back in the game.  
COACH KELLOGG: I hate to say it, but when we make shots, it gives our guys a
little more energy to get into the press and I thought we finally made a few
3s and offensive possessions that looked good, and then we were able to get
into our press.  
At that point I felt like we had the tempo going our way, and I felt pretty
good, even when we were down 14‑12 and we were ready to make a little bit of a
run, and even within that run we made, I thought, two or three 3s, if my
memory is correct, didn't go in, T.V. had one that was right in there and we
missed one or two free‑throws.  
  
Q. Derek, with your foul situation the way it was, you guys went for the 3
there, were you going for the win ‑‑  
COACH KELLOGG: Yeah, absolutely! We ran a kind of play‑‑ a ball‑screen play,
and I had T.V. floatin' behind. I thought he was going to be open for the 3,
and they did a good job of rotating, and he hit Putt, and I yelled at him to
shoot is it, just like I yelled at Jesse three games ago against Temple to
shoot the three. I thought it was a great look for a kid, when you look out of
your office and see a guy shootin', that's the vision I have when they raise
up, that it's going in. Absolutely, a 2 was fine, a 3 was fine also in that
situation.  
  
Q. Chaz, did you feel like with the momentum you had that you were going to
pull it out?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, this game ‑‑ we wanted the win. This game meant a lot to
us, so when it got down to six minutes, we had our backs against the wall and
we were ready to play.  
  
Q. Can you describe the last shots, what you saw when it left Putney's hand.
Did you think it was going in?  
TERRELL VINSON: Most definitely, he was the only one open, he was down there
ready to shoot, I passed it to him, ball was in the air for a long time, but I
thought it was down when it left his hands.  
  
Q. Chaz, you guys have a lot of guys coming back next year, do you think
with this experience, the big win against Temple, you're right in there with
St. Bonaventure, is this experience going to help you guys going forward and
into next season?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Hopefully our season isn't over and we can continue to play and
go from this point and learn from the last game, including the St. Bonaventure
game we played and move forward and stay positive.  
  
Q. Derek, talk about the way Maxie played in the first half to keep you guys
afloat?  
COACH KELLOGG: It was nice to see a freshman come in and carry our team the
first half there with T.V. with two fouls, and Putney with two fouls. I wasn't
certain how much he would be able to play, but he had 14 and 7 in the first
half. If he would have played a little better defense on a couple of those
ball handlers, he would have had almost a perfect first half. But it was nice
to see him around the rim, he's probably the best guy we have on our team in
the front of the press, and it was good to get him confidence and have him
feeling good about playing a lot of minutes in the first half.  
It was a nice boost. To see one of your young guys to step up on the stage is
a nice thing for that day and also for the future for Maxie.  
  
Q. Terrell, when you came in the second half after foul trouble in the first
half, was it in your mind to make things happen? Looked like you were trying
to be a catalyst.  
TERRELL VINSON: Most definitely, I wanted to win. I didn't want to go home. I
felt like we should have beat them in the first half, we were letting them
bully us, and they were getting a lot of offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Chaz, in the second half I think you got within 2 and they went on a 22
‑6 run. What did they do to change the momentum at that point?   
CHAZ WILLIAMS: They were just playing basketball and we wasn't playing
defense. We had to step up and take charge of the game and that's what
happened put it was too late.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Xavier  71  
St. Louis ‑ 64

  
THE MODERATOR: As always turn this will be Xavier's first trip to the
championship since 2006, and Coach, opening statement, please.  
COACH MACK: I thought the game was going to be a tough one. We had lost our
two previous games to St. Louis in both instances, I thought our play was
pretty good for one half and pretty poor for the second half.  
Tonight I thought we really defended well. They came out and I think they had
8 points in the first TV time‑out and you look at it and they get 23 for the
first half, they scored 16 points in a matter of‑‑ 13 points in a matter of 16
minutes.  
We talked about it in the locker room, we have had that feeling before where
you know you're in the NCAA Tournament and how much does this game mean to
you? My former mentor, Skip Prosser used to say a "hungry cat hunts best",
they're a gutsy team, they continued to battle but I'm proud of our kids.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you think the difference is in this game and the
first two and what it means to get to a championship?  
TU HOLLOWAY: The first time we played St. Louis we were still trying to put
things together and when we went to their house the second time and we were up
by halftime and we folded a little bit in the second half. I didn't play well
myself, but now we're in the A‑ 10 Tournament, new life, a lot of confidence
and to be here in the championship I'm excited. Coach talked about it the last
three years and for three years we fought for it but now we're here and we're
ready for it.  
  
Q. Kenny, talk about the evolution of this team, the last couple of games
when you guys look like you're playing with a new lease on life?  
KENNY FREASE: That's what I've been saying, all year, trying to play well
together, our backs were against the wall over the last couple of games and we
knew that we had to win or we were going home and I think that's when this
team is going to thrive and I think today we were able to show that we were
able to stay with it through the up's and down's, whatever it was, we were
able to stay with it.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you talk about the job you and Walker did down low, the first
time you got Conklin in foul trouble and how tough is it to play against a
player who is so physical?  
KENNY FREASE: It's not just how quick he is, he's a quick player and skilled
around the basket and getting him in foul trouble early helped us out a lot.
He's a great player and in the second half we were able to sustain a little
bit, he was able to get his basket off, but down the stretch we were able to
keep him off the glass and I think that was a key.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how hungry team can be dangerous, can you speak to
playing St. Bonaventure tomorrow who is not right now a "bubble" team and who
needs a win to get into the NCAA Tournament.   
COACH MACK: We don't know what we are, and we didn't come all this way to just
"show up" in a championship. I have no doubt we will be ready. It's a little
different against St. Bonaventure, with the teams we played in this tournament
so far we have had great familiarity with it. I can't remember when we played
St. Bonaventure, it was one of our early games so with an unbalanced schedule,
there is not as much familiarity with teams you play especially early on, but
make no mistake our guys are here to win it and that's what we're going to try
to do tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Dez, you said you think this team has what it takes, are you seeing that
now and do you think the team it playing its best ball in the last few
games?  
DEZMINE WELLS: I stand by what I said, the leadership we have on this team I
feel is a spark. I look forward to playing‑‑ (Away from mic.) I look forward
to being coached by Coach Mack, and I stand by what I said, our leadership and
strong and I believe in everything they have for me and they believe in me,
too, so that's a dangerous team.  
  
Q. Coach, how big of a part do your seniors play, Kenny and Tu for this
season?  
COACH MACK: Extremely proud of these guys, it's not easy when you hear what
Coach Mack has said going on four years, you win, you lose, but they have
become good leaders, do you players, down the stretch here, our backs were
against the wall and for Kenny to go up to the free‑throw lineup 3 points at
the very end and misses that front‑end of the one and one, a lot of pressure,
it's still a one‑possession game and Kenny knocks 'em down.  
That's the mark of a senior. He's not the only one, we have other guys making
big plays, include in freshman right here, proud of our seniors and the entire
group, seniors all the way down to our freshmen and all the way down to our
coaching staff for how much time we have continued to put in and how much we
have continued to believe when others haven't.  
  
Q. Tu, you went up against Mitchell tonight. What does that say about the
guard play in the A ‑10?   
TU HOLLOWAY: We're underrated, every time we go up against another Atlantic 10
team it's a challenge.  
  
Q. Tu, do you feel like you're in now or do you have to win tomorrow?  
TU HOLLOWAY: Every game is necessary for us to win. We came out here to get an
A‑10 Conference Title, so hopefully we can take care of St. Bonaventure
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you speak about the challenges that Nicholson and others will
offer you tomorrow compared to what you saw today with St. Louis?  
KENNY FREASE: He has‑‑ (Away from mic.) It will be a whole different
challenge. He's definitely one of the best players so it will be a challenge
but I think we're ready.  
  
Q. Coach, with the program you coach a lot of success in the tournament the
last ten years but how important is it to win the Conference Tournament? What
would that mean to the program?  
COACH MACK: It would mean a lot, our first Tournament Championship since 2006,
I was on the staff and none of these guys on the podium here were a part of
that. It was probably one of most special feelings I had as a coach. Four
times in four days, there is nothing like a Tournament Championship, being
able to play right before Selection Sunday, it's going to be exciting. Our
program is used to playing in Marchand I believe it's going to be exciting
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Xavier  71  
St. Louis ‑ 64

  
THE MODERATOR: From St. Louis, Dwayne Evans, Cody Ellis, Coach. Opening
statement, Coach?  
COACH MAJERUS: Well, congratulations to Xavier. They're an excellent team,
they played very well today. They played with the greatest purpose. They had
energy and effort and they took it to us.  
I don't know who is going to win this thing, but both these teams are really
good. And we faced a good one today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Cody, in the previous games with Xavier so much of your offense was
dictated by the defense, how much was that a problem today not being able to
get the stops to get the offense going?  
CODY ELLIS: Defense has dictated our play all year, that's what made us so
good this year, but we didn't come out in the third ready to play at all. We
weren't aggressive like we usually are and we didn't get the stops that we
usually do. That affected our game.  
  
Q. How much are you looking forward to playing in the NCAA Tournament next
week and how much of a leader has Brian Conklin been this year?  
DWAYNE EVANS: Brian has been huge, he's led us to where we are now, looking
forward to the Tournament, got to bounce back from today, get more block‑outs,
and focus on defensive and get ready for next week.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
CODY ELLIS: Obviously we haven't thought about it at all, we're getting ready
for the games that we have been playing. Like Dwayne said we got to get back
to St. Louis, work on our mistakes and get better as a team and do what we
have done every day this year and see what happens.  
  
Q. You guys made the second half run and got within a point and I believe at
that point Xavier scored on the next five possessions. Defensively, you talk
about not having effort in the first half, but in the second half Wells went
wild, what was going on?  
DWAYNE EVANS: I missed a few down the stretch and we let Xavier do some
things, and we weren't able to get the stops against their offense that we
needed. A lot of things I need to work on personally. We need to focus on next
week.  
  
Q. As much as this loss has to hurt, you have to know that there is
something beyond this and tomorrow you get ‑‑ you should be in the NCAA
Tournament unless a great injustice is done, that must be a slightly good
feeling going out of this?   
CODY ELLIS: Obviously no good feeling coming out of a loss. This hurts right
now. But tomorrow we've got to pick it up, look forward to getting better
before we play and hopefully coming out like the team we know we are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Questions for Coach Rick Majerus?  
  
Q. Rick, there was a point in the first half you were up 20 to something and
it seemingly went south. What happened in that span?  
COACH MAJERUS: The fool's gold of bad shots, you got your 6‑foot athletic
guard who is a junior shooting a jump shot against a 6‑11‑‑ 32, I forget his
name, I just know these guys' numbers.  
That's ridiculous and I told Dwayne that and he worries and has anxiety over
the jump shot in the left corner, and the left corner in front of our bench
the first half, left corner in front of their bench the second half, that he
thought they were going to score or something, and it was jump shots, 16 of
their first 20 points came inside the 10 and partly because we were dependent
upon each other in the schemes of the defense and the support in many
instances, like when they got that first back door pass he was standing
straight up and they just zipped by. They come out of a time‑out, run a
backdoor for 52 or 10, I couldn't see their number, when they scored, and that
was Rob's fault. We were overplaying that because we feel we get support from
the base, and it just was one of those days where‑‑ you get down to the
nut‑cutting time and they zip a ball past Kwamain‑‑ and they have done that
all year, they are opportunity oriented guys, without any loss of vision, so
right over Kwamain's head and on the biggest possession of the game, Conklin
doesn't block out. This all reverts back to me.  
All my former players come to practice and they all watch and they all say
you're too easy, you're too old and you're too soft. I used to be a tough
coach and I've got to look at myself and see, is it resonating through me?
Because that isn't how we got 20‑‑ whatever the hell wins we have.  
I'm disappointed in myself, I'm disappointed in the team and I applaud Xavier
for being opportunistic, smart, energetic and they are a very good team. I
believe they were picked 1, I don't know.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Conklin's leadership this year and his career
‑‑  
COACH MAJERUS: It's typical for me to go all retrospective on the year when
the year is not over and I understand your situation. Right now I'm a little
bit‑‑ let's put it this way, I'm pissed at Conklin for that foul, that was an
intentional foul and then for the backdoor and for the block. He played
uncharacteristically without that today. And, you know, again, you know, I try
to drive this deal here, and probably I've let it slip a little bit.  
I think we won something like‑‑ I don't know how many we won out of our last
whatever. Then I think a sense of complacency sets in and at home when we beat
'em we had the big Billiken Blue behind us, we had the band and the fans and
we were down and that brought us. Today we were out there, an island by
ourselves and we didn't necessarily "man up" collectively, one guy played his
guts out today, and Cassity in the minimal minutes he played he gives great
effort.  
  
Q. Does that mean you're going to be tough on the guys in the next few days
getting ready for the tournament?  
COACH MAJERUS: Well, I don't know what prompted this but I mean, I don't have
any friends that are telling me, "let's go have a cannoli right now. Every
friend I got is saying "let's go eat a banana" and I had the "banana talk"
with them after the game today.  
Hey, I don't want to take anything away from Xavier, they're a really good
team. Holloway is an outstanding player, they hit some tough shots, Jordair
and Mike couldn't have defended better, you've got to give those guys credit,
head a hand up.  
  
Q. The shot Lyons had there at the end was a 2 ‑point game.   
COACH MAJERUS: You're right.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, I asked the guys if you hate to lose like this ‑‑  
COACH MAJERUS: Honest to God, I'm proud of what they said, I didn't say
anything to them, but I'm not looking ahead to anything right now, I'm looking
forward to seeing the films, identifying the mistakes and correcting the
issues at hand.  
Then I'm not looking ahead to anything at all about anything other than
remedying what it was that occurred today. I'm not trying to be disrespectful,
so if you're asking me what I'm looking forward to, I'm looking forward to
getting home as fast as I can and gettin' in that film room.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Bonaventure  84  
UMASS ‑ 80

  
THE MODERATOR: This is St. Bonaventure. We have Jordan Gathers, Demitrius
Conger and Andrew Nicholson, along with Coach Schmidt. Coach, opening
statement?  
COACH SCHMIDT: You know, it was a great game, a nail‑biter at the end. We
didn't do a great job of finishing that game, but give them credit. I thought
in the first half we played well, especially in the first half When Andrew was
on the bench with two fouls, Demitrius was tremendous. He was two assists away
from a triple, double. I tell the guys all the time, you're a big‑time player
when you play "big" in big games.  
For a freshman in that environment not to play a ton his freshman year, and to
be able to play the way he played today showed grit, and Andrew was Andrew. He
got in foul trouble, but he was there when we needed him. We found a way,
missed foul shots, made it close but give UMASS credit, they're talented. You
don't win 22 games without having talented players. We found a way to win and
move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's open it up for questions. First for Andrew Nicholson,
Jordan Gathers and Demitrius Conger.  
  
Q. Over the final few minutes, tell us what's going through your head as
they're gettin' closer and knowing that you need to make a play to close it
out.  
DEMITRIUS CONGER: We tried to stay poised, basketball is a game of runs, and
we just tried to maintain and stay focused through the whole thing.  
  
Q. Is it hard to battle the nerves or whatever you have going on in your
head while the game is unfolding like that?  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: Yeah, because it's tough.  
JORDAN GATHERS: It's tough, but we still have to stay mentally focused and
take care of the ball down the stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing in the A ‑10 Tournament Tile for the first
time in the program in 11 years?   
DEMITRIUS CONGER: It's something special. It would be nice to look back on
when we are old and to have those memories. It's real big.  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: It's been a big goal for us all through the season.  
  
Q. Andrew, with four fouls, you don't seem to change your style of defense.
You challenge, what's going through your mind there? Are you oblivious to the
foul ‑‑ obviously not but seems like you are.   
ANDREW NICHOLSON: I'm just trying to block the shot!  
  
Q. Regardless, right? (Chuckles.)  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about this run that you guys are on now and the fact
that you are playing for a spot in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH SCHMIDT: I just feel good for our guys, they've fought, we had some
tough losses, had some negativity written about us, but we fought through.  
We've been fightin' it from the very beginning. My guys have continued to
maintain focus, work hard in practice, we've improved and it's a credit to our
guys, and I'm excited for them to be able to get into this position and
hopefully we can play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you guys got a big boost out of Ndoye, today out of
Gathers, secondary ‑type guys, can you speak about their maturation process
throughout the year?   
COACH SCHMIDT: Our bench is really good, Chris Johnson played well, today,
too, with 14 points. They have played well. It's hard as freshmen to come in,
and Chris is a junior college kid but that first year is difficult. As the
season comes along, I've gained more confidence in 'em and they have really
helped us. You know, Demitrius and Andrew get a lot of publicity, but we're
here not just because of them but because of our bench and our young guys.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about Demitrius and his overall play today? He
carried the offense for you guys.  
JORDAN GATHERS: He gives us a lift in every game, rebounding, great energy,
he's solid.  
  
Q. Can you talk ‑‑ Jordan, you've been starting the last few games. How
comfortable are you getting in your position on the team?   
JORDAN GATHERS: I'm feeling the same comfort level, I trust in my guys to help
me out when I'm out there, and I do what I have to do to help the team win.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel that after you broke the press you could have been
more aggressive ‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, you're exactly right. We talk about it all the time and
talked about it before the tournament started. There are two ways to approach
it, one is to go out and play to win and the other is to play not to loose.  
I think we had a tendency in the last 5 to 6 minutes to play not to lose, and
that was partly my fault, and we should have let 'em go a little more but it
ended right.  
  
Q. Demitrius, you're one win away from the A ‑10 Title but one win away from
the NCAA Tournament berth. What would that mean for you guys?   
DEMITRIUS CONGER: That would mean everything. That's what we played for to get
to the NCAA Tournament, so that's our goal, we will compete and do what we
have to do.  
  
Q. Demitrius, great game, 22 points but a lot of that came when Andrew was
on the bench in foul trouble. Talk about your mind set, looked like you were
in an extra gear and attack mode for that.  
DEMITRIUS CONGER: It was team chemistry, gettin', like‑‑ I don't know it's
hard to explain, I don't know.  
  
Q. Did you feel like, okay, Andrew is on the bench now I've got to help keep
us in front here?  
DEMITRIUS CONGER: I didn't feel like that, I felt like going with the flow of
the game, you know, teammates was open, you know, they had open shots I passed
the ball to them, I was open they passed the ball to me, it was the flow of
the game. Just so happened I scored 22 points.  
  
Q. Demitrius or Andrew, UMASS brings a pace on the floor, their transition
game, can you talk about dealing with that and trying to counter that
throughout the game?  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: Just to maintain poise.  
DEMITRIUS CONGER: Same thing he said. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Coach, what would it mean to you and the program to be able to get into
the NCAA Tournament? It's been a long road back, some rough years.  
COACH SCHMIDT: It would be a great accomplishment for our team. You know, I
said it yesterday, we said that we were going to rebuild this program and we
were going to rebuild it the right way, bringing in good guys, kids that are
going to class, graduate, keep their noses clean socially, and we've done it.  
We've brought it back, and as I said yesterday, my staff, our players have
done a tremendous job and, you know, to go from where we are to where we are
today, it's a great accomplishment for our program.  
I'm proud of it, I'm proud of our guys, we still have one more to go and if we
can get that one tomorrow, it would be one of the greatest accomplishments, I
think, in St. Bonaventure history.  
  
Q. Coach, when this year started there were lofty expectations with so many
coming back, 19 wins is the most the program has had in over 10 years, the
first conference finals in that time. In your mind what is success for you
this year?  
COACH SCHMIDT: Success is improving. You know, you don't put a number on it
because every year the schedule is different, you know, it's tougher, easier,
you want improvement. Our goal was to try to get into the top 4 to compete
with the elite teams in this conference and I thought if we could do that then
it would be a successful season.  
Getting to the final game doesn't say that we're successful or not. If we
don't win tomorrow doesn't mean we aren't successful. I think in the whole
picture, what we've done has been a tremendous accomplishment and something
I'm really proud of. It's something that has been a positive for our
University.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys shot 51% from the floor, five guys with 9 or more points,
16 assists, 10 turnovers. Can you talk about how well the guys played
offensively as a team?  
COACH SCHMIDT: We talk about it all the time, the three phases, defending,
they shot 41%, we did a good job; rebounding, we didn't do a good job today,
and in the first half 10 assists and no turnovers. In the second half didn't
do as well but when you do two out of three of those things well, you're going
to have success, and if you do all three you're going to win by a bigger
margin.  
I thought we shared the ball well, shooting 51% against that length is a
testament to our guys, how we shared the ball and attacked, and that was a big
key, especially the first half. And we talked about when Andrew was on the
bench for Demitrius to step up the way he did, that was a big key.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Bonaventure  76  
St. Josephs  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach?  
COACH SCHMIDT: A great game, probably not as good as the one we played up at
the rally center in game one with St. Jones going into double over time. I
thought we found a way to win got Andrew played terrific, I thought Youssou
gave us a huge lift in the first half we defended much better than we did in
game one but it was a great game, they have a talented team and we found a way
to win. They were terrific coming off ball screens and I thought we did as
good of a job as we could on Galloway. When we do those three things we have
success and we didn't do a great job taking care of the basketball but we did
the other two things and that's why we won.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last possession, the play Andrew made, the
block?  
COACH SCHMIDT: It was a great play, we talk about finishing plays, and we did
that today, we showed some mental and physical toughness, the guards are
tremendous for them, Jones and Galloway, we did a great job of containing
them, we played.  
I told the team before the game you gotta play to win and not to play not to
loose and I thought our guys came out and played well today.  
  
Q. You mentioned the mental toughness, the game, 30 lead changes, to be in
that type of a game and to continue to play, talk about the way they were able
to keep their poise, keep their heads in it despite going back and forth like
that.  
COACH SCHMIDT: We got good players. We have hard‑nosed players, players that
play with confidence and they trust each other and I think that's how you win
games at this level.  
We've been in a lot of tight games, especially early on when we lost and I
think our guys learned from that, gained some experience and you learn how to
win by win and go our guys did a tremendous job today.  
  
Q. Andrew, can you talk about the last two defensive series you took the
charge on Galloway and blocked Jones, could you talk us through those?  
ANDREW NICHOLSON: I shot an air ball on offense so I had to get back on "D"
and make a big play.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Charlon's play today and how comfortable is he
getting?  
COACH SCHMIDT: A big transition from where he came from to America to play at
this level. The point guard position is the quarterback, I'm hard on the
quarterback, he needs to know his position and everybody else's position, we
run a lot of stuff so as the season has gone along he's improved.  
He works extremely hard not just in, practice, outside of practice time. He's
a tremendous kid, a tremendous hard worker and I'm glad he's having the
success that he's having.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did it mean when you pulled out the game last week, how
much did that pay dividends coming into today? When that game looked like it
was a lost cause?  
COACH SCHMIDT: We had a tough call at the end of that regulation and our guys
fought through it.  
Probably you learn how to win by winning and go gettin' in those tight
situations. As another guy talked about, 30 lead changes if you're in that
situation you become more comfortable so I would assume the guys probably know
better but I think that helps us. It helps us in terms of knowing we could
beat 'em, and income that situation, being able to handle the pressure that
comes along with it.  
  
Q. Coach, now in the Atlantic 10 semifinals, can you talk about the step now
that you're advancing?  
COACH SCHMIDT: This is tremendous, we started the season and one of our goals
was to try to get to the top four. We built that thing and my assistants have
done a great job and the players have done even better. From three scholarship
guys five years ago to where the program was dead and, you know, we worked
hard to play and we did a tremendous job, we went 13 to 10 to 8 to 7 and
making that jump is hard, especially with the teams we're playing against with
bigger budgets and all that stuff, and to do that stuff is a tremendous
accomplishment for our program, for our players and it means a great deal. If
somebody would have said we were going to be in the semifinals of the Atlantic
10 tournament, people would have laughed at us but because of the work our
players have put in and what my staff has done, we're here and hopefully we
can play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Andrew, you have a career 2,000 ‑point scorer, how much goes into today
when the game is the on the line and you're thinking that there is no tomorrow
for you guys? Does that come into play when you're thinking that this could be
your last game?   
ANDREW NICHOLSON: It's tournament play so you've got on play every possession
like it's your last.  
  
Q. For both Coach and Andrew, what do you remember about your last game with
UMASS and what do you take from that?  
COACH SCHMIDT: They got us in the second half pretty good. If I remember right
I think we were up by 3 or 4 in the first half and the second half they came
out and really played well, took us out of things, we didn't play well, we
turned the ball over, their pressure hurt us a little bit.  
She shot the ball really well, too. So we've got to play much better tomorrow
if we have a chance against a long, talented, athletic team as you mass is.  
  
Q. Charlon, can you talk about your play, getting to the basket, career high
in points, can you talk about that?  
CHARLON KLOOF: (Away from mic.)  
  
Q. Coach, what happened with the technical foul for the Jersey number and
were you sweatin' that at all? The 1 point that they got off the technical
foul?  
COACH SCHMIDT: I looked in the paper today and we were a 2‑point underdog so
that 1 point was going to be a big thing. The guys names weren't in the book,
Quan's, and a couple of walk‑ons, I can tell you that won't happen tomorrow.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH SCHMIDT: You have to coach every possession, I'm not smart enough to
sweat that out, we would have sweat it if we would have lost by 1.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Charlons' recruitment and the expectations you
had coming with him coming into the season?  
COACH SCHMIDT: I went to the Canary Islands and I thought that was in South
America but I found out it was off the coast of Spain and we heard about him,
so I went out to the Canary Islands, good place if you haven't been, and
recruited him, watched him play, saw him on tape and he trusted us. We had a
good relationship, he trusted us and came without seeing the university,
without seeing my assistant coaches, seeing anything. He trusted us and his
coach did a tremendous job helping us but he's been tremendous for us and when
you talk about Andrew and‑‑ we wouldn't be here without Andrew but we wouldn't
be here without Charlon, either. He has been tremendous. Hopefully I can make
more trips to the Canary Islands.  
  
Q. Coach, the last time I looked you guys had a huge advantage
reboundingwise. Talk about the controlling the boards and the post, scoring so
many points in the paint.  
COACH SCHMIDT: It's toughness, you win in games like this with rebounding, you
defend and you rebound, they shot 43% and we out rebound them by nine and
that's how you win. In game one we outrebounded them by 19, they shot a higher
percentage but we got more shots. Rebound it's just a mental thing, it's
physical, and when you out redound guys it means you're ready to play, we were
first or second in league play and we did that today and that's one of the
reasons why we won.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.

### [Tu Holloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22047)

### [Mark Lyons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22049)

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Xavier  70  
Dayton  69

  
THE MODERATOR: Statement from Coach Mack, first.  
COACH MACK: First of all, just a whale of a game and I thought both teams
played extremely hard. For us to go in the locker room down 10 I told our kids
I thought it was a function of couldn't make a free‑throw. We go 6 for 16 in
the first half shooting free‑throws and you're not going to be in many games
if you can't make 'em. We like to get the guys in the lane and put pressure on
Dayton and we tried to do that more in the second half.  
Either team could have won ask both teams are hard playing and I thought it
came down to us being able to get a few stops in the last four minutes of the
game. Down 5, didn't look good and we said in the final TV timeout huddle,
this is it. This is what we worked for all year and we were able to go out on
the defensive end and get stops and these guys made huge plays, Mark making
the ball to the basket and blocking the final shot to win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. In the last couple of minutes did you realize how much this game meant,
did you realize the season could be over if you lost this game?  
TU HOLLOWAY: It's hard when you're at home and you're watching that happen and
I'm a senior and we needed to go out and get this one and set ourselves up for
the NCAA. So I want to go out and win every game.  
MARK LYONS: Like he said, seeing your team on the bubble and stuff like that
is tough so you want to play every game like it's your last.  
  
Q. Mark, will you describe the elation out there, making the big plays out
there?  
MARK LYONS: My teammates put me in a great position to score, and I felt like
I was letting them down the first half, foul trouble, taking bad shots. I was
just trying to get myself in the lane and make myself better.  
  
Q. Could you guys address playing St. Louis for a third time this year? It's
been two emotional games so far.  
COACH MACK: Well, obviously in the conference tournament there is quick turn
around but we know those guys, they know us, two very hotly contested games
and, you know, we felt like we did a good job against them in one half, in
both instances, in both games.  
They have had a great year and we'll be ready to play. It's that time of year.
Our team is used to playing in big games and tomorrow is going to be no
different, it's going to be a big game. When you get this far and start
playing teams for a third time there is so much familiarity, the scouting
report is going to be brief for these guys, especially with a quick turn
around mid‑afternoon game but we'll be ready and St. Louis I'm sure will be
ready.  
TU HOLLOWAY: St. Louis is a really good team, they're going to go out and play
defence and compete, and it will be tough for us, but we have to go out and
play as hard as we can.  
MARK LYONS: Same thing, you know, they're a tough team, they're mentally tough
on defense and offense, got a bunch of great shooters and you've got to be
ready defensively and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Tu, you came out in the second half and seemed to have a different
attitude and swagger about your game energywise. Was there anything in the
locker room that was said that got you fired up and goin'?  
TU HOLLOWAY: Sometimes the difference is when you ‑‑ (Away from mic.) I tried
to be aggressive from the first play of the game. Once again, I'm a senior and
this is my last crack at it and I wanted to be able to get into the NCAA
Tournament, so you've got to have intensity in your game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last time ‑out and the inbounds play, and talk
through what happened in that last possession.   
TU HOLLOWAY: First we got out there and wanted to see their alignment so then
called a time‑out and coach said don't foul, communicate on defense, so we
don't have any guy open in the back or anything like that. My knees were
shaking over there I was hoping we were going to get a stop and Mark contested
great on Johnson and forced them to miss the shot.  
  
Q. Can you speak a little bit about the effort that you got from Kenny
Frease tonight? He seemed to give you life tonight.  
COACH MACK: 9 for 14 after what he shot in the first half, he's played well
the last three or four weeks, he really has. When you look at his statistics
over the last few games, he is right at a double‑double.  
These guys are getting confidence in 'em and we're putting them in better
positions around the basket and I think he is manning the ball.  
Tonight was huge because he didn't get in foul trouble and we stressed that to
a couple of guys not get in foul trouble. One of 'em listened, one of 'em
didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Ramon Galloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23425)

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Louis  78  
La Salle  71

  
COACH GIANNINI: We lost to a very good team, their record makes that obvious,
but I'm telling you, it would be hard to play the game of basketball better
than what St. Louis does. There is always someone more talented, I'm sure
there are teams with more talent than us and than St. Louis but in terms of
how they played the game they are extremely impressive.  
I thought on our end we got off to a bad start, after that I thought we
outplayed them for good portions. Again, I think they were more solid, we made
more mistakes and getting in the hole early hurt us but our kids played hard
and one of the unique things about this year's team is that was a game with a
minute, minute and a half, 2 minutes left. No one was leaving and that's how
every single one of our loss were this year.  
We never had a bad game where we were out of it the whole way. A lot of times
the other team, you get off to a bad start like we did today and you just
never get it back. This team was in every play every single minute and I think
it's a testament to how hard these kids play and we're going to miss Earl a
lot but other than that we have everyone back and I think it's more of‑‑ it's
certainly not an ending for the majority of the guys in that locker room and
we can learn from a team like St. Louis who doesn't make many mistakes,
doesn't do much to hurt themselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You were able to get it down to 1 the second half, why couldn't you get
over that hump?  
COACH GIANNINI: They wouldn't let us. We would have loved it if they would
have let us, we really tried, they wouldn't let us. They weren't cooperative.
(Chuckles.) We tried!  
  
Q. Coach, Rick Majerus was talking about how you guys deserve an NIT bid,
how much would that mean?  
COACH GIANNINI: Big deal, big deal, we're 0‑4 to St. Louis and Temple, two
good teams but we're 4‑0 against UMASS, St. Bonaventure and Xavier. We would
love to be in the NIT. I think when those‑‑ that bracket is announced, you see
some of the best programs in the country in that. Obviously everyone would
prefer to be in the NCAA Tournament, but you're judged by the company you keep
and you're going to see household names in that tournament and we would love
to be among those household names and one of the better programs in the
country.  
  
Q. John, with the four ‑guard offense, the advantages and disadvantages are
obvious and these advantages played out today but what about the
disadvantages?   
COACH GIANNINI: It's usually rebounding but that wasn't at an extreme level
today.  
I really can't say that, you know, I think Conklin had a good second half but
Conklin had a big guy on him, that match‑up is a wash. I think typically it
hurts you in terms of rebounding but tonight I don't think it hurt us a whole
lot, we made mistakes, we had a guy or two not have normal good games, got in
the hole early but most importantly that is as sound of a team as you can
play. They're maniacal with their scouting preparation and we had one set that
we executed perfectly that they had never seen and through their habits and
fundamentals they covered it like a textbook something perfectly executed with
good players that they had never seen before. People think highly of Coach
Majerus as a coach for good reason, we lost to a good team. We could have
played better, we can beat them but we would have to step it up.  
  
Q. Ramon, can you talk about the game and in terms of what it means for the
season to end like this and the hopes for postseason play?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It's a tough loss, we worked hard to get 21 wins for the
program, stepped up from last year and to lose first round is disappointing,
but we worked hard all year and like we said, we lost Earl but that's only one
player and got everybody else back so we need to get back to work tomorrow,
day after that.  
  
Q. Ramon, as a Philly guy you had to know about the Philly losses, was there
motivation to carry the torch?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It was a lot of motivation. Everybody told each other, we're
the only Philly team left in the tournament so we tried to keep that as
motivation so we can have our Philly pride and just La Salle pride.  
  
Q. This is your first year at La Salle, can you speak to it?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: As a whole it's been great. To have Coach G. coach me and the
players I'm playing with and am going to continue to play with is great. To
have teammates, Tyreek, Taylor, everybody on that bench is a great team and
they have great chemistry, and we're family.  
  
Q. As was mentioned you guys cut the lead to 1 on two separate occasions,
you went 7 minutes scoreless to open the game after scoring the first basket,
can you and Ramon talk about what Coach said to you?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: At the beginning Coach G. told us to keep our heads and keep
it together. In the game of basketball each team is going to have their runs
so the score at the end of the game counts so don't caught up in the early
runs, stay positive and stay together and in order for us to come back we had
to get defensive stops and we brought the game down to 1, we couldn't get the
defensive stop that we needed. They're a great team, they rebounded great and
their defensive presence was awesome.  
  
Q. Coach, with the promising core coming back, how excited are you for next
year?  
COACH GIANNINI: We're really excited and I think one of the big positives is I
thought Steve Zack played great today and Jerrell Wright had a good year, and
we played our four‑guards a lot this year because they're were our most
veteran players, our most our most experienced players, consistent players,
and therefore our best players, but I think our big guys are going to keep
coming on and they're just going to keep getting better.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Langston Galloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21965)

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Bonaventure  76  
St. Josephs  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach?  
COACH MARTELLI: There was a loose ball recovery, there was a flurry in the
first half where we had a lead and then there were some loose balls, a ball
bounced twice on the top of the backboard, they recovered it, we didn't. We
were playing in the second half and we did a great job defensively, broke the
ball loose and we didn't recover it. So to me, loose ball recovery, really, a
one‑possession game.  
That will be what eats away at us as we go home tonight and regroup again
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Phil, talk about Nicholson today. It looked like you had three different
defenders that you used on him and he had an outstanding game.  
COACH MARTELLI: Our game plan was we were going to for everything that we had,
we threw at him, and there was one wrinkle that we had in but they didn't
present that set to us. A lot of credit to Mark Schmidt because we have a lot
of ways of getting him in the action. They have a lot of different
cross‑screen actions, you know, they pop him out, so wonderful player, he's a
great representative for the league and he's a good player but the coach
deserves credit because of how they feature him.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about this loss and obviously you coming to this
tournament knowing you need to do damage to make an impression upon the NCAA
Tournament Committee.  
COACH MARTELLI: It had nothing to do with our preparation. We wanted to play
tomorrow, that's all. We just wanted to play tomorrow and see how, you know,
things would play out. But these players have never heard NCAA, they have
never heard "bubble" they've just heard about what we talked about since
August, win.  
Our intention was to win today and then let everything else take care of
itself. This hurts. It hurts. You know, we get a break here we'll continue to
play basketball and that would be great for these guys because we have a lot
to work on and we have a lot to work with.  
But I don't have any‑‑ like the implication for the NCAA Tournament, that had
nothing to do with this game for us.  
  
Q. Phil, could you talk about the rebound differential and what impact it
had in this game?  
COACH MARTELLI: If the first half they were much more aggressive, the big,
young fellow, Ndoye had a big first half, I think it was 21‑10 at the half. In
the first half it seemed to me we had not learned our lesson from the first
game but if we're going to walk out of here‑‑ I don't think it was rebounding,
I think it was loose ball recovery, like there were balls that were broken
loose and we didn't end up with the ball when we needed it.  
  
Q. Phil, how much do you think it hurt and you helped them just that last
week you had them on the ropes a couple of different times, they ended up
coming back, today the game was that close at the end where they had that to
go back on and they were able to pull that game out. How much that might mean
for confidence?  
COACH MARTELLI: I don't know, I don't know about where they are. It wasn't
like we had second thoughts, calling it the way it is. Last week they made
field goals to catch us and today a guy decided to blow his whistle on every
possession and that's how they scored their points at the end of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Langston?  
  
Q. The last two plays, Longston was called for a charge and you didn't seem
to be happy with either of those ‑‑  
COACH MARTELLI: No, no, no, you just establish the way you're going to call
the game. The same guy passed on a charge, C.J. took a charge on Nicholson, in
my opinion you then loose the right to call that later in the game, that's
all. The play at the end, I think, was probably a forced play, Tay had a good
feeling in the second half but I wasn't upset about that call at the end, no.  
  
Q. Langston, you heard the coach talk about this one hurts, you're in the
game the entire time and you come up short against the same team in less than
two weeks' time.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: It's definitely tough, we couldn't capitalize on the little
things, last week it was rebounding, this week it was a loose ball recovery.
It came down to the little things and we didn't capitalize on it, that's why
we lost.  
  
Q. Could you get us through what you were trying to do that last play?  
COACH MARTELLI: We were looking for the same play that we had run the sometime
before. And then Langston when we threw it down would have the ball in the
center of the floor. The first time we had it and maybe there was
overpenetration, I would have to look and see what happened there and the
second time I think Tay saw daylight when he turned the corner.  
I think retrospectively had we gone quicker‑‑ we didn't go as quick as I
wanted us to go, and everything in this offense was the next pass, we had to
make the next pass in this game. For the most part we did do that and those
last two possessions it didn't go our way.  
  
Q. Langston, could you talk about the play at the end where you were called
for the charge? Take us through that play and what transpired there.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: When I came off the screen I thought I had the lane once I
got past my man and I should have pulled up but I went too far and they called
a charge.  
I didn't think it was a charge because he was a little late, but they called a
charge on me.  
  
Q. Phil, how difficult was it to play defense against Nicholson the way the
game was called. It looked like a tough task.  
COACH MARTELLI: No, I don't think it had anything to do with it. His skill is
more than anything else. I don't think there was any kind of nickel and diming
in terms of referring. No, I don't think that made it difficult to guard him,
so I don't look at it that way.

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Juan Fernandez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20796)

### [Ramone Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21942)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

UMASS: 77  
Temple: 71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach?  
COACH DUNPHY: I would like to congratulate UMASS, I thought they played well,
I would like to congratulate Atlantic City and the Atlantic 10 for what would
have been a good weekend for us in terms of sticking around for a few days but
we didn't do a good enough job today.  
I thought our play was solid. A lot of stretches, except obviously for the
first, I believe, six minutes of the second half, if I look closely at the box
score and the line, I think they scored 20 points in six minutes and obviously
we didn't answer very well. All that being said we got ourselves back to up
four, two times we were up four and we had poor decisions with the ball and it
led to baskets down the other end and can't do that. Got out of character
again and that's what happens‑‑ when it happens we get out of character we're
going to pay the price can and we did today.  
Again, I congratulate UMASS, they deserved to win the game and they worked a
little harder than we did.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach and the players.  
  
Q. Ramone, can you tell me going into this tournament as a top seed and
taking a loss and heading to the next step of the postseason, how difficult is
that going to be to wait out this weekend and lose any momentum that you build
in?  
RAMONE MOORE: I think it's very difficult, my five years being here we've
always done a great job down here, I think this is our first time going home
the first day. It hurts a lot, you know, and this is our last go‑round, I
wanted it as bad as anybody.  
It hurts that we couldn't come up for a team but like Coach says we got to
give UMASS credit, those guys did a great job.  
  
Q. How do you guys get yourselves centered here and make sure this doesn't
carry over into the NCAA Tournament?  
RAMONE MOORE: It's going to be a tough couple of days, I don't know if we will
make it to the NCAA, but if we do that will be great. I'm not sure how many
days we will have to prepare if we get there but we have to have great
preparation and, you know, put this behind us and try to move forward.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Chaz Williams and what he does for them and
being so much bigger than his height and how impressed you are with him?  
COACH DUNPHY: I am impressed with him, he plays hard, 10 assists, 1 with
turnover pretty impressive for all that time with the basketball. One of his
best plays today was coming off the screen and they rolled, I think it was
Carter who rolled to the rim and we didn't help from the weak side even a
little bit, but those are the kinds of pressures he puts on you, shoots two
3's, makes both of them, he had a great 3 at the top of the key and we got
caught going behind, he's just really a great competitor.  
That's the piece that impresses me the most. Obviously he's talented, fast,
and hard to guard but a competitive indeterminate is what separates him.  
  
Q. Ramone, you guys were down 10, got up 4 at 68 ‑64, did you feel like you
had taken their best shot and you guys had done enough and did the last
stretch surprise you? Where do you feel like it got away from you?   
RAMONE MOORE: I think it was a lot of mistakes down the stretch, a lot of
turnovers, and those guys converted on the other end. I mean, in these tight
games you've got to be perfect down the stretch and not make too many mistakes
and that was our down fall tonight, we weren't able to convert on the
offensive end and I think those guys came out and did a great job, whether it
was an offensive rebound, making the free‑throws or hitin' big 3's, something
like that.  
  
Q. Juan, what happened in the early going in the second half when you guys
couldn't get a basket and they went on a 15 ‑0 run and how much did the 22
turnovers kill you today?   
JUAN FERNANDEZ: They played better than us in that stretch and I think it was
a big part of the game. A lot of it is on myself and on the senior guards, we
see that coming we should try to manage the game and get a good shot to try to
stop that run and we didn't do it today. Things that you got to look at after
the game and try to work on, so you have the chance to keep playing.  
COACH DUNPHY: I think my halftime speech was stirring! So I'll take the blame
for that. The first part of the second half, Ramone made a good play, and we
didn't catch and finish. Just the momentum of the game right away gets turned.
I think "Mone" made a nice play, I'll take a look, if we get our defense set,
Morgan comes down and makes a 3 off of our turnover.  
We suck the air out of us and give it right to UMASS and then it compounded
itself, we turned it needlessly a couple of times and bottom line is when they
were open they made shots, they didn't miss too many looks and we got to give
them credits and we didn't do a very good job down the stretch.  
I was proud of our guys for not getting too far down, we had the ball twice up
4, we take a bad shot and turned it over and those two plays are what
separates you again, you can do a good job for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions.  
  
Q. Fran, can you talk about why Khalif didn't start and why you felt he had
a little trouble getting into the game?  
COACH DUNPHY: I didn't think he did. Again, address this to the last time the
situation occurred, he's a really good guy and he's not a malicious bone in
his body, on occasion he thinks his time is more important than everybody
else's, so it puts the control in my hands and I have to do some‑‑
disappointing, was hoping we wouldn't get that this point but that's what
happened. I thought him getting hurt in the second half hurt us.  
He doesn't finish the play on the break‑away left and then he's got to come
out of game right away, too, I thought he was back into the flow and the
rhythm, but then it got interrupted a little bit. We had already gone down 6,
and he gets a steal and we got up to 4 and would have interrupted their
momentum and as a result probably what we shouldn't do. None of us is perfect
and hopefully we will be given a reprieve and we can continue to play
basketball this year.  
  
Q. Coach, assuming you get invited to the NCAAs, how easy will it be to get
this group up?  
COACH DUNPHY: I don't think it will be a challenge at all, to be honest with
you, I would have said to you‑‑ I was impressed and surprised in some ways
that we had done such a good job today after getting our doors blown off in
the first 6 minutes and finding a way to get that lead. I think it would be
similar, use that as a example of we get down and don't stay down, use that as
an opportunity to play better basketball.  
  
Q. Did Khalif get hurt on that play?  
COACH DUNPHY: Doesn't appear to be a career‑threatening injury, I was ready to
put him in in the second half, but he was in the locker room. I will have to
talk to the doctor about what the extent of that injury is.  
  
Q. How difficult is Chaz Williams to prepare for given his speed?  
COACH DUNPHY: He's very difficult, we are not the only team that has had
difficulty guarding him, and we won't be the last. I thought for the most part
he did a great job, but he makes good plays, and has good assists, 10 assists,
he had, and he's difficult to stop from scoring and he has 10 assists and he's
gone a great job that way and he stole the ball four times, creating 4 of 22
turnovers, as a direct result of Chaz Williams and there are probably other
direct results that you don't see on the box score so we will look at it on
the film.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Brian Conklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23423)

### [Rick Majerus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13958)

### [Kwamain Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23424)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

St. Louis  78  
La Salle  71

  
THE MODERATOR: We will start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. Brian, a lot like the first game against La Salle, turnovers that they
caused, similar game?  
BRIAN CONKLIN: Except for more high‑scoring, we didn't play the defensive game
against them the first time that we did today. A lot of easy buckets for them
to transition, we're going to have to take care of that, Dayton or Xavier are
going to be a team that pushes it in transition and we have to get rid of the
turnovers and get back on "D."  
  
Q.Kwamain, can you talk about the guards and the match‑up problems?  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: The problem is that they have four guards on the court so
for our bigs, it's a problem, and Brian, Cody and Cory kept fighting, and they
made some big shots but we counted on Brian to defend him and it's tough
because they play four guards at a time.  
  
Q. Brian, looked like the start of the second half you guys made a concerted
effort to get the ball down low.  
BRIAN CONKLIN: It wasn't a concerted effort as much as it was Kwamain was
playing such a great first half it opened up things inside for me and Corey
and Cody, Kwamain was getting to the ball screens and there were some gaps and
he did a great job of hitting us on the ball screens, and they were concerned
about him and he hit us right in front of the rim and we were able to finish
so it was what they were giving us.  
  
Q. Brian, then Kwamain, you're aware all of the Philly area teams got
knocked out, right?  
BRIAN CONKLIN: Philly has great basketball and, you know, it was surprising to
see Temple and St.Joe's go out, and they are a great team, they're going to be
great in a few years and Temple is going to be back next year, along with La
Salle.  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: Brian hit the spot, like he said, saint Joe's had a great
team, Temple, it's surprise that go they lost, but they'll come back.  
  
Q. Kwamain, can you talk about the first half, it look like you were doing
everything out there.  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: I was just letting the game come to me, I wasn't trying to
be the "man", Brian was posting up, giving me looks, and second half I was
looking for my teammates more.  
  
Q. With Temple out of the tournament, is that good for you guys?  
BRIAN CONKLIN: We're going to watch the half of the next game, we've played
them each twice, we're just going to get ready for the winner of this one.  
  
Q. La Salle scored the first basket, made it 2 ‑0, you guys tied it and then
never trailed for the rest of the game, save for one or two separate
occasions, can you talk about how they would come back and you guys would
stretch the lead?   
BRIAN CONKLIN: Every time the coach would call a time‑out when they made a
run, and we would huddle together and say "they just made their run now it's
our turn" it's something that over the course of the season we've grown and
when teams make a run at us, we just don't get frustrated, we just make
another run back at them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Coach will be up in just a minute.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening statement, please.  
COACH MAJERUS: I thought our guys played hard, I thought they played with
toughness and very smart, credit to La Salle capitalizing on our errors,
omissions at times. La Salle is a good team, I hope they can get another
chance, they deserve it. With a record of some impressive victories that they
have, I think they deserve it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Rick, a lot like the first game, they forced turnovers and you guys
seemed to weather the storms when they came up.  
COACH MAJERUS: Yeah, they're very athletic and scrappy defensively, and
sometimes, you know, playing small ball is a difficult thing. Second half we
switched 4/5, they were not switching with Pettis and I thought Rob did a good
job of switching to go a much superior athlete. We had careless turnovers, we
were 19 of 22 from the foul line, 86%. You know, we had some lapses of not
taking care of the ball but a lot of that is them. You have to credit them as
well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it takes to win these close games, they kept
making run and each time they did you were able to keep them at bay there.  
COACH MAJERUS: Well, I mean, when you play defense and you make defensive
stops‑‑ I mean, there was no way to respond to that, we're the kings of that,
and the only one that approximates that would be the foul by Rob, frustration
fouls, and I jumped him on that. He's go the to learn to grow up.  
Yeah, we know you made a mistake, not being able to score on a 5‑11 point
guard, but, you know, doesn't do you any good to foul them going to the
basket. But our defense was consistent and we tried to defend. Getting in the
passing lane, so forth.  
  
Q. I think Cody drew four charges in the game.  
COACH MAJERUS: Cody is interesting, he's our leading charge taker and he is
our worst guy on the physical block‑out. You would think they would dovetail
each other and there is a dichotomy there that‑‑ how do you have the courage
to step up and consistently take those charges and then bail out of a
block‑out. He's working on it, Cody's dad I think is here, is he here? He is
one of the toughest players in Australian history. And as Cody works toward
that degree, he's much better defensively, he is doing more, playing more of a
physical game.  
But the charges were outstanding, and tonight he missed two block‑outs, my
expectation that you can always block‑out.  
  
Q. Coach you talked about the discrepancy in size between the two teams when
it came to switching defensively but in offense you out scored them on second
‑chance opportunities.   
COACH MAJERUS: We're bigger, we should have done that, we tried to exploit
post‑up situations. You've got to be careful not to win the battle and lose
the war. Sometimes we were trying so hard to exploit the mismatch that we
turned it over, but we got stagnant with our ball handling.  
  
Q. Rick, the first half you had Kwamain with the big game outside and the
second half there was more inside stuff?  
COACH MAJERUS: We were looking for the inside stuff the first half, Kwamain
took a couple of bad shots that he made, makes or misses don't make it a bad
shot. He had one foot inside with the right elbow in front of our bench and
had the follow‑on, that was a good shot. He‑‑ when we went that 1‑4 flat that
time, we hadn't worked on that and I thought he could exploit that mismatch.
Who am I, who is covering me, who is covering my teammate, who is my teammate.
That's basically the way the game goes in a lot of ways and our guys play that
game fairly well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH MAJERUS: I just want to commend my players for one thing. We had exams
this week and we took exams‑‑ I told them not to take exams, I overruled the
academic people because we practiced yesterday and I don't think it's fair to
take an exam on a bus. It's hard to read or see or do anything on a bus but
when we got in Wednesday night the guys took exams until 1:00 in the morning
and all day Thursday, because this is our exam week so I'm proud of the
players because we couldn't get them back into the reality of this‑‑ nor would
we want to, we don't have any pro's on that team, nobody is going to make a
living playing ball, they're all going to remember if they got a good
education.  
I was proud of how they handled that and took care of that, so thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

UMASS: 77  
Temple: 71

  
COACH KELLOGG: We played a great second half, let's not worry about tomorrow,
let's try to get a win here, obviously I have much respect for Temple and
Coach Dunphy and how they've been able to do and that program. And I'm hoping
we can make some noise down here, I think the kids feel good about where we
are in the program and the greatest thing about it was with 4 minutes and
change we didn't have any timeout's left and I told the guys this is exactly
where I want to be. It's up to you guys now. So I feel confident with this
team and enjoyed watching the game today, I thought it was a great basketball
game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about coming out in the second half after being in foul
trouble in the first half and breaking out the way you did?  
JESSE MORGAN: My teammates telling me to keep my head, keep playing and go, it
worked out.  
  
Q. Coach, were you pleased with your teams poise after you took the lead and
Temple came back and took a lead of their own and your guys answered again?  
COACH KELLOGG: I thought our guys responded after Temple made their run, I
thought our guys responded and we didn't take as many bad shots and even
though Moore put 'em on their back for a few minutes, they were deep and
Fernandez hit a deep one and I was hoping the tide would turn and fortunately
it did, we got good offensive shots and it's nice when you make them.  
  
Q. Did you feel like at the end of the first half that you guys missed
opportunities to have it be closer and take a lead going into the second
half?  
COACH KELLOGG: I thought Freddie had a few open looks, those two were 0 for 6
at the half, and we gave them a couple of rebounds, I know Jefferson,
specifically, the tip‑in, so I felt good where we were but when you're playing
a top‑25 team who has done well sometimes you're not certain how things are
going to work out.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your message at the halftime break?  
COACH KELLOGG: I thought it was a toughness thing. I thought if we could
rebound the basketball and not turn the ball over and match their toughness, I
thought we would have a chance in the second half and I'm happy that our guys
would play with a little more toughness.  
  
Q. The last time you guys played against Temple, how much did that help you
guys confidencewise when you took them into overtime?  
JESSE MORGAN: It was a big thing, we knew we could come and play tough and
compete with them.  
  
Q. Chaz, to beat these guys you had to be extremely confident can you talk
about what you guys learned from the last game?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: We tried to learn from our mistakes in the last game and move
on from that.  
  
Q. Chaz, a lot of loose balls, you guys got your hands on 'em and controlled
them, was that an energy thing that you guys bring to this group? Was that
something you had to do down the stretch to finish it off?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, and watching the last time we played Temple I could have
got more of those 50/50 balls that I couldn't get, and I take most of the
blame for that. But, You know I try to make up for the lack of my performance
last game.  
  
Q. Sean, can you talk about what Chaz has brought this season to have a guy
like him that can handle of everything, run the show?  
SEAN CARTER: He's brought great poise to our team, young guy, came in early in
the season and he brought it, couple of games, a few mistakes but he learns
quick, he's a smart player. He's mature on the court and he can‑‑ he drives,
it's his passion. Besides basketball, his whole summer is waking up 6:30 in
the morning, the Coach harped on us to bring energy, bring energy, it's crazy,
playing hard some of the weirdest things happen, loose balls fall in your
hands, getting the tips, that's the thing that Coach harps on us about is
making the tough man's plays.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have improved overall was today another step for what
you're trying to build toward?  
COACH KELLOGG: I think so, it builds confident in the teams that we can
compete with others in our league and we can get over the hump and win a game
against a team like Temple. I think we have played since the Dayton game,
played very well since then. When we're clicking on all cylinders and making
shots and rebounding, the team feels like they can compete with other teams
nationally, and today was a great step in the right direction and we can enjoy
it for about an hour and focus on tomorrow and another big‑time challenge
ahead of us, two very good teams that are going to represent challenges in
their own way.  
  
Q. Derek, is this your biggest win? Talk about this, your biggest win at
UMASS today, do you think?  
COACH KELLOGG: Some would say so, I don't know. If it leads to a win tomorrow
and the next day, then absolutely. If it doesn't then, to me it's another win.
I'm looking at a team that is very good and a top‑25 team, but I like all the
wins, I'm greedy, I like every one of them.  
  
Q. Coach, you've talked about "there is no tomorrow" and "living for
today."  
How has that played out? What has today done to that?  
COACH KELLOGG: They played like we speak, like we're playing today and we
haven't tried to look too far into the future all season long, it's been one
day at a time.  
Let's take care of business on the court and we have won games lost games and
this team has kept an even keel after big win and tough losses and I think we
have been able to rebound because of the resilience and how hard they work.  
These guys are basketball players, it's one of the first groups you've been
around that they like to play, you will come into the gym and they will be
playing 2 on 2 or 3 on 2, so when you have guys that are gym rats and get in
there, it's great. I will look out of my office at 8 a.m. in the morning and
Jesse is there shooting or Chaz is shooting free‑throws, so it's nice to see
there that when you work hard there are dividends, there are dividends.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome and your thoughts on about the season.  
COACH WEBER: Obviously excited to be at K‑State. There's a lot of positive
things going on both on our campus and the Big 12, just happy to be part of
it. We have a veteran group back, lot of minutes from last year led by our
three seniors, Rodney McGruder, of course, one of the top players in the
league last year, Jordan Henriquez and Martavious Irving. If we're going to
have success, we need those guys to have good years.  
The thing I've done since I took the job is focus on those guys. I want them
to be successful, and, you know before I even took the job I got ahold of
Rodney just to make sure if you can get your best guy to buy in to be sold and
ready to go on what's going to happen, it makes it easier on you as a coach
and a staff.  
So we need these guys to be successful. We have a lot of other guys. We have
some good depth. We had a chance to go to Brazil this summer and ten days of
practice, a chance to get to know each other on the trip. Little bit of a nice
jump start on the season. We're looking forward to it.  
Any coach right now, we had three or four pretty good days of practice. It
obviously takes a toll on them. After yesterday you're not sure you can beat
anybody. But that is part of the early month of practice, and it's a tough
grind. But it's a time you get your foundation together, the things you'll be
successful at.  
Hopefully you can emphasize those, and those will be things that you'll fall
back on. I think that will be our toughness, our defense, our rebounding,
which Coach Martin did a great job of implementing into the program. And
slowly but surely if we can make some shots and teach them a little bit of
offense, maybe we can be a competitor in the league.  
  
Q. How do you see ‑‑ do you see a different in general between the final
play in the Big Ten and Big 12 and maybe your system fits the Big 12 a little
better?   
COACH WEBER: Both are very good conferences. There is no doubt. The thing, and
I mentioned a lot of things going good in this conference. I was surprised
when I went to Big 12 meetings and you start looking at the success, and you
look at the scoreboard up there, all of the things that have happened over the
last five years, ten years in the league, there are obviously a foundation
there now, a TV package, a lot of good things.  
So I think the difference, if you look at it and I've had a chance, we played
Texas, we played Kansas, we played Oklahoma State through the years. Maybe a
little better athletes. A little bit more length. Big Ten, a little more
possession oriented, defensive‑wise. They get up and down a little more in the
Big 12 than maybe the Big Ten. That's team by team, but very good basketball,
obviously, in both conferences.  
  
Q. You had a chance to follow Bill Self at Illinois, now you have a chance
to compete against him in the same conferences as a chief rival. What do you
think will be harder?  
COACH WEBER: It was difficult to follow him. He did a tremendous job at
Illinois. The kids liked him, the fans liked him, and I had to get them sold
that, hey, we'll be okay. We actually did pretty good. So it was a good run
for us. Bill was truly missed there when he left. But we kind of got our own
thing going.  
Now, obviously, as one of the first questions John Currie asked me, my
athletic director, when I interviewed. Why do you want to come here and deal
with that? And I think as a coach, you want to compete against the best.
Kansas, and running the Big 12 is amazing. Obviously, nationally the last
three or four years Bill has been to the Final Four, runner up, won national
champions. As a coach, you want that challenge. That's the exciting part of
it. I hope we make it a rivalry. It's obviously a rivalry, but we hope we can
compete and have a chance to really get them worried about us also. So it
should be fun. He's done a great job, and hopefully we can compete with them.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about him. But I wonder if you could speak about
having Rodney as a pillar as you try to build your program? To have somebody
like him to lean on?  
COACH WEBER: There's no doubt if you have seniors and veteran seniors,
experienced guys, that it makes it so much easier as a coach. The nice thing
about Rodney, he's a tremendous person if you've been around him. I don't know
if you can get a better kid. He's a very, very hard worker. He wants to do
well. He's always in the gym. So that makes it easier. If your best guy is
doing that, everybody else wants to watch.  
Our guys get in the gym, and some of it is because of him. He has to get
better. He knows that. We're trying to work on learning the play without the
basketball. He's good with the ball. He's strong. He's a good rebounder. But
in the long run he's going to be a good leader for us, and mainly by his work
ethic.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of really good guards that you've coached, Deron
Williams obviously comes to mind. How does McGruder stack up with some of the
good guards you've coached through your career?  
COACH WEBER: He's a little different. He's kind of a hybrid guard/forward.
He's so physical and strong. He gets to the basket. He's the second in
rebounding in practice. We did stats the other day, and he's our leading
rebounder in practice. So he's very versatile. We'll have to post him up a
little bit. The thing we're trying to get him to do is play without the
basketball. Learn to read screens, come off staggers and make the good read,
the tight curls, and shoot open shot. I think that's the other thing. He's so
driven and so tough. He's always trying to get to the basket. Slow down, he
told me the other day I thought it was a nice epiphany for him, he said,
"Coach, I go too fast." I said, "Yes, slow down, and let the game come."  
If we can get him to do that with his work ethic and his attitude, he's going
to be very, very good, but he's a little different than maybe a Deron Williams
or Luther, Smith, some of those guys we had at Illinois.  
  
Q. What is the importance of having a basketball practice facility?  
COACH WEBER: I talked about a lot of positive things on our campus. Obviously,
football's success, volleyball, and then to add a brand‑new practice facility
is just great timing for me. One, for practice, you don't appreciate it. When
you have a building, you kind of take it for granted. When you don't have a
building, the deal with the men's and women's practices, just fighting for
time that's not easy. In our women's program, Deb's done a great job there.
She wants her time, we want our time. So you have that aspect.  
But the other part is just getting shots up. If you're in an arena, and you
look around we have one side basket, and you can't get shots up. When I took
the job, everyone said got to get free throws better. I know why. You don't
have the time to put the effort into working on free throws.  
So we're not in the gym yet. We had the ribbon cutting, and they're going
through getting the state codes and all that stuff. But we're hoping by the
end of the week we'll be in. It will give us 24/7 with the kids coming in and
shooting. Guys like Rodney McGruder and Angel Rodriguez they love to get in
the gym, so that's going to help putting time with shots, more practice time,
going when you want. Then, obviously, recruiting. We have something pretty
special now to show recruits that's ours on the K‑State campus.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Chris Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15069)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH WALKER: I will say, this our guys are going to come out and play with
pride. And play for the name on the jersey, and in doing that, I think we'll
do enough to be competitive in every situation.  
  
Q. Chris, congratulations. First of all, two questions, first is Kyle's
play. He's been around basketball as a player, and a coach, a high school
coach. What style will you play? Secondly, when you got the shot, who was your
first call to? Who did you call outside of Texas Tech to help you navigate the
waters?  
COACH WALKER: To answer the first part, we're going to play a little more up
tempo. That is my nature and personality. I like a little more zone, a little
more attacking style on turnovers. It keeps the game moving at a fast pace,
two, three pointers, and some more tactical into the game.  
But definitely more possessions to keep the game moving, and keep the guys on
their heals on offense and defense. That is the style that we desire to play.  
We have the personnel, players I think that you can teach them to play that
way. First of all, I've worked with so many guys, that it will be tough to
Steve Alford to name a few, John Oliver my first game. They're all different
and had different success. I'm going to take a little bit of each one of those
guys and sprinkle a little of my stuff in there as well and see if we can have
a successful season.  
  
Q. Nowadays on contracts you're supposed to have a four year deal, but
that's not long enough. What do you want to see?  
COACH WALKER: It's all about attitude. I was remarking to somebody the other
day there are a lot of interim coaches out there, they just don't know it. I
look at this situation, and people look at it as if I've been diagnosed with
cancer. It took me six months to live. I've really flipped it and said it's
six months to give. I'm head coach for the first time in the Big 12. I'm going
to give everything I have to the University, to the players and the community
of Lubbock.  
At the end of the day, we'll just see what it be. I'm not worried about wins
and losses and all that kind of stuff. Number one thing I'm focused on is
getting Texas Tech players to play Texas Tech basketball and the other Big 12
coaches to get their team to play their style of play.  
  
Q. You talked about not wanting to look at the past. But as a coach you must
be aware there are some other things. How do you go about that moving forward
from that point?  
COACH WALKER: We've already moved forward from that point. And some things
happen in the past that can make you stronger. We've grown as a group. Again,
it's just a forward thinking mentality. They're rallying around that. No one
is in Lubbock feeling sorry for us. I tell the guys all the time that 85% of
the people who don't care what's going on, and the other 15% are glad you're
going through it. Those are guys that are playing hard for Texas Tech
basketball.  
  
Q. Tell us a little bit about your staff and your leadership? Can you talk
about your leadership style?  
COACH WALKER: I would describe my leadership style from a disciplined
standpoint, I use my moral compass in all situations. I aim before I shoot
when it comes to kids, and you realize that the number one thing I need to do
more importantly is open their hearts while I open their minds. I'm really
into changing the way they think and really focused on making them the best
men, best students, and best athletes they can be by the time they leave Texas
Tech, because we are the last line of defense before they go into the real
world.  
As far as my staff is concerned, I have a great group of guys. Could not have
gotten to this point without those guys. I'm the one that you see here today,
but those guys have been the wind behind the sails. Jeremy Cox who was with
Coach Gillispie at Texas A&M and Kentucky and in Nebraska. A very experienced
coach, really good recruiter and even a better person.  
Bubba Jennings who is the star of Lubbock. I tell him all the time he's the
most popular man in Lubbock. He's just a great resource for the guy, awesome
player, and the star of Texas Tech and the people of Lubbock, and a host of
other guys that have helped us transition to the point where we're really able
to pick it up.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH WALKER: Dejan's doing great. He's transitioned from junior college. It's
been a whirlwind for him. He's done a 180. Has tough family issues he's
constantly dealt with. He's risen above all that stuff and gotten himself to
Texas Tech. Every day is a learning process and a growing process. He's met
every challenge head on, first with Coach Doherty coaching him, and I'm
looking forward to him being a major contributor for us this year.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about trying to build a program in this
conference?  
COACH WALKER: Great question. If you walk in, it's intimidating. Fortunately
enough for me I've been in the Big East and worked with great coaches. Bottom
line, this is what it comes down to. It's me getting my players to play my
style of basketball more so than the other guy gets his team to play his style
of basketball. That is my only challenge. It's not focusing on the accolades
of the other coaches. It's me focusing on what's going on in Lubbock and
controlling that narrative. That's where I'll start and I'll begin. But at the
end of the day get them to play for you, more so than the other guy gets his
team to play for him.  
  
Q. Based on what you have now and obviously 16 players coming in. But what
do you see as the one thing this team has to do better, whether it's scores,
whatever, what do you see the team having to improve in?  
COACH WALKER: I would say the number one thing we have to improve in is
believing that we can win in Lubbock. That is, it can be accomplished. I'm
watching all the election stuff with the debate last night and you see all the
poles and stuff, and you see the poles where Texas Tech is picked. If you look
at that stuff, it could affect the way you do things.  
But in Lubbock right now these guys were so entrenched, focused on being the
best they can be. Coming into the arena, being competitive. We have this thing
where everybody on our staff wears black every single day. It's to remind
ourselves that every time we step on the court, you're on the road. When
you're on the road, you're the most focused, everyone's against you. We create
that in practice every day. We create great habits that we're in the most
difficult situations, and that's what's going to come out.  
So saying that's their mentality every day. Even today, we're all wearing
black. It's a road mentality, that's what we're going to take on for the
season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bill Self from Kansas. Coach, your thoughts about the
opening season?  
COACH SELF: I'm excited. I like our guys. We have great experience with our
senior class that's been through a lot of battles, and we have a lot of
puppies. Seven freshmen, so I think it will be a good team in time. I don't
think that we'll be great early. I think we have a process that we have to go
through.  
But I do think there is some talent, and I do like the possibilities of us
competing hopefully for another championship.  
  
Q. In regards to Ben and Jamari, who did they guard in practice last year?
How did that help them develop?  
COACH SELF: Well, we put Ben the majority of the time on Tyshawn, which I
thought was great for Ty. Because Ben was athletic enough and long enough that
he could give him some problems and Jamari every day. When I say every day,
second semester went head‑to‑head with Thomas every day. And Jamari actually
held his own with Thomas three out of five days. Then the other two he gets
murdered. But I think it was really great for those guys to play against pros
last year, at least for a period of time. I think that's helped their
advancement.  
It's been amazing to me how much they've both improved in practice since the
start of practice because they're starting to get it and get things. Because
they missed all the early practices last year, this is all new to them, but
they're picking up stuff quick.  
  
Q. Coach, last season recurring themes or recurring concerns were defense
and depth. How do you feel about those two areas coming into this season?  
COACH SELF: I think last season we were pretty good defensively. I mean, most
of our teams since I've been at KU have been pretty good defensively depending
on how you rate good defense. But the way we rate it it's been pretty good.
Depth was obviously a factor last year. We went seven deep and not eight.  
So this year I think we can go 10 or 11 deep. We're definitely a deeper team.
I think we potentially shoot it a little better, but we don't have the star
power. You don't have guys that can go out and get you 36 between the two of
them over the course of the season like Thomas and Ty did.  
That will be the challenge to me is having the really good players step up and
become excellent players, or to have the bling guy step up and play a more
pivotal role. We'll miss Thomas and Ty without question. But usually guys when
they get the opportunity step in and make the most of it.  
  
Q. What have you done to improve the post development? Have you added jump
hooks, face ‑up shots? What has Steve done in terms of his post development?
  
COACH SELF: We've actually‑‑ that's been an emphasis of ours, and we have done
a lot. Norm Roberts has spent a lot of time with Jeff. But the biggest thing
with him, he's a good space up jump shooter. He's an excellent free‑throw
shooter. He can make jump shots, pick and pop, score over his left shoulder.  
But he has to get where he can score over his right shoulder, and we've been
working hard on him developing a left‑hand jump hook or a go‑to move over his
right shoulder. So that's a point of emphasis. Something we tell him to do
every day. I think it will continue to develop over time.  
But Jeff naturally isn't one of those guys that looks to score or it comes
easy for him. That's not the case. Last year he averaged nine a game. In large
part because he played next to Thomas. Thomas would get doubled or whatever,
and Jeff would benefit from that. This year defenses will be designed to stop
Jeff. So he'll get 12 a game and show great improvement in his offensive moves
and repertoires, so to speak.  
I'm excited for him. I think he can do it. It's just taking it and putting it
in the game, because he can do it in practice.  
  
Q. Lot of guys drafted out of the league this past year. I think I've only
seen two or three teams preseason polls. Is this a replenishing year for the
Big 12? How do you break it down?  
COACH SELF: I don't think so. I think our league doesn't‑‑ I think our league
reloads. If you stop and think about it, and we did have some great prospects
in our league. But don't we have just about as many great prospects going into
the season as we had last year?  
Nobody knew Robinson would be the fifth pick. I remember sitting here last
year and I think I said we hope he can play like an All‑American. You look at
what Baylor's got down there. They've got a high lottery pick, a first round
guard. Without question I think he's the best guard in the country. You look
at basically I think McGruder's a pro. I think Henriquez will be a draft pick
for sure, and Oklahoma State's roster's loaded without question.  
You'll have guys emerge every year that will be draft picks. Our league won't
take a step backwards. Laugh last year we had three teams in the Top 10 all
year long. I'd be surprised if we don't have comparable result this is year.  
  
Q. You've talked about the new kids, the seven freshmen. How important is it
for those kids to get going quickly for you guys early in the season?  
COACH SELF: I think we play Michigan State in less than four weeks. So I think
that it will be very important for those guys to get going. But the biggest
thing is they're going to make mistakes and be up and down and that kind of
stuff. We know that. The big key is our seniors play like seniors. If they
play like they're capable of playing, we'll get enough guys to blend in and
buy time, so to speak, until everybody's on the same page.  
But I'm looking forward to the process. I think we'll have some nights where
we look really good. We'll have some nights where we don't look good at all in
large part because of our inexperience. I think it will be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. How do you look at the eight straight regular season Big 12 titles? Is
that a point of pride or a reflection of everything you've done in your
program?  
COACH SELF: It's not a reflection of anything I've done. It's a reflection of
having good players, period. We've had some hard rocking guys come through
there. And some guys that have developed over time and played at a really high
level. But it's a great sense of pride or source of pride for us. Not just for
me, but for everybody in our program, for our players.  
Our players don't want to be the team that doesn't. They put pressure on
themselves not to be that. I think that's good. I think it means an awful lot
to them. I don't think there is a jubilation of winning the league maybe that
you would anticipate with our guys, because I think they take the approach
this is our job. This is what we came here to do. So I really like their
approach. I like how much it means to them. I like the pride they take in it,
that sort of thing. But the most important one we could ever win would be this
year's, and that's how I think our guys look at it. That is certainly how I
look at it.  
  
Q. Talk about the freshmen. How much do you feel it helped their development
the fact that you can work with them more this summer?  
COACH SELF: Oh, no question. That's a great rule change. NCAA has done great
things as far as rule changes here late. That may be one great one they've
done, giving us access to our guys, not just from an athletic standpoint, but
an academic standpoint. You get a chance to steer your guys. You have more
control. Guys always do better when there is structure.  
So it's been really good for us. It's helped us. We got a double bonus because
we took our team to Europe. Though we still got two hours a week, we got more
than two hours because we got the ten practices. So that was good for us. I
don't think we performed well in Europe at all, but I'm not sure that wasn't
good for us too because it humbled us saying we've got a long ways to go. So
that was a great rule change.  
I haven't heard one coach say anything other than that that I've ever visited
about.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Oklahoma Coach Lon Kruger. Your thoughts on
the upcoming season?  
COACH KRUGER: It's a great time of year. Delighted to be back in Kansas City.
Through five days of practice, guys are anxious to get started. They'd like to
play tomorrow, of course. From a coaching perspective, we need a lot more
time. But this is a fun group. It's a fun group that's working hard. They've
had a very good off‑season and excited about getting things started soon.  
  
Q. How is it knowing that 88% of your scorers are coming back?  
COACH KRUGER: It's great to have experience. Any time you have a lot of guys
coming back, you feel good about that. They've got a better idea of what it
takes. The big key is our five seniors have not played in a postseason
tournaments, so they've been very much motivated during the off‑season by
that. They've worked hard. They want to play in the postseason, and they
should have that as a goal. That's allowed them to prepare well for the start
of practice, and again, anxious to get the year started.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about M'Baye, I think I'm pronouncing it right. What
kind of player is he, and how much did it help to have him in the program for
you?  
COACH KRUGER: Yeah, Amath M'Baye is a terrific young guy, first of all. He's
very genuinely motivated to be great at whatever he does. He's a terrific
student. He had that year last year to sit out as a transfer. He worked
extremely hard on his game. Yet, while he did that from an individual
standpoint, he was always interested in helping the team prepare for the
upcoming opponent. He's the guy that has the respect of his teammates. He's
very interested in doing whatever he can to help the team.  
But he's the guy that will be on the floor for a lot of minutes. He can play
you inside, outside, and that versatility allows him to stay out there a
little longer.  
  
Q. What a difference a year makes for you. Expectations and different things
you want the intrinsic things in the program now established as your kids
start practicing?  
COACH KRUGER: I don't know that they're established, but certainly farther
along. The starting point is different now than it was a year ago. Guys have a
much better idea of what the goals are, of what our expectations are. Again,
they've worked really hard in preparation. A year makes a big difference, for
sure. No question about it. Hopefully we'll see that translate into better
results.  
We were in a lot of ballgames last year. We just didn't quite get the stops we
needed or buckets we needed late in ballgames to get us in the right column,
but guys continue to work hard at that.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get your view of the Big 12, especially with losing
Missouri, losing Texas A &M, but bringing in West Virginia, bringing in TCU,
how does that change, if it does at all, the character of this league?   
COACH KRUGER: I don't think it changes it much at all. Losing two schools, of
course, you hate that. Certainly being from the old Big 8 days, the thought of
Missouri not being here is disappointing from a tradition standpoint. But we
bring in Trent Johnson, Bob Huggins, two terrific veteran coaches that will do
a great job and have their teams ready to play.  
So from that standpoint, the basketball standpoint it's not going to change
anything at all. Two terrific coaches.  
  
Q. You are just six victories away from 500 victories. How big an
accomplishment would that be for you?  
COACH KRUGER: Not something you think about, of course. Been doing this for
quite a while, that's why they add up. We've had a lot of good players, but
don't really think about that at all, nor will anyone else for very long. It's
just part of it.  
  
Q. You've coached in the NBA, from college to the NBA, back to college, what
did you pick up in your time in the NBA that you brought to the college
game?  
COACH KRUGER: When you play, as you know, in the NBA it's surrounded with the
preseason and everything. It's surrounded with a hundred ballgames a year, so
it's like three college seasons. So the experience of it in late‑game
situations, different ways to cover a pick‑and‑roll, different things to do
when a ball goes into the post. Just a few things that are a little different,
but just the experience, I think, gained from those four years is probably as
much as anything.  
But still you have to do things that your players are comfortable doing. You
have to identify your personnel, and still the objective at any level is to
put them in the position on the floor where they have the best chance to be
effective. So you take some of those experiences from the NBA and apply only
those that are going to fit this particular team. So it

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Opening thoughts?  
COACH JOHNSON: Exciting time for TCU basketball. Obviously, when you look at
TCU in the transformation from the Mountain West to the Big 12, everything's
new and it's very exciting. I think our institution is primed to be in some
position. I've inherited a group of young men that are doing an exceptional
job of buying into everything we've asked them to do up to this point.  
We're just look forward to the challenge that every day presents us to be a
decent basketball team.  
  
Q. I understand football's done great there. That is kind of taken care of
now. What are they doing to help bring TCU basketball to the level of the
other team's in the league?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, for us, when you look at our education I think in terms
of this league, it sets us apart in certain situations. The commitment to our
locker room I think you have to look no further than what happened to our
football facility in a short period of time. That's one of the things that
attracted me to this job. The quality of players and the many players that are
in the Dallas‑Fort Worth Metroplex.  
So the commitment from our institution is huge. We're going to have
renovations started after the season in our locker room. But all that being
said, bottom line is our football program, our baseball program, they did a
lot of winning before they got good facilities. We need to take care of our
abilities, and don't have a sense of entitlement, and everything else will
take care of itself.  
  
Q. LSU, you get first in the SEC when you go to LSU. Now there will be
another big building project here at TCU. What did you learn from there? After
the first year, the program kind of struggled a little bit. What did you bring
from that experience to Fort Worth?  
COACH JOHNSON: It was a different experience at LSU. We inherited some issues.
But what I learned in those middle two years, I don't know what it's like to
die. But I got close to dying during those middle two years. As we all know,
let's make no secret about it, you need to have good players, players that are
committed and you need to do a good job of recruiting on a consistent basis.  
But I tend to stay away from the word rebuilding. I don't know where that
label got thrown to me in my career. But make no mistake about it, I'm always
in a situation where we're trying to win as fast as we can, and play fast as
we can, and play well.  
  
Q. Is there a better way to upgrade recruiting than making the leap
conference ‑wise that TCU just made?   
COACH JOHNSON: Other than win games, no, there is not. Again, I think I said
it earlier. Now the kids in the Dallas‑Fort Worth area that have bypassed TCU
in the past, they're playing in one of the premier conferences in the country,
if not the premier conference in the country. So now they can come, get a
quality education and play at a high level. Again, it's going to take a
certain young man. It's going to take a good basketball player, but it's also
going to take a guy with a lot of courage. We've been received very well in
terms of the AAU coaches the high school coaches in there.  
But I think for the most part the guys that jump on board with this program
are going to be guys that can play, one. Guys, two, that want to be a part of
building some tradition. There in lies the challenge in itself.  
You look at all the premier programs across the country, regardless of the
league it's in. They got started somewhere. There was a group of players and a
group of guys that said I want to help this program build a tradition. That's
the young man we're looking for, and we're making strides in that regard.  
  
Q. Trent, what were the challenges that attracted you to this particular
job? You've been all over the country to a variety of different coaching
positions. What makes TCU unique as far as what made your juices flow to take
the job?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, the institution, the support, again, probably the most
important thing is the players in that area. There are so many players in the
Dallas‑Fort Worth area. Also the location for me where I like to have my
family, and hopefully be my last opportunity.  
So all of those things. Then the challenge, there is a challenge. There is a
huge challenge in front of us. You look at our conference, and there are five
guys that have coached in the Final Four, and four guys that are pretty good,
and you have one grinding. So those challenges in themselves and being a part
of building a basketball tradition when you win on a consistent basis, and
you're a main play era cross the country. I think we can achieve all of those
things in time. Is it going to happen overnight? Probably not.  
  
Q. What is the biggest difference about the SEC compared to the Big 12? I
know you've been asked that before, but what you noticed anything else since
April?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I haven't played a game in the Big 12 yet, so I don't
know if I can answer that. But from afar, I think any conference you're in is
the strongest conference and most competitive conference. But I go back to
just from afar in regard to what league I've been in, the quality of players,
the quality of coaching, and the physicality of the league. From top to
bottom, in my mind, I think it's been undervalued. Obviously, like I said, you
look at the history and tradition of this league, it's in the last five or ten
years it's been consistent in terms of how good it is, the number of prospects
that have come out. The number of coaches that have taken teams to postseasons
and so on and so forth. There in lies the answer to your question is pretty
simple.  
  
Q. In the SEC, at least for a little bit for one year you had a chance to
see what Devon Tay could do playing his freshman year at Arkansas you have
really big bodies in the Big 12. What else does he bring to the table?  
COACH JOHNSON: He is the one guy on this team that's been battle tested and
competed at a high level. That is no disrespect to the guys I have inherited.
I've inherited a good group of guys. He gives us a post presence in terms of
his strength and his size. He's no different than the group that I inherited
Amric Fields, Garlon Green, Kyan Anderson, Nate Butler, Jarvis Ray, all of
these guys are quality kids, and decent athletes. We need to push through
adversity. Devonta is the guy that's been put in that situation versus high
caliber teams and high caliber talent.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by West Virginia head coach Bob Huggins.
Coach, talk about the upcoming season?  
COACH HUGGINS: We're excited. It's going to be a great challenge for us. I
think when you have something new, I think there is a lot of excitement. I
know our fans are excited about every team playing in the Big 12. So we're
looking forward to the year.  
  
Q. The Big 12 has more small towns and college campus arenas, and the Big
East had more big city arenas than NBA arenas. Did that make the Big 12
tougher to win on the road in the Big East or not necessarily?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think it is. I think teams in the Big 12 probably have the
best home court advantage of any of the major leagues in the country. We
played in a lot of NBA arenas. There were a lot of teams that didn't have
their own arena, so it wasn't on campus. I think it makes a huge difference.  
  
Q. You hear a lot about expansion teams and universities moving around
conferences in football. How does that affect basketball? You guys are new to
the Big 12 this year. You don't talk about that much in regards to
basketball.  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I think whoever, Chuck Neinas, I guess, in charge of
expansion. I think they did a great job. They picked schools‑‑ we're a lot
like the other schools in the Big 12. We're the state university. We're a land
grant institution. We have great facilities. I think they did a great job of
getting people who were like the schools that are already in the Big 12. We're
a college town, much like most of the schools in the Big 12.  
  
Q. You've had experience in the Big 12. How do you think that will help now
that you're transitioning into the league?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I know where to go eat, but it's changed. Since I
was in the Big 12 when there was a north and south division, and we played
everybody in the south once, and everybody in the north twice, there were
places I didn't get to go. I didn't get to go to Lubbock.  
I almost wanted to stay just so I could go to Lubbock the next year, you know
what I mean? Now honestly I don't know. We're all‑‑ you look at the coaches in
this league. Five of them having coached in the Final Four. There are great
coaches in this league, but there is a wealth of experience in this league, so
we all know each other. We've all coached against each other, so I don't know
if it's an advantage or not.  
  
Q. If you would, could you just talk about Gary Browne? Last season he comes
off the bench. Gives you quite a few minutes. He's one of your main ball
distributors. Is that basically the role you're expecting of him this season
or is it changing?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we finally have some guards. We were the only team in
America that didn't recruit guards. I think we had when I finally got two and
Mazzulla got hurt, when he came back, Truck got hurt, so we only had one guy
with ball skills.  
I think we're fortunate now with Gary, and with Juwan Staten, and Jabarie,
that we have three guys that can actually play the point.  
I think what Gary brings is a tremendous amount of intensity and enthusiasm.
He plays so hard. I think he forces everybody else to play harder because he
plays so hard. He's really worked at his game. He's shooting the ball better,
handling the ball better. He's probably our best on the ball defender.  
So I don't worry about Gary Browne getting on the floor. He'll find a way to
get on the floor.  
  
Q. Every one of your conference road games is a long trip. What is the
potential impact on your team of having to take so many long trips?  
COACH HUGGINS: They asked me there who our rivalry in the conference was going
to be, and said it's probably Iowa State. They're the closest. Only 853 air
miles. So I don't know. We came out to Wichita last year and had mechanical
problems on the plane and didn't get in until 4:30 in the morning, 4:30
Wichita time, 5:30 our time, then played the next day. Played a heck of a
game, an overtime game.  
Then we had some problems getting back. We didn't get back until 5:00 a.m. and
that was a Thursday night. Then we turned around and played Miami at 1:30
Saturday afternoon at home and were fortunate enough to win both of those
games.  
Maybe I screw them up overcoaching them. They won't have to listen to me as
much. I don't know. I kind of thought maybe we'd just stay the night and come
back the next day. Maybe that would help. But they don't sleep anyway. After a
game it takes them a while to go to sleep. They sleep better on the plane, I
think.  
Have you ever noticed those guys sleep better sitting down than they do lying
down? You put them in chair, they go right to sleep. Tell them to go to bed,
and they won't ever go.  
  
Q. One thing that hasn't changed since you were in the Big 12 is that Kansas
has won the title every year. How do you explain that? How amazing is that in
this tough a conference?  
COACH HUGGINS: It's really amazing. You were talking before about home court
advantages, and I don't know who has a bigger home court advantage than KU
has. We went in there and lost by I think it was 106, my year at Kansas State.
My 7'2" center fouled in and out seven minutes. It's hard. It's a hard deal.
Bill does a great job. The job he did a year ago particularly being down the
way they were down and then going to triangle and two, and things that really
I don't think historically he's played a whole lot of. He just finds ways to
win.  
When you talk about KU winning all of those, I think there is one guy really
responsible, and that's Bill. He's a great coach. Of course having all those
players doesn't hurt anything either, just in case you were wondering. That
doesn't hurt at all either.  
  
Q. Your program is built a certain way being in the Big East. Are you going
to have to make some tweaks to account for the Big 12?  
COACH HUGGINS: If we are, I'm not smart enough to do it. I don't think so.
We're just going to play the way we play. We've had to change and adjust
things over the five years I was there just because of personnel. There was
like a five or six‑game stretch. I played Da'Sean Butler at point guard.
Didn't want to. Didn't have any choice. I don't think so. We're going to just
do the things that we do.  
We're going to try to go back and play a little faster. I'd actually like to
see us score once in a while. We've struggled with that. But we haven't played
very fast. We just couldn't play very fast. We're going to try to up the tempo
and play a little faster and do maybe some of the things that we did when I
was at Cincinnati than what we've done. I didn't really like playing as slow
as we had to play, but I like losing less. You have to do what you have to do.  
  
Q. It being a little unusual going back to Kansas State and not seeing
anybody there when you had the program there. Is it disappointing not to go up
against Frank in this league?  
COACH HUGGINS: We played last year. Actually, Frank owes me a game, either
Frank or K‑State, somebody still owes me a game. But that was‑‑ I don't know.
We went for a while, and we all said we're not going to play each other. Then
Andy Kennedy who is kind of like the wisest of the bunch said, "Why don't we
play each other?"  
At least whoever loses will be happy for the other guy. We're terrible losing
to some guy you don't like, you know? You're going to lose to somebody you
like. So we decided to play. I've got great memories of that happening at
K‑State. The people were absolutely fantastic. But you're right. It's a
different administration. It's a different everything. But it's still the same
people. They were absolutely wonderful to myself and my family.  
My wife still talks constantly about the people in Manhattan and the
surrounding area. They were wonderful people. I've got great appreciation and
great respect for them. I think that's a really, really hard place to play.
When they start playing wall bash cannonball, and start doing whatever it is
they, do I never could figure it out.  
It's really neat. It's a great, great atmosphere. It's fun. Our guys will have
a good time playing there.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Iowa State Coach Fred Hoiberg. Coach,
welcome this morning.  
COACH HOIBERG: Thank you. We're talking about our heart conditions here, so
maybe that's the reason. Thank you very much. It's been a great first couple
days for us with practice. We've had a great summer with our guys.  
I think it was a very good rule change to allow us to work with our guys for
two hours a week. Got a lot accomplished just as far as starting to put in
some of our philosophies. Carried over a little bit from the success we had a
season ago as far as getting back into the tournament. Our guys are hungry.
We've got a group of five seniors that all, a couple of them sat out last
year, Korie Lucious and Will Clyburn. We had three guys that have key roles on
our team a season ago.  
So our guys are ready to roll. We've got a very good mix with our seniors.
We've also got five freshmen on this team, and I'm really looking for our
seniors and for that great leadership. So far they've done a great job with
it. I think some of our freshmen will have an opportunity to go out and have
an impact on our team this season, and we'll see what happens.  
But we're excited about the season. It's a great group of kids. The best thing
about it, I don't have to coach effort with these guys. They bring it every
single day, and that is a great feeling as a coach. It's a fun group to be
around. It's a fun group to practice with every day.  
  
Q. When you have players like Will and Korie and the transfers you had last
year as well, in their sit ‑out year, what do you expect from them in
practice? It seems to me when you have quality players like that, that they
can contribute a great deal?  
COACH HOIBERG: Yeah, a hundred percent. I'll go back to two years ago when we
had the four guys sitting out, Royce White, Chris Allen, Chris Babb, Anthony
Booker. It's an opportunity for those guys to build great chemistry together.
They play on the scout team. They push the guys that are out there eligible
for playing. When the team goes on the road, they stay, and workout together
watch the games together. It's a great opportunity for those guys to start
building that very valuable chemistry. We developed that an early part of last
season, and it carry throughout the season.  
Same thing with Will and Korie, last year those guys were working out together
every day pushing our starters. Chris Babb who is as good a defender as there
is in our league. The guy that he had trouble with was Will Clyburn because of
his length, his skillset, his ability to finish in the paint with his
athleticism, and he can shoot the ball. So it gets you excited. You know, you
see what you have around the corner.  
We knew going into the season after Royce declared for the draft that we'd
have a lot to replace. We'd lose our top three scorers from a year ago, and
Royce led us in all five statistical categories. Well, six, if you count
turnovers, I guess.  
Well, it's Royce, and Chris Allen, and Scott Christopherson, those guys are
difficult to replace. But you look at who you have sitting out and who is
eligible this year. And I think we'll have increased role this is season.
Collectively, as a group, we'll be able to replace the three that left our
program.  
  
Q. Royce did so much for you guys over the course of his career. What do you
think you'll have to fill in with what he provided?  
COACH HOIBERG: Our team was so unconventional last year. We played outside the
box, and we didn't have a primary ball handler last season. For Royce it was a
perfect team because we had shooters and we had guys that could space the
floor. That was the biggest thing. We put the ball in Royce's hand at the top
of the key, the elbow, the post, let him be a facilitator of our offense. He
was tremendous. He was so good at finding that open man, drawing the defender
and making the right play.  
This season we'll play a lot more conventional. We'll have Korie Lucious, a
pure point guard again. And I'm excited about that. It gives us the
opportunity to play a little bit faster. Royce was great. When he had the
ball, you put a guy in a position that's not used to guarding a ball handler,
and in some cases you have a seven‑footer guarding him.  
But it was a little slower pace going down the floor. With Korie, he's played
in two Final Fours and he's got that experience of leading a basketball team.
We've got the athletes to get out and run to play with him. So I'm excited
about what we have this year.  
You know, it looked a little like we did two years ago when we had Diante
Garrett leading our fast break. But I think we have more weapons than we did
with that team a couple years ago.  
  
Q. Conventional, your style. You've played for Johnny Orr; you've played for
some good NBA coaches. You seem to adapt. But in an ideal world, how would you
like to play?  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, I'm always going play to the strengths of my players. My
system will be based on who I feel we have and put the ball in the hands of
the guy I feel has the best chance of making a play. Try to exploit a mismatch
on the floor. Last year it happened to be Royce. He was the guy that had the
best opportunity to draw on a defender and make a basketball play.  
This year, it's not only Korie. I'll use Will Clyburn in a lot of situations
like I did Royce a few years ago. If he rebounds the ball, I'm expecting him
to push the ball down the court. Which will get Okoro on one lane, Chris Babb,
and McGee on the other lane, and we have guys that are knock down shooters.
You can play some smaller lines out there at times and try to keep the defense
on their heels. That's what I really like about this group is the versatility.
We can play small, we can play big, and play different lineups based on who
we're playing against. That is the thing I'm going to try to do to find the
guy to utilize their skill set in the best possible way.  
  
Q. Second year you've needed to build a program with impact transfers? Can
you talk about how you get those kids to come be cyclones?  
COACH HOIBERG: Just looking at what we did two years ago. My biggest thing
when I got the job was trying to get the talent base where we could compete at
the Big 12 level. We only had three scholarship players when I took the job,
and we had some good freshmen that came in. Melvin Ejim being the best of the
group. Then to get those transfers in there and give them a second chance, it
was attractive to them.  
In a city like Ames, you can come there. Half the town is 60,000; we have
31,000 students this year. You can come here and focus on your basketball and
your academics. It is attractive to those guys to come there and have that
opportunity to play in front of as good of fans as there is in the country.  
When I was putting that team together a couple years ago, when you have the
amount of transfers that we did, you're not just coming in on your own. When
we got Chris Babb, and then Anthony Booker and Chris Allen, and Royce comes
aboard, you get four guys. The thing you sell to them is how to build that
chemistry to have a great impact on the floor with that ball in the season.
Then you start selling it to the other guys.  
They saw the success we had with transfers. You talk to others about how you
can make an impact by coming to our program. We'll see how it works. We wanted
to fill with transfers and four year guys, and we accomplished that. I'm
excited about this young group of freshmen, and I think they all have a chance
to play some this season.  
  
Q. Chris Babb comes in for you last year. Did you notice what he did
defensively, and have you noticed any adverse affect on the offense, and how
much has he worked his shooting during the off ‑season?   
COACH HOIBERG: I think the biggest thing Chris went through were some
confidence issues. Chris early in the season the first half of the year, he
was in the Top 10 in the country in three‑point percentage. He hit seven of
them against Rice. The tournament itself, he had five against Texas in the Big
12 opener, and he went through a slump. I've been there. Anybody that's been a
shooter in their career knows what it's like going through a slump. There are
time when's it feels like a little the thimble up there and it weighs on you.
He has the assignment every night of guarding the best perimeter. He buys into
that. He had a tremendous impact on winning. Every night he went out and
bought into his role of being a lock down defender. Look at a guy like Jacobin
Brown made life difficult by making him take tough contested jump shots. Chris
is playing with a tremendous amount of confidence right now. He's shooting the
ball

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Travis Ford. Coach, your comments about the
upcoming season?  
COACH FORD: We had a very competitive opening weekend of practice. We were
fortunate enough to be able to take a trip to Spain, a summer trip in early
August, which really got us ahead. And I think it's really we've already seen
some dividends. It's paid for us as far as how sharp their practices have
been, and things like that. I like our basketball team.  
We return several young players that were kind of thrown in the fire last year
and gained some extremely valuable experience. I'm not sure how many games.
But at the end of the year, the last 7, 8, 9 games of the season last year, we
were starting three freshmen, a sophomore, and a senior. Those freshmen and
sophomores got some extremely valuable experience, and all those guys will be
stepping up and playing, obviously much bigger roles this year and we'll be
adding in some incoming freshmen that will step in and take Keiton Page's
spot.  
But we finished the year last year with some pretty serious injuries with
Olukemi out with an ACL and Philip Jurick was out with a torn Achilles and
Le'Bryan Nash missed the last seven or eight game was broken wrist. We're
still in the same situation. We're pretty injured right now this first weekend
and this first week of practice, including this week. We'll be without three
of our top seven, four of our top eight guys have been out with either
injuries or illnesses.  
So our team can start preparing and start coming together as a team, because
we're just kind of piecing things together at this point through practice.  
But I like our team. I like that we're still very, very, very young. We're
going to be playing three or four‑‑ three or four freshmen, and three
sophomores, and a junior, and probably one senior or two seniors the majority
of the minutes. But we're still relatively a very, very young basketball team.
But fortunately enough we have young players that have gotten valuable
experience through last season.  
  
Q. Travis, I heard that Smart is a very versatile player. How many positions
can he play? Can he play point guard? What all can he do?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, Marcus is an extremely versatile player. Can he play four
different positions on the court from the point guard position to the two, to
the three, to the four. If you asked him to play the five, he would do that
too. But extremely unselfish basketball player. Marcus, probably more than any
player I've ever coached, affects a practice, effects games more than any
player I've seen. He's involved in every play in practice, whether it be a
rebound, a loose ball, defensively making assists. He's involved in
everything. He's the ultimate winner. He competes every drill to win every
drill. He takes great pride in winning. He takes pride in his team winning.
He's an extremely vocal leader. He never stops talking in practice, and this
is from a freshman. I tell everybody, he's kind of old school. He doesn't care
what position he plays, doesn't care how many points he scores. All he cares
about is winning.  
I've never seen too many players that make as many extra effort plays as
Marcus Smart makes. I was telling our team the other day everybody kind of
does what I tell them to do. He kind of goes above and beyond what I tell him
to do. It's just very refreshing. I think it's fortunate that on our team we
have two to three to four different players that play that way. It becomes
contagious when you have a player like that. He kind of helped everybody. It
makes it that much better when he's so unselfish. It's fun to watch him play
every day. But he affects the game in so many different ways.  
  
Q. With that, how has he impacted Le'Bryan Nash? Le'Bryan comes in as one of
the top recruits in the country. Are they developing a relationship that
carries on to the court? Is Le'Bryan welcomed? Marcus? How does that dynamic
work?  
COACH FORD: Absolutely. I think they complement each other very well, very
well. In the fact that I think Le'Bryan complements Marcus very well, because
Marcus is a great passer, and Le'Bryan is a great finisher, and he can finish
from a lot of different areas on the court, from the three‑point line on in.
Marcus, those two have developed a great bond on and off the court. They're
fun to watch. Marcus complements LB, because LB sees the success that Marcus
has and his team has only because of how hard Marcus plays, and that becomes
contagious is to guys like Le'Bryan who last year was a little inconsistent
and with his play. He worked a little bit. We don't have that problem right
now. He's been terrific. He learned so many great lessons his first year in
the Big 12.  
In that aspect, he's helped Marcus a lot too. He's helped Marcus a lot. I
heard him talk about how competitive it is at this level. It is. It's
interesting seeing those two on the court because they complement each other
very well.  
A lot of people have commented to me that I bet Marcus really helps Le'Bryan,
well, Le'Bryan helps Marcus as well. It's fun to watch those two.  
  
Q. Obviously you've got some new talent coming in. You have some hold overs
from a young team. But what do you really need to do to move up? What is maybe
one of the most competitive, if not the most competitive leagues in the
country?  
COACH FORD: That's very easy for us. We've got to rebound the basketball.
That's been kind of the theme for us since practice has started. Kind of been
the emphasis for us since practices started. Pretty much every category. Any
rebounding category we were last. From offensive, to defensive, any category,
we were last in the league in rebounding. We've got to make a drastic
improvement in that area.  
We have Brian Williams who is pretty seriously hurt right now who will be out
for a while, and that does not help our basketball team as far as rebounding.
We've got to get some other guys working. Brian Williams was one of the more
athletic players in our league. 6'5", he was playing the four‑three for us.
He's out for a while. We're not sure how long yet. We've got to make sure that
we're doing drills every single day. Brought up to our team every single day
that we need to make sure that we kind of had the slogan, last to first in
rebounding. That is the emphasis we're making on it. It's very evident what
we've got to get better at when you just look at stats‑wise. I think we'll
score a few more points than we did last season, even though we're losing our
league in score. I think our defense will be better. We're longer, more
athletic. We're making the emphasis on assists.  
We want to be one of the top teams in assists. That is another emphasis for
us. We were fifth or sixth in the league last year. But it all comes back to
rebounding every single time.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Scott Drew. Coach, welcome, and your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
COACH DREW: Well, it's good to be here. I know if you saw any of our
highlights from our Moonlight Madness, you saw that we have a pretty athletic
team. In fact, I don't know if there was any dunk contest quite like it when
you have Brittney Griner doing 360 dunks, then you have Deuce Bello dunking
over 7'1" Isaiah Austin. But a great way to start the season. As far as
practice season, I should say.  
As far as our team goes, experience in the back court, which is a little bit
different. In the last few years we've been a taller team and more experienced
on the front line. But when you lose three players to the NBA and return a lot
of people in the back court, it kind of changes some things that you do. That
is the great thing five, six years ago, four years ago we had a lot of guards.  
This year we're more similar to one of those teams. I think coaches will tell
you it's great to have an experienced and talented and depth in the guard
position, especially early in the year.  
With our front line starting out with Cory Jefferson and J'mison Morgan, those
are our returning guys, and they've got to fill a lot of rebounding and shot
blocking and a lot of points. When you lose Quincy Acy, Quincy Miller, and
Perry Jones. I think this year when you look at our team last year we had a
tremendous leader and warrior in Quincy Acy.  
I know Pierre Jackson's preseason Player of the Year. He's really improved and
focused on his leadership and being more vocal at practice. Obviously a great
talent and really came up with some big plays last year for us.  
But I was going to say that leadership this year is going to be hard to
replace what Quincy Acy brought from the locker room and every day in
practice. Hopefully we have some guys this year that step up and can replace
that. So any questions, we can open it up now.  
  
Q. With those three guys going to the NBA, is that going to be a focus even
more for Pierre picking up the scoring? Or has his role changed in that regard
at all?  
COACH DREW: I think Pierre led us in scoring last year, so he's used to
scoring. I think he'll be focused on more defensively and offensively
everybody will focus their game plan around him versus last year, Perry Jones,
maybe Quincy Acy or Quincy Miller. So as we all know, the expectations for him
and the focal point, things are going to be tougher for him. At the same time,
he's improved his game and is excited for that challenge.  
  
Q. You guys faced Kentucky at Kentucky December 1st. How do you prepare your
team to face that team?  
COACH DREW: I think it's a great opportunity for us. All we want to do in our
non‑conference schedule last year in mid January we had the toughest
non‑conference schedule in the country. I thought that prepared us for Big 12
play. That's what we want to do is play as tough a non‑conference schedule.
This year could be harder than last year's non‑conference schedule. We play
some real tough road games, true road games like at Gonzaga, at Kentucky. That
gets us ready for the Big 12. Because playing on the road in the Big 12, why
the Big 12 conference is special, why it's elite, statistically you could
argue it's the best conference the last five years is because the home court
advantage. It's tough to win on the road in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Obviously Deuce is a great athlete. Just wondering about the progression
of his offensive game from his freshman to sophomore year. Also where do you
see him playing? Is he conceivably a three for you? Has all the people you
have in the back court? Where do you see him fitting in?  
COACH DREW: The good thing is in coaching, it's easier to improve someone's
skill level and skill set rather than the athleticism. Deuce is an NBA
athlete. He's worked extremely hard to improve his ball handling, his passing
and his shooting. I think he's made strides with that. I think he creates
better for himself and his teammates now.  
So I expect a better Deuce Bello this year. At the same time defensively at
the end of the year he really came on and did a great job on the boards as
well for us.  
Being a taller guard f we're playing a three‑guard lineup, he could definitely
be matched up with a bigger defender. At the same time, a lot of times last
year he guarded point guards for us. So he's versatile, and I think we'll
match up with whomever we think gives us the best match‑up.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could describe the early development of Isaiah in your
program so far and what he's going to bring to your program?  
COACH DREW: Well, he brings a lot of height, a lot of length, and a great
skill set. I think the biggest thing when you look at him right away is you
know he can get stronger. He's worked extremely hard on that, and I think he's
put on 10, 12 pounds. Because of that, it definitely will help him inside. But
at the same time offensively because can he shoot threes and handle the ball,
he really stretched the defense and makes it tough to guard a big guy like
that. Now he's going to be down low as well. But that versatility makes him
special.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you're the only coach in the league that went up against
West Virginia last year and you got a chance to see their athletes and what
they can do. Just wondering from that experience, can you give any kind of
prediction of how they could fit into the Big 12 this year athletically and
everything else?  
COACH DREW: I think Coach Huggins is no stranger to the Big 12. We all
competed against his teams when he was at Kansas State. Very similar styles,
him and Coach Frank Martin. Last year when we played them, just what we
thought. Very good, solid fundamentally, very well‑coached.  
But physically they are as tough a team as you'll face all year. I know we
really had to play well in that game to give ourselves a chance to get a win.
I think everybody knows, again, Coach Huggins is a Hall of Fame coach for a
reason. They're not going to beat themselves. Physically they're going to be
very imposing.  
  
Q. Couple years ago you got to see what home court advantage could be in a
Regional down in Houston where you had a really strong following. Does that
give you any extra incentive when you see Cowboy Stadium in Arlington hosting
a Regional as maybe a goal for your team in terms of having a strong regular
season to put new position to maybe feed into that Regional?  
COACH DREW: I think first of all postseason and March Madness, you're
motivated and excited to hopefully have an opportunity to be in that. Then as
it gets closer, you start looking at sites.  
I know right now our coaching staff with five freshmen, we're just trying to
make sure we're passing to the right guys and defensively getting to the right
spot. So really not worried about that yet.  
But definitely as the season goes on, that is an incentive and something that
excites every player to have an opportunity to play close to home in front of
family and friends and get that kind of support, no question.  
  
Q. Are you sticking with the zone defense? And the success Perry Jones is
having in the preseason, can you speak about that a little bit?  
COACH DREW: I think first of all with the zone and man, I think each year we
teach both, then we go with whatever we think gives us the best chance to win.
I think you'll see both this year. With the smaller lineup, we'll probably
play more man this year, but, we'll have both to go to.  
As far as Perry Jones and his success, we knew he was going to be successful
in the NBA. Can't wait to watch them in the postseason. The Thunder had a
great run last year.  
But that organization and that team are great situations for Perry Jones. We
love it being close to Baylor Nation so we can follow them. I mean, Moonlight
Madness for that opening night, the Jones family was in the house. The only
request Perry had was make sure he got a Moonlight Madness T‑shirt. So he's
down all the time and very close and loved in the program. I think he's going
to really fit in well with that organization and do a great job.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2012

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Texas coach Rick Barnes. Coach your
opening thoughts and we'll go to questions.  
COACH BARNES: This is the first time we've ever had a team of our recruited
athletes. We only have freshmen and sophomores. It's been a really fun group
to work with. We really appreciate the role that the NCAA put in this summer
that we were allowed to spend time with them during the summer on the floor.  
But we feel like we've got a pretty good pulse on this group. So we're excited
about the season and looking forward to getting going.  
  
Q. Style of play? Two questions, style of play, you've done some of the Utah
Jazz action over the last year or so. Will you stick with that? Then, will Cam
and Prince ever play together on the court at the same time, do you think?  
COACH BARNES: Well, our style will be ‑‑ the one question that I think we've
got to answer is can we get some consistent scoring from a couple different
guys that we really do think that we're going to be a team that's going to be
balanced and one we're doing with some of the things that you mentioned with
the Jazz but also back to some of the things that we've always tried to do to
get the ball inside.  
We do have Cam and Prince playing together some, and it's not so much what
we're concerned about offensively with those two guys, but it's more
defensively.  
But Prince is very long, very quick, and can really move. But yet either one
of those guys have ever played very far from the basket. Those guys really do
complement each other in practice when they go against each other, because you
have Cam who is a very big, strong, powerful player. And you have Prince who
is long and blocks a lot of shots. So those two guys I think have helped each
other throughout our practice sessions.  
  
Q. How important is it to you as a coach knowing that three of your Top 5
scorers are coming back this year?  
COACH BARNES: I don't know. How many did they score last year? That's really
you go back to a year ago and think about our team, we relied on Jacobin Brown
so much, because we just couldn't seem to find that second or third consistent
scorer with our group last year. As the year went on, Sheldon McClellan
started being more consistent, and we need him to do that with this group.  
But with the guys that we have returning, we know that we're going to play 11
guys because of where we are right now. We've gone back to really talking a
lot about accountability and efficiency and having everyday players and guys
that we can count on.  
So really, we need that from Sheldon as much as anybody because he has a knack
for putting the ball in the basket. I think a challenge for him will be that
he's got to be able to do it day‑in, and day‑out.  
  
Q. You mentioned balance and coaches like balance. You lost your number one
scorer. Is McClellan the best shot you have at replacing Jacobin as some type
of number one scorer?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, I think you would say that because of the fact that he's
at ten points a game a year ago, and he does have a knack. He needs to become
more specific in terms of we've been getting on him in practice again. Still a
year ago, and we do it even now, where he needs to be ready to shoot the ball
when he catches it, because he's going to be guarded. He just needs to want to
shoot the ball when he's open as opposed to trying to maybe mess with it a
little bit too much dribbling or looking to overpass it.  
But Sheldon has the ability to score. He's got an innate ability to do that.
Probably the most natural scorer that we have on our team. So we just need him
to be consistent.  
  
Q. How about the perimeter shooting? Who are those guys going to be?  
COACH BARNES: Well, again, obviously Sheldon is a guy that can do that. But I
think with our returning players we've got Jonathan that's really worked
extremely hard to stretch his game out a little bit. Did you ask me how many
pure shooters we have? I know we've put a lot of time into shooting and we've
watched guys get better this summer.  
But if you ask me‑‑ well, if you ask those guys they would all think they're
pretty good shooters. But it's going to be a team that there's not a guy on
our team that can't shoot. I'll say that. We have a guy that every time he
shoots it, you think it's going in, I would think that would be probably
Sheldon. He's good. When it leaves his hand you think it's got a chance.  
  
Q. With all the freshmen and sophomores, this appears to be one of your
youngest teams you've had. Is it a little trying to your patience that you've
got so many young guys that are going to be called on to do big things for
you?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I think every year‑‑ I don't think when we go to practice
did I ever look at these guys as being young. I really don't. I don't really
buy into the young. Even though as coaches you have a tendency to really
probably get after teams that you think can be good probably more so, and this
is a group that we've got confidence in and we think that they've got a chance
to be good.  
But we never looked at them as being young. We've never used that term with
them either, we're this, that or whatever. We just know that we've got to
coach them and teach them to compete every single day in practice. Knowing
that, again, that's why we've always tried to play a difficult non‑league
schedule to get them ready for Big 12 play.  
But in terms of patience, I don't know. I've had some teams that would try
your patience maybe more so than younger guys, because this is a group of guys
right now that I will tell you the chemistry with this group has been as good
as it's been in a long time. It's a group that we've enjoyed going in to
practice with every day. It's a group that they put a lot of time in on their
own.  
So it's been a fun group, and I don't think it would be‑‑ I wouldn't use that
I've been impatient with them. I know I want them to be everything that we
think they can be.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  90  
Baylor  75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Missouri Tigers. Tournament champions.
Coach Frank Haith, congratulations on the victory today. I know you have four
student‑athletes, Phil Pressey, Michael Dixon, Marcus Denmon, and Kim English.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's victory.  
COACH HAITH: Okay. Thank you. Obviously it was a tremendous, tremendous game.
Thought our guys played extremely well. On both ends of the court, other than
they‑‑ they got 18 offensive rebounds. But I thought our defense was good.  
We were outstanding offensively in terms of our execution. It was just a great
performance today, but also just a great performance all week for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For anyone up there, to take our city, our title, our town, talk to me
about that, what you guys did here. So many of you, especially Mike and
Marcus, in your hometown, and, Kim, an adopted son, just what a proud moment
it is in your life to accomplish this in Kansas City.  
MICHAEL DIXON: This is Kansas City, Missouri. And for me and Marcus, this is
our home city. And we just are so proud and glad that we all just came here
together and stayed together and fought with a lot of heart and toughness, and
you can't really measure that with this team.  
I just think we did a great job, and we're going to let this one settle in for
a few days.  
And credit Baylor, because they fought hard. And they played three tough games
as well. And we're just going to let this settle in and get ready for the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Kim, you had ‑‑ when you have a week like this shooting the ball, talk
about your mental approach a little bit. Does it start getting on the bus
coming in or in practice or do you start feeling it in the games?  
KIM ENGLISH: My mental approach this week started when we started preparing
for Oklahoma State, the night when they beat Texas Tech. And the mental
approach was 100percent defensively, what we were going to do to stop them,
how we were going to stop, and offensively our team is so good and so not deep
in numbers but deep in offensive talent, you never know who it's going to be.  
And, I mean, if you really concern yourself in getting stops, you're going to
get a lot of easy baskets in transition. And our guards did a huge job of
really heating people up up top.  
I mean, the shots I got were a testament to Coach Haith and his staff finding
deficiencies in teams' defense and our guys getting easy baskets in
transition.  
  
Q. Marcus and then Kim, in what ways is this team similar to the team that
beat Baylor in '09 in Oklahoma City for the title, and in what ways is this
team different?  
MARCUS DENMON: I'll just start with our similarities. I think that that was an
unselfish team. That's kind of where we made a staple of our program this
season, us to be selfless and play together as a team, because the outcome
usually is a positive outcome.  
I'm not really sure on the differences. We have a little bit different
approach coming in the games than that team that year. This year we're a team
that's doing more preparing for each game and in that game.  
So that's about it as far as that.  
KIM ENGLISH: Piggyback what Marcus said, the number one and I think the most
important similarity is the selfless nature of those teams and the want‑to
defensively. We really want to guard the same way we wanted to in 2009. The
difference is that team just had two pros on the inside with DeMarre Carroll
and Leo Lyons, and they really cleaned up the glass. And we really depend on
our guards to help out our bigs to rebound.  
So if you want to nitpick and find things, those would probably be the only
two.  
  
Q. Phil, Michael, and Marcus, what made what Kim did this week make him the
most outstanding player in this group?  
PHIL PRESSEY: I'm not surprised he got that. He's been working since fall. The
last person in the gym along with all of us, just shooting constantly, and, I
mean, you guys are surprised that he's making those shots, but I see him make
those shots day in, day out. And I'm just proud of him.  
MICHAEL DIXON: Well, Kim works as hard as anybody I know. And he wants it as
bad as anybody I know. And these four right here you see is the overtime crew.
Every practice, every after‑conditioning, after everything gym‑wise, we stay
and shoot and play one‑on‑one and work on each other's games every day. And
that's just a tribute to him and us being in the gym.  
And Kim is a tremendous player and he's in a good mindset right now. And he's
just very mentally ready and focused. And he does a lot for this team besides
scoring a lot of things that people don't see on the stat sheet.  
MARCUS DENMON: I mean, Kim's play was unbelievable all weekend. I'm glad. And
he was fortunate enough to make shots all three games. And he really carried
us. So he's a senior. I've been with him for four years. He's a brother of
mine. And to be able to see him go out on top as far as Big 12 play is great.
But we still got more to do.  
  
Q. After the game on the podium, you guys were at least briefly chanting "1
seed." Is that about just purely strictly easiest possible path to Final Four,
or is that about the respect that goes along with being a 1 seed?  
KIM ENGLISH: Nothing about it is easiest path. All 68 of those teams are
capable. I remember last year VCU was one of the first four that played on
Wednesday and they got all the way to the Final Four. Easiest path not at all.
It's the respect factor. We went 30‑4 and finished a game out of winning the
Big 12 outright. And we eventually came here and took care of business.  
Joe Lundari, if you're watching, look out for us.  
  
Q. Kim and Marcus, there's about four minutes left in this game when Ricardo
fouled out and not long after Steve got his fourth foul. And I think probably
every Mizzou fan in the building looks at Steve Moore and says be careful, and
instead he went out there and made a couple of real bold, aggressive defensive
plays that were real key. Can you talk a bit about Steve's play defensively
there at the end?  
KIM ENGLISH: Steve made some huge plays. I told him. The play at the half
where he stripped Brady Heslip, his dunk, his block on Gary Franklin, and he
got a rebound and fell and still found one of our guards who made a free
throw. So he made some huge plays down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Make your case to the nation why you should be a 1 seed.  
COACH HAITH: I'm not like the guys. We'll talk about that a little later. But
we're happy that we've had a great regular season and to win a Big 12
Championship, that stuff will work itself out. We're not concerned with that.
I'm more concerned about being in Omaha and St. Louis. That's where I'd like
to be. Whether that's a 1 seed, 2 seed. The less travelled. We'll be happy if
they send us out west. It doesn't matter.  
  
Q. A lot of adversity you guys have undergone this year. Are you thinking
about that now, what you guys have overcome and kind of the accomplishment?  
COACH HAITH: I think any team that achieves success, you play the season out.
And there's no question I played the season out, when we finished the ballgame
and all the things that have happened this year and what this team has endured
and all the things that people say what this team is not and not what we are,
it's just a humble moment for me.  
And I'm very honored to have the opportunity I've had here at Mizzou. And it's
been a special, special year.  
  
Q. Talk to me about where you're at emotionally right now. I don't know if
I've ever seen you be this ‑‑ I don't know what the right word for it is right
now. It seems like you're almost soaking this in a little bit more than you
have other big moments during the season.   
COACH HAITH: I don't know. I don't know how I'm supposed to act, I guess. I'm
just going to be who I am. And I'm excited about this team. I think we're 30
and 4. Shoot, if you told me we're going to be 30 and 4 at this time of the
year, I mean, I would say you're crazy, particularly when we lose Laurence
Bowers. It's just been a special moment.  
And we're really blessed. God had his hands all over this year.  
  
Q. Seemed like about the last month there's been everything is the last ‑‑
the last time you're going here, there, last times you're playing these teams,
do you attach any significance to winning the last Big 12 game that Missouri
is going to have?  
COACH HAITH: Obviously it's special. To win championships, I think, is just
special. We talk about‑‑ we got the job. We talk about‑‑ that's one of the
things, the team winning championships.  
We came here to Kansas City in early November. We won a championship. And now
we have an opportunity‑‑ we didn't win the regular season championship. But we
won a conference tournament championship.  
And I think that whether it be the first or last, maybe down the road we'll
think about that, but right now I just think the guys are just excited about
winning championships. And that's what we talked about from day one.  
And now we get a chance to compete for a national championship. And that's a
blessing.  
  
Q. Three games in three days, seems like you guys could play tomorrow. Have
you ever coached a team that plays this hard combined with the chemistry that
they have?  
COACH HAITH: No, this is a special group. This is a special group. And I think
someone asked me the other day is this team tired. Do you worry about your
team being tired, because we played so many games, you only have seven guys in
your rotation.  
These guys love to hoop. They love to play. They played the game the right
way. A basketball expert‑‑ when you look at our team, we play the game the
right way. And we're a fun team to watch play. I think they enjoy the way we
play, and they get excited about competing.  
  
Q. Scott Drew was talking about this league does an excellent job of
preparing its teams for postseason play, NCAA Tournament. In what ways do you
feel like your league schedule and in what ways do you feel like this
tournament has prepared this team for whoever you play and wherever you have
to go?  
COACH HAITH: I think the one thing is that we have really good talent in this
league. We have great coaches. We have tremendous fan bases in this league.
And when you have achievement like we've had or some of the teams that go into
the NCAA Tournament, you compete in this league, you play a true roundrobin,
which no other power conference plays, I think you're truly capable of
competing at the next level.  
And I think that Baylor, man, they're so talented. And we're fortunate to have
success we've had against them. But they are a really talented team. I
wouldn't be surprise if they're not in New Orleans as well as Kansas or Texas
or Kansas State. I think we have‑‑ Iowa State. I think we have really, really
good teams in this league.  
  
Q. You talked earlier this week about the comparing the importance of
championships. You talked about the ACC championship. Compare the two now,
having gone through this from the head man job.  
COACH HAITH: The ACC, you don't play a true roundrobin and I think that you
play an imbalanced schedule. That's the difference. I think‑‑ in this league
you have a true champion. And that's why I believe Texas will get into the
NCAA Tournament. You play everybody twice. The atmosphere today was
tremendous.  
I mean, Mizzou Nation was unbelievable. We drove up today before the game,
and, I don't know, a thousand maybe fans were standing outside the gate as we
pull in. And I got emotional. That was unbelievable.  
And I know we're in Kansas City, Missouri, and I gotta believe we're not an
afterthought in Kansas City, Missouri.  
  
Q. Marcus isn't really one to talk about whether he's hurt or injured, and
Kim sustained that knee to the thigh. Can you just talk about what it took for
Marcus to be able to play today, what he did with his ankle yesterday, and
also Kim having to rebound from that?  
COACH HAITH: Well, we got a great training staff. Pat Beckman was outstanding,
and I told him after the game you get to earn your money tonight.  
And he kept those guys up doing treatment, both those guys, and he called me
early this morning, there was an early treatment this morning. I think they
got very little sleep. He told me he thought they'd be ready to play. And play
well.  
You could tell Kimmie is not 100percent. Marcus, he's not 100percent. Both
those guys played well.  
  
Q. Phil had a great stat weekend, but he did a lot of things off the stat
sheet. Could you discuss some of the things he did that helped this team to
win this weekend?  
COACH HAITH: Obviously he gets us in offense. We talk about our offensive
execution. I think he's the main reason. He's the conductor. He's the
orchestrator.  
But also he was great defensively. He got his hands on a lot of loose balls.
Got steals. Those steals do show up on the stat column. But I think just his
leadership, his presence, and how he carried himself and the command he had
out there on the court, that gives your teammates confidence.  
He's in control. And if there's a‑‑ he's as good a point guard as there is in
the country. I can't imagine there being a better point guard than Phil
Pressey in the country.  
  
Q. Like myself, you're kind of a young guy, and I know this season ain't
done yet. But as you look back, what did you learn through the course of this
season, this tournament, 30 and 4, everything you've gone through, that will
make you a better coach in the years to come?  
COACH HAITH: Well, I think we all as people, as human beings, I think we're
all faced with adversity in our lives. And how you handle adversity will
determine how successful you're going to be.  
I think this team had a never‑quit attitude and stayed true to the course.
There's no question that I think our staff, our players did that. We stayed
true to the course.  
And we'll be happy what the end results are. Let's just stay focused on today
and not worry about tomorrow, and that's what this program, this team has
done.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2012

  

### [Quincy Acy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21881)

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  90  
Baylor  75

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with Coach Scott Drew.  
Coach, we'll call on you first for your thoughts on this afternoon's game.  
COACH DREW: I thought we defended, rebounded, worked the ball better
offensively in the first two games. Today we didn't. Credit Missouri. Pressure
defense, shot quick threes, didn't go into it.  
I think it's a good learning experience for our team, and because of this I
think it will prepare us for the NCAA Tournament. And at the end of the day
can't dwell about this loss. Gotta shake it off because tomorrow we find out
on who we're playing, where we're playing.  
The NCAA Tournament is you lose again, we know we're all done. So hopefully
we'll learn from some of the things that we should have done better or could
have done better.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you ‑‑ your team gained a lot of respect this week. Talk
about the character of your team not quitting, basically playing a road game
in the Big 12 tournament.   
COACH DREW: We really had three road games, Kansas, Kansas State and today.
But at the end of the day, I thought‑‑ I said it yesterday in the press
conference. I thought we grew up, but this was the next stage. And the next
stage is handling success and bouncing to the next level. I think we'll learn
some things from this game, and hopefully it will prepare us for the NCAA
Tournament, especially if we play a team that's guard‑oriented like this.  
THE MODERATOR: Our student‑athletes are Perry Jones III and Quincy Acy.  
Let's go to questions for them.  
  
Q. Quincy, how frustrating a day was it for you, and is it frustrating
playing Missouri? Seems like you guys kept getting close, getting close, and
they'd hit a shot or get to the foul line, and it just seemed like you guys
couldn't close a gap.  
QUINCY ACY: They did a great job of hitting shots. And we had some mental
mistakes on defense that cost us. So it's a good learning experience. But we
have to learn from it.  
  
Q. You guys have the size advantage. What did they do to keep you from
dominating in the paint?  
QUINCY ACY: I mean, they just shot.  
PERRY JONES III: A lot of penetration.  
  
Q. Perry, how difficult is it to keep up with that 4 guard offense? It just
seemed like they were lightning fast, getting down there on breaks.  
PERRY JONES III: I mean, they're a tough team to match up to, playing four
guards and one big. That's why they're one of the best in the country because
it's a hard matchup. They know how to play with each other, and just gotta
learn how to defend on the perimeter.  
No matter who it is, you've got to be able to defend them if you want to win
the championship.  
  
Q. You guys had a couple of the losses to Kansas and Missouri, and then you
lost tonight. You had a strong showing against kind of the de facto road
teams. Has there been ‑‑ has anyone been especially vocal in the practices
leading up to the games this week and what do you hope to improve on most
leading to the tournament?  
QUINCY ACY: Just some of the mistakes we had in this game and over the
tournament. It's better to have them now than‑‑ it's win or go home. So just
looking to learn off of this game.  
  
Q. Quincy and Perry, did it seem, though, that you never could quite gain
momentum to make a run in the second half, every time you seemed on the verge
‑‑ I'm thinking of A.J.'s basket that was waved off, a few other things, that
you couldn't quite get over the hump against Missouri in the second half until
at least late. What was the feeling like for you guys?  
QUINCY ACY: I mean, we just had to get stops. I mean, that's pretty much the
whole game. We had to get stops and we had to convert easies. That's it.  
  
Q. Quincy and then Perry, it seemed like the first five minutes of the
second half kind of set the tone. What did Missouri do during that time span,
and what should you have done to have responded to it?  
QUINCY ACY: We just have to communicate better on defense. I sound like a
broken record right now. We just had to get stops. That's pretty much what it
came down to, stops.  
I mean, we're going to learn from it. We're going to watch film so we'll be
prepared in the tournament.  
PERRY JONES III: Like he said, we gotta get stops. I mean, it's just plain and
simple. No stops, I mean, you're not going to win a championship that way. And
you've got to know how to stop the run and convert easies. That's it.  
  
Q. Quincy, how excited are you to begin the NCAA Tournament?  
QUINCY ACY: Very excited. I don't know where we'll be at. I guess we'll find
out tomorrow. So I will be excited tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Two things, what the players got asked about the first five minutes of
the second half, that seemed to pretty much set the tone. It also ‑‑ Pierre
and Quincy kind of struggled today, Quincy Acy. Without those two guys, how
difficult was it to get past Missouri?  
COACH DREW: I thought there were several times in the games where we had
layups or shots that we've hit that we missed, and they had some tough shots
that they‑‑ shot clock winding down, contested 3s. I mean, for them to shoot
43percent in three games in three days, I don't care if they were guarded or
not, that's hard to do. So they get a lot of credit for that.  
I thought, though, that we missed some opportunities that we haven't missed
before. And I don't know if guards just get looser quicker or what the reason.
But we came out flat in the first five minutes and the same thing in the
second. And seems like we weren't ready, we weren't loose in the beginning, or
maybe just credit them for playing so well in the beginning.  
  
Q. You had talked about shaking off this loss and preparing for the NCAA
Tournament. Do you start estimating where you might be seeded now and who the
matchups might be, or do you just kind of wait and see what happens on
Selection Sunday and just kind of react accordingly?  
COACH DREW: Actually, I haven't checked out anything or seen anything, because
I knew we needed to take care of business, and then that would take care of
itself.  
Just like everybody else, the fun will be tonight or tomorrow, once we stop
thinking about this, to start planning on where we're going and to try to
guess where we're going.  
I do want to say I think the Big 12 does an incredible job preparing the teams
for the NCAA and postseason. Because they run the tournament just like the
NCAA Tournament.  
So, I mean, for teams to move on now to the NCAA Tournament, they're not in
that shock and awe of how the rules are for a postseason, and for our team,
especially with three newcomers and one guy that's never been in postseason
starting, this hopefully will prepare us for that. And then we can enjoy a
celebration like that.  
  
Q. You said that this game hopefully would prepare you guys for the NCAAs,
but you probably aren't going to face a team like Missouri with four guards
that can play like they can and pass the ball and that sort of thing. Are they
just ‑‑ you know, a real unique team and a team that it's just really tough to
play just because of all those factors?  
COACH DREW: I think the biggest thing we haven't talked about is their
experience. Five seniors. They've been through situations like this. They've
been through‑‑ and with us, I guess the biggest thing is handling success of
playing well two days in a row, being able to be focused and ready for that
third day.  
And I think that's‑‑ in some of these instances, that's what‑‑ because you win
in the NCAA Tournament, as we all know, you have a lot of people
congratulating you, telling you how good you're doing and all that. And you
gotta push that aside and move on to the next game.  
And that's why I think, again, our losses this year made us a better team and
put us in a better situation to be ready for postseason.  
In the meantime, we've done it 27‑7\. Three losses to Missouri, two to Kansas,
and K‑State's a very well coached team and a very good team and Iowa State at
Iowa State. And they finished third in conference.  
So we haven't lost to teams we shouldn't lose to.  
  
Q. What did Missouri do to take away your size advantage on the inside?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think they baited us into some quick 3s, let's put it that
way. And we took the bait. So we needed to work the ball, get it down more and
try and get more shots in the paint. That's what we had talked about.  
But it didn't happen. So hopefully that's something we can learn from, so if
we play a team smaller like this again we can‑‑ we've been so patient on the
offensive end. This game, for some reason, we weren't as patient.  
And, let's face it, when you're down 10 points, you try to get it back
quicker. If you're up 10, you tend to slow it down more and that had something
to do with it.  
  
Q. Was there something that you saw in the matchup? Was it foul trouble that
Deuce played this much and talk about his contribution today?  
COACH DREW: I think Deuce was tremendous today. He was fresh. And the second
thing is defensively, I mean, Phil Pressey is really good. I mean, he's really
good. And he does so much for that team.  
So we just tried to put a fresher body on him and Deuce is doing a good job on
him, and he has length. But Phil really sets up so much for that team.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked in the past about changing the looks up on defense, but
looked like tonight you seemed mostly man. Can you talk about what led to your
decision to do that?  
COACH DREW: That's where you‑‑ after a loss, right away you start thinking
four or five different things you could have done, should have done, might
have tried. And you saw in the beginning, we didn't move well, first five
minutes. And I just got worried if we went to a zone we'd get even more
stagnant.  
So that's why we stayed with the man. If we had to do it again we probably
would have tried it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  81  
Kansas  72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Bill Self, and
his two student‑athletes Tyshawn Taylor and Jeff Withey.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SELF: I don't think that we played particularly well in any facet. But I
thought Baylor, of course, they shot the ball great from deep, and they made
their free throws.  
We let them get comfortable early, which isn't a good sign when you're playing
a really talented team. And even though we didn't play particularly well, you
know, we took a lead and when we had a chance to have some good possessions
both ends we just didn't get it done.  
So they were better than us tonight, no question.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, can you talk about the 18 ‑3 run that got you back in the game,
kind of what turned for you guys at that point?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I mean, we started playing how we play. We started moving the
ball. We started defending a little bit. They were taking tough shots, and we
were making some.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, was the fact they played more man, was that part of the issue
tonight from the first two games?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: Not at all. I would have rathered them play man, honestly. I
don't think that was it at all. I think defensively we didn't play our best.
They rebounded the ball well, and they made big shots when they needed to.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, for a guy like you who plays 38 or 40minutes a game, you guys
played 33 times this year. You're going to be a 1 or a 2 seed. Is there any
benefit to the rest, to the day off, heading into the NCAA Tournament? I'm
sure it's hard to think about now, but is there any benefit to it?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I think it will help. I rather would have been playing
tomorrow. But a day off, I think it might help.  
  
Q. Tyshawn and Jeff, couple of weeks ago after you played Missouri, Coach
had expressed concern about this team being able to get key stops. Do you feel
like tonight's defensive performance offered an example that that's still a
trouble spot for this team?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I mean, tonight we didn't get the stops we needed tonight. We
left a shooter a couple of times and he made some big shots. I mean, when the
game is that close and in that situation, we can't leave the best shooter on
the court. And, I mean, we did.  
But I don't think that's what the game came down to. I think it kind of‑‑ it
came down to everything. Us not rebounding the ball, us not defending from the
beginning. Us doing a lot of things that we shouldn't have done.  
JEFF WITHEY: I don't think it came down to‑‑ it wasn't the last couple of
minutes that really killed us. We put ourselves in a hole the first half by‑‑
we never let a team outscore us really in the first half by that much or even
get to 43points.  
We just put ourselves in a hole. And we tried digging ourselves out of it. But
at the end it just wasn't enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When Heslip's man left him to help out, is that what happened and should
he have not done that?  
COACH SELF: Yeah, the whole deal on Heslip is the most we're ever going to
leave him is to bluff at the ball and get back to him. We made two critical
mistakes. Critical.  
But you can't just put it on Travis, because maybe if we got through the back
screen‑‑ I gotto watch the tape‑‑ maybe if we got through the back screen
quicker on the back screen fade screen plan they ran, maybe we could have
released and got to the shooter quicker. I don't know. I'll have to watch the
tape. But that definitely went against the scouting report.  
  
Q. Thomas set out for a lot of the first half. How much was due to foul
trouble and he had the two fouls early, and looked like he might also be
sitting, because you knew you'd need him for a lot in the second half and also
in the front court, maybe expose some of the perceived lack of depth up there
behind him and Jeff. So what are you looking to see in practice between now
and the first of the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH SELF: Well, the reason Thomas came out was because of two fouls. But
let's call it like it is. Withey and Young were our best guys the first half.
That wasn't the reason. We cut it to four shooting free throws. And they end
up going up eight when we had a chance to do some things. We just had so many
bad possessions.  
But certainly the foul situation was the biggest reason why he came out.  
  
Q. What's the most disappointing aspect of this? Was it the way you guys
played. They just beat you?  
COACH SELF: No, they beat us. Make no mistake about that. They beat us. But
the thing that was most disappointing to me, I thought we played a style that
is just good enough to get your butt beat. Average energy. Let them pass it
wherever they want to. Never dictate a tempo defensively. Crappy traps on the
post. Couldn't remember scouting report.  
There were some things that happened tonight. And then also we didn't rebound
the ball. Those are man plays or whatever. I thought even though the battle of
the boards was even, it was totally identical. I don't think anybody thought
watching the game that we controlled the glass. I think the perception would
be is they controlled it.  
So I think that if we can't make other teams play bad, then we're not going to
advance very far in the NCAA Tournament. And we certainly didn't make Baylor
play poorly at all.  
  
Q. Some of the guys said after you guys made that run in the second half
that they were really feeling it. They looked up at the clock. There was still
ten minutes left. Did you see any of that down the stretch of just like some
tired legs?  
COACH SELF: We talked about that in the timeouts. But Baylor played as many
minutes last night as we did. I ain't buying any of that stuff. If you're
tired in that particular situation, then the reason you're probably tired is
because your mind or your preparation level is such that it allows you to be
tired.  
When guys are geeked up and playing like the last possession of the‑‑ the last
possession you're going to play of your life, you don't get tired.  
So there were some things I think that happened tonight that probably showed a
lack of toughness on our part which allowed us to be soft on key possessions.
Fatigue being one of them.  
  
Q. What's your experience going into the tournament off of winning the Big
12 versus coming in off of a disappointing loss like this, how do you turn
that around, I guess?  
COACH SELF: We can practice‑‑ I'm not sure Ty's going to get his wish on the
day off tomorrow. But we'll go back to practicing. We gotta guard. We don't
guard. Let's just call it like it is. We don't guard. This has to be a team
that makes other people play poorly.  
And I've said this many times. Defense, offense, you just don't say, okay,
we're going to start doing this and it's going to‑‑ the light's going to come
on tomorrow. It has to be a mindset. And certainly we have some key players
that aren't doing that right now.  
So you don't have to kill them in practice, but practice an hour and work on
certain things.  
But this tonight to me hurts, because anytime you lose it hurts. But it's
not‑‑ if it makes us better next week, then it wasn't a bad loss. So if it
doesn't make us better, then it's a bad loss.  
And so we've usually recovered pretty good and responded pretty well to not
playing well, losing a game, so hopefully that will be the case again.  
  
Q. Is there any relief in not having to play Missouri again and deal with
all the emotion that goes into a game like that?  
COACH SELF: Zero.  
  
Q. Kind of staying on that topic, you all right with how the rivalry ended
this year?  
COACH SELF: I've never said I was all right with the rivalry ending. I never
said that. I'd like for it to go on. It's just not going to.  
But I would rather be playing Saturday regardless of who we're playing, who we
would be playing against, whether it be Texas or Missouri. But I didn't come
over here thinking about the rivalry or anything like that. What we were
trying to do was just win the day and focus on whatever would be the case
tomorrow.  
So we had two epic games with them this year. Two epic games. And it's
unfortunate it's going to end.  
  
Q. Do you agree with Tyshawn and Jeff that the game was lost because of
things the guys did not do during the first half, or did it come down to not
being able to make the key plays, especially defensive plays, in the last few
minutes?  
COACH SELF: Yes, on all fronts. We let them get comfortable the first half.
But, I mean, it was a horse contest, guys shooting slush shots.  
But, you're right, regardless of the situation, it's like a tennis match, you
gotta win certain points. And we didn't win the key points down the stretch.
They won them all. Sure, I think that had a lot to do with not getting key
stops, absolutely.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Kim English](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20804)

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  81  
Texas  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Missouri Tigers, Coach Frank
Haith, student‑athletes Kim English, Ricardo Ratliffe, and Phil Pressey.  
Coach, congratulations on tonight's victory. Your thoughts.  
COACH HAITH: Good hard‑fought game. I thought it was a very competitive,
physical Big 12 basketball game. Proud of our kids.  
We played really together on the offensive end. I thought we were solid on the
defensive end.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Phil or Ricardo, because I don't think Kim will answer it, have you guys
ever ‑‑ is this the best you've seen Kim play these last two games
individually?  
PHIL PRESSEY: No, he's hitting shots. When he gets hot, I mean, there's not
much you can do. We see that every day in practice. He stays after late, and
it's paying off for him.  
  
Q. Phil, you've talked a lot this year about defense kind of picking their
poison. Did you sense early you had open jump shots from Texas, and I mean
when the first couple went down, how confident did you get?  
PHIL PRESSEY: Well, I usually try to get a feel for the game and see how teams
are going to play me, because some teams tend to play me for the pass. Some
teams tend to just let me shoot.  
So I just took what the offense gave me. My teammates were confident in me to
hit those shots, so I'm just going to take them.  
  
Q. Talk about what happened in the second half with your thigh and how is it
feeling now?  
KIM ENGLISH: I just was coming off a cut, an offensive action that we had been
doing all game. And he shot the gap, and his knee hit my quad pretty hard. And
just got to get treatment tonight.  
I'll be fine for tomorrow. It's the championship. It's the Big 12.  
  
Q. For any of you, I know I've seen on Twitter the hashtag "businesstrip,"
and it seems like you guys really have kind of narrowed your focus here as
you've come here. For any one of you, just talk about how you are approaching
this tournament right now as that business trip and kind of how this whole
entire thing came about?  
KIM ENGLISH: That's how it's been all year. We've really been dialed in what
we have to do in the process.  
I feel like I'm really redundant with that word. But we really, truly have
been focusing on each game and, to dive deeper in that, each possession. We
want to get the best shot each time down court and try our best to get a stop,
and then with a rebound each time down court.  
It is a business trip. Every game is about business. Every road trip is about
business. And we came to Kansas City to take care of business. And we're in
the position where we expect it to be.  
  
Q. Right before you got a hit, I think you said: They can't guard me. I was
wondering if you thought that it was a little cheap and maybe in response?  
KIM ENGLISH: I didn't say that. I didn't say that.  
  
Q. Well, then, a follow ‑up. You said coming in here that‑‑ when asked about
playing Kansas, you said you'd play Fort Hays State to win the Big 12. Now
that you're there, is it a little‑‑ do you wish you were playing KU or are you
happy playing Baylor?  
KIM ENGLISH: Again, we would have played Texas Tech, Iowa State, Oklahoma
State, Baylor, Texas, anybody. We just wanted to win the Big 12. We played
Baylor to beat them my freshman year to win the Big 12 tournament.  
We knew that was going to be a big game. Our coaches didn't come here early to
scout Kansas. They came here to see what both teams do. And we were prepared
to beat Baylor tomorrow and try our best. We came here just wanting to win the
Big 12 Championship, no matter who it was against. We knew a bunch of teams
could have been in this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kim, you've joked, mentioned a couple times about nobody in the Big 12 is
rooting for you guys, that kind of thing. Just hoping to get your thoughts
along those lines for tomorrow's game with that on the line and what other
people might be thinking.  
KIM ENGLISH: We're focused on people that's in our locker room, the people
that support our program. The fans in the state of Missouri. That's who we
want to win this championship for. We don't care about the Big 12 not
supporting us or whatever you said.  
We're really focusing on doing this for the people that do support us, for our
coach, for our seniors, for our young guys, for the entire state of Missouri.  
  
Q. Kim and Ricardo and Phil, going back to what Kim said about taking care
of business, is it difficult to stay focused on what you're here to do with
all the stuff that's going on with the other tournaments and everything?  
KIM ENGLISH: No. Absolutely not. First and foremost, we get back and dive into
the things we could have did better in our game and our preparation for our
next game begins immediately.  
And then all of that next day how we're going to execute. All the other stuff
is fun, because we are basketball fans, so it's great watching the Big East
game and the Big Ten and ACC games. But our number one focus is our game every
night.  
RICARDO RATLIFFE: Not at all. I mean, we watch basketball just because that's
the sport that we play. We're not really focused on it like the Big East, ACC
tournament. We enjoy watching it just because it's other DivisionI basketball.
But we just focused on the Big 12 right now, which is playing Baylor tomorrow.  
PHIL PRESSEY: To piggyback what they said, us as a team, we're trying to focus
on the next game, because if you lose that next game, then everything else is
impossible. We're trying to take one game at a time. If you do that, you'll be
successful.  
We're just trying to take one game at a time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I'm curious if you were pulling for Kansas to win today, and if there's
any sadness that the title game isn't with you guys?  
COACH HAITH: That's a really tough question. No, I don't care who we play. All
right? We're happy to be in the championship game. And that's all we concern
ourselves with. It's a great opportunity.  
We got here. We talked about winning championships. We had an opportunity to
do that earlier in the year in the CBE Classic. That was the championship. We
have an opportunity to play with the Big 12 Championship, regardless of who
we're playing against.  
  
Q. What do you think it says about where your team is right now that your
one guy who is a First ‑Team All‑Big 12er, Marcus Denmon, can go 0‑10 and you
guys can be in control of the game basically the whole way and win by 14?  
COACH HAITH: I've said it all year about the team. And I think that's a great
example of a ball club that's a team. And we don't ever want to be‑‑ and
Marcus Denmon is our leading scorer, but we have other really good players on
this team.  
Flip had one of those nights. He was shooting the ball extremely well, and
then obviously Kimmy was outstanding and Ricardo got going late. We've got
other guys who can score the ball. We put five guys out there, all those guys
can have a big game.  
  
Q. I don't know if I've ever seen a group look so visibly focused on the
goal at hand. I feel like they should have been wearing suits with you
afterwards with the way they're treating this. Talk to me about how they're
approaching this and how excited that makes you. And at the same time, despite
that cold ‑blooded look on their face, how much fun they're having doing what
they're doing?  
COACH HAITH: I think it's a fine line. You want them to have fun and enjoy
what they're doing because they've got a tremendous opportunity to play a
sport that they've grown up playing all their lives under the bright lights.  
But you want them to stay focused on the task at hand. And these guys have all
bought into that. And I know Kim sounds like a broken record, but all these
guys do in terms of the process.  
They've really bought into that. They bought into preparation and they bought
into focusing on doing the little things every single game.  
  
Q. With regard to that, with Kim, it looked like his demeanor looked a
little bit even more stern or something tonight. Have you seen something in
him in the last couple of days about how he's looking at this tournament?  
COACH HAITH: He's been really focused. I think he's been focused all year. But
obviously I can sense that he's really determined. And the way he's played the
last few days has been unbelievable in terms of just shooting the ball.  
But he's been outstanding all over the court.  
  
Q. The old cliche about playing your best basketball at the end of the
season, do you think this is the best basketball your team has played all
year? And, if so, do you have another level you can possibly get to?  
COACH HAITH: We're playing really good. I think the one area‑‑ and Texas is
such a really good offensive rebounding team. I think they really emphasize
that. They went after us. But we've got to continue to rebound the ball.  
But we're playing really good. We're executing. We're not turning the ball
over offensively and we're not just taking a bunch of 3s, we're executing,
getting good shots.  
I thought our defense has been good the last two days. We played really good
defense. The only thing we've got to continue to do is rebound the ball.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the post play. It looked like maybe the biggest
difference between this game and the game you two played in Columbia, it may
have been Chapman. Looked like defensively he was doing a better job on
Ricardo, and obviously he got a lot of rebounds. At the same time Ricardo
ended up with a strong game numbers ‑wise and contributed a lot, especially
the second half.   
COACH HAITH: Ricardo had a double‑double, 18 and 18, outstanding night. We'll
take that every night. I think he was outstanding. And I think Steve gave us
really big minutes, too.  
Steve was outstanding for his 14minutes he played. And but Chapman has had a
really good career. I think they wanted to‑‑ based on how the game played out,
they were emphasizing getting the ball inside. And I think they wanted to
attack us in the paint, and obviously he had 13 clips. And I think they made a
concerted effort to get the ball inside to him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Congratulations.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  81  
Texas  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Texas Longhorns, Coach Rick
Barnes and his two student‑athletes Myck Kabongo and J'Covan Brown.  
COACH BARNES: I thought the game started and obviously we needed to really
grind on them and put the ball inside and make them play defense. And I
thought early in the game we really were moving the ball, then it starts
sticking a little bit, other than the fact we turned the ball over some, just
where we needed to be a little bit tougher with the ball, they knocked the
ball out of our hands.  
When Pressey, Phil's making those 3s, he's as tough any guy to guard because
we‑‑ couple different ways in the first half we were trying to go under it a
little bit. And actually wanted him to shoot some of them. Then I think people
would see why it's hard to double team him, because he did such a terrific job
seeing the floor.  
I think Missouri does as good a job as any team I've seen in a long time in
terms of sharing the ball, moving the ball. When they get you to spread out,
they not only make the first extra pass, but they'll make the next one, the
next one, and the next one.  
But our team's grown up a lot. And a team like Missouri gives you very, very
small margin of error guarding them. But when they're shooting the ball or
he's shooting the ball, it really makes it extremely tough on your defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. J'Covan, what happened to your head there?  
J'COVAN BROWN: I banged it in the camera, hit my head, and just my neck got
stiff on me. So just battling that right now. But I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Myck, what do you feel like you guys got out of these two games here as
far as moving on?  
MYCK KABONGO: We're improving. Improved every step of the way. I think we're
taking strides the right way. We didn't back down at the end of the game even
though it slipped away from us. Everyone kept fighting, had something good to
work for.  
And we're going to go back and work hard and get ready for whatever's next for
us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Are missed shots almost like turnovers against those guys, the way they
kind of just take it and go?  
COACH BARNES: Yes. That was a big thing that we talked about earlier, we did
not want to take quick early shots.  
We did that two or three times in the first half, and they converted all three
of them back, either layups, they're excellent in the open floor, and
obviously they're an offense‑minded basketball team. So you want to make them
defend so you don't get layups. And really I think against those guys you've
got to run, and there's no question you gotta go after them inside.  
I mean, we got 20 offensive rebounds. When you get 20 offensive rebounds, we
should shoot better than 42percent from the floor. So we were‑‑ and when we
drove it hard, good things happened. Then we got down, thought we started
reaching too much on defense.  
They went five trips where they got to the foul line. And the crew, I'm sure,
there were five fouls. I don't have any problem with that because I could see
we were reaching not doing what we needed to do.  
A team like Missouri, they don't need help. They really don't. You've got to
be solid against them. And we got away from it, when we actually got the
movement we wanted to go at them inside. The ball starts sticking, where we
just stop moving the ball and got careless. I go back to the first half they
just knocked the ball out of our hands. That's where we've got to be tougher
with the ball.  
But if you do miss, believe me, it's in an early situation they capitalize
against any team you play against.  
  
Q. A lot of Missouri fans have been saying that the Tigers were playing with
a special purpose this tournament, since they're about to go to the SEC and
there's been some things said from some other schools about blaming them for
all the problems in the conference. Did you notice that they seemed to have
any special fire or any special motivation?  
COACH BARNES: I don't think that's the reason. I think people on the outside
come up with all kind of reasons to do whatever. I think that a year ago, you
really dig deep inside, it was a group of guys.  
And this is just me from an outside coach perspective. And I mean this
sincerely. I've never talked to Frank Haith about it, the chemistry wasn't the
same. I'm not taking a shot at anybody about any of that.  
I think these guys have gotten older. Look at their team. They're an older
group of guys. They don't have many guys to play from the very beginning. When
you watched them from the time they started, you knew there was something
about them.  
And you can't‑‑ and, again, I think it's the players. I don't know‑‑ I think
it always comes from within the players. But I don't think that those guys
could care less what league they're in, when they start playing basketball. I
really don't. I think they've got themselves into a position where they want
to win. I think they know they're capable of beating anybody. I don't think
that's their motivation.  
I think they want to have a chance to play, they're playing for a championship
tomorrow, and they're going to have a chance because of the kind of year
they've had to have a great seed, play for another one.  
But, again, I don't think that's the reason they have done what they've done
this year.  
  
Q. Rick, at this point in the season, where would you say this team is as
far as what your expectations were and where you're at right now?  
COACH BARNES: You know, I'm proud of our team. I really am. I think where we
were, and I've talked about it. This team has continued to improve. And I
actually talked to them at the end of the game tonight in the locker room. I
said: Okay, we've played 33 games. What do we know about ourselves?  
And it's obvious we know we played hard. And that was the one thing I said at
the beginning of the year, would this mean new players, there was a couple of
things we're going to have to do in terms of trying to do them well. And one
of them was establishing a work ethic. And the attitude that we're going to go
out and compete every single night. And for the most part I think that we did
that.  
And I think that when we didn't play as well is‑‑ tonight a little bit we got
away from our game plan. And it's such a fine line. And last night we were
much better with it. But as you watched the tape from last night, we were in
some pretty good position‑wise, but I'm sure if you're Iowa State, they look
at why were we careless with the ball. I thought last night we took care of
the ball. Tonight at the start of the game we were careless with the ball. We
knew it was going to be different a little bit.  
That's the things you don't understand. But we know we've improved. We know
that we're going to fight. And I am proud of this team. I really am, because
they had no clue what they were getting into when they came to Texas a year
ago, and some of them not even that much.  
And you look at a team that our losses‑‑ I'm looking here. We've got 13
losses, three to Missouri, two Kansas, two of them to Baylor. So that's, what,
three‑‑ what is that? Help me out. Seven losses. Seven of the 13 losses are to
teams that are mentioned as 1, 2, 3 seeds. But we've improved. We've gotten
better.  
I still think on any given night if we do what we're capable of doing, we can
beat anybody. I really truly believe that.  
  
Q. Your games with Missouri and Baylor, they were so close. Do you think if
you would have won one of those games the team might have reacted differently
and played with more confidence the rest of the year?  
COACH BARNES: You know, that's a good question. It's a good question. It's
actually a great question. I don't know. I don't know. Because the way we
reacted, you know, what I know that we were‑‑ our guys were devastated. That's
the word I would use after the Missouri game at home. I think they were
devastated after the Kansas game. And I think they were devastated after the
Baylor game.  
But what they did each time, they shook it off and they came back and they've
tried to get better. And who knows. You know, sometimes with young guys,
there's also‑‑ they might get a false sense of whatever.  
So I don't know, but it's a great question. I would have liked to have seen
that and found out. But the fact is‑‑ I don't think our team lacks confidence.
I think a lot of it is experience. I do. I think that's a lot of it. And
understanding just how a fine a line it is.  
You go back and look tonight, you go take away those transition‑‑ and forget
the fact that they made 3s. I mean, in the first half it was really the
transition baskets that put us in a hole. And it's because of lack of
execution on the offensive end. It wasn't‑‑ I mean the 3s are going to do
that. But it's those plays that kill us. Killed us. And they're good. I mean,
those guys are good.  
And, I mean, I love watching them play because of the way they share the ball.
I really do.  
  
Q. When you see the moments of lack of execution, is there a common
denominator? Mental breakdowns? Is it just ‑‑  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, guys hold the ball. They stop the ball from moving. You've
got to move the ball.  
Again, you can learn a lot about just watching them as you prepare for other
teams. I kept talking to our team today and last night about not only did they
make the extra pass, they'll make one more and one more. They really move the
ball and they really stick the ball. The ball doesn't stick. They really move
it. We bog down because we break out of it too easy in terms of just
understanding simple ball movement, and we started standing.  
And we need to be a team that moves the ball‑‑ because I do think when we
drive it hard, tonight, every time we drove it, something‑‑ hard. Not soft.
Because when we drove it hard, we went in, got a lot of offensive rebounds.
And, I mean, it's pretty simple. They don't want you to drive it at them. They
don't want you to throw it inside.  
But the fact you got 20 offensive rebounds, we should have gotten more out of
that than we did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  81  
Kansas  72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Baylor Bears. We have Coach Scott
Drew. The student‑athletes will be here shortly.  
Comments on tonight's victory.  
COACH DREW: First of all, very pleased with our guys from the standpoint we've
been successful against Kansas before in spurts, and then they would have a
spurt that we wouldn't be able to answer a run.  
And tonight you knew they were going to make a run. When they took the lead, I
was really pleased with the poise our guys had and the togetherness,
character, we didn't have to call timeouts, and those guys just played through
it and really did a great job in reestablishing and getting us the lead back.  
And for three first‑year‑college guys and one second‑year, I think they grew
up a little bit tonight.  
That's the great thing about playing in the 12, if you don't have that during
the regular season, you're not seasoned and ready when postseason comes.  
So that's the great thing about this league.  
THE MODERATOR: Question for Coach.  
  
Q. Scott, Brady had a couple of big 3s out there. Can you tell how y'all set
those up?  
COACH DREW: I think one of them was a play. Another one I think his teammates
created an opportunity. He did a great job moving without the basketball. And
at the end of the day 16 assists, nine turnovers, that can win you a lot of
games.  
I think we took really good care of the basketball, and because of that found
the open guys. We had six in double figures. I thought just a great team
effort.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the student‑athletes Perry Jones III, Pierre
Jackson, and Quincy Acy. Questions for student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Quincy, can you talk about the offensive rebound off the missed free
throw, how big was that, and how were you able to get inside there?  
QUINCY ACY: Never assume a miss. It's been cases in the regular season where
I've done the same thing. I just never assume a miss and I always try to
outwork the person that's trying to guard me.  
  
Q. Pierre, you guys go 0 ‑4 against Kansas, Missouri in the regular season,
looked like a different team tonight. What did you feel like was the
difference between those games and what you're doing now?   
PIERRE JACKSON: I think we're just all more focused and playing as a team.
Once we all are clicking like that, we're hard to beat. We know what time of
the year it is. So just trying to get a Big 12 Championship.  
  
Q. Pierre or Quincy, are you guys ‑‑ there's some presumption in this
question, but if Missouri wins this next game, are you guys ready for the rest
of the Big 12 to be rooting for you tomorrow?  
QUINCY ACY: I mean, we're ready for an away game. We're in their state, we
know it's going to be tough.  
But that's the same with all the teams we've played so far. So it's the same,
really.  
  
Q. For any of you, was it motivation that this final in this tournament was
supposed to be KU versus Missouri according to most everybody?  
QUINCY ACY: Well, yeah. I mean, we had‑‑ to ourselves we had a disappointing
conference. We felt we should have did a lot better. I mean, we knew that was
going to be it. But you never want to get disrespected.  
So we came in with an axe to grind and with the mindset to win every game.  
  
Q. Perry, can you talk about ‑‑ Coach mentioned it‑‑ the way you all
responded. I think Kansas had like an 18‑3 run. Finally took the lead. Can you
talk about the way you all responded down the stretch?  
PERRY JONES III: Just trying to defend a lot better. They're a great team.
When they get on runs, it's hard to stop them. So just trying to get rebounds
and trying to get second‑chance points. And just trying to keep them out of
the paint as much as possible. Because they're one of the best in the country
at getting to the paint.  
  
Q. Perry, it seemed like they were switching between Robinson and Withey on
you. Were you surprised to see Withey on you a bunch down the stretch?  
PERRY JONES III: No, I wasn't. That's the way they run their defense. They
felt like they needed to switch back and forth, and that's what they did. But
not at all.  
  
Q. Did you feel more comfortable going against Withey?  
PERRY JONES III: I mean, I felt the same. He's one of the top shot blockers in
the nation. And he's a shot blocker in the nation because he blocked shots.
That's what he does best. But, I mean‑‑  
COACH DREW: It's that Baylor education.  
PERRY JONES III: I'm not sure. I don't know how to answer it.  
  
Q. Pierre and Quincy, can you guys just talk a little bit about what A.J.
brought, it's two games in a row he's really stepped up pretty big for you
guys, double figures and other issues.  
PIERRE JACKSON: A.J.'s‑‑ y'all know this, he's a great defender, but he can
also score the ball. He's showing that. And he has a lot to prove, and he's
just coming up big for us. And he decided to keep his confidence up, and he
helps us out on the other end too, keeping everybody's confidence up and
staying positive.  
  
Q. Pierre or Perry, could you talk about 3 ‑pointers can change momentum a
lot. But just the three that Brady hit and a couple off the scrambles, just
what kind of feeling was it like on the court, what kind of lift did that give
you guys?  
PIERRE JACKSON: A big lift. Whenever Brady puts a shot up, we all think it's
going in. So I'm glad he had the confidence to take it. I'm glad he hit both
of those big 3s. We needed them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Scott, is there a story about how you found Brady up in Canada?  
COACH DREW: Actually, no. Just he was transferring and somebody that wasn't
really highly touted and came to Baylor, lost 24pounds. Worked really hard.
Got an unbelievable work ethic.  
His uncle is Jay Triano, the former coach of the Raptors, so he's got some
basketball in his family. His uncle is supposedly the Bob Cousy of Canadian
basketball. Good bloodline and a very hard worker. He's by the hometown of our
athletic director, Ian McCaw, so that probably sealed the deal.  
  
Q. You guys pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the Mizzou ‑Kansas
rivalry tonight. Curious, how does that feel? I'm curious, what do you think
college basketball is missing now that that's gone away?  
COACH DREW: I think it's unfortunate that a lot of rivalries have disappeared
because of realignment, and I think every fan should be saddened.  
And I think from a personal standpoint I think people make decisions thinking
they're going to keep rivalries and get to do other things, and sometimes that
doesn't work out.  
So I feel bad for the fans.  
  
Q. Talk about after the subs you put Quincy Miller on Jeff Withey and then
either rotated Perry or Quincy to guard Robinson. Talk about the decision to
have Miller guard Withey.  
COACH DREW: I think no matter who you guard you're in for a tough assignment,
and both of them played extremely well against us. I thought Quincy Miller was
extremely efficient tonight, 18minutes, 13 and 8. So I thought he did a great
job.  
  
Q. Between Robert Griffin and Kim Mulkey's team and yours, is there just
something in the water this year or the uniforms, or what the heck is it for
Baylor?  
COACH DREW: I think, first of all, we're blessed. We have outstanding
Christian leadership from Ian McCaw, President Starr, they've upgraded the
facilities.  
One thing about Baylor is‑‑ people ask how you get kids. And whenever they
come on campus, like most places, everyone's got good people, but I think
Baylor, for some reason, people just feel part of the family. It's made
recruiting a lot easier.  
Once you get some good players, as we all know, players want to play with
players, and we're blessed because we not only have good players, but they're
good people. So now people want to come be teammates with them.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH DREW: We'll find out. I like them right now.  
  
Q. Two parts. One, Kansas took the lead late, 58 ‑56\. Just talk about how
your team responded to that. And then, secondly, Quincy scored to go up 13 and
you called a quick timeout. I wonder what that was about. That was earlier in
the second half.   
COACH DREW: Right. I think we had some tired people. And normally players give
up more on the defensive end when they're tired than they do on the offensive
end. They seem to get fresher when they've got the ball in their hands. So I
just wanted to try to regroup, make sure we could get back to focus and try to
get some defensive stops.  
And then I thought that this was really a night that helped us grow up. We've
won close games all year long against KU and Missouri, and I think they've
made runs that we haven't had answers for.  
And I think tonight when the crowd was going and Kansas was going, again, when
you got three first‑year‑college guys and one second‑year, talented, yes, but
experience is something that you can't replace. And I think, again, playing in
the Big 12 during the year has helped prepare us and make us better.  
Earlier in the year we never had a game of 16 assists, nine turnovers.  
  
Q. Scott, these last two games, are they the best two games you think your
team's played this season?  
COACH DREW: They would be up there, but we've played some really good teams in
the non‑conference, and we had some really good games. And those teams might
have even played better basketball. Our West Virginia game at that time they
were playing really well.  
I mean, I put them up there, but I can't say they're our best as far as‑‑
actually, you know what, execution‑wise it's definitely the best as far as the
guts that‑‑ that ‑‑ to get wins early in the year is tough to do with a young
team. So that's why it makes it kind of hard to say it was better
execution‑wise. No question. Our best execution the last two games was much
better than earlier this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Elijah Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22852)

### [Thomas Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22142)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  83  
Texas A&M  66

  
COACH SELF: Well, it was a good win. I don't know if we played great, but we
shot great. And I thought we actually did a pretty good job guarding them
except on the defensive boards.  
But it was good. And, of course, Elijah kind of got us over the hump there in
the first half. And then Thomas played consistently well the second half. I
think he had 13 the second half to kind of carry us.  
But it was a good team effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How hard is it to beat a team three times in one season?  
THOMAS ROBINSON: I'd say extremely hard. All because of the scouting report,
they pretty much know you pretty well by the time you get to them the third
time, so everything has to be on point pretty much by the time you get back to
them, especially in postseason.  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: I think that it can be easy or it can be hard. It's about how
you go about it. If you pay attention to how you played them the first two
games, it can be quite easy. But if you just take it for granted and think
that the third time is going to happen like the first two times, that's when
teams get you. You try to focus and make sure the third time we do everything
we did the first two times.  
  
Q. Elijah, this is your second big game this year against A &M. Is there
just something about the way they play defense that you're able to take
advantage of?  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: I don't know. I remember before the first time we played
them‑‑ no, the second time, we went down to College Station, Coach made a
comment to me. And he made one today, about how I was shooting the ball. I
don't know if it's just because he said it, but I just felt good today, just
felt real good.  
Everything I let go just felt like it was going in, nowhere else, even off
balance or however it went.  
But I think Coach kind of gave me a couple of words I needed to hear after
going through what I went through and just trying to refocus and just be
ready.  
  
Q. Thomas, if you wouldn't mind me asking was Jayla here and, if so, have
you spoken to her a lot about these last couple of weeks, what it's been like
for her to see you play and have some success?  
THOMAS ROBINSON: No, she was not here tonight, actually, because of school.
And I'll talk with her. She's happy for me. That's pretty much it with that.  
  
Q. Elijah, was there one point in the game where you knew you were starting
to feel it after a few shots or did you just know it kind of going?  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: Yeah, after the first shot that I made after‑‑ I know the
second shot I made after they blew the whistle, I didn't shoot it great in
warmup, but I didn't pay too much mind. But after the second shot that I made
after the whistle, I told Tyshawn it felt great, and he took advantage of it.
He came to me whenever he could and Conner did, too.  
Thomas actually threw me a couple of passes that got me going. Without that I
wouldn't have had a chance. My teammates got me going because they started
out, actually was feeling the rhythm of the game.  
  
Q. Thomas, I don't know if you were able to see much of the Baylor game
earlier today, but tomorrow, of course, you're going up against Perry Jones
and that squad. NBA scouts will be watching it closely. I'm not sure if you're
going to be matched up with him individually, but if you saw any of that game
or about that matchup, matchup obviously the team's done well this year?  
THOMAS ROBINSON: No, I didn't even hear about it until you said something. All
I know is we play Baylor tomorrow. That's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Bill, about Elijah's game, could you talk about the ball movement that
led to those two 3s that got you going?  
COACH SELF: You know, his first two shots he took were right after the whistle
blew, he made both of those. He really had a chance to have a monster game.  
But I thought that after we were stale early offensively obviously, but I
thought after we kind of‑‑ the 12‑minute timeout or something like that, I
thought the ball moved pretty well. And the way they played, they trapped off
different people, but a lot of times they came off of a guard to trap and we
were able to make some extra passes. And I don't know if he benefited from
that as much. But certainly they played to make us beat them from the
perimeter, and he was able to do that.  
  
Q. Can you kind of let us in on what you talked to him about before the
game? And with a streaky shooter like that, do you have to pick your moment to
have that kind of conversation?  
COACH SELF: No, not really. What he's talking about, his uncle passed middle
of last week and services were Tuesday. So his family wanted him home. So he
left Sunday and came back Tuesday night late. So he was away from the team for
three days.  
And so we‑‑ that's what he was talking about. But yesterday when I was
watching him practice, I felt like it looked as pure as it looked all year
long to me. I told him that. But that‑‑ trust me, that didn't have anything to
do with him making shots today.  
But I think he was very confident today, kind of like he was last time we
played in College Station.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the way that they played you packing the paint and
wanting you to beat them from the perimeter, is that the way you think a lot
of teams will play you in the postseason?  
COACH SELF: It depends on who we play and how they play. I think it's good‑‑
this was an interesting deal for us today. It's very minor, but they started
small. So in the NCAA Tournament you're going to play‑‑ like tomorrow we'll
play against two bigs, but in the NCAA Tournament, the first‑round game for
sure, you're going to play against a perimeter 4‑man. They started Middleton
at the 4. That was good for us. Made me nervous, but it was good for us.  
And kind of us adjusting to how we play that way. But I don't think teams this
point moving forward‑‑ I don't think that teams necessarily change who they
are just for scout reports. They may double off a guy or something like that,
but I think teams are going to play the way they played all year long for the
most part.  
  
Q. You shot 61percent. Was it something you saw in their defense, the
scouting report, or your team just had an abnormal great shooting night?  
COACH SELF: Well, don't call it abnormal. We've actually made shots before.
But going 10 of 15 from 3‑‑ you know, there's been numerous times we've shot a
high percentage, but we get a lot of layups. Today we got a lot of open looks
from D.  
But I don't think there was anything‑‑ A&M statistically is as good as any
team in our league defensively. And they don't give up points.  
Rather than us talking about our shooting percentage, the most amazing thing
is we got 83 on them when we didn't get off to a good start at all.  
But there's nothing that was‑‑ one thing that's helped us is Loubeau gets two
fouls and plays five minutes the first half. That changes the whole complexion
of their team. I don't know if it was anything we saw but we benefited that,
obviously.  
  
Q. A &M kind of threw the first punch, are they a tougher team to play than
their record would suggest?  
COACH SELF: I think they're pretty good. I do. I think if Billy and his staff
have had their full complement of players the whole year, that would be a NCAA
Tournament team, no question.  
I thought yesterday they played well, and I thought that they played better
than the score indicated. When you have Turner and Loubeau and Middleton and
the other Turner, Elston, out there, you've got four guys that can score. And
that's one thing they've labored with all year long is scoring, because they
haven't had all their parts.  
So I think they're harder for us to play against, plus my old assistant, he
knows our stuff better than I do. So I'm sure that he puts a lot of emphasis
on the scouts to take away some things.  
  
Q. I know this is looking ahead probably a little too far than you like. How
special would it be if the title game would be you and Mizzou?  
COACH SELF: It would be special. That means we win tomorrow. That's all I'm
thinking about. We got our hands full big time tomorrow.  
I kind of like what Elijah said the question about beating a team the third
time. It's true, I think it's hardest to beat a team the third time, because
sometimes I think the psychological advantage goes to the team that you've
beaten, but maybe it's with you if you handle things right and that kind of
stuff.  
But we played pretty good against Baylor both games. But we haven't got their
best shot yet. And I anticipate getting their best shot tomorrow. Because
they're really‑‑ they're so talented, it's a joke. And Pierre is as good as
any guard around.  
So it will be an interesting next 24hours trying to get ready.  
  
Q. Bill, they mentioned that your guys took a pretty good shot there early
from A &M and they put a real nice run together, and you got the lead and got
that timeout. You looked like you were having a real good time out there, and
I've seen that a few times this year. Is there something about this season or
this bunch of guys that you're just particularly enjoying this year?  
COACH SELF: I'm a good actor. But I think they like each other. And one thing
that‑‑ if you‑‑ this is a minor thing‑‑ but if you really watch our team when
we play our best, the ball really moves.  
And Tyshawn made two 3s in a row, comes down, takes an awful shot. What does
Thomas do? Takes an awful shot after Ty's shot. Everything we do is
contagious. So when we're on a roll, we're fun to watch. When we're not, then
we're not very fun to watch.  
But I think that's the thing I'd like most about them is for the most part
they're pretty selfless.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Jordan Henriquez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23351)

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

### [Rodney McGruder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22021)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  82  
Kansas State  74

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Kansas State Wildcats, coach Frank Martin
and student‑athletes Jordan Henriquez and Rodney McGruder.  
Coach, we'll come to you first for your thoughts on today's game.  
COACH MARTIN: Just a lot of credit to Baylor. I said it the whole week coming
into the game, I think they got a raw deal, because they lost a couple of
games in the Big 12 and people start acting like that makes them a bad team.  
They're a Final Four‑contending team, and they were real good. And
defensively, when they went to their man, Scott decided to go with the three
guards, that really caused major problems for us running our offense.  
But offense wasn't our problem today. It was defense. We just probably played
second worst defensive game we've played all year. But they had a lot to do
with that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jordan and Rodney.  
  
Q. Jordan and then Rodney, Coach was talking about defense. What do you feel
like you guys need to fix defensively to give yourselves a chance to go deep
in the tournament?  
JORDAN HENRIQUEZ: It's just simply going back to what we do best, and that's
denying lanes and protecting the rim and rebounding the ball. They killed us
on the offensive rebounding and just total rebounds, period.  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: What Jordan said, just doing our defensive principles, being
in line and helping each other out. We didn't help each other out tonight. And
the way we played defense, that's a major key.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know you didn't guard Perry Jones the whole game, but how tough
a matchup is that?  
JORDAN HENRIQUEZ: He's a good player. They all said he's a pro, and he came
out to play tonight from the 40‑minute mark.  
  
Q. Both of you, can you just talk about your emotions coming off this tough
loss and knowing that you guys have one more opportunity? I mean, going into
the NCAA, this is it now?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: I mean, it hurts, you know. Jamar and Victor's last Big 12
game, and we didn't want to go out like that. It hurts. It really do. But we
just have to take advantage of the next opportunity we have, and we can't let
it slip away from us like we did today.  
JORDAN HENRIQUEZ: Exactly what Rodney said. It is Jamar and Victor's last Big
12 game. And we're given one more opportunity, and we have to make the most of
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the first half, it seemed like the story was Baylor's offensive
rebounding. I know you mentioned you guys didn't play defense, but was
rebounding the biggest issue for you guys?  
COACH MARTIN: When I refer to the defensive side of the floor, I include how
you finish possessions, which is rebounding the basketball. And we were awful.  
I mean, I can't believe‑‑ last time we played these guys the reason we had a
chance to win, we outrebounded them. I think they had six offensive rebounds
in the first ten minutes of the game, and then we kind of neutralized it.  
Today was a joke. I mean, it was a joke. We were so bad defensively today. And
I say that in a way which Baylor was good. And they're good. They're a heck of
a basketball team. They've got real good players and Scott's done a great job
with that team. I don't want to take away from them and their moment, because
they won the game.  
But defensively we were so selfish today. We didn't help each other. We didn't
go rebound the basketball. We just‑‑ they set the tone. They came after us and
knocked us down, and we really never punched back.  
And that was unfortunate, because we've come a long way in that department
this year. For us to revert again, it was a little frustrating.  
  
Q. You talked throughout the season about having good practices, having bad
practices. Coming into this one, does it surprise you that it turned out the
way it did? And where do you see the personality of this team now entering the
final stage of the season?  
COACH MARTIN: Was I surprised? Yes. We finished the year off playing well. Our
practices were enthusiastic. Guys were excited about having a chance to come
here and make a run at the Big 12.  
That's why it's disappointing today. Usually when we are bad in preparations,
I'm not disappointed after a loss, because you get what you deserve in life.  
And I'm disappointed because the behaviors that we showed today as a team,
stuff that we had going on back in November and December, and we've gotten
away from that.  
And now we've got to cross our fingers and we've put our fate in someone
else's hands. We've got to cross our fingers and hope that what we've done is
enough and we're given an opportunity.  
And like I told the team, if we are given an opportunity‑‑ make sure I say
this‑‑ I think we're very much deserving of an opportunity. We get one more
chance to get it right. And if we don't get it right, then the season will be
over.  
  
Q. I don't know if I remember how many ‑‑ or the last time that Jamar played
so many minutes without having a rebound. And he was frustrated. Was that more
that something Baylor was doing or just he didn't have it going today?  
COACH MARTIN: I got no idea. He's been real good. I'm not going to jump to
conclusions, because he didn't have a very good game today. We didn't really
have too many guys have good games today.  
Jordan was once again good. His growth‑‑ I'm real‑‑ I'm not into individual
performances, but his growth as a kid, as a player and his consistency here as
of late is awesome. And Jamar has been pretty good for us coming down the
stretch. I'm not going to sit here and put my finger on him.  
Our perimeter defense was atrocious. We all, including him, played very
selfishly defensively. We didn't help each other.  
And Baylor's too good to play that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jordan's performance, how he was a little bit
overshadowed today by Jones by what he gave you?  
COACH MARTIN: It was awesome watching those two guys play. I told Perry after
the game, I said, Man, keep being who you are. Don't give into perception and
public nonsense and‑‑ I said, Be who you are, man.  
He's a beautiful kid and he represents class and he's a very talented player.
And we forget that he's, whatever, 19years of age.  
And then Jordan, like I said, for him to play as consistent as he's played
here for the last month of the season, that's why you go through the process
with these kids and you stick with them through good and bad, is so you can
see them figure it out. And he's starting to figure it out. And he's a heck of
a player when he does that.  
  
Q. Off of what you just said, are you concerned about your team's confidence
going into the tournament?  
COACH MARTIN: No. No. We've played how many games now? 30? What's our record,
21‑10\. 31 games. One game‑‑ are we going to be worried about one game or 30
games? We've been doing this for six months.  
We know we can play with anybody when we play the game the right way. We
didn't play it the right way today.  
  
Q. Speaking of the tournament, how do you gauge success in the tournament?
Obviously you want to win the whole thing, but only one team's going to. So
with this team, what would make a successful NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MARTIN: Just us playing the game the right way, the way we played it.
You can't control winning. That's kind of out there. You can control who you
are and do things to the best of your abilities.  
That's what we have to do. And if you do that, that winning stuff takes care
of itself most of the time. And we've done a pretty good job of that for five
years and we've done a good job of that in the NCAA Tournament, the three
times we've been in it before.  
We have to make sure‑‑ we didn't do that today. We've got to make sure that we
do that the right way sometime next week. And we play in an unbelievable
league. The top six teams in this league this year are real, real good.  
And I said it coming into this week: This thing is going to be crazy here. I'm
not a big fan of conference tournaments. You've beaten each other up for three
months and now all of a sudden you've got to have a tournament against them.  
We do it. I'm all for it. It's great. Our league deserves it. The community
deserves it. But I'm not a fan of conference tournaments. I never have been.
I'm ready to go play somebody else. I'm sick and tired of watching Big 12
basketball, to be honest with you. It's too good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  82  
Kansas State  74

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor coach Scott Drew and Brady Heslip and
Perry Jones III.  
Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH DREW: I think this is a better press conference than last year after the
first game.  
So glad we're here a little longer. Pleased with how the guys played. I
thought we took much better care of the basketball. In the two previous games
against K‑State, we had 18 turnovers and 18 turnovers. Maybe it was the
uniforms; we saw who we were passing to. But I was going to say that was a big
part. Defensively I thought we did a pretty good job for most of the game.  
K‑State's a very good team. I think they're going to have a lot of success in
the NCAA Tournament. Coach Martin does a tremendous job and their guys always
play extremely hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Perry, it's been ‑‑ maybe fair or not, it's been an up‑and‑down season
and for you personally. How pleasing, I guess, is this for you to have the
game you did on this stage?  
PERRY JONES III: It's pleasing because I got my teammates to give me the ball
in the right position, my teammates encouraging me to shoot shots I don't
normally take. And they told me to do it like I did in practice.  
I opened up my whole arsenal. They told me: We got one game. If we lose, we're
out, so just give it all on the floor. And that's what I'm doing.  
  
Q. Perry, was it something you saw in the K ‑State defense or were you just
in the zone today?  
PERRY JONES III: I guess I was just in the zone today. Just being aggressive
and more assertive. Just looking for my teammates when I can find them. If
they were open, they told me to make a play, and I would do my best and make
the best play I can.  
  
Q. Perry, yesterday you talked about getting to the free ‑throw line. Can
you talk about how the offense developed for you today and what you saw from
the Kansas State defense?  
PERRY JONES III: Just being aggressive going to the hole. Not really looking
for the foul, but just going into the body, hopefully I'll get the foul,
hopefully not. But just being able to finish, and convert and‑ones. And it's
postseason and you won't get that many foul calls, you gotta be aggressive,
you gotta be tough, and just attacking the glass, attacking the basket.  
  
Q. Perry, you said that your teammates encouraged you to take shots you
normally wouldn't take. Why would you not? With your ability, why would you
not normally take those shots?  
PERRY JONES III: Just being in the offense, Brady is a 3‑point shooter, giving
him the ball at the 3‑point line, things like that, wanting to be on the
inside more.  
But my teammates said‑‑ they told me to open my whole arsenal, meaning do what
I know I can do. I've been shooting a lot after practice, making consistent
shots after practice. So it only felt right to take the shots I was taking in
the game because I made them in practice.  
  
Q. Perry, did it at all enter your mind before this game what your situation
was, almost exactly a year ago today, you couldn't play in this thing?  
PERRY JONES III: Say it one more time.  
  
Q. Did it ever enter your mind what your situation was a year ago almost to
the day?  
PERRY JONES III: Yeah, my teammates reminded me when I got on the plane. They
all gave me a round of applause for being able to show up here and being able
to play in this tournament.  
But, I mean, other than that, it was all laughing and jokes. It wasn't nothing
serious.  
  
Q. Brady, could you talk about the three ‑guard look you guys have gone to I
guess since the Texas game and why that's worked so well for you guys?  
BRADY HESLIP: I think it works well for us just because we're all different,
and we all bring something different to the table. Those guys can really play
defense. And Coach told us we really gotta guard today, and that's what we
did. And the three‑guard lineup allows us to be fast, but also guard at the
same time.  
  
Q. Perry, if you guys most likely are going to play Kansas, what do you guys
need to do differently to beat them in the third try?  
PERRY JONES III: Defend. Defend and rebound. They're a great offensive and
defensive team. They rebound really well. We've got to be able to rebound and
get a lot of stops, as many stops as possible, because they can get on runs
and it can get ugly. So just play defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Scott, how gratifying was it to see Perry have this kind of performance,
especially given what happened a year ago? You know everything he had gone
through. So seeing him go out there and do that today?  
COACH DREW: Coaches always want to win and do what you need to do to win. But
Perry's one guy I think our whole staff and team really felt good that had a
great game.  
I think throughout the year he's received a lot of negativity and at the same
time I think as we've all shared with him‑‑ and he's a positive kid. He's one
of those guys that the more you build them up, the better he is.  
And I think tonight he saw or you guys saw a game in which he was feeling good
going into it. And credit the teammates giving him the ball and doing a good
job.  
And during the course of the year there's times where we didn't get him the
ball as much as we should have. And that's my fault. At the same time, I think
he showed his repertoire tonight shooting the 3. He spent extra time late in
the season working on that again, where earlier in the year he was shooting
them and we kind of got away from it.  
So I think he's confident right now, and I think he's playing well right now.  
  
Q. When your team has had the expectation it's had all season, you get to
this point and you have this kind of game, is it more of a breakthrough or
more of a wake ‑up for your team in your mind?  
COACH DREW: I think the big thing is if you look at our losses, we haven't had
a bad loss. The teams that we've lost to are all good teams and teams that are
NCAA Tournament teams, are going to be successful.  
I think what drives coaches the most nuts is when you lose to teams that you
shouldn't lose to. And the NCAA always calls them bad losses.  
And I think credit our leadership, we've shown up and every game we're
supposed to win we've won. And I think we've gotten better.  
I'll throw Coach Knight a bone here. He did a great job a couple of weeks ago.
I asked him‑‑ he always moves the ball so well when he coaches. And we were a
little stagnant. We threw in his favorite drill to help with
assist‑to‑turnovers. I don't think the guys liked it at first, but we're
getting better.  
So I think we've handled the ball better and hadn't had as many turnovers
lately.  
  
Q. Coach, what made you decide to go to man ‑to‑man defense there at some
point in the first half, and is that something you feel like you'll try to
continue the rest of the tournament?  
COACH DREW: I think really the greatness of our team is we have versatility.
The tough thing is finding out which is better. Because statistically a lot of
games zone is better. I think sometimes man is better. And trying to figure
out which works against K‑State's pressure, the three guards really helped us
on the offensive end and helped us get some easy transition baskets.  
So I think that lended itself to that. And that's the great thing, is we can
go vice versa. What's tough on players is one game you play 25minutes, the
next game you might play five minutes. That's tough on everybody.  
But as long as we stay as a team, that can be our biggest strength. For the
most part this year, for 26 games, we've done that.  
  
Q. What did you say to your players at the halftime? You've had some rough
rolls the last six weeks, second half play, but really were the aggressor in
the second half. What did you say to have them really coming out firing like
that?  
COACH DREW: I think the common theme in all our losses is we haven't defended.
You look at every game in which we've lost, we've given up over 50percent
defensive field goal percentage.  
And tonight Kansas State is one of the best rebounding teams in the country
for a reason. They're one of the best in the Big 12 if not‑‑ depending on I
think they're first in the Big 12‑‑ so we rebounded and didn't give them
multiple opportunities, which was great.  
The second thing, with that, was just making sure that everything they had was
tough and earned, and for the most part tonight we did a pretty good job with
that.  
  
Q. Were you pleased with just kind of the general toughness in your team
tonight, especially against the K ‑State team that really prides itself on
that?  
COACH DREW: I think 11:30 games are always a concern for every coach because
sometimes college kids don't get up that early.  
So I was pleased with how we came out, competed. I think K‑State came out and
competed. Whenever we played them, they're good games. And we're glad to get
the win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contributions from A.J. Walton, four steals, three
assists, 11points?  
COACH DREW: I thought A.J. was huge tonight. He was hitting the mid‑range
jumper, which was great. But defensively he did a very good job and those four
steals were huge. And he guarded without getting in foul trouble. And that's
something that is important, because usually he's guarding one of the best
players on the other team.  
So he did a very good job.  
  
Q. The way Perry played, did that seem to kind of rub off on everybody?
Seemed like everybody kind of lifted their games.  
COACH DREW: I think Perry's one of those guys, the biggest compliment we can
give Perry is as good a player, as good a talent as he is, he's a better
teammate. Everybody loves Perry. You love coaching Perry because he's always
got a great attitude. It's always team first. On Senior Night, he's one of the
first guys to come up, Coach, can one of the guys start for me?  
And, I mean, here's a guy that might leave after this year and he's given up
his starting position for the last home game because he wants to help the
team. He's just a remarkable kid.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  88  
Oklahoma State  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Missouri head coach Frank Haith and
student‑athletes Marcus Denmon, Kim English, and Phil Pressey.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH HAITH: I thought that we played very well tonight. I thought our defense
at the start of the ballgame was outstanding. We got back to guarding the ball
the way we were guarding the ball earlier in the year. I thought our intensity
level was very good.  
I've always felt this way in tournaments, when you play a team who played the
night before, you have a tendency to not be ready to play. And these guys
really fought hard against that, and we were ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defensive effort especially in the first half?  
PHIL PRESSEY: Well, I usually just try to pressure the ball the best I can.
And this game I came away with some steals.  
So I'm just playing defense how I know how to play. And that's what my coaches
want me to do. And I came out with some steals.  
  
Q. Marcus and Kim, can you guys just describe what Phil brought to the game
tonight? There was that sequence, 17 ‑0 run, where he was feeding you guys on
layups almost the whole time.   
MARCUS DENMON: Well, early Phil really made the team feed off his defense.
Like he said, he was making defensive plays, getting steals, and it allowed us
to get early and easy layups on a fastbreak.  
KIM ENGLISH: Yeah, he's absolutely right. We really came in this game focusing
on energy and defense, because, I mean, we feel like when we're right, our
offense is never the problem.  
So, I mean, we really came out with a concerted effort to defend. And that
starts with Phil out top. I mean, he was getting on‑ball steals. And it was a
track meet from that.  
  
Q. Phil and Kim, both you guys came close to career highs. Were you holding
something back? Because you could have easily broke that today if you wanted
to.  
KIM ENGLISH: That's never the focus. We were stuck in the process on executing
each possession, getting one stop this possession. Getting the best shot this
possession. I mean, when you truly get yourself concerned in that process, big
nights will happen.  
But, no, I don't even look up at the stat thing, except for fouls and scores
during the game.  
PHIL PRESSEY: Yeah, I mean, my dad always told me when you play the game the
right way, all that will take care of itself.  
So, I mean, once we get up by a certain amount of points, we want to run our
offense and try to get the best shot, like Kim said.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about that 24 ‑3 run early in the second half‑‑ or,
excuse me, early in the first half? You had 12 of those points, including the
first 10.   
KIM ENGLISH: Well, we were defending and the ball wasn't sticking. We had
tremendous ball movement. Good ball movement relieves the tension of the
offense. That's Pete Carril. And that's the truth. When the ball is moving,
things just happen. So that's what it was.  
  
Q. Kim, do you feel right now like your guys' very best is better than
anyone's very best?  
KIM ENGLISH: I don't think so. That would be a bold statement. There's a lot
of good teams in the nation. That's kind of out of our control.  
Again, if we just try to play our best on each defensive possession and get a
good shot on each offensive possession, then I think we can have a chance to
win a lot of ball games.  
But Kentucky, Kansas, there's a lot of really, really good basketball teams in
the nation. We're so focused on the next game, Texas or Ohio State, that's a
long way away.  
  
Q. Kim and Marcus, there's been some talk this week about whether Kansas
City is a Missouri town or perhaps some other school's town. Just your
thoughts on that and what you guys feel when you come here to play?  
KIM ENGLISH: Marcus comes home. He's born and raised Kansas City. Mike Dixon,
Steve Moore, Jarrett Sutton, Andrew Jones. City adopted me. So this is our
city.  
MARCUS DENMON: I mean, we are in Kansas City, Missouri. So I really can't
worry about that. I mean, this is home for me, but I think that Missouri fans
come out great here as well, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Frank, is your team better when Phil tries to do other things besides
score first?  
COACH HAITH: Well, I think we're really good when he's play making. I think we
still want Phil to keep defense honest, because he does have the ability to
score. But when he's into that mode of getting guys involved and play making,
he's awfully good, which makes us awfully good.  
  
Q. Do you think this is one of your better defensive efforts in the first
half, especially, of the season?  
COACH HAITH: We had some games we played defense like that, particularly when
we were in Kansas City before, I felt we had two really good games guarding
the ball, good pressure.  
You look at overall our defensive performance tonight, we were plus 20 on the
boards, so we didn't give them any second shots.  
So I thought there's no question our defense was great tonight. But we've had
that kind of performance a couple times earlier in the year.  
  
Q. How impressed were you with the fact that OSU didn't give up in the
second half, and where do you think that never ‑say‑die attitude comes from?  
COACH HAITH: I didn't think they would. Travis gets those guys to compete, and
I have a lot of respect for Keiton Page and his career and what kind of player
he is. And I didn't think that they would quit.  
And it just tells you a lot about their coaching staff and their program.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that 24 ‑3 run in the first half?  
COACH HAITH: It was all about our defense. I thought we really‑‑ we were able
to get some loose balls and 52points in the paint. I hear a lot of people talk
about our team, and they talk about us being a jump‑shooting team.  
But I think we can make shots. We can make 3s, but I like to think of us being
a team that can put pressure on the defense by attacking the paint.  
  
Q. You mentioned that the previous two games here were kind of played out in
a similar way. Going forward in this tournament, is that a factor at all? Do
you feel like the comfort level they have here could be a big deal going
forward?  
COACH HAITH: Well, there's no question. I thought we‑‑ coming back here our
performance early in the year we reminded the guys how well we played here,
and you're hoping it can play out like that, there's no question. But I think
our guys are comfortable being here in this building because we have had an
opportunity to play here early in the year.  
  
Q. When Oklahoma State made that run in the second half, how important was
it for you guys to come back after that timeout and close the game out?  
COACH HAITH: Like I said, Oklahoma State didn't quit. They continued to make
shots and continued to play. We may have let up a little bit there, our
execution there a couple times on offense. And I thought we lost Keiton a
couple times on defense, and it was important for us to continue to play the
game the way we know how to play it. And I thought our guys finished the game
we should.  
  
Q. You were able to kind of rest your starters as much as you can with this
team, and maybe just physically and mentally it wasn't really that much of a
draining game. Do you feel like that's kind of important in a first ‑round
game when you might have to play two more?  
COACH HAITH: As a matter of fact, in the first half we got some guys in there,
Jarrett and Andrew, kind of lessen some of the minutes. Because we've got
three days, hoping that we're playing three days.  
And we only have seven guys. So it was good for us to get some‑‑ the only guy
I think played 30minutes was Kim, I think. Yeah, it was Kim. Or Marcus. Both
those guys were right at 30.  
But they're normally at 35. So it was good to get some less minutes on those
guys' legs.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Keith Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23361)

### [Bill Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20715)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  83  
Texas A&M  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Texas A&M coach Billy Kennedy and
student‑athletes Keith Davis and Khris Middleton.  
Coach.  
COACH KENNEDY: First of all, you've got to give a lot of credit to Kansas.
They demand so much help with Thomas Robinson and Jeff Withey that we left
some guys open on the perimeter. When they make ten 3s and Robinson hits two
3s, they're a very difficult team to beat by anybody.  
I'm proud of our guys for competing, especially in the first half I thought we
did some good things. But Kansas was very good today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Khris, could you just comment on the fact that this team ‑‑ Kansas is so
talented, when they're as good as they are today, they're extremely difficult
to beat?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: They're a tough team from top to bottom. So go out there and
guard, and we have to guard every player, and they make us do that.  
  
Q. Khris and Keith, you guys played so well for about a 10 ‑, 12‑minute
stretch there. I think you were up 7. As you look toward next year, is that
something where you feel you can turn this around if you can play those kind
of stretches consistently?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: Yeah, I mean, Coach tells us all the time we've got to play
for 40minutes. Every game you've got to play for 40minutes. This game we
didn't do it, and it showed.  
KEITH DAVIS: I think as a team, yes, next year we'll be able to do that. We'll
have more guys willing to compete. If we compete 40minutes, I think we can't
be beat.  
  
Q. Khris, what made them so tough to defend? It's not often that your team
lets up 80points in a game.  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: Their guards can shoot. They have really good bigs. That's
basically it. You can't really double the post like you want to because he'll
just kick it out every time. We just wanted to try to make it hard on the post
and contest their 3s, but they made most of those. So it's tough.  
  
Q. Keith, do you think you'll be able to kind of ride the momentum
individually from what you're able to do today against such a great team, with
such good length and great bigs into next year?  
KEITH DAVIS: Of course. But I have to work in the spring and offseason to be
able to do things like I did tonight. And it's up to me if I do that. If I
work hard, I think I can do good next year.  
  
Q. Khris, what did you learn about yourself? What do you think the team
learned about each other with all the struggles that you guys went through
this year?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: Just how good of a team we can be if you play for 40minutes.
There were stretches we played really good for five, ten minutes, but we just
have to play good basketball for 40minutes.  
  
Q. What was the most frustrating part of this past season?  
KEITH DAVIS: I have to say the injuries. I'd say the injuries are frustrating.
When you've got three of your top players out, that's a bind on the team.
That's the toughest part, is just the injuries.  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: I think for me it's just losing. I mean, being there for
three years and never lost this many games. It's hard on everybody. Just hate
losing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What's your message to the guys, particularly the returning players? This
program has been on a rise, and after a one ‑year lull, what's the message to
make sure that they put in the work to squash this after just one year?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, first of all, you kind of reap what you sow. And just the
message that you do the right things all the time in every situation, off the
court, on the court, work ethic. Just some characteristics of what it takes to
be a champion.  
And it's hard to do that when you have injuries, you have a new coaching
staff, and you have the adversity we went through. Just want them to learn to
keep fighting, keep competing, and making good choices every day.  
And we got better the last three weeks in practice. Our effort was better. We
shared the ball a lot better. Khris looked like himself I think the last
couple of games and did some really good things for us. He was obviously
playing like our best player.  
So we had some definition at the end of the season that we didn't have just
three or four weeks ago or a month and a half ago.  
  
Q. Do you think the foundation's in a pretty good spot with who you've got
coming in, with obviously you're still working on recruiting, you have some
spots, but also just with a lot of these guys having to play, because of the
injuries, should create more depth for next year?  
COACH KENNEDY: We have our base end, but we have to have them finish up with a
good recruiting class. We need some help. When it became man‑on‑man against
Kansas over the course of 20‑, 30‑, 40‑minute game, you could see that they
had some guys that were on another level than us physically and athletically.  
And to win big at this level you've got to have good players, and I think
we've got a nucleus but we've got to add some more talent and some more
toughness to our team. And we've got to be a better defensive team where we
can protect the paint. We weren't able to protect the paint in this game, and
we were exposed defensively.  
And playing back‑to‑back games you've got to have depth, you've got to have
some guys who are used to, who are athletically talented enough to play back
to back and perform at a high level two days in a row.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Royce White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23385)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  71  
Iowa State  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Fred Hoiberg, student‑athletes Scott
Christopherson and Royce White.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH HOIBERG: It's disappointing to go out in the first round down here,
especially with all the fans we had in attendance. It was great to see all the
cardinal and gold out there, and to walk away after one game is very
disappointing.  
I thought the key to the game was a nine‑minute stretch in the second half. We
go up 11 right away in the second half. About 18minutes to go, and you look at
the nine‑minute mark, and we're down eight. So they outscore us by 19points in
that 10‑minute stretch and that's the ballgame. They made big plays.  
I thought we put our heads down a little bit as a team. And then we regrouped
and found a way to get back in the game. But they made big plays down the
stretch and we didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Scott, what were they doing defensively to the perimeter shooter guys?
Looked like they were playing fairly tight on you guys.  
SCOTT CHRISTOPHERSON: They did a good job of getting to our perimeter guys and
contesting 3s. I think Texas is a pretty good defensive team, and you've got
to give them credit for the way they performed tonight on the defensive end.  
  
Q. How did you see J'Covan Brown's game ‑winning 3‑point play?  
SCOTT CHRISTOPHERSON: He made‑‑ kind of drove left and Babb cut him off. I
thought he was going to spin back. I didn't do a good enough job getting my
entire body down there in front of him. And I reached in. The ref made a call
and he made a great shot.  
  
Q. Royce, can you talk about your performance, 17points, but in a loss,
first ‑round quarterfinal down here?  
ROYCE WHITE: It means nothing. My performance was not good enough, especially
when you think about the first five minutes is the most important and I came
out and turned it over.  
It just wasn't good enough. I'm going to have to get better even here in the
next week if we're going to make a run in the tournament.  
  
Q. Royce, you now have a few days before Selection Sunday. What are these
next few days going to be like for you and the team and what are you going to
do now to get past this to look ahead to the tournament?  
ROYCE WHITE: Just prepare. Just prepare and try and get better each day. Not
knowing what opponent you're going to draw is definitely different in terms of
preparation.  
But you just prepare yourself mentally for whoever you draw and work on
yourself more as a team than trying to prepare for an opponent that you don't
know.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Chris Babb's defense in spite of what J'Covan Brown
did, he shot 7 of 19 from the field. Hit big shots but they were all
contested?  
COACH HOIBERG: He's a big‑time player. He's the leading scorer in our league.
Gotta give him credit for making big plays down the stretch.  
I thought Chris made him take tough shots. I didn't think our awareness to him
the entire game was good enough. It was good at times. We ran at him and made
him give up the ball. But there was other times where he split our defense,
and you can't do that. You can't allow a great player to have those
opportunities getting to the rim.  
Listen, Chris has done a great job all year. He's as good a defensive
perimeter player as there is in our league. But that kid, he's a load. He's a
big‑time player, made big‑time plays tonight.  
  
Q. You talked about that run that they made after you were up 11. Was it
more about what they were doing on offense, or was it mistakes or turnovers
from you guys?  
COACH HOIBERG: It was a combination. We came out and got four baskets right
off the bat, off of great ball movement. Really got out and ran and got
rebounds. And that's how we attacked.  
And once they started getting offensive rebounds, they get 16 offensive
rebounds against us tonight. That's way too many.  
We're not able to play in transition. That's where we've been at our best.
We've been a very good rebounding team this year.  
They came in minus one of their top rebounders and won many, but they still
found a way to control the glass. That slowed us down. We weren't able to get
out in transition. We had to play in the half court. They do a really good job
in the half court as far as sitting in and making you beat them from the
outside, which we didn't do tonight.  
So a little bit of both. We didn't get the boards, and then they did a good
job going out and attacking and getting the game and the tempo where they
needed it.  
  
Q. A loss like this can be tough for a team to overcome, do you imagine the
kids are going to have a tough time getting past this one with what's ahead of
you now?  
COACH HOIBERG: It will bother them, that's for sure. It's a group that goes
out and plays with pride. We've done that all season. We've accomplished a lot
with this group. And it's a testament to them. Going back to all the hard work
that this team has gone through, the two‑a‑days going back to July. A trip to
Italy for ten days. And we put a lot into this season.  
And they're a very disappointed group in there right now. We've got some
things to correct here. We've got one more chance to go out and to try to do
something, to try to make a run. And I believe this group will do that. We'll
come in, we'll have good practices, and hopefully we come out and get a good
draw and play well.  
It's a learning experience, when you play in a setting like this, where you've
got neutral court. You've got both bands. You've got both sets of fans in
attendance and you learn from it. And hopefully we'll be better the next time.  
I thought we came out a little bit tight. Once we started playing I thought we
got better and that second half run was the key. That ten‑minute stretch was
the key to that game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  88  
Oklahoma State  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma State head coach Travis Ford and
student‑athletes Markel Brown, Keiton Page, and Brian Williams.  
Coach, we'll call on you first.  
COACH FORD: Just, first, congratulate Missouri, and, secondly, just how proud
I am of our basketball team. I think you saw in the second half kind of what
we've exemplified: A team that never gives up, a team that's going to fight
until the end, a team that has felt adversity, we felt adversity in the first
half playing against one of the best teams in America who was playing great.
That's tough to go against.  
But give them credit. I think fatigue was a little bit of factor. We used up a
lot of energy last night. Quick turnaround. Not to make an excuse. I think
Missouri played up on that. That was something they probably talked about:
Hey, Oklahoma State doesn't have a whole lot of players, those guys have been
playing a lot of minutes. They played late last night. Let's go at them early.  
But not to make any excuses. Our guys played hard. We just went up against a
team tonight, and I've told my staff this a while ago, when Missouri‑‑ when
you let Missouri play to their strength, if they're playing to their strength,
there's not many teams better in the country. There's not.  
When they're playing their best, they can beat anybody really at their best, I
believe. They're that good. And when they're on a roll and you give them
confidence early, they're as good as it gets. I give them credit.  
But our guys, I'll tell you, for us to come back and win the second half, to
keep playing, these three guys up here really carried us in the second half.
I'm just proud of the way they've handled themselves this year. Very proud of
their effort.  
As we told them, we've laid the foundation for what I think its going to be a
very good basketball team. We were led by one of the best players in the
country, one of the best seniors in the country in Keiton Page.  
But very proud of these guys and how hard they've played and how they've
represented us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Keiton, how hard is it going to be for you to know that you're going to
be taking off that jersey, Oklahoma State; that you've worn with so much pride
for four years? How emotional is it for you right now?  
KEITON PAGE: It's going to be tough, especially coming from a guy that's
wanted to be a Cowboy since he was little.  
It's been the best‑‑ it's been a fast four years, but it's definitely been the
best four years of my life. To play with great, great teammates and then put
in a great opportunity under this coaching staff and great position, and just
a million memories I've never forget.  
  
Q. Brian and Markel, can you kind of talk about Keiton's contributions to
this team this season and over his career?  
MARKEL BROWN: He's contributed a lot to this program. A guy like Keiton, I
don't think there will ever be another one. Just a great leader on the court
and also off the court. He's led the way for us this whole season. He showed
us a lot that we can take with us for next year.  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: He's a great player, great scorer. Even better leader in
person, and we'll definitely miss him next year.  
COACH FORD: Keiton and Markel are roommates. It's tough for Markel to say a
lot of positive things about Keiton. They're usually going back and forth
against each other, so that's pretty good for Markel, because they're usually
going back and forth at each other. But, no, that's the truth.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about what that defense was like in the first half, how
stifling that was for you guys to face?  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: Well, they played great defense. I give them credit for that.
But we weren't knocking down shots. And it was just a rough first half. But we
had a better second one. But I think it was a little too late. We dug
ourselves too big of a hole.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I don't know if you know this, you were too busy giving a hug to Keiton,
but when you took him out 53seconds left, it wasn't just people wearing orange
shirts that gave him a standing ovation, it was people wearing all different
colored shirts that gave him a standing ovation.  
COACH FORD: That doesn't surprise me. If you love the game of basketball, then
you love Keiton Page, because he's what it's about. And if you don't like
Keiton Page, then there's something wrong with you. I mean, there really is.  
We celebrated Keiton in the locker room after the game. And I told our guys. I
said, You guys, some of you are very temperamental, but you're talking about a
young man who I have really been hard on for several years early in his
career. Handled it like a champ, like a pro. And he's come back, and senior
year become one of the best college basketball players in the country.  
And he has taught this team so many things that they'll hopefully be able to
carry with them to make them a better team, a better player.  
I joke about Markel and Keiton. You know, they've been roommates for a couple
of years now, past two years, and they're extremely tight. And he's been so
good for Markel, and Markel's been good for him.  
But, yeah, to see‑‑ I noticed it. I felt it. And I think obviously it's well
deserved. But I think he's meant a lot to a lot of people, and I think
everybody just respects Keiton Page and what he stands for and what he has
accomplished.  
I mean, he's accomplished a lot. We were trying to get him his 300th 3 at the
end. I think Brian goaltended his 300th 3. I think it was going in. And then I
debated do I leave him in there to try to get it, but I felt he deserved to
see the impact that he's made on so many people in a positive manner and how
many people have enjoyed‑‑ I can't go anywhere, I can't go recruiting, I can't
go anywhere, anywhere, in the United States without somebody commenting to me,
Boy, I loved that Keiton Page, I love that Keiton Page, I love watching him
play.  
And I told them so do I. So do I. So it's going to take a while for it to sink
in for me that I'm not going to be coaching him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that run at the start of the first half, that 24 ‑3
run, and what it did to you?  
COACH FORD: I think it started with their defense. Their defense was just
stifling. They played with such great energy. We were kind of in slow motion,
and they were in fast motion. We told our team that.  
We were trying‑‑ our guys I could see it in their eyes, similar to how it went
in Columbia. They're a veteran‑experienced, tough‑physically basketball team.
I mean they're physical. They may not be the tallest team, but they're a
physical basketball team.  
And we're just the opposite right now. We're young. And they played to their
strengths. Their defense led the offense, and in the half court they were
making 3s.  
So give them all the credit. Again, I've commented on it. I can't begin to
describe what a great job Frank Haith has done with this Missouri basketball
team. It's one of the best coaching jobs I've seen this year.  
  
Q. Do you expect to see Keiton on your bench as a GA next season, on your
staff, and what do you think his future is as being a basketball coach?  
COACH FORD: If he doesn't get drafted in the first round or something like
that, yeah, hopefully he'll come back and coach. I'm trying to promote him on
the NBA teams, hey, you might want to put him on your team.  
He wants to get into coaching. His dad's one of the great high school coaches
in Oklahoma. His brother's into coaching now and is doing a great job this
year. He kind of wants to follow in the footsteps and I think he wants to try
college possibly.  
Yes, he knows he has a place on my staff anytime he wants it.  
  
Q. In the season where so much goes wrong, how much did it kind of keep your
head from exploding that you had a guy like Keiton that does everything right
for you?  
COACH FORD: Oh, no‑‑ you know, we've talked about it and I talked to my wife
and I said how much I wish we were sitting here 28‑4 for Keiton Page alone.
We'll get there. But I wish he could experience it.  
But with that said, I've enjoyed coaching this team in the past two months as
much as any team I've ever coached. And that's saying a lot because I've had a
lot of fun coaching a lot of teams, but I've really enjoyed coaching this
basketball team the past couple of months, really enjoyed it. And I think
Keiton and I have talked about this.  
I think Keiton Page will look back on this as not like the years where we were
going to the NCAA Tournament and things, but as one of the rewarding year for
him. Maybe not the best year, but a rewarding year overall in what he's
accomplished and the group of guys and kind of‑‑ some of you guys have been
around us the last two months, but you haven't been around us as much, it's a
lot like we are. It's been a fun group, it really has.  
It's been a very positive group. Good attitudes. Good personality. Fun to be
around off the court. And he's a big part of that.  
So I think even though he would love to have won 25 games, I think he'll look
back on this. And we've talked about this. It was fun. It was a young team we
overachieved to an extent. We believe that. We maximized our abilities, and he
by far was the leader going out and being an All‑Conference player, averaging
18points a game in this league, with some young guys. He's like the
grandfather of the team. Everybody just followed him and everybody played off
of him and other guys stepped up on certain nights.  
And I think he's going to‑‑ and, again, we've talked about it. He's enjoying
it. He's had fun. He's going to look back on this as a fun year, especially
the way we finished it.  
  
Q. Put this season in a nutshell for me and where do you go from here?  
COACH FORD: Well, it's been challenging in a lot of areas, but also very
positive in a lot of areas.  
The schedule‑‑ you know you look at our schedule, again, was one of the
toughest schedules in America. Sagarin had us I think second the other day.
That had a lot to do with a lot of the things that happened with the schedule,
period, and then the injuries. The schedule and the injuries were the two
things that were the biggest adversity.  
You know, we lose J.P., who has been through the league before. We were really
excited about getting him to the league and seeing how he would respond. We
were excited about that. And then you lose Le'Bryan and Phil had multiple
injuries.  
And then you're left with freshmen. And you didn't‑‑ it could have went in a
lot of different areas, but it went up. And so many things happened for crazy
reasons. You don't really understand it. But we chose to look at the glass
half full than half empty, and it's been‑‑ it's been a fun two months,
rewarding two months for us when you get a team that's overachieving and
maximizing abilities and you've got some kids that are bright‑eyed and
bushy‑tailed and playing hard and you've got a senior out there that just
continues to impress and continues to do more than you think he can do.  
You're like, well, he can't do that again. He scores 40 against Texas. I'm
like, whew, people are really going to shut him down now. Nobody is going to
let him shoot. And then he comes back and gets 29 the next game and then goes
just on a terror.  
We laid the foundation. We have some guys that played tonight that will be
returning, a lot of experience. We have a lot of guys that did not play
tonight that were in the locker room that we expect to get back full‑go. And
we have some guys that will make an impact. We're getting our schedule right.
There are some changes I've made. We're getting it right.  
So things are definitely headed up. There's no question there was a point in
the season where there was a lull. And for a couple of weeks there I was‑‑ we
were all strung but then we started taking off. It's crazy how things work
out. Some things happen for a reason. And sometimes things happen when you
think wow, and it turns out to be a positive thing.  
But the injuries and the schedule were the two toughest things for our
basketball team. But, again, our guys have been resilient and hopefully we've
learned from it. We are losing a great player. We are losing 18points a game.  
And we're going to have other guys step up, but we had guys tonight that can
do that, we have guys that are sitting out that can do that, and we've got
guys coming in that are going to help.  
But his leadership, I can't overstate the leadership that Keiton Page showed
those young guys. I can't overstate it. It is phenomenal. It's the best I've
ever seen. Ever seen. The best leadership that I've ever seen from a player.  
And he goes out and scores 18 in the game. But a lot of work to be done. But
right now that's kind of it, quickly.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  71  
Iowa State  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Texas Longhorns and Coach Rick
Barnes. The student‑athletes are Myck Kabongo, J'Covan Brown, and Clint
Chapman.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's Texas victory.  
COACH BARNES: I told our guys right after the game that I've coached a lot of
basketball games and we've had a lot of different teams, but I'm not sure
we're any more proud of the effort these guys gave tonight.  
They really‑‑ from the start to the finish, they just really did a tremendous
job in what we're trying to get done and really proud of the fact we only had
six turnovers.  
But defensively we fought. And I thought we stayed with our game plan from
start to finish better than any point the entire year.  
But just really proud of the effort. I thought not just these three guys, but
everybody. It's a great team win, and I'm just really proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You've said before that crazy things happen when you spin, but did you
have a bigger spin move than you had in the last 30seconds? Can you go through
that play and what you were thinking?  
J'COVAN BROWN: Coach called top, and I came up and Chap had a good screen and
the 3 ball wasn't there. So I drove left, three whole dribbles, and when I
felt him on my side, and I had to spin it, and I did. And Christopherson came
over and fouled me. I knew I had to get it on the rim, and it was a good play
call by Coach, really.  
  
Q. Myck, seemed like you did a good job controlling the offense today. Talk
about how well and how the game slowed down for you today.  
MYCK KABONGO: Coming into this game, the biggest thing has been pace. Coach
has been preaching to me about pace and pacing myself throughout the whole
game. And that's all I try to do, just pace myself at the whole game. My job
is to run the team and get us into stuff, and that's what I tried to do
tonight for our team to win.  
  
Q. Myck, when you were running in the second half, felt like you got in the
lane almost seven or eight possessions in a row. Was that purposeful? Was it
something you talked about at halftime and helped you get in a run?  
MYCK KABONGO: No, the biggest thing is spacing. When you have good spacing on
the court when you're playing basketball, it opens up things. My teammates
opened up things and we opened up gaps for us to drive. That's the biggest
thing. We came into this game thinking it was driving gaps and trying to get
in there, and it was open because of our spacing.  
  
Q. J'Covan, are you saying the first option could have been a 3 on that
play?  
J'COVAN BROWN: Just whatever defense is giving me. Could have had closed the
gate on me, you know, quick. He's a great defender. That's what great
defenders are going to do, make you do your second option.  
He gave me a lane, able to drive left. When I took it, he cut me off and I
just spun. And just tried to go make a play. And I had to. And just give
credit to that.  
  
Q. Myck, it seems like all of us, all we ever want to talk about is how
young you guys are. Tonight did you guys feel you have really matured from the
beginning of the season? Was tonight a statement that you guys are ready to
take that on?  
MYCK KABONGO: Not young no more. When we came back from the break, that's when
we had to‑‑ we've grown up. We've shown strides, every single one of us, the
six freshmen. It goes to the help we got from our older players, guys like
Chap, Lex and J.B. that's on us every day and they don't cut us any slack.  
So a big part of us growing up is to those guys that pushed us every day.  
  
Q. Clint, 27minutes, have you ever played a harder 27minutes, particularly
in terms of what you had to do defensively against White?  
CLINT CHAPMAN: I really don't think so. Obviously a great player. There's so
much he can do with the ball that obviously there's a lot you gotta be ready
for. And I think the last time I played that much that hard was the last game
up in Iowa. So I don't think so.  
  
Q. J'Covan, not to veer away from this game, but looking ahead to tomorrow
night, can you tell us a little bit what you see from Marcus Denmon and what
he brings?  
J'COVAN BROWN: He's a great scorer, not just a shooter. He can put it on the
ground, 1‑2 dribble, shoot it, get to the rim. He's a versatile player. But
we're going to go out there and guard everybody, the shooters, because that's
what they do. They're catch and shoot. They try to beat you in transition to
get going.  
So we're just going to watch film when we played them home and when they was
home and just go from there.  
  
Q. J'Covan, how would you describe the intensity of this game with
everything that was on the line, and what effect did that have on your team?  
J'COVAN BROWN: Tournament time is always a great thing to play in. The crowd,
I think we only had like a couple of fans. But they had a great amount of
fans.  
You love to walk into other gyms and quiet their fans. So we just went out
there, just gave it our all for 40minutes, like Coach said. He never gave up
on us. So we didn't. It really starts with Coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Good part of the second half you were using four guards. Was that fouls
or just wanting to maybe get a quickness advantage?  
COACH BARNES: Well, it was fouls, some of it, and it was a hard physical game,
and we knew we may have to do that obviously with Lex being down. And we did a
good job with it. And once we got it going a little bit when we spread it open
there, that's really when we got the lead.  
And actually in the first half I think they kind of sized down to us a little
bit. And Fred has done a great job with this team. They missed some shots
around ‑‑ we missed some, we missed a lot of shots early, too. But overall we
have worked on that a little bit, and I think it helped us tonight.  
  
Q. Rick, did these guys grow up a little bit tonight?  
COACH BARNES: You know, I thought it was the best. And you look at there's a
lot of things that we did tonight really from start to finish in terms of
staying with our game plan, we did. We really did.  
And I thought Myck‑‑ again, I'm really proud of him. I talked to him a lot
about understanding the situations, and he came running over to me in the last
minute and he said, Coach, let's get Jaylen in the game so we can switch
everything.  
I told him after the game of all the things he's done this year, I said, I'm
telling you, you're heading in the right direction. Because he thought the
game‑‑ he got a little excited a few times, that's going to happen, but I
thought he did a really great job.  
He's done a great job on Christopherson. You come into this game,
Christopherson I think averaged 21points over the last five games. Tonight you
look at what he did.  
Those two 3s came from out‑of‑bounds situations, and one of them wasn't Myck.
But as hard as he had to play, because as Christopherson is a tough guy to
guard, and we were really concerned about their dribble penetration.  
And Chap said‑‑ and the question what he said was it was the hardest he ever
had to play because our post guys had to get out there and help with the
dribble hand‑offs, ball screens and get back. There was a lot going on for our
post guys, but they did it.  
As a team, again, it's just a great team win. And there's no question this
year from start to finish we stayed with what we wanted to do.  
  
Q. At halftime you got 20minutes that could decide your whole season left
and you come out and give up a 7 ‑0 run. Is there any panic, worry, just
concern? What happened there, the way it started, and how did you get it
turned around so quickly?  
COACH BARNES: What I told them, I did get upset because we started the half
with‑‑ took a quick shot. We drove the ball. We wanted to be aggressive. We
didn't just have the angle. Then we threw it out of bounds. And it was our
offense.  
Because all year we've guarded. And we did a really pretty good job for the
most part getting back in transition. Not every time. But I did. At halftime I
told them. I said, Look‑‑ and, again, in terms of the NCAA Tournament, I think
I've said from the very beginning everybody‑‑ I mean, it's amazing when people
talk about who is in, who is out, all that stuff, how things have changed in
24hours.  
It goes back to what I've always said: You put it in the book and at the very
end you'll see. But I did tell the guys this. I said, You know what? Let's
just say we are on the bubble. Let's just say that. All right. Now, if I wrote
down NIT or NCAA, which one would you put your name under right now? And I
said, So whichever one you want, I can assure you you're going to have to earn
it.  
And when we came out, yeah, I was upset, because I didn't think we came out
and did what we needed to do. But we fought back. But this team has done this
all year.  
  
Q. Following up on how you guys stuck to your game plan, they shot 5 for 18
from 3. Can you just talk about are you pleased with that number, obviously?  
COACH BARNES: Well, where we were able to do a good job there was we were able
to stop a lot of‑‑ they turned the corner so hard. And, again, you gotta give
it to our guards for really working. And we talked about it for two days. It's
being on edge, away from the ball, because they're an extremely hard team to
guard. And White's as tough a matchup as anybody we'll play against.  
But not only did it take the guards being ready, but the post guys had to do
their job. And we told our guys we've gotta do them both. We've got to try to
close down the lane, but we've got to get back out there on the catch.  
But the key would be stopping dribble penetration, and for the most part we
did stay in front of the basketball so they couldn't drive and kick out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  62  
Oklahoma  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by coach Billy Kennedy of the Texas A&M Aggies
and his two student‑athletes, Khris Middleton and Elston Turner.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH KENNEDY: I thought it was a great team win. Our guys bought into our
defensive game plan and trying to limit them in the post. And this is the
first game I think we had four guys in double figures. We really shared the
ball and made big shots when we needed to.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Elston, Dash's huge shot. You hadn't made a shot from outside in the
second half. I think they have pulled within two, and that kind of keyed you
guys on a 10 ‑2 run. How huge was that 3‑pointer?  
ELSTON TURNER: It was one of the biggest shots in the game. And, like you
said, we weren't really hitting in the second half. And Dash, throughout his
career he's hit big shots.  
So it didn't surprise any of us one bit.  
  
Q. Khris, how big were David and Ray? They combined for 21points inside.
Just talk about their second half, combining for 21 in the second half.  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: They're huge, especially on the offensive boards for us, just
Dave attacking the paint with his dribble and going through contact and trying
to finish. They really helped us on the defensive end, too, by containing
their two bigs.  
  
Q. Khris, your thoughts on getting another shot at Kansas tomorrow?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: It's always a good game at Kansas. They compete real hard. We
just have to master our attention and go over that too and just go out there,
execute the game plan we get tonight and just fight tomorrow and compete.  
  
Q. Khris, they got you at that 3, kept an 8 ‑to‑2 run, and from there you
guys kind of seized it. Could you talk about how big that was and was it
deflating to them, do you think?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: I honestly don't know. We just wanted to take that shot, use
that as momentum, just get stops. That was the main thing down the stretch,
was just keep getting stops.  
  
Q. Khris, could you talk about just what was different down the stretch,
talk about stops, but you've had games where things have gone away at the end,
a lot of close games. What do you feel was different about this game?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: I think it was mainly the same. Every game we compete hard,
but I think we just got a couple of balls to bounce our way this time.
Sometimes that happens, sometimes it doesn't. But sometimes you just have to
go out there keep competing.  
  
Q. Elston, how does it feel to play a team back to back? Does it make it
easier or tougher to prepare for this game?  
ELSTON TURNER: I mean, we said in the locker room earlier everybody's used to
it because you played AU and sometimes we have to play three or four games in
a day. So we're pretty used to it.  
Just gotta rest our legs and just be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, your players played a lot of minutes. How are you going to rest
them up tonight for a quick turnaround tomorrow?  
COACH KENNEDY: We're just excited to keep playing. You build momentum in
tournament play. The first game is‑‑ if you don't win the first game, you feel
like you haven't even been in the tournament.  
So we're going to rest up, get some cold tubs, get these guys in the cold tubs
and do the best we can to be as ready as possible.  
  
Q. Khris and Elston, you guys have come in with five ‑game losing streak.
You broke that tonight. What does that do for a confidence factor going
forward?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: I mean, my confidence was still high during that losing
streak. We were playing hard. We just couldn't come out with it. But each game
you've got to put each last game behind you and keep moving forward. I think
we did that.  
ELSTON TURNER: Just, you know, kind of like what Khris said, we just gotta put
it behind us and fortunately we came out with the win. We feel even more
confident with tomorrow's game because we have played Kansas close for both
games. And we feel like we can beat them.  
So tomorrow's going to be tough, but I feel like with the way everything's
going we can get the win.  
  
Q. Elston, could you just talk about that 10 ‑point little run you had at
the end of the first half from a personal standpoint? You hit a couple of 3s,
most of your scoring there, and that seemed to provide you guys with a lift.
You've kind of been a streaky scorer this season. Were you just feeling it at
that point?   
ELSTON TURNER: Yeah, I guess you could say that. I was really just trying to
get us jump started. It was a back‑and‑forth game: They would take the lead;
we would take the lead; it would be tied up.  
We just needed a lift before the end of the first half, and I just tried to
fulfill that role and get our team to pretty much get a lead.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the victory.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You hit three shots outside of the paint in the entire second half, but
they all came in that flurry about a minute apart. Just kind of talk about
that stretch there.  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, it was from three of our upperclassmen. I thought Dash
was open, and after we had moved the ball from side to side a little bit and
it was under ten seconds, and he hit a big shot.  
And fortunately the next opportunity David got what we called a second cut at
the elbow and was confident enough to shoot it. Dash made a great play on the
baseline drive, and Khris had some good looks. And I knew he was due to make
one.  
What I like about Khris is it doesn't shake his confidence, and he stepped up
and made a big 3 when he wasn't shooting the ball as well as he's capable of.  
  
Q. You were able to play Kansas very close at home, two low ‑scoring games,
what do you credit it to and will that be a similar challenge tomorrow in this
similar environment in KC?  
COACH KENNEDY: We're excited to be playing. And hopefully we attribute it a
little bit to our defense. We tried to limit Thomas Robinson both times and
make other guys beat us. Kansas is so good, other guys are capable of beating
you. Elijah Johnson had 18points the first half against us to build a good
10‑point lead.  
And we were playing from behind from then on, and we have to hope they miss
from the 3‑point line, because they're so good in the post and build up such a
great job of getting those guys in position, and Thomas Robinson and Jeff
Withey together is probably one of the best post tandems in the country. So we
gotta be inside out and hope they miss perimeter jump shots and we give them
one shot.  
  
Q. Could you talk about David's two big offensive rebounds for you in the
last few minutes and his hustle in that time?  
COACH KENNEDY: We told our guys throughout the game to continue to go to the
offensive glass. Defensively they switch a lot. And we had some mismatches on
the offensive glass I thought a little bit if we aggressively went after it.
Fortunately we were able to get the right bounces and guys went after the
glass. I thought Ray Turner and David both did a good job, and Khris rebounded
the ball well for us also.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about how you were able to slow Thomas Robinson
particularly at your place. What did you feel you were able to do to slow him
down? He was noticeably frustrated during that game.  
COACH KENNEDY: We swarmed him with about three guys. We really just tried to
attack him and make him kick it out. And he's such a good player over the
course of the game he wears you down.  
Again, we were fortunate and were able to get him‑‑ I think he had two fouls
the first time we played them in the first half, and the second time we
swarmed him and he kicked it out and Elijah made some big shots.  
  
Q. Daniel Alexander hasn't been playing well or hasn't even been playing a
lot lately. In the first half he came out had five big rebounds. What was the
key to getting him going in the first half?  
COACH KENNEDY: I just thought Ray picked up two fouls and Daniel's been
practicing better the last couple of weeks. Our team, we've had our whole
group except Kourtney obviously the last two or three weeks and you get better
in practice. And we've gotten better in practice since the Oklahoma State
game. And guys have really made more of an effort in practice to get better
and start‑‑ Daniel was one reason‑‑ Daniel did a good job in practice. I think
he prepared himself better than he has in the past.  
  
Q. Could you go back, you opened about the defense against their post. Could
you elaborate just what was working and what you set out to do.  
COACH KENNEDY: Are you talking about the Oklahoma game?  
  
Q. This game, you said you saw him switch your defense, able to stop them in
the post.  
COACH KENNEDY: The Oklahoma game? We really doubled off on the perimeter. And
we really tried to attack and double teams. I thought Naji Hibbert, when he
played, did a great job trapping. Dash Harris, and we forced him to shoot 3s,
and in the first half they missed shots and they started to drive us the
second half. Instead of shooting 3s, they really just tried to drive the ball
and get to the free‑throw line, which they did a pretty good job of.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  62  
Oklahoma  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Oklahoma Sooners to the interview room, coach
Lon Kruger and student‑athletes Sam Grooms and Romero Osby.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH KRUGER: First of all, congratulations to A&M. I thought they did a lot
of good things. All night they seemed to be quicker with loose balls, and then
the offensive boards really hurt us as well.  
But at this point in the season this group, they've worked hard all year,
despite the way it looked tonight. I think they've made some progress, and
we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, and look forward to
getting started on that right away.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Romero, you only touched the ball with a chance to score I think five
times in the first half. What was A &M doing to keep the ball out of your
hands?   
ROMERO OSBY: They were trying to do a good job of fronting me in the post, not
letting me post up and trying to ride me off screens, not really letting me
set a ball screen, kind of like Coach wants us to do with everyone else.  
They were really physical with me and trying not to let me get to the
offensive boards as well. And I think they did a good job of it. I wasn't
being aggressive enough and really getting low and getting my body into guys
and being able to demand the position that I needed to. And they end up
winning that battle.  
  
Q. After you guys tied it in the second half, both of you guys, I think you
had two missed shots, two turnovers when you had a chance to really take the
momentum back. What happened there?  
SAM GROOMS: Obviously we tied the game up, fought back. Missed two shots and
had two turnovers and they converted on I think both of those possessions and
they went back up four. And I don't know, when you miss easy ones around the
rim and you turn the ball over, you give Big 12 teams the opportunity to go
back the other way and to make plays, they're going to do it.  
So it's mostly on our part. You can credit Texas A&M for what they did, but we
gotta finish plays and limit our turnovers.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what this season was like with the new coach and
then looking forward to next season, how you felt the season went?  
SAM GROOMS: It was great for me. Playing for Coach Kruger, he taught me a lot
of things, him being a point guard himself. Broke down a lot of film and I
learned a lot of things that this whole year that probably‑‑ I probably
wouldn't have learned.  
And as far as the team, I was excited to play with these guys. It didn't go
the way we wanted it to, but we have next year and we're going to get ready to
go to work and get better. And playing for a coach like this, you don't have
that long.  
ROMERO OSBY: Following up with what Sam said, it was great playing for Coach.
I learned a lot. He put me in some situations to really challenge me, and
that's what I needed. That's what I needed as a player and as a man.  
As far as playing with my teammates, I think it was great playing with them, I
just hate to go out like this with the seniors we have, those guys, we're
really close and we work hard.  
But I'm excited also to have Coach coming back next year and having us all
coming back next year and seeing what we can do, and hopefully we can do some
damage.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Is this sort of indicative of the season, that it was always a five
‑minute lull or tonight it was offensive rebounds, another game it may be
turnovers or not shooting it well? Was it sort of like that all year long, you
just couldn't quite get over the hump?  
COACH KRUGER: When you don't win a lot of games, as many as you want to,
consistency is probably going to be a problem. And exactly like you said,
whether it be maybe turnovers one night or offensive boards, generally it's a
stretch in the ballgame we had difficulty in overcoming. But I just thought
loose balls, offensive boards, I thought A&M was quicker in all of those than
we were.  
A game that's pretty tight back and forth most of the way, oftentimes it will
be the difference.  
  
Q. Got T.J. Franklin in the game for the last 25seconds or so. Could you
talk about the importance of him for this program and just being able to do
that for him?  
COACH KRUGER: T.J.'s attitude is outstanding. He's a guy that only cares about
the program and whatever he can do to help his teammates get better every day,
a guy that's been there consistently from the start, with very positive
outlook and a lot of energy, and really highly respected by all his teammates
and coaches for sure.  
  
Q. You constantly talk about learning to be a little bit more competitive,
play hard for 40minutes. Talk a little bit about some of the newcomers,
whether it's Amath or a couple of these freshmen, seems like that may be some
of the guys that next year will help the entire team because there will be
more energy, more effort?  
COACH KRUGER: The guys returning have to crank it up a lot for sure. And then
the new guys coming in, new faces, fresh outlook. We've got to learn how to
compete a lot harder and compete to get a winning result and can't settle for
less than that.  
And, again, in a lot of different areas we've got a lot of work to do. And yet
we know this group will get back after it and try to make the progress.  
  
Q. Can you just sum up your first season at Oklahoma, how it was for you,
how you saw your players improve over the year?  
COACH KRUGER: Generally I thought they played with a certain level of
enthusiasm, consistently worked hard every day in practice to get better. I
liked that about this group from the start.  
We have to be more physical. We have to be more aggressive. We have to get
after loose balls more, rebounding at the Big 12 level. A long way to go in
that area.  
A lot of work to do. But, again, I like their attitude, like their work ethic
and willingness to do that. We have to compete a lot harder, to get the result
we want. Whether it be setting a screen or blocking out or getting on the
floor after a loose ball, all those things we have to grow a lot in those
areas.  
But, again, I like their approach every day in practice. They came with an
energy. They came with an enthusiasm and know we have to get better and they
get right back to work after it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  76  
Texas Tech  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Travis Ford from Oklahoma State.
Student‑athletes will be Cezar Guerrero, Brian Williams, and Keiton Page.  
Coach, first we'll go to you for your thoughts on tonight's victory.  
COACH FORD: Well, words really can't describe how proud I am of our basketball
team. They continue to amaze me. Our basketball team has been through a lot of
serious injuries, and especially to go through one in the last week or the
last game of the regular season, and the last two or three days we've had to
start playing guys‑‑ Brian has not been playing the 4 for a month and a half,
two months. C.J.'s been playing 15, 16minutes. He plays 30minutes. Then you've
got Christien Sager who we've asked to come in and play some serious time and
Soucek.  
And for these guys to continue to play as hard as they are, and it's just fun
to watch. They're fun to coach.  
We've just concentrated the last couple of days on trying to play hard. And
these guys have done a good job of trying to adjust to some of the things
we've had to change up a little bit in the last couple of days.  
I'm just proud of them. Very, very proud of their effort. And this was a
really good win. This was one of the better wins for us as far as what we've
been through.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. C.J., it looked like there was a point there where maybe guys were
dragging a little bit. Did you feel like maybe you needed to provide a spark
there second half and you kind of got a couple of 3s and a basket?  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Well, I felt like I just needed to bring energy in, just get
these guys going again. And I'm very thankful that my guys set me up and got
me open looks. They were playing a triangle and 2, so they were guarding the
point guard and they had a man on K.P. So it left me wide open.  
So luckily my teammates just got me open and I hit the shots. I was really
feeling it today. And it felt great coming out.  
  
Q. You're one guy among the guys who are available to play, really not tired
this time of year, right? There was that point in the season where you didn't
have to play a lot. You had some fresh legs out there tonight.  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Yeah, I have a lot of fresh legs. And I just came in bringing
the spark. And just bringing the energy like I always do before and just get
these guys going with the intensity and the energy that I bring to the team.  
And it just so happens, I just got going, and I mean, I just went off, got
16points.  
  
Q. Cezar, you had zero shots in the first half, and then you shot it 11
times in the second half. Was it a game ‑plan thing or your confidence was
there? What was it?  
CEZAR GUERRERO: I felt like we just knew the game plan that Texas Tech had,
and it just left me wide open, so they just gave me the ball and just open
looks, and I felt confident today in my shot like I was before in the
beginning of the season.  
So I started hitting my shot and just felt comfortable, and they just kept on
going to me and just went off from there.  
  
Q. Keiton, you've been through a lot in the four years and Coach Ford was
talking about how much adversity you've been through this season. Could you
maybe talk about that element and kind of finishing up your career with these
guys and not wanting it to end a little bit?  
KEITON PAGE: We've definitely been through our adversity this year and had ups
and downs, tough close games. These guys made it easier this year. They've had
their heads up the entire way, always keeping their heads up, always wanting
to work harder the next day and always wanting to get back on the practice
floor and become better players and become a better team.  
So, yeah, through all the adversity we've had, we're still fighting and
everybody still has great attitudes. And just taking it one game at a time and
just battling and just fighting to keep this thing alive.  
  
Q. Keiton, Coach said this is a great win. You don't have a couple of days
to think about this and make tune ‑ups from it. How do you keep the momentum
going forward to tomorrow's night game?  
KEITON PAGE: Gotta stay focussed. A win's good for right now, but we have to
get our mind on Missouri now. We know how tough a team they are. We've played
them twice now. We're 1‑1 against them.  
We've got a decent feel for them. Just got to get back, get focused and start
watching film on them and preparing for them tomorrow.  
  
Q. Since Keiton touched on that already, I'll ask Brian and Cezar your
thoughts on Missouri going into this game, a team you've obviously beaten at
home, but a game you probably didn't want to remember in Columbia. Your
thoughts for going for round three against Mizzou?  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: We didn't exactly play the way we wanted to there at Columbia.
I'm excited to get another chance. It doesn't always happen. We'll get to the
film room and start studying Missouri.  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Exactly the same thing. I'm ready to get this game against
Missouri underway and just going into the film room and just study and get a
great game plan from Coach Ford and just get the game going tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brian, when Tech came back from 12 down to take the lead briefly, did you
consider that to be a scary moment in the game?  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: It was scary considering the fact that this loss could have
ended our season. So everybody just kind of thought about it like that, like
it's do or die this time of year.  
So C.J. just came in and hit some big baskets, and we fed off of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You were saying the other day that Cezar, his shot wasn't where you
thought it was going to be, because you thought maybe you were talking to him
about being more of like a pass first point guard. Second half he shot well
and shot you back into the game. Just talk about that second half from him.  
COACH FORD: I don't know if‑‑ his shot has been fine. We've just been working
on him to pass a little bit more first. I don't think anything's been wrong
with his shot at all.  
He's capable of making shots at any point in time. Tonight they were playing a
triangle and 2. And we found him open one time and noticed that they weren't
guarding him, so we told our guys just send Keiton one way and throw it back
to C.J.  
And once he made one‑‑ I've seen that before‑‑ he's definitely capable of
making two, three from that point. But he has the capability to score. When
he's playing‑‑ when he's able‑‑ we've put him in situations this year where he
hasn't been able to just get into a flow. Put him in there two, three minutes
to give somebody a rest, and then we bring him back out. It's kind of tough
for a guy like him who is a natural scorer, that's really what he is, and he's
really developing.  
We want him to continue to be able to do that. But you're also playing a
point. You've got to get your team into an offense and you've got‑‑ you can't
look to score all the time. That's what he's gotten better at. He's gotten
better at that, and that's what we've seen. But he's always been able to make
some shots. We just‑‑ he hasn't been getting long enough minutes, significant
minutes to get hot like he did tonight.  
  
Q. Advantage to have beaten Missouri once this year?  
COACH FORD: I don't know. They took it to us pretty good in Columbia the last
time out. But it can't hurt. Gives our team a little bit of confidence. We
were a different team. Our team is made up a little different than it has all
year long.  
But I've said I've got a tremendous amount of respect for Missouri and their
players, and I think Frank Haith has done one of the more amazing jobs in
college basketball this year.  
They're a really good basketball team. Their kids, a lot of respect for their
kids. And it's going to be a very tough game. We just gotta get off our feet.
I don't know, Jimmy or somebody mentioned we were a tired basketball team out
there a couple times tonight. End of the first half, we got up 11 or 12,
whatever it was, 13 in the first half, last two minutes we let them get out in
transition because we were a little fatigued, we didn't get back.  
So we've got to make sure that we get our guys some rest, and we'll study the
tape and see. But it's going to be a great challenge.  
  
Q. When you were in the position that you're in, shorthanded, you have to
get contributions from everybody. Your walk ‑on, Christien Sager, scores five
points tonight?  
COACH FORD: Unbelievable tonight. Not only did he score some points, but he
made some unbelievable defensive plays, some steals, rebounds. He brings a
toughness to our basketball team, a real toughness.  
I hope he sticks with it. Because I think he's a guy eventually that could be
a regular rotation guy eventually for us.  
But he really helped us win this game. He was a big, big factor. So was
Soucek. They all were. They all got in there and battled and overachieved and
played better than they have been.  
That's what it's going to take. And I can't stress enough what we've been
through. We have not really even‑‑ we had myself, Coach Middleton and Coach
Pierre practicing yesterday. We probably practiced harder than the rest of the
guys did, because we don't need to get anybody hurt. We don't have a lot of
guys. Guys are playing positions they have not been playing for a while.  
And I'm just so proud of them, because I thought we played against a Texas
Tech team that's been playing well, they really have, and I thought they
played well tonight. Our guys are just trying as hard as they can.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  76  
Texas Tech  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Red Raiders of Texas Tech, coach
Billy Gillispie and student‑athletes Jaye Crockett and Jordan Tolbert.  
Coach, opening comments.  
COACH GILLISPIE: As a game, I thought we had a great chance to win. We got in
a great position to do it, and just made some critical errors and gave some
easy baskets up. And then to their credit, they made a couple of big shots and
we turned the ball over too much, let them get it out there again. And before
you know it, they had too big of a deficit for us to overcome.  
So I give them credit for advancing. Good luck to them as they move forward in
the Big 12 tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jaye, you guys talked a lot this year about peaking at this right time
and kind of really setting your sights on this game tonight. And right there
having a lead in the second half, how kind of disappointing is it the way it
sort of ended tonight?  
JAYE CROCKETT: Anytime you start letting a lead‑‑ I mean, we were up by 1 at
one point I think, and anytime you let a lead get away, it's devastating.  
We just did simple things like turn the ball over. We weren't getting all the
defensive rebounds. They were getting layups on us, and that was just too easy
for them and we didn't make it difficult enough.  
  
Q. Jaye, that run, as soon as you guys did take the lead it was a 15 ‑0 run
in about three and a half minutes. What was sort of the biggest problems you
guys were having defensively during that stretch?  
JAYE CROCKETT: We weren't getting stops. It was easy buckets. A lot of times
my man would drive me to the hole. Sometimes we weren't in the help‑‑ we were
in a triangle and 2 at one point. They hit some 3s. It went away from there.  
  
Q. Jordan, how much fuel is this going to give you going forward the way
this ended tonight and the motivation you're going to carry into the
offseason?  
JORDAN TOLBERT: It's a great game to build off of. We had a lot of positives
as far as defense and rebounding and pushing the ball, defensive rebounds. So
it's a great thing to build off of.  
  
Q. Jordan, could you just talk about how far this team has come since the
beginning of the Big 12 season and what you think the future holds for this
group?  
JORDAN TOLBERT: We've come a very long way. When we first started it was very
tough. But we never stopped. We always kept fighting. And as the season goes
on, the wins and the losses, they don't show it, but we know that we got
better in a lot of different aspects of the game. So just waiting for next
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same question, kind of a lot ‑‑ focus on this game and
you talked a lot this year about wanting to peak. What were your thoughts on
the way it ended tonight?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I noticed at the start you all were identifying yourself of
who you were and where you were from and who you represented, so I wish you
would all go ahead and do that.  
It's hard to see. I was just playing. Poor attempt at humor, obviously.  
But I thought we'd play our best game of the year and came out and just made
some‑‑ we just‑‑ they try as hard as they could possibly try all year long.
But it's just like‑‑ it seems like we've continued to be the coyote and the
roadrunner deal where the anvil always hits you on the head.  
Just too many times that happened tonight and over the course of the season
where you're in good shape to do something, lose the ball, you don't get it,
they turn it into a dunk.  
It didn't really happen in the first half too much except right at the start
of the game we got down pretty early, and then I think we were down 13 and
ended up being down 5 at half on a pretty good run.  
But even at the last 30seconds of the half really kind of shows you what's
gone on with us all year long as far as we need to be better thinkers of the
game, because we go in and we shoot it with 18 or 20seconds to go in the half
and Jaye does a great job to get an offensive rebound.  
At that time what you should do is take the last shot of the half. We don't,
they end up with the balls, Ty runs over a guy, that's why we subbed him.
Those are things difficult to overcome. Third foul, fourth foul wasn't the
smartest foul either. Those are things where you're trying really hard, but
you have to think the game a little bit better than we thought it especially
at critical junctures.  
We got ahead of the game‑‑ we got ahead in the game 36‑35 tonight, and then
after that we had a timeout very shortly after and Guerrero makes two shots.
We told him he's going to be the guy that going to make the shot, and we
didn't really contest him.  
He had to make the shot, but we didn't contest him like we needed to, and the
game was kind of over at that time because we had turnovers on the other end
or poor shot selection.  
So while we tried really hard all year long, they never gave up. And so you
look at our record definitely in conference and everybody knows me, knows I'm
not much on losing. We lost too much as far as that goes. And we'll get that
fixed in short time. But it could have been a lot worse.  
To the credit of the players, those guys, they learned, as you saw in
practice, came to several practices, many practices over the course of the
year, they were a new group.  
We never made an excuse, we've got 10 new players. We never made an excuse,
we've got all these freshmen. When I hear all these things about other teams,
they always talk about how many freshmen they have and how many injuries
they've had. It's nothing we've ever promoted or will accept as an excuse and
we won't as we move forward. And so I'm proud of that.  
Those guys always kept their head up and they continued to get better as the
season went along. Like Jordan said, the wins and losses don't exactly show
what they were exactly made out of or exactly how much they improved. But they
kept fighting until the very end. And it could have been a lot worse, if you
would have had a team that didn't really care. These guys really cared and
they really cared about each other.  
And so what you have there is when you're saying that, you're saying the wins,
the losses still add up to the same, that's the bottom line of the business,
and I understand that more than anyone, but what we've done, we've set the
foundation of how we're going to move forward.  
There's so many things. I've been through it before. And it was very similar
to what we went through at Texas El Paso, and those guys really learned to
work and love each other and took care of everything off the court and in the
classroom and all those kind of things. And I'm not a Bill Murray saying it
just doesn't matter, because it does matter.  
But they've got the foundation set as we move forward to build our program,
and it will be built in a big hurry I think because of a lot of the efforts of
the players that have been here. I hope I used up all my time on that.  
  
Q. You've talked about what this team has done off the court and all the
things you want, but in terms of maybe what you need from your lineup and the
talent you have and what you maybe need to add to this, what do you think you
need for next year, Billy?  
COACH GILLISPIE: We'll start assessing that. We've done some things in
recruiting already and we've had inconsistent play from every position. And
we've had inconsistent coaching, I'm sure, too. So we'll assess that as we
move forward.  
And we'll get closer. It takes a little time. It takes a little time to get a
complete roster like you want it. But we've got to get faster. We've got to
get bigger. We've got to get stronger.  
A lot of that happens when you have more mature players. So our guys are going
to get stronger. Once you get bigger, you'll be stronger. And that really
gives you a great deal of confidence a lot of times. And all this experience
all these guys have had, every single player on our team had an opportunity to
play minutes, and we've played probably more guys than I've ever played as far
as the numbers. We played everyone that was basically eligible to play as far
as‑‑ I mean, all of them are doing great academically, but I mean regarding
redshirts and all those kinds of things.  
So they've had great opportunities, and those minutes should be great teachers
for them. And they're great young people.  
And so if they'll just look at what happened to them this year, the good, the
bad, and they'll try to move forward. I think it will be a little
different‑looking group even though it may be the same guys.  
But we've got to get faster. That's the thing. And every single time‑‑ I've
said this several times. But Seabiscuit is a very good movie and I remember
the scene where Seabiscuit goes through the gate and he's about two feet
shorter than Gary Steven's horse, maybe more admirable or whatever, and he's
looking down at him. Every single time we went up for the jump it seemed like
we were Seabiscuit about two feet shorter and about 100 pounds lighter per
man.  
So we've got to get stronger, we've got to get bigger, faster, we've got to
get more skill, and you can develop skill. So we have to improve in every
single area, including coaching. It all starts with me. And I'm the head of
the program; I'll take responsibility for every loss we had.  
And we'll move forward and every single aspect of the program we'll move
forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  50  
CINCINNATI  44

  
COACH PITINO: Well, I think you can see how excited our guys are and how much
the tournament means to us. We wanted to come in here and start to play better
basketball. We started to get healthy about three weeks ago and started
playing guys more minutes, and it was‑‑ our practices have been a lot of fun,
even though we lost to Syracuse the last game of the season. It meant a lot to
these two guys being seniors to win this championship, and they played every
game.  
This game was very difficult, and we knew it would be, no matter how much we
tried to push the pace. They know us as well as we know ourselves. We know
them as well as they know themselves. Mick and I worked together, and we know
the way each other think. We just‑‑ it's very difficult to play two teams that
know each other so well an hour and 20 minutes down the road. It was going to
be a defensive battle. We knew we were going to give up some lay‑ups because
we were guarding the NBA line with our life, and prior to Chane going for a
steal, we were able to blank them from the line. So we did a lot of really
good things defensively. We knew it was going to take defense to win this
game. We thought it was going to take offense to beat Marquette, we thought it
was going to take defense to win this one.  
  
Q. You played great defense all year, now you're healthy, had a good
performance this week. How do you feel about this team going into next week?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I told the guys just two weeks ago, I said look, we've got
to get through the last two games, and we'll go change and go back to the way
we normally play because we'll have some numbers. We still have a couple of
guys that aren't ready to play the type of defense. Wayne is starting to get
it, but he's still away from that. Kevin is struggling with it. But getting
Wayne and staying healthy is a big thing for us because with all these
timeouts, it is so long, you don't have to use your bench quite as much. So
that's a good situation for us.  
  
Q. This is, I think, the first conference championship without a founding
member. I guess some people might view it as a changing of the guard in the
BIG EAST. From your perspective how different, if at all, did it feel to
you?  
COACH PITINO: You know, I'm a traditionalist, and I'm very disappointed that
teams are leaving, certainly. But this world today, like I told the guys, even
in our town, our players felt it. We lost a couple of games, and people said,
you can't score, you're not that good, and I said, guys, don't worry about
that. Peyton was getting a lot of criticism. I said, Peyton, just kidding
around to him, you go into New York and be MVP and nobody will even remember
you played a regular season. I used the analogy of the Giants. I said do you
think the New York fans can remember who the Giants lost to? All they remember
is beating the Packers and moving on. That's the worst thing about your
culture: The gratification is so short, and the way they handle failure is so
short that it's one game removed.  
My brother‑in‑law, who I lost in 9/11, always used to say your business is so
much different than mine, and that was right before 9/11. He said, on Wall
Street, we're only as good as our last trade. You guys have longevity. But not
anymore. You get on a two‑game losing streak and you can't believe how much
panic there is in this world. So we try not to get too high, not to get too
low, and these guys didn't, and we always felt this tournament is a new season
because it's a tournament and you get to play great competition, and the BIG
EAST right now is taking on a whole new thing. It's disappointing that we're
losing some teams, but on the other hand, we are inviting. I think you guys
will be excited about Temple, and I don't know a whole lot about some of the
other teams coming in, but it's just a change. Everybody wants change
nowadays. Let's go to this league. You see Nebraska leave and go to this
league, this one jumps to this league. It's bizarre how everybody just leaves.  
It reminds me a lot of when you watch the movies and you see people
constantly, oh, I'm with you forever. I'm with you forever. I'm with you
forever, and you see these mobster movies, all of a sudden in the Godfather
I'm selling him out. It's only business. I can't believe it, it becomes
business, and great analogy, but I always think of that when everybody is
ready to jump. I say, why don't you like where you are. Somebody mentioned to
me, you've been very stable the way you stayed at all those jobs all those
years, and I looked at him and I said, "good point."  
  
Q. How special is winning the BIG EAST Championship to you?  
COACH PITINO: You know, it's special because I love coaching these guys. We
have a very unusual group. It's a throw‑back. This young man here, he'll speak
in a few minutes, I coached him for four years, came in as a walk‑on, was
dying to go to Duke as a walk‑on. His goals weren't very lofty, and then‑‑ I
said walk‑on about Duke, not about Duke. It goes from that to last week they
were asking me do you think he could get a shot at the NBA. And I kicked him
out of my office and said I don't want to think about it. He's really grown to
that point.  
Chris has led a different life. He's been in with a very celebrated brother,
and both of them have been great to coach, and they know what this means. Both
of them, Chris had a great game tonight, and they've been knocked by the NCAA,
and this meant a lot. This was a great starting point for both of these guys.
We've got a great group. You saw how much enthusiasm they had for winning that
championship. It means so much to them to win.  
  
Q. This is for Kyle: Obviously you guys have more games to play in the
tournament, but what does this mean to you, especially given the growth you've
had over your four years as a player?  
KYLE KURIC: It means a lot, but I don't really think about it as my growth. We
had a real rough season, and coach talked to us about a new season, and we
took it to heart and Peyton led us the whole way from the beginning, and we
all followed him as a team.  
  
Q. Chris, they talked about not having that focus tonight. You guys had it
the entire time. How do you continue it into the NCAA Tournament?  
CHRIS SMITH: Well, we continue it by just staying with the same mindset and
growing on what we've built here.  
  
Q. Kyle, you mentioned Peyton. What difference did you see from him the last
four or five days or was there something special?  
KYLE KURIC: You could tell he stepped into the role we needed him to play. The
Peyton that we're all used to, you could tell he didn't want to lose and he
wasn't going to let us lose. Anytime something happened, he would pick
somebody, every timeout, he was always talking. He was very vocal.  
  
Q. Coach, Mick, when he was in here talked about his team and he sensed some
overconfidence from them. Did you sense that from them?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we played great defense at their place, held them to 32
percent shooting, but they made 11 threes, and against Syracuse they made
eight threes in the first half. Our strategy was very simple, we were going to
show zone, play man but we were going to guard the NBA line. We were going to
limit their attempt and if they did get an attempt, it was not going to be a
good look. Prior to Chane going for a steal there, we didn't give them good
looks, and they were 0 for 9, I believe, at halftime from the three. We knew
they were going to go one‑on‑one. We felt good with Gorgui being back there.
He's learned now to foul being back there. So we knew we had to win this game
with defense. We played a heck of a game against them at their place and lost.
We showed the guys why we lost, but we wanted to stop the three‑point line
tonight. We've been winning off our defense. We knew, although both teams were
trying to push the pace, we know each other too well, and you don't have time
to innovate your offenses with one day prep.  
  
Q. Had you been able to slow it down ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: No, we didn't try to slow it down, we tried to run. Both
defenses were great.  
  
Q. You've mastered every pace in this tournament. Is that going to prepare
you better for whatever match you get in the tournament?  
COACH PITINO: Well, it's not the players' fault. We started out, we had a very
difficult time practicing. We've had three knee surgeries, Peyton Siva was out
a month, we've had five concussions, multiple concussions, Kyle missed two,
three weeks. So we had probably more injuries‑‑ so we never had any
continuity. And if I would have run and press and go crazy up in the‑‑ all I
would do in the last ten minutes of the game is tire our own team. So we had
to get to this point where everybody got healthy. We've got three guys wearing
helmets in practice.  
  
Q. Are you injured, as well?  
COACH PITINO: Russ Smith bet I couldn't dunk, and I told him I could. I went
up and grabbed the rim and scraped it, and I came very close to dunking. I
just pulled it on the rim.

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Yancy Gates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19360)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  50  
CINCINNATI  44

  
COACH CRONIN: Well, obviously wasn't our best night. Give all the credit to
Louisville. Very happy for Coach Pitino, love him like a brother. I wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for him. So I'm very, very happy for him. Very
disappointed for my players because we didn't give our best effort tonight. I
take nothing away from Louisville. We have a tendency to get over‑confident at
times. I thought that was an issue for us.  
But I give Louisville credit. I don't like to say that we play bad. I hate
when coaches do that.  
The other thing I would say was just from an X and O standpoint, our passing
was as bad as it's been‑‑ I'm sorry, our lack thereof. So I was very, very
disappointed in that we dug a hole because we wouldn't pass the ball. We had
one assist in the first half.  
  
Q. What do you think caused them to be overconfident?  
COACH CRONIN: Yeah, if you've followed us all the time complacency is an
issue. It cost us a couple games early in the year that it shouldn't have
because we're just over‑confident. We have a tendency to be on cruise control.
I would have been much happier if we had to play Syracuse again tonight where
my guys would have thought that we had to have a great effort. The fact that
we beat Louisville‑‑ I said it to Bill yesterday, that was a big concern of
mine with our guys.  
  
Q. The offense picked up in the second half. Was that because you passed
better then?  
COACH CRONIN: We actually executed what was being called and passed the ball.
But our lack of free throw‑‑ the comeback was tough, but when you're making a
comeback you have to make free throws. We didn't do that. 1 for 7 in the
second half, you've got no chance to make a comeback if you do that. You're 5
for 7, and instead of being down four you'd be tied.  
  
Q. You had that 16 ‑6 run that you closed the game out on. JaQuon really got
a little more aggressive. Were you happy to see that they were executing what
you wanted?   
COACH CRONIN: You know, this is a simple game. The team that executes and
plays harder wins, and Louisville did that tonight. It gave us a chance when
we started executing and passing the ball. But it's my job to get them to do
that, and obviously I didn't get the job done with that tonight. So I always
try to self‑evaluate. You hold a team to 35 percent shooting, you should win
the game. 50 points, you should win the game, with our talent level. But we
didn't play team basketball on offense until it was too late.  
  
Q. You did talk last night about your fear of overconfidence. Did you sense
going into this game that ‑‑  
COACH CRONIN: They just admitted it to me. They just admitted it to me.  
  
Q. That they were overconfident?  
COACH CRONIN: We just have a tendency to go to cruise control at times.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CRONIN: Well, you've got to be able to defend, you know, because when
you get in the NCAA Tournament, 99 percent of the teams have a good team.
They're there for a reason. You know, even if they didn't have a great overall
record, they got hot late and they're playing well. So I think that if you
can't get some stops, you can't win. And I think leadership‑‑ if you were to
ask me one thing, I think, that affects winning, especially in basketball,
whether it's the pros or college, leadership from players.  
  
Q. Mic just said that you guys admitted to him that you were overconfident.
Did you think that was a problem?  
YANCY GATES: Yeah, I was the one that said it. I could tell the difference in
the way we was getting ready for the game today. A lot of people didn't have
the same focus as we did when we first got out here, and I think because we
won our first two games, they were so tough and we won them the way we did, we
kind of felt like Louisville was going to come in here and kind of give it to
us, but I think it was the reverse, we came in here and gave it to them
because we weren't prepared to play a hard game until the second half, so we
paid the price for it.  
  
Q. Cash, does this feel like an ending? Your season isn't over, but it's the
end of this championship.  
CASHMERE WRIGHT: No, it's not the ending. We've still got games to play. We
can't lock back, we can't look at this game no more. It's over. We can't mope
no more. We've just got to look forward and keep pushing in practice and get
better.  
  
Q. The win over Syracuse, did that give you the confidence that you could
beat anybody in the country?  
COACH CRONIN: Well, I try to impart to my team that I believe most teams that
are good teams can beat anybody. But we're also capable of losing to anybody.
You know, there's only one or two teams, I think, that can have a bad night
and still win. And in the NCAA Tournament, I don't know if that exists. I
don't think‑‑ there's not enough NBA players stacked on teams like the '90s in
college basketball, and I firmly believe whatever happens in the NCAA
Tournament, you could replay it and have totally different results. There's
that much parity.  
But I think for the kids, what I try to tell my guys is it's a great
opportunity.  
  
Q. Cash, what finally got you guys going offensively the second half?  
CASHMERE WRIGHT: We started playing with our heart, and we came out thinking
we were going to win like Yancy said. We weren't playing with our heart, and
we were just playing off last game. Then in the second half we realized they
weren't going to give us the game so we had to go take it, but after we
started pushing, it was too late.  
  
Q. When Cincinnati came into the BIG EAST, you faced some adversity early
‑‑  
COACH CRONIN: There's the understatement of the press conference.  
  
Q. But you've reached this level in the BIG EAST championship. In the next
couple years there's a flux of new teams that are coming in. Do you see the
potential for some of these other programs that will be coming in?  
COACH CRONIN: I'll say what Jim Calhoun said six years ago. I wouldn't want to
be a young coach trying to build a program in this league, and I'm glad I'm
not anymore. But I will say, fame is fleeting, too. There's a fine line
between 12th place and 5th place in our conference. There's teams that finish
there with McDonald's All‑Americans and talent. So you've got to make sure
you've got winners in your program and develop winners.  
We're here tonight‑‑ obviously you know, the guys know me, I'm a competitor. I
wanted this more for them than for me because I'm where I want to be in life.
I'm with who I want to be right now. But I know where they want to go. You've
got to develop winners in your program, and we're here because these guys have
really fought hard to rebuild our program. Coaches get a lot of credit. No
coaches win without players.  
  
Q. Yancy, you were visibly frustrated a couple times in the first half,
talking to some of your teammates. What were you telling them? What were you
saying up there?  
YANCY GATES: Basically, you know, I mean, when you're out on the floor you can
feel that we wasn't playing with the same intensity as we did the past few
games. I was trying to tell guys, we need to try to find a way to pick it up.
Normally the way we started the game wasn't scoring, and the way we get going
is with our defense and deflections. We tried to find a way to pick it up, and
it didn't happen until late in the second half. Like we said, by then, it was
too late. That was basically the frustration. It wasn't with any scoring or
anything. It was just how we was playing as a team.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Gorgui Dieng](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23434)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Peyton Siva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22009)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  64  
NOTRE DAME - 50

  
COACH PITINO: I've lost sort of my voice. I'm going to let Gorgui give the
introduction and opening remarks.  
GORGUI DIENG: I can't do it. What do you want me to say?  
COACH PITINO: Tell them what you thought of the game. Tell them you thought it
was brilliantly coached.  
GORGUI DIENG: It was a very physical game. We played good defense, but we got
down in the backcourt. I hope that's not going to happen to us tomorrow.  
PEYTON SIVA: It was a well coached game, a very well coached game.  
COACH PITINO: Serious. Our guys did a fabulous job because when we played them
last time we played two overtimes. I think 7 of 11 games have been in
overtime, you think about that, how scary that is. The amazing thing is the
last time we played them, including two overtimes, we got out five times on
the break. We were banged up obviously with a lot of injuries and we were
willing to play that style. Tonight we weren't. Tonight we got ahead 11 of 13
times on the break for 19 points, and we shot a very high percentage. But in a
matter of a game we had 20 assists, which is really, really good, played good
defense. So real proud of our guys. We've wanted to get to this championship
game again. We lost it last year in a very close battle, and now we get the
opportunity to play for it again, and it's a great opportunity for the players
and all our fans.  
  
Q. Just specifically offensively, what was happening maybe better tonight
than it has in the past?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we were trying to obviously push the pace. We were trying
to mix it up, and any time we got in a jam, we wanted to go inside to Gorgui
because they don't trap the post and he did a very good job tonight of going
to a variety of different moves, especially his jump hook. He's becoming a
terrific player, and we're very fortunate to have him in our program because
he's one of the most popular guys on the campus because he's such a terrific
person. So he's really improving. I'm real proud of him. He plays real hard.
And the sky's the limit to how good he can become down the road when he gets
stronger.  
  
Q. I think it was about eight minutes into the game you guys were down 15
‑9, you called a time‑out, and I don't know what was said in the time‑out but
you responded with a 20 to 2 run.   
COACH PITINO: Well, a couple things. We were playing really good defense but
we were giving up second shots. I said Gorgui can't cover Cooley by himself.
The obvious thing they were doing is run pick‑and‑rolls and get him in foul
trouble. If we get him in foul trouble today, obviously tomorrow it's
difficult for us to win. We did it the other night. So I put the two mosquitos
in the game with Russ and Peyton, and they just bother people, they just gnaw
at people, they just really, really get under your skin, and that really gave
us a big lift defensively.  
  
Q. Kind of piggybacking off that last answer, I think you held them almost
13 minutes without a field goal. Can you talk about stifling their offense?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we were putting good man pressure on it, and I thought
Russ Smith did a tremendous job of leaving his man and helping Gorgui out. He
kept saying to the guys in the time‑out, I've got Gorgui in the low post, and
he did a really, really good job of that. I think Peyton is really changing
pace, which is something he wasn't doing. He's doing a great job of changing
pace and finding people. So our offense fed off our defense and our defense
fed off our offense.  
  
Q. This is a question for Peyton and then Rick. Could you describe the ways
that the BIG EAST Conference tournament makes a team ready for the NCAAs?  
PEYTON SIVA: I mean, Coach P told us before we got in the BIG EAST, just
forget about the regular season, that we're starting a new season now, we're
going to start fresh, and everybody really bought into that. Everybody really
bought into defense on this team, and everybody was really feeding off that.
We're just taking it one game at a time right now. BIG EAST is really a tough
conference, like right now I'm beat up. I'm going to go hop in a bath after
this. But it's tough. Like Gorgui said, Jack Cooley is strong, we've got Yancy
Gates tomorrow, and it really gets us prepared for the NCAA Tournament because
of all the different defenses we see.  
COACH PITINO: I think it's a special treat. I think my players are all rooting
for Syracuse in the locker room saying they want to get a third shot at them.
I said, you guys are sick. There's something wrong with you. It's not the team
because you all know how good Cincinnati is, they beat us. It's the fans. You
have to play a road game. So any time you can get Connecticut and Syracuse out
and you can play a championship in a neutral site, it's really good for you.
So Gorgui kept yelling for Dion Waiters to score, score, score. I said, son,
you've got to realize we've lost to them twice now, let's play without 16,000
people. And the interesting thing is how many people they'll bring to Tobacco
Road. That will be interesting. There's not many Syracuse alums on Tobacco
Road.  
  
Q. Talk about Gorgui.  
COACH PITINO: He led the‑‑ we were struggling with the backboard and he led
it. He played great last night. He's a great player, and we're very, very
fortunate. They're just great guys to be around, and he's a good leader. He
gets down when he doesn't play well like anybody else, but he never lets it
affect the next day of practice or the next game. The most important thing
he's learning right now is not making silly fouls, and he's changing his pace
all the time, and that's making him a much better basketball player.  
  
Q. How much better have you gotten this year?  
GORGUI DIENG: How much better?  
COACH PITINO: Answer them. Tell them your weight when you came in.  
GORGUI DIENG: When I got in here, I weighed like 187, 197. And I started
lifting more, eating much better, and my sophomore year I weighed 244. Then it
was too high, then I lost probably 10 or 15 pounds.  
But I think he changed my whole game. Like I can tell I was kind of‑‑ I don't
want to say soft, but I wasn't physical at all. I just got on the court and
played. But he changed my whole game. He makes me like stand up, and like I
say, he changed everything. I think he's going to make me look like a better
player my junior year or my senior year.  
  
Q. So far in these last games, you guys have led the script pace wise and
every aspect of an opponent. How do you see tomorrow night, that game possibly
being played at a different pace?  
GORGUI DIENG: Like I always say, like my teammates, it's not like we're
playing. We're just trying to follow the game plan, trying to execute well,
play good defense. And I think if we play a better defense every game, it
doesn't matter, we're going to win.  
  
Q. This championship game tomorrow is going to be the first without an
original BIG EAST team. Given this crazy year we've all followed, do you see
any significance in that?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I think Conference USA has come to the Big Apple. Look,
some of us who were born in New York City and can't fathom Syracuse being in
the Atlantic Coast Conference. The strange thing about it sometimes is certain
schools don't need money. It really doesn't matter. You can't use‑‑ all of you
say money is the reason, and it really is not the reason. We're the No.1
revenue producer in college basketball by $11 million according to Forbes last
year. We made 40 and Duke was second at $29 million. So with that in mind,
when we make decisions of what to do with our program, it's based on all our
athletes and our alumni. So Tom says, okay, he polled all our athletes about
how much they love the BIG EAST, and 90 percent of them said they love it.  
Although we're going to miss Syracuse and obviously they have so many alumni
in this area, I can't fathom the why part of it. Now, everybody says fast
break. Well, we've got a better fast break conference now, so John has done a
brilliant job with that putting it all together. Memphis will be very exciting
for the league, Temple will be very exciting for the league. I think we're
really going to miss Syracuse because the side of their court says New York's
College Team. So we're going to miss them. Pitt and West Virginia were great
for our conference, but putting Memphis and Temple in place of those two,
you're replacing two great traditions with two great traditions, but we're
going to miss Syracuse.  
  
Q. What does it mean for a point guard for a guy that's a perfectionist?  
PEYTON SIVA: It's very tough playing for Coach P, but it's fun, especially
when you put in the style of running and getting out of a break. During the
season, we played a lot of slow ball and it really wasn't working for us, and
he pulled us aside and told us we're going to run Coach P ball. It's really
fun to get out there. He said it's going to be more rebounds, more steals,
more assists, more points. As players, we love stats, so it's a great program,
fun little system to play, and I love it. It's tough sometimes, but at the end
of the day, he gets results.  
  
Q. With so many injuries this year, it was kind of mix and match with missed
practices. How complete is this team right now?  
COACH PITINO: What Peyton alluded to, we always would run and press, but we
had to survive this year. We were really scared that we couldn't practice this
year. Peyton missed over 30 days. Kyle Kuric missed two weeks, and then we had
three major or knee surgeries, two ACLs and a microfracture. So we lost
everything at once. And then two of our players, Kevin and Wayne Blackshear
didn't become eligible until December and January, so we were just trying to
play slow the first time just so we could try and win games. And the guys did
a great job. And everybody was saying, well, you can't shoot, you can't‑‑
well, we couldn't because we had no bench. We had to survive. And now that we
have a bench, we have gone back‑‑ I said, look, all we have to do is get to
the postseason. We weren't going to speed South Florida up, and we could not
run up and down in the Carrier Dome with the largest crowd ever their senior
night, and it wasn't prudent to do that.  
So I told the guys, look, we're going to go back to what we planned in the
summertime in the Bahamas to running and pressing. We've got guys that can
come in, and it certainly helps Peyton's game tremendously, and it helps Kyle
Kuric's game because they can be playing in the half court. So we are still
going to have to play some half court basketball, obviously, but we did a
fabulous at that job tonight. The guys worked really well inside to out. They
screened well. They run their pick‑and‑roll well, so that's why we shot 50
some percent.  
  
Q. Is there any chance you're going to get an infrared tie?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we were worried about Syracuse getting to the finals
because of what we would look like next to them. I'm real proud of Mick
Cronin. We've got two guys in the BIG EAST that I've had the pleasure to work
with, Kevin Willard and Mick Cronin. Both took over devastated programs, both
brought them back, and Nick is a tremendous teacher, great worker. He has
tough kids that play their tails off. It did not surprise me that they won
tonight at all because they had a lead on Syracuse last time and lost and I
thought they learned a lesson. Mick had to weather the storm of people
second‑guessing him and saying you are not turn it around. Very similar to the
Tom Crean situation what he was left with and look at where he stands today
bringing this program back to the championship game. I know our guys are
really looking forward to playing a championship game, and we're really
excited about that.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Yancy Gates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19360)

### [Sean Kilpatrick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22084)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CINCINNATI  71  
SYRACUSE  68

  
COACH CRONIN: Just like we drew it up (laughter). Dion Waiters put on an
unbelievable show in the second half. I don't know what his numbers were, but
he made some big time shots to get them back in the game. Proud of our guys.
We controlled the game. Our zone obviously was highly effective for the better
part of the game. But my guys played with unbelievable toughness. To be able
to battle them on the glass even, with our lack of size, and come away with 11
steals, just a tremendous job all around by a lot of guys on our team.  
I've been telling them all year, people keep putting it that we stunned
Georgetown. We beat them four in a row. I've got faith in my team. When our
toughness rises to the level of our talent, we've got a great team. We can
beat anybody. We came here to win the tournament, and we've got one more
tomorrow night at 9:00.  
  
Q. On the three ‑pointer, you were just kind of planted down in the corner
to rotate. Can you talk about how that play unfolded?   
SEAN KILPATRICK: I mean, I just‑‑ Cashmere just told me to stay in the corner,
and then Coach was telling me to go to the corner because Kris Joseph, he was
going to come up and play cash because Cash was hot, as well, throughout the
game. Once he played Cash, I was just wide open, so Cash‑‑ it was a good thing
that Cash caught me?  
  
Q. Did you know it was good as soon as you let it go?  
COACH CRONIN: He always thinks it's good when he lets it go. Just ask anybody
in white planes.  
  
Q. You played seven guys, a lot of wear and tear. Talk about the poise you
had to maintain.  
COACH CRONIN: Yeah, because we played zone the whole game, I'm with these guys
every day, I know what they're capable of. I can tell when they're tired, and
fatigue wasn't really a factor because we lived in the zone, and we were‑‑ I
thought we got a lot of rest. We never let the game get at the pace where they
could get up and down and play in their comfort zone. They're the best
conversion team in America from defense to offense. That was a big key for us.
I think that helped us, as well, because we've got a lot of freshmen over
there on the bench and Cheikh Mbodj is a first year player as well good
tonight because of the pace of the game I didn't think these guys‑‑ I kept
asking them if they needed a sub in the timeouts, but everybody kept saying
no. I had to get a volunteer one time to get our six man rotation going.  
  
Q. If you could speak to the luxury of being up by 17 and the challenge of
how hard it is to keep a lead a whole game against a team that good.  
COACH CRONIN: Well, no matter who you're playing, the top half of our league,
the game is never over. It's human nature to flinch a little bit when they
come‑‑ obviously it's like a home game for them, which makes the win even
sweeter for us. But we hesitated for a little bit and didn't attack their
pressure. Once we started attacking their pressure, we were able to get it
back to a ten‑point lead. I kept telling the guys in the timeouts, this is
going to be a crazy ending and we're going to win by more than ten because we
got to break the press. I have seen them play. When they get behind, they're
going to come. They're not going to sit back in that zone. They're going to
come. So we did a pretty good job after our initial hesitation of attacking
their pressure.  
  
Q. As far as obviously you've got a whole game plan and you're prepared, but
when your team shoots the way that it does, a team that makes a little more
than a dozen threes a game, and is shooting the way they were, are you
thinking that something has come together?  
COACH CRONIN: No, we've made more‑‑ in the course of the entire season, we
lead the BIG EAST in three‑point field goals made. We've made more threes than
anybody in the BIG EAST. We're standing there wide open. Last night, we were 2
for 21. We shot 7 that went in and out. We've got guys that can make shots, so
law of averages catches up.  
When you let it fly with confidence the way we do, we only shot 22 threes, so
I'm not going to sit here and act like it was some miraculous things that we
made some shots. This is not the first time we've made‑‑ we're going to make
10 threes in a game. We've made way more than that in games throughout the
course of the season.  
  
Q. You were sitting right where you are now when you mentioned that
rebuilding the Cincinnati program was like trying to raise the Titanic. You
beat Georgetown. You've had some good ones. You just beat what most people
believe is the No.1 seed on national television. What kind of a statement is
this for your program?  
COACH CRONIN: Well, it's a huge win for our program. I think what you've got
to realize in college basketball is you've got to allow teams the course of
the season, some teams get better. We had injuries to key guys early on, and
we lost five seniors. We lost a lot of toughness on our team. It took us a
while to develop toughness, and now that our toughness has caught up to our
talent, when we make shots we can beat anybody. But our defense hung us in
there last night. You need that all against Syracuse because they are arguably
the best team in the country. But it's a great win for our program. Maybe the
guys that vote in the coaches' poll will give us at least one vote on the
also‑rans. We didn't get any last week despite winning eight of our last ten.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you about Jackson's basket at the end. Was that
drawn up?  
COACH CRONIN: I'm trying to remember which one. You're talking about the
press? Well, I was begging our guys to throw over the top against their
pressure. If you keep trying to play sideways they're going to steal it.
They've got nothing to lose, so you have to throw over the top and attack.
It's easier said than done. They were coming after Cash pretty hard. But once
we were able to catch it and throw over the top the way we were trying to do
it‑‑ when you're in that situation they've got to take that gamble.  
  
Q. You kind of spoke to this earlier, but it's a big win for the team and
the program but you still have another big game tomorrow. Can you speak to not
getting too caught up in a big win tonight?  
COACH CRONIN: As soon as I‑‑ by the time I got done with ESPN I walked in the
locker room, the guys had written "we need to win one more" on the board. I
didn't even have to write it.  
Where we come from, we play to win. Like I said last night, we'll show up
tonight at 7:00, tomorrow we'll be here at 9:00. We're not in it for the old
college try. When this tournament starts next week, we're quietly going to try
to win it. We don't let people outside our locker room define who we are as
people. We're not perfect. Or as a team. We try to define that for ourselves
and make sure we're giving our best effort. That's what true greatness is,
John Wooden.  
  
Q. Yancey, can you imagine that you're one game away from a BIG EAST
championship?  
YANCY GATES: No, not at first, but as the season went on, yeah. I told the
guys last night, talking about the Georgetown game, I was telling them, we're
not going to miss those shots today. I mean, we knew we'd come in here and we
was going to have a good chance of winning. I didn't think we would be up that
big at halftime, but I knew that we had a chance coming in here and beating
Syracuse.  
  
Q. Yancy, the three ‑pointers kind of stopped falling there for a period in
the second half, and you kept attacking the glass, going against those shot
blockers. How critical was that, going to the rim like that?   
YANCY GATES: It was big because them hitting those shots really opened it up
for me in the middle, so you know, it was pretty much one‑on‑one with Fab
Melo. A couple times they converged down but they blocked it out of bounds so
it was still our ball. Then they had to try to play both of us and that's when
Cash hit the three in the corner, so it just worked out the best for us.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Dion Waiters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23426)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CINCINNATI  71  
SYRACUSE  68

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought the game started‑‑ Cincinnati moved the ball better
than we did. They got some real good looks. They made eight threes in the
first half, and we didn't get anything going offensively in the first half. I
was shocked that we were within 12, and then we started the second half off
and had a couple good defensive possessions, didn't get the rebound, and they
got it, put it back in.  
We just couldn't get anything going. We'd get close a couple times, we'd get
it where we'd have a good shot, a good look, a couple free throws we missed,
right when it was‑‑ when it was still seven, eight minutes to go, I think it
was five, and I think Brandon missed two free throws and we missed a drive,
didn't convert. I thought we had an opportunity then.  
And then late, Dion made a couple really difficult threes, and we got it to
two and we had an opportunity, and we just couldn't make a play there. Dion
made the‑‑ we wanted to try to miss the second one, but he's such a good
shooter, he couldn't do that. We tried to get the ball back.  
I thought we really made as good an effort in the last ten minutes as we could
make, but the first 30 we just really didn't move the ball well. We didn't
pass it well. We didn't shoot well until the last ten minutes. We made all of
our threes in the last ten minutes of the game. We probably made six or seven
of the threes that we made. We were about 4 for 15 in the first part.  
But I give Cincinnati a lot of credit. I thought they moved the ball. They
made shots. Gates played really good inside, and they did a good job of
controlling the game. I give my guys a lot of credit, to come back the way
they came back.  
I think unfortunately we're doing a couple things defensively not as well as
we have, and we really haven't seen a zone defense, probably hardly at all
really, since‑‑ I can't remember the last time we saw much zone. So I think
that's one thing, we didn't attack like we probably should and could.  
But I think when you lose‑‑ I think you take‑‑ we've had some spotty games
over the last ten, but I think when you win, you don't learn enough from those
games. I mean, you talk about them, you try to change things, but I don't
think you learn enough, and I think losing this game we'll take some things
out of here.  
The one thing that stands out to me is when we've played well, Scoop and Kris
have been there for us. They've been very good. And Dion has been consistently
good all year, C.J., Fab, Brandon, they've been pretty consistent. But when we
played our best, Scoop and Kris have been there. Scoop wasn't there tonight.
He didn't get a rebound in 33 minutes, and he's got to be there for us and
Scoop has got to be there. I don't think either guy‑‑ I think they had nine
turnovers. They are two seniors who have to take you forward. As we go to next
Thursday, the two things I told the team we had won 31 games, which is a good
thing, and we've done it with Scoop and with Kris setting the tone every game,
and everybody else doing what they can and should do.  
And as we go forward into the tournament, I think that's going to be a key for
us.  
  
Q. Dion, obviously it's disappointing to lose. So many people had you
favored to win the Big East Tournament. What's the mood of the team right now
in the locker room? And Coach, what do you say to your team to get them
prepared for the tournament after this disappointing lose?  
DION WAITERS: I mean, we hate losing, at the end of the day. Our mindset
coming into this tournament was just to win and continue to get better as a
team. Nobody likes to lose. You know, Cincinnati came out on fire. You know,
we've got to do a better job at the guard position getting up on the shooters
and contesting the shots better than what we did in the first half, and I
think if we do that and continue to work hard on the defensive end, I think
we'll be a lot better moving forward.  
COACH BOEHEIM: And what I'll tell them is we've won 31 games, and we've proven
what we can do and we've got to get back and we have to play a little better
from the beginning. Our two seniors have got to do what they need to do. Most
national championships‑‑ not all, but a lot of them have been won by teams
that lose in their conference tournament, including us. So as much as we want
to win this tournament, the tournament that starts next week is the only one
that matters. Nothing else matters anymore in college basketball. It doesn't
matter that you win 31 games. It doesn't matter that you win your conference
tournament. The way college basketball is now, whoever you are, whether you're
VCU or Syracuse, the only thing that really matters is how you do in the
tournament. We know that, and we're going to be prepared for that.  
  
Q. And in that regard, you mentioned that things have been a little spotty
coming down the stretch. Do you feel you are playing your best, or do you see
certain threads that show ‑‑  
COACH BOEHEIM: No, I think we play good enough to win ten games in a row. In
our league, that's good enough. But can we play better during those games?
Yes, we can play better. We've got an extra day now, an extra two days,
really, now to go back and work on those things, so hopefully we will be able
to get better.  
  
Q. 15 turnovers today after just four yesterday. What was the big
difference?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, I think we had four in the first half yesterday, but we
had 15 yesterday, too. Did we only have four the whole game?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, I think what I would say is we tried to play faster, and
when you play faster you make more turnovers in transition. I think when you
play against a zone like we played against our zone, you're going to make a
few more turnovers, and their zone is very good, very active, just like ours
is. So they had 14, we had 15. A couple of them were bad turnovers, but that
happens.  
  
Q. You mentioned the two seniors, that you need to get them going again. But
C.J. struggled in both games, and he's been so consistent. Is he another guy
who's going to be critical next week?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, he's really struggled down here these two games. He
hasn't really struggled all year, but he struggled here. He got going on the
boards a little bit, he got more aggressive on the boards, and this game he
got 11 rebounds. But yeah, we need him to be more of a factor.  
But I really think for us the key has been all year, it's Kris, Scoop, Brandon
and Dion in terms of offensive production. We're hopeful that James‑‑ he got
the same shots tonight he got last night. Last night they went in. We need him
to make a couple. He's going to play. He's going to get six or seven shots,
just like he did tonight, and we need him to make a couple.  
But C.J., I think, will be all right.  
  
Q. Can you talk about in a game where Scoop and Kris struggled how Dion kind
of put the team ‑‑  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, he's a tremendous offensive player, and he knows when
other guys are struggling he's going to have to be more aggressive, and he was
tonight, and he obviously shot the ball very well, and that's a good sign,
too.  
  
Q. For both players, what does this do to your level of confidence? Do you
still have a lot of confidence?  
DION WAITERS: Because we're confident. At the end of the day it should give us
that much more to go out there and play more, and when we go back to practice,
take practice to a whole other level and just get ready for the championship,
the NCAA Tournament. That's the main goal and that's what we all talked about
at the end of the day. I mean, winning the BIG EAST don't mean nothing at all.
We're trying to win the NCAA Tournament. That's the main focus.  
  
Q. For both players, I don't think that you guys trailed by more than 13
this entire season. At that moment when you find yourselves down 17, Dion, you
said that they came out on fire. What is that like, that unfamiliar territory
in that situation for the first time all year?  
DION WAITERS: I think we were down 13 before to South Florida. It's the will,
the will to win, the heart, and just having confidence in each other, knowing
that we're going to come back. That's been our motto the whole year, even when
we get down. We have faith in each other and we know at the end of the day
we're going to win the game. Tonight we came up short but it gives us a chance
to go back to the drawing board and work that much more hard and get ready for
the main goal at the end of the year.  
COACH BOEHEIM: When you look at this game, what it comes down to is, there
were five or six opportunities when we had it to six and we had it to eight
and we had it to five and we had it to four and we had it to six with plenty
of time to go, not late, with plenty of time to go. We've made a play every
game this year. We've been in that situation. We were down eight to
Connecticut with seven minutes to go last night, eight minutes to go. We've
been in that situation. We were within eight tonight.  
But every game that we've been in that situation, we've been able to make
plays, and tonight we had somewhat easier plays, and we just didn't make them.
And we made two or three really bad turnovers in transition, not forced
turnovers, that we haven't made in those situations. That's why we've won
every close game we've played. The only game we lost wasn't close. Every game
we've won has been close‑‑ every game we've had a close game, which there have
been a number of them, probably conservatively eight games that could have
gone either way and that we were behind eight, six, seven, five late, and
every one of those games when we made a play, we made it. We made the play we
had to make, and tonight we didn't make that play.  
When you're behind, you can't afford to not make that play. When you're up
eight, you can afford to not make a play. But this is what we've done all year
long. We have not overpowered people in our league unless we had a rare‑‑ when
we had really good shooting nights, at St. John's, last part of the
Connecticut game at home. Every other game we've played has been very, very
close, and we've made plays. And tonight we just couldn't make a key play.  
And the solution to that problem is to play better earlier and not get in that
position going forward. That's the answer for us.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Eric Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23386)

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Jack Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23435)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  64  
NOTRE DAME - 50

  
COACH BREY: You know, we turned it over there a couple times, and I don't
think we really ever recovered. Their full court pressure kind of got to us,
and we never really did recover. They defended the heck out of us. We had some
open looks that you've got to knock down to kind of stop the bleeding when
they were in the midst of their run, and we never got any of those. So give a
lot of credit to Louisville, just kind of making us uncomfortable with their
defense.  
  
Q. You alluded to this, but there was that stretch there, almost 13 minutes
without a field goal.  
COACH BREY: Yeah, yeah. We called a timeout after we turned it over a couple
times. It was 15‑15, and then we broke pressure and we had a couple open
threes that you've got to make one or two of those to kind of get you feeling
good like you're kind of getting your momentum back or reestablishing your
tempo. Never could really do that.  
They're hard to keep out of the lane. Siva is so good getting in there. We had
jack established. We were throwing it into him and he was doing stuff, and
then when they started coming down on him we had some looks, but you've got to
make a couple more of those to have a chance tonight.  
  
Q. There were times, back to January down there, where it got a little
hectic, and you were able to regain control. Was it a matter of not being able
to make shots that you got the tempo back where you wanted it?  
COACH BREY: I think so. When I called a timeout, I said this is exactly what
happened at Louisville, and we got back under control. Now, they went back and
played more zone down there. They fell back to more zone. They stayed on us
with ball pressure in the half court. They kind of matched up, and that I
think had us a little frenzied at times. Even when we got looks, we were kind
of rushed.  
  
Q. Talk about coming up short again?  
JACK COOLEY: We had another chance tonight to do something we haven't done in
our program before. There was that one stretch that's really hard to overcome
if you go 13 minutes without a field goal. That's a pretty big amount of
decline to put yourself down that much. It's a pretty big disappointment but
we've just got to move on to the next tournament. The next one next week is
the biggest one in the whole season, so that's what we've got to focus on now.  
ERIC ATKINS: We are disappointed we didn't make it to Saturday, but they're a
tough team. I give them all the credit. They really got after us. But I think
now we have to set new goals in the NCAA Tournament and move on from there.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about Jack's struggle a little bit yesterday, and
today he bounced back and you were able to establish him a little bit inside
today.  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I think that was a key for us, and I feel good going into
the NCAA Tournament the way he got off and we were throwing it into him and
him defensive rebounding. He has been such a key factor for us being 13 and 5
in the regular season and getting‑‑ securing an NCAA bid. So we need his
presence, and I think him playing well‑‑ even though it was a loss, him in a
rhythm tonight helps‑‑ I feel good about that moving to a game on Thursday or
Friday.  
  
Q. You guys had 19 offensive rebounds tonight, shot a decent percentage on
the arc, but talk about how the zone gets into you on the perimeter.  
COACH BREY: It rushes you a little bit. Even when we got those clean looks,
you are a little frenzied. The guy that is shooting it, his feet are not quite
as set as they would be in other situations. And they do really a great job of
it. I mean, again, the ball pressure that they kept on us and kept on our
guards, it kind of takes its toll, and it did on us tonight.  
We didn't make enough‑‑ we had some free throw situations, too, that would
have stopped the bleeding a little bit and maybe give you some hope, but we
couldn't make a free throw, either.  
  
Q. What did you go through after last night's performance, between then and
now?  
JACK COOLEY: Again, I was really disappointed. My team really helped me last
night picking me up. I let everyone down last night. I had a decent game today
and I wanted to make sure I came back and got a little bit more in the rhythm
of thing and tried to play more for my team, and I wanted to play my hardest.  
  
Q. Eric, how much of a concern, two of the last three games, this one and
South Florida, Georgetown, three of the last four, it seems like points are
such a struggle for you guys to get to?  
ERIC ATKINS: You know, they have been a struggle for us lately. You know, I
just think that we need to play our game and play at our pace. In all those
games, I don't think we really got the ball where we wanted to, and we have to
shoot the ball better. It really comes down to that. We had some open looks,
and we're going to have to knock them down to beat some good teams.  
  
Q. You talked in the past about almost exhausting yourself to get through
regular season, get through this tournament. How do you get everything
refreshed so you can make more progress in the next one?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I think the benefit, you have tomorrow to kind of get your
legs under you and travel, and then Sunday we'll get back into a practice
segment. It's kind of a fresh start. I talked to them about giving that we
leave here with a bad taste in our mouth, can we be really hung rear and a
little edge year as we move into the NCAA Tournament. I'm really proud of what
they've done up to this point. They've had a heck of a run, and I love the
fact that they're stinging. I hope that helps us in our preparation moving
into the next one.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Victor Rudd, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23336)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

NOTRE DAME  57  
SOUTH FLORIDA  53 (OT)

  
COACH HEATH: I'm real proud of my guys. That was a heck of a game. We had it.
I thought we just let it slip away in regulation and made some mistakes and
didn't finish some plays that we should have finished. But I thought we played
hard. We were much better on the defensive end the second half. We did a good
job sharing the ball and taking care of it and getting some quality shots and
just came up a little bit short. That's a very good basketball team at Notre
Dame. Hats off for the way they found a way to win. Hopefully we erased any
doubt in terms of what kind of basketball team we are and proved that we
belong. We definitely belong.  
  
Q. Can you expand on that thought and explain why you think the selection
committee should have no doubt about why this team should be in the
tournament?  
COACH HEATH: Well, you know, that's just my opinion. I certainly have the
inside view on our basketball team. But any time you have a team that's giving
that kind of effort on the defensive end‑‑ I think one thing that I know
coaches around and coaches in our league, they really appreciate when you have
teams that sacrifice themselves on the defensive end. And that's why I think
most coaches really like the way we play.  
People on the outside, the casual observer that don't really know how
difficult that is, I don't think they understand that. But teams like us not
only get in the tournament, win and advance. You've seen Butler over the
years, the way they guard and how hard they play. Notre Dame is a great team
that controls tempo and does a great job with that, as well. But I think
it's‑‑ when you get in tournament play, teams get very conservative, and so
teams that are used to playing that way have success, and that's why I think
our team can be very good in that kind of play.  
  
Q. You've played most of the season without a true home court. How much did
that factor in the way the year played out?  
COACH HEATH: I don't know. We were good. We can't complain about that at all.
We look forward to a beautiful brand‑new Sun Dome that we have for next
season. But we were 14 and 2. I think the one thing that was kind of good and
bad, we probably lost a little bit of a home court crowd because our students
had a little bit of difficulty getting there. But in some ways, it may have
helped us just playing on the road, just simply we were used to always
traveling and always getting on the bus going to games.  
So I don't think that was what it was. What bothered us more than anything was
our non‑conference is just not being healthy. When you're missing three of
your key players, Poland for 11 games and Gilchrist for two games and Anthony
Collins for five, that's a huge void in your basketball team.  
  
Q. A lot like the Syracuse game, you jumped off to that big lead and then
had a huge lull. How frustrating was that?  
COACH HEATH: I just think it's part of the game. I mean, obviously we like to
keep things going, but sometimes you just have it. It's a game of runs, it's a
game of momentum. Notre Dame is a terrific team, and you knew they were going
to come back and settle into the game, as well.  
You know, we didn't score and keep pace, but you know, once we got back in our
rhythm again, we were fine.  
  
Q. You said you were so proud of your guys with this game tonight. How
indicative of this performance is your team from tonight, and what can they do
that wasn't on display against Notre Dame?  
COACH HEATH: Well, I think you saw a more complete team, a team that was
better offensively, took care of the ball a lot better, wasn't as sloppy.
Yesterday we had some guys that were a little bit tight and we missed lay‑ups,
didn't catch some passes. But our defense has always kept us in games, and
tonight we were better offensively, and I still think our team can still get
better. We had a lot of lay‑ups and easy plays that we can finish that we just
didn't do tonight. But we played them much better, all‑around game of
basketball tonight.  
  
Q. Victor, what changed for you guys in the last minute of the second
half?  
VICTOR RUDD, JR.: I don't think we changed. We just didn't finish plays and we
turned the ball over a little bit.  
  
Q. Of the chances you had to win, does one stand out any more than the
others?  
COACH HEATH: The chances we had to win, for instance, the West Virginia‑‑ oh,
those plays? Yeah, Poland should have finished that lay‑up. He's point blank
all by himself, he makes it, game is over, it's done. He's normally a
highlight reel and he normally dunks it and the fans go crazy on plays like
that and I don't know if he didn't have his footing or was so focused on
catching the ball he didn't have sight of the rim. He's been a guy that's made
huge plays for us. He basically took over the second half of our Louisville
game and won that game at Louisville, which is a huge win for us. He played
some big plays when we beat Cincinnati, another top team. So he's had the
games where he's delivered. It's just to night wasn't his night.  
  
Q. Overall you got a win here, you won two of your last three. Do you feel
good about things?  
COACH HEATH: I'll be honest; I won't sleep. You want to hear your name called
on Sunday at 6:00. I think we've done a great job by putting ourselves in a
great position. I think our team is worthy. But there's some people that have
a lot of information that make wise decisions, and we'll let our case rest
with them.  
  
Q. Anthony Collins got hurt late in the second half. How do you think that
affected him the rest of the game?  
COACH HEATH: I think it affected him big time. It looked bad. The finger was
really disjointed. You know, I don't know if they popped it back or what they
did, but they taped it up, and I could tell‑‑ normally he goes and gets the
ball, and then those situations he's going to get some free throws. So the
ball didn't get in his hands in the later part‑‑ I think we were up and he
didn't get the ball, and normally he's a guy that cashes in on those free
throws. I think he was a little bit worried about how he can handle the ball
with his fingers bothering him.  
  
Q. When you're putting together a team with this kind of defensive
intensity, is there something in the recruiting process where you're looking
for guys that will buy into that?  
COACH HEATH: Well, we didn't kind of build our team that way. I always want to
be a good defensive team. We actually played early in the season with more of
an offensive lineup, and it was okay. But I just felt as time went on, we had
to become better defensively, and we went with a lot more length. We went with
a lot more physicality with both Anderson and Gilchrist together, Rudd and
Robertson, and probably in some ways it probably has cost us a little bit with
maybe shooting and ball handling, but as time has gone on I think guys have
improved in some of those areas. I thought tonight we did a good job of
playing within ourselves, playing our roles. This is Vic's first year, really,
of college basketball, and he's oozing with talent. I think you saw what his
upside can be like and how well he played. We've got Anthony Collins, a
freshman point guard out there running the show, and for some of these guys,
it's kind of their first taste of a Big East Tournament and what it's really
like.  
I think this team has versatility. I think it has toughness, and I think it's
a team that's learning how to develop itself offensively. You know, we've got
some other parts that probably could use a little bit more. Noriega is a
terrific shooter that I haven't really used and he can probably help us a
little more, and Gilchrist shows you those flashes, and when he's consistent,
it makes us a different team when he's consistent around that post.  
  
Q. Is there a point where maybe the game got away from you in an ugly
sense?  
COACH HEATH: Well, ugly is in the eye of the beholder. I think it's‑‑ I love
the way we play. I'd like to get a little bit more maybe transition baskets
and get a little bit more penetration and kick and some things like that. But
I have no problems. I don't apologize at all for how hard my guys defend. I'm
proud of it. I think there's probably 90 percent of the coaches that would
love to do the same thing. So there's no apologies.  
And I think it's wrong that‑‑ it's almost like I have to come up here and
apologize for the way we play. It's won 20 games, 12 in the BIG EAST, got to
the quarterfinals. I don't understand that at all. I mean, that just baffles
me.  
But I think what we've learned is valuing possessions and defending give you a
chance to win. And whenever we cut down our turnovers, it gives us a chance to
win even at a higher level, and I think you saw a little bit of that tonight.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Jae Crowder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22128)

### [Darius Johnson-Odom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20620)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  84  
MARQUETTE  71

  
Q. Any real positives that come out of tonight's game, or was tonight one of
those games you've got to get rid of right away?  
JAE CROWDER: We got a chance to build on it going into the tournament. Look at
the mistakes we made and try to learn from it, so it's a lot of positives can
come out of a loss, no matter what point of the year it is. Of course it is
for us.  
  
Q. Talk about all the turnovers.  
DARIUS JOHNSON‑ODOM: We work on our press like every day. Wasn't disciplined
enough to get to our spots. I think they kind of forced us into turnovers with
a lot of their pressure. They kept hounding us. They did a good job of forcing
us into turnovers.  
  
Q. Were you surprised by the type of pressure and how they were able to
sustain it throughout the game?  
DARIUS JOHNSON‑ODOM: I think we had an idea that they were going to pressure
us. I didn't think it was going to be at a high level like that. That's why I
think a lot of guys, including myself, we didn't get to spots like we were
supposed to, and it caused a lot of tension on ourselves and a lot of stress
on ourselves where we tried to make plays because of it, and we ended up
turning the ball over.  
  
Q. Is there an adjustment factor play with Davante after playing with Jamil
for all those games?  
DARIUS JOHNSON‑ODOM: Think everybody knows how Davante plays. We know what
he's going to bring us, so I don't think there is an adjustment level for us.
We're pretty close, and we pretty well understand our teammates.  
  
Q. Jae, you went into the second half with three fouls or you went into the
half with three fouls. What was your mindset coming into the second half?  
JAE CROWDER: Told them to pick up a quick one. Wanted to try to get an easy
basket, as well, but I picked up another one for my fourth foul. I was trying
to make a play, trying to get some momentum for our team, and they called me
on one. So I was just trying not to get one quick one, but it happened.  
  
Q. Darius, talk about the two ‑day layoff coming into this. Did you feel
like you were a little bit rusty at all?   
DARIUS JOHNSON‑ODOM: Not at all. We were here last year, the same spot against
Louisville, and I thought everybody was mentally focused. We were ready. We
didn't bring enough energy in the first half, and they just took us apart. A
lot of it is on ourselves. We gave a lot of offensive rebounds, and 26
turnovers, just ain't going to do it. We have to learn from what happened.  
  
Q. As far as the pressure goes, do you feel like it was their team speed
that really kind of threw you off?  
DARIUS JOHNSON‑ODOM: I think we knew that their transition was the key. We
wanted to get them to score on half court D. We are just as fast, but we
didn't do a good job getting back, and when you give up 26 turnovers, then it
makes it easier for them to get in transition and score easy points.  
  
Q. Did you think the last four minutes of the first half was key?  
DARIUS JOHNSON‑ODOM: Yeah, I do think it was key, but it was a lot of little
things that we didn't do that were key, also. We just have to learn from it.  
  
Q. The NCAA Tournament, what do you think are the adjustments you have to
make, not just from this game but from past games?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think we'll make any adjustments. It's ground hog day
every day with them what we do, so when you get to tournament play, just like
here, if you lose, you go home. We're fortunate that our body of work allows
us to play another game, but from this point, you lose, you go home, and you
don't get to play again until next November.  
  
Q. You had eight turnovers today. Can you pinpoint that on anything?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I did a really bad job. If your team has 26 turnovers, which
is the most during my tenure as head coach, and if your team allows 26
offensive rebounds, which is the most it's allowed since I've been the head
coach, it's on the head coach. It wasn't just Junior. Junior is our primary
ball handler, but every player that played more than three minutes had a
turnover. So it's not just Junior. Junior is going to have more because he
handles it more, but if you play more than three minutes and you have a
turnover, if every player has a turnover, then I've done a bad job.  
  
Q. How do you assess the defense first half, giving up 50 points?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, a lot of that, if you give up points off turnovers and
if you give up points off offensive rebounds, and if you give up points off
transition, I'm not sure how many points they scored in the half court. And if
you were to divide that up throughout the game, again, I don't know what the
total would be. Having said that, that's how they play. That's why they won.
That's why they were playing us tonight. That's what they feed off of is
points from their pressure, points from transition, points off, offensive
rebounds. I'm not sure that they've had a better meal all year long than what
we served them tonight.  
  
Q. Is this kind of like a worst case scenario for a team that plays your
style?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. I think if you study our 31 games prior to now,
we probably are just as good playing against teams that are like us. This is
an aberration relative to how we typically play. Entering tonight, we were
averaging 12 turnovers, and tonight we had 26. And entering tonight, 65
percent of our baskets through 31 games had been assisted. That was fifth in
the country.  
Our assist to turnover ratio was 1.38, points per possession, 1.09. If you
look at all of our numbers, not being arrogant at all, they're pretty good.
And so the recipe that we have through 31 games and 25 wins is pretty
specific, and I think we've honed that. Our players understand that. And we
never cooked by the right recipe tonight.  
Any team, no matter their size, somebody said they were faster than us. I
haven't heard that since I've been employed here. But I guess you are fast if
you have 26 turnovers and 26 offensive rebounds. We probably did look slow,
slow and poorly coached.  
  
Q. When Gorgui went out with a third foul with nine minutes left, did you
feel that was a turning point in the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I thought we were playing from behind from the very
beginning. It never seemed to be in sync. Seemed like we just kept passing the
mic at a karaoke bar and I'm not sure of the words, you try. We were kicking
the ball everywhere. They were taking it from us, just no good, never in
rhythm, never in sync. I thought Gorgui was outstanding, but collectively,
like if you look at their numbers, Kuric had 20, Behanan 12 and 8, Gorgui 8
and 10, Siva 18 and 8, Russ Smith, 12 and 3; Jared Swopshire, that's a career
high for him, 12 rebounds in 20 minutes. They all played well.  
  
Q. You said 26 turnovers and 26 offensive rebounds is on you. Is that not
being prepared for it?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I would say that however you could deduct what would lead a
team that's had the success that we've had to 26 turnovers and 26 offensive
rebounds, I think it's a variety of things. So you can Twitter, write,
whatever you think it would be because that would be included.  
  
Q. How do you guys bounce back after this and get ready for the
tournament?  
JAE CROWDER: You just clear your head, wait for the opponent that you're going
to get matched up with come Sunday and find out what they like to do. But at
the same time work on what got us to this point. I feel like we'll be fine
once we get back to what we do and study the next opponent and get back to
them, and we're looking forward to the challenge.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Yancy Gates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19360)

### [Cashmere Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22083)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CINCINNATI  72  
GEORGETOWN  70 (2 OT)

  
COACH CRONIN: Obviously a great game. Georgetown was tremendous today,
outplayed us for most of the game. But our kids, despite not being able to
make shots, we hung in there, continued to battle. As a coach, you talk about
developing an inner toughness and not letting your offense affect your
defense. Today was a great example of the character of our team. So I couldn't
be more proud of these guys right now, to go 2 for 21 from three against
Georgetown and win the game is unthinkable to be honest with you. It's just
unthinkable that we were able to dig it out. So I'm just really proud of the
team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the resiliency that you guys showed,
down 11 with nine minutes left?  
COACH CRONIN: Yeah, you know, that's what I said in my opening statement. As a
coach, there's things you can control. You talk about effort and attitude and
togetherness and playing hard and defending and rebounding and hanging in
there and staying together. There's never a better example of that than today
with the situation we were in. We were down as far as 11. I believe when I
called a time‑out, I was just trying to get the guys settled, let's just get
after them and make one last run at them. We're going to score eventually,
you've got to stay together and keep digging in.  
These guys have been through a lot together rebuilding the program, so I think
that they've been in situations, and when you've got leadership like we have,
it was air key. The other key, we started getting the ball to I can't answer
I. That was a big key. He got us a lot of tough baskets when we were really
struggling.  
  
Q. I can't answer I, how badly do you want to stay here and play? How hungry
are you?  
YANCY GATES: I was thinking about that on the court. This is my last shot at
it, so you don't want to just play one game and go home right away. I'll never
played in the Garden in the Big East Tournament again, so just trying to push
and fight and stay here as long as possible.  
  
Q. What was it like when you were going back and forth, going blow for
blow?  
YANCY GATES: Henry Sims, he's a great player, so just trying to guard him as
tough as I can, and the same with him. We both were caught up on getting tough
baskets down the stretch for our team, so it was just a good battle between
two big men, two seniors, too, trying to stay in New York for a day longer?  
  
Q. Coach, you said earlier in the season you didn't ever want to come out of
the zone again, even if people criticized you, but at the start of the second
half you brought out man to man. Why is that?  
COACH CRONIN: No, I said that about Marquette. Marquette could have beat us by
50 at Cincinnati, I wasn't coming out of the zone. Our plan was to try to
change defenses. They're so proficient on the offensive end, what you try to
do is pick the shots they're going to get. They're going to get shots because
they're such a good passing team. But you try to keep them off balance as much
as possible.  
I thought zone worked for us late, different times, different things. But they
only had two turnovers at halftime, so we needed to turn up the heat. So I
think the first half was more my fault. I was so‑‑ in the pregame I was
talking too much about not getting backdoored and we didn't have enough
pressure on the ball, and consequently we weren't‑‑ the layoff, the double
bye, we were flat. That was my fault in the game preparation.  
Trying to get the guys going in the second half as much as possible, not worry
about fouling. We've got to get up there and get some deflections. If we don't
turn them over we're not going to win the game, got to get some turnovers, and
they did a great job of that.  
  
Q. Cashmere, can you talk about the game ‑winning shot, what you saw and how
you were able to get that basket?   
CASHMERE WRIGHT: I mean, it was all set by Yancy. They were respecting me so
much, like when he ducked in, seemed like the whole team just sucked into him,
so the hole just opened up wide open, and I just took it upon myself to try to
win the game for my team.  
  
Q. What was it like watching Yancy go back and forth like that?  
COACH CRONIN: You know, one thing‑‑ it's like a proud parent. Me and his dad
will talk tonight and laugh. We've been working on this guy for a long time,
his dad longer than me. One thing about Yancy and Dion Dixon, they're
traditional guys. You know the 60 Minute special about red‑shirting. These
guys weren't held back. They are young seniors. He's still a young guy. His
best basketball is way ahead of him still as he continues to develop his body
and become an adult. He's been called upon to do a lot, too much, in
rebuilding our program, before he was ready to do it. It was really unfair.
He's been through a lot. So for me, two things: I'm happy for him, but also as
a coach, it's great when you know you've got a horse and you get him the ball
and he's delivering. It gives you options. When you've got no options, it's
tough to wear a suit and a tie over there. But when you've got a guy like him
doing that, then it gives you some options. Our offense changed once he
started finishing, we started getting him the ball.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about tomorrow night's match ‑up in the semifinals,
now playing against Syracuse?   
COACH CRONIN: Yeah, that's the farthest thing from my mind right now. We
understand Syracuse has got a great team. UConn gave them a great battle
today. We'll show up. Game is at 7:00, right? We'll be here. We'll make sure
we're here.  
  
Q. Yancy, you guys played them earlier in the season. You came back to turn
them over a bunch. Do you guys think about that game when you were down?  
YANCY GATES: Yeah, that was one of the first things he mentioned coming down
the stretch, how we were able to do that in their gym, to be in the Garden at
a neutral site, it was possible to do it again. I think that kind of gave us
the confidence and the energy to go out there and make it happen, which we was
able to.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Jason Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20614)

### [Henry Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22866)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CINCINNATI  72  
GEORGETOWN  70 (2 OT)

  
Q. Talk about the turnovers in the second half, how they were really a
critical part of this game.  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yes, we had some very untimely turnovers at key junctures.
They got some second shots at key junctures, and I think that's why we ended
upcoming in here second and they came in here first.  
  
Q. Talk about the final play and how that evolved, and was that what you
were looking for?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yeah, but I mean, we wanted‑‑ Jason dribbled off Henry,
had Hollis in the corner. They just locked in on Hollis so he couldn't move,
and so both guys came with Jason, he threw it back to Henry, a shot Henry has
made, so you want to get those three guys playing together, so the reading was
there. They locked in on Hollis. Hollis didn't cut, didn't come around. Jason
came up, both guys came at him. Threw it back to Henry for a wide‑open shot,
ball didn't go in.  
  
Q. Henry, I was just wondering if you could talk about your emotions, going
from the high of making the shot in the first overtime to missing the second
one.  
HENRY SIMS: I mean, it would have been nice to make that last one, obviously,
but the first lay‑up to put it into double overtime I think obviously felt
good. But I'd much rather have that shot at the end.  
  
Q. I know this is not about individual accolades, but can you reflect on how
Henry has improved over the season and how he's become a key player for you
guys?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I think we've been reflecting on that all year. He has
improved. I think I said it yesterday. He's made a natural progression each
year, and you see this year the fruits of a lot of hard work that he put in
starting this summer and rededicating himself to being a good basketball
player.  
  
Q. What did Cincinnati do differently in the last nine minutes of the second
half?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I'm not sure. I think that during that stretch our
turnovers‑‑ we had made some poor decisions at that point, I think.  
  
Q. You had a couple of front ends on one ‑and‑ones that could have made the
difference down the stretch. Can you talk about how tough it is to see a game
come to something like that?   
COACH THOMPSON III: Obviously it's difficult to come here and lose, and like I
said, to come here and lose when I think the key things were rebounds,
turnovers, and then you put your foul shots in, and that's what's different.  
  
Q. Talk about Cashmere Wright's drive on the game ‑winning basket. He seemed
to have a lot of room, he went right down the middle. Can you talk about what
happened there?   
COACH THOMPSON III: He's a good player. I think for most of the night they
were trying to attack our zone with penetration, and at a key point he was
able to penetrate and get to the rim.  
  
Q. How tough was Yancy tonight?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yancy is tough every night. I mean, their team is tough
every night. Yancy hurt us, not just with the post moves, but he got some big
second shots that we needed to get the defensive rebounds. But he's a
competitor. He's been through it. He's a very, very good player.  
  
Q. Jason, can you talk a little bit about they clamped down on you pretty
good there and kind of your emotions about this tournament, how you hold it in
high regard and how you feel now that it's over?  
JASON CLARK: You know, I'd rather be sitting in here talking about a win, but
they did a good job, and that's a tough team. They played hard. You know, it
doesn't just come down to me scoring. We've got a lot of guys on this team
that can score the basketball. But like I said, I'd rather be in here talking
about a win.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Shabazz Napier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22172)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  58  
CONNECTICUT  55

  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, obviously congratulations. What Jim has done this year,
you can make an argument between them and Kentucky as the best teams in the
country. They certainly have a great many answers, terrific athletes. In the
end‑‑ and the end could have been any end, minute to go, two minutes to go.
It's not really important. The key thing is they had guys that could make
plays on their own and get to the rim and do some pretty good things.  
I love Jim Boeheim like a brother, and through everything else, and I've told
people this through the whole year, including other things that have gone on,
he's done an incredible job coaching his team and being unselfish and giving
to each other, and they're just a terrific basketball team capable in my
opinion of winning a national championship.  
But that's the team that Jim coaches, and I'm happy for him. I'm really,
really anguished in many, many ways because when I arrived last Friday in the
gym, not knowing after four weeks what was going to happen, little did I know
that I'd find a new team. Not that we were bad or anything else before, but
just our‑‑ who we were and what we were was different.  
That continued all the way to the tip‑in by Andre or steal by Bazz or whoever
it may be, and this is a good basketball team. That's the great thing about
it, too, really good basketball team. If they aren't one of the two or three
best teams in the country, and I say one, two, we're pretty good. And we
fought, and we're capable of playing better. What I've watched over the
three‑game win streak, I know you can't use that anymore because we always
like to use the two, three, four game losing streak, just a thing we have in
Connecticut, we like losing streaks, not everybody, some guys get fixated on
that. But more importantly, the three‑game win streak, and more importantly
how they did it, kind of how you guys did it made me so proud.  
And the anguish I feel is disappointment for them. They were primed mentally
today to do something very special and almost pulled it off. It's a funny game
because things happen to us. Things happened to West Virginia yesterday for us
and things happened to Syracuse today, and that's what basketball is about.
But no one can tell you that it wasn't a good team who was wearing blue today.
Did we shoot great, no, did we make great decisions, no, did we play with
great heart and great intensity and did we play for us and each other, without
a doubt, and I couldn't be prouder of them. I've sat here, as you guys know,
26 years of BIG EAST tournaments and sitting a lot of other places, and I
couldn't be prouder of my basketball team. And it says a lot of something to
them, and I said this yesterday that went through the season, a whole bunch of
different things. For them to show up on Friday and give me seven days, as I
said, a lot of pride. If we lost that game yesterday, I would have had pride,
too. But to pull it off yesterday, and quite frankly, a play or two today from
pulling it off, an incredible win. I love these guys and I love the way they
play and I love the way they care about it.  
I'm not talking about the technical things. They weren't pretty. But yesterday
we didn't rebound. You can check the stats sheet if you want. We were going to
rebound today. Did we have a hard practice to do that, no, we just kind of all
collaborated on it last night.  
I think emotional I told you last year during the five‑game win streak or
other times during win streaks, fatigue is the most over‑written about thing
in sports. Mental fatigue, though, I felt we had a little bit at the end.
Emotionally, we've been through seven‑‑ and we're going back to Friday.
Saturday's game against Pittsburgh was very emotional and traveling Monday and
playing Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and they stood up to it all. We came up
a little bit short. Once again, I love them and I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. What did you not do as well the last eight, ten minutes that you had been
doing well offensively?  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, it was eight, ten minutes, I thought we were leading
still during that time. But they found Jeremy, as they had most of the game. I
thought when we got the ball into the center of the zone, which we did a
magnificent job the entire game, we didn't make plays in there.  
Secondly, we tried to use a couple different offensive plays, they did a very
poor job down on the other end, so we're stuck in between now. Do we play Alex
for defense or do we play someone else for offense. We got bad on both ends,
quite frankly. We didn't get the offense I thought we really could have got
because when you get that ball to the center we were really good. That's the
best‑‑ one of the best times I've seen us with that zone. We actually had a
whole bunch of‑‑ we made one of our first ten shots, eight of them were good
shots. So we were well prepared mentally and ready to go.  
I just think they tightened up. That's 31 wins. When you went 31 wins, and
we've had teams that went up to 34, 35 wins, and when you start winning a lot,
you can feel a sense of tightness, and they're just tight. Ball comes spinning
out of the rim. I'm saying those kind of things, not the official's fault. I'm
saying those are the differences in games. If you thought the game was going
to come down to Syracuse running away, unless it was five minutes of the game,
I didn't think so. I thought they'd make it hard for us. That's when they had
a couple plays and we didn't. I think you could probably play that back and
find‑‑ you could make an easy way for Connecticut to win that game, just the
way it played out.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've done enough to make the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, let's see: 22 out of our games played against top 100
competition. That's not a very good schedule, but they say it's number one in
the country. We had ten wins against top 100 teams. So I heard the coach of
Iona saying don't put one of these BIG EAST teams in? We've played four teams
in the top 100. I'm sure he is a great coach and I have a lot of respect for
what he's done certainly. But you've got to kind of tighten those laces up. 22
times? This team you just saw, three times, okay, Notre Dame twice, I can keep
on going, Florida State. We probably have as many quality wins for anybody in
our position, and I just think when you start to look at how many teams have
done what we've done. Are teams at the one, two, three, four spots, certainly
they have. A lot of them haven't played against the kind of fault competition
we have. I am not going to make a pitch for it. I trust the basketball
committee and there's no doubt in my mind that they will look at it, and if
what they say is true, we want you to play good people, I think 22 out of 32
top 100 teams is probably a pretty good schedule.  
Oh, by the way, that doesn't include Asheville, who's 104, and I can keep on
going with other teams. I remember early in the season, UConn playing poor
schedule. Who's poor? Florida State? I just went through the teams they said
we weren't playing, and then I looked at what John and the people in the BIG
EAST who were so kind to give us Syracuse twice. We'll send you to USF. That's
always an easy one. You know the point we make it in the summer based on
objectives, that's part of the game. Jim Boeheim and I had a long talk a
number of years ago upset about TV games.  
The league said, but you get a chance to play TV games. I said, yeah, and I'm
playing against Kansas and I'm playing against‑‑ his point being simply
because we were picked first, because we won a national championship last
year, which we still have, and we're not defending it, and we were placed in a
position. But I don't think he would tell you that they expected Seton Hall to
be a bear. They probably didn't expect Notre Dame to be one of the top four
teams in our league and we only had to play them three times. I don't know
what else we have to prove that we're probably one of the top 30 teams in the
country, but we're certainly not one of the top 10, 20, but we're one of the
top 30 teams in the country. I don't make those decisions, but I know who we
are. I know what we are. I've seen who we've beaten.  
I can't do anything to control that. I only can tell you that there's enough
people that can crunch numbers that it's difficult‑‑ I was a coach at
Northeastern for 14 years. I know how hard it is to get there if you can't get
quality opponents to play, so I understand that the coach at Iona has a great
team and a great player. He's done a tremendous job there. But when you're
going to go 22 times, you want to change our record, take about six of those
out and now we get 26 wins. So that's what you‑‑ and by the way, I think we
all would agree, the collective beating down‑‑ I remember having Georgetown a
couple years ago, five in a row, I remember having seen Notre Dame a couple
years ago, we almost could get beat down but didn't get beat down, we stayed
alive. And down the stretch, Pittsburgh is always tough for us, DePaul game, I
don't think we did anything to hurt us. I think if anybody wants to see how
they do against a number 1 seed, most people would probably want‑‑ I don't
know if you'd want to see that game because it wouldn't be the prettiest in
the world, but if you want to see two teams go to battle, that would be a
battle of a game.  
And I won't say anything more about it because I can't do anything about it.
I'm just proud of these guys. These guys are one of the top 30, 35 teams in
the country, and they belong.  
  
Q. Shabazz, the last couple days in terms of being a leader you were really
encouraging the guys. Do you think your leadership has improved or changed the
last couple days in the way the team views you or your impact in that area?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I just think the guys, like coach said, the last few weeks
he's seen a change in me. I just seen a change in the guys. Everybody is
really into each other. The chemistry is there. I think we got that edge that
we was missing. You know, and we're just starting to have a lot of fun. A lot
of basketball teams, they lose, and the reason why they lose is because
they're not having a lot of fun out there. We win, we have fun, and it's hard
to have fun when you lose. But if you see out there, we're smiling, we're
enjoying the time out there because we all know we're blessed to be in the
situation we're in, and I just think that my leadership may have rised, but at
the same time, our team just became more into each other, more chemistry, and
we turned the corner, and we're just a happy team now.  
COACH CALHOUN: Just one perspective from someone inside outside, four weeks
away, I think what happened, it isn't just Shabazz, it's the team and Shabazz
and everybody. Shabazz' main concern recently, because he said to me, is
getting Jeremy points, and that's what he does. This guy has been great all
year.  
But the thing is to make sure this guy gets points, make sure different people
get things, and it's not always easy. Quite frankly, he'll tell you and
they'll both tell you, it's not easy following a great, great player because
no matter what he did it was great. It wasn't always great, trust it. He was
an incredible kid, incredible player, but it wasn't perfect. But these two
guys have helped so much bond this basketball team.  
  
Q. You touched on rebounding, and you had 18 offensive rebounds today. Can
you talk about the shift from yesterday, the mindset?  
COACH CALHOUN: I don't like to use the word in basketball embarrassed, but I
was embarrassed yesterday because during the 40 years that I've coached, I've
never gone through a college basketball season‑‑ we're plus 4, I think, for
the season, being out‑rebounded. The only other time we were out‑rebounded as
badly as we were is when a guy named Alonzo and another guy named Mutombo. The
next time we play them we'll out‑rebound them. So what happened yesterday was
the only reason that we could have lost that game. So we appealed to them, no
practice or nothing, and they responded. And I guess that's kind of the
overall thing I'm telling you, because sometimes when you're going through
things, you're not hearing anything. Everything we say to each other right
now, we're hearing each other. We're hearing each other.  
  
Q. How big was it for Andre today playing really well on a big stage? Is he
really just scratching the surface?  
COACH CALHOUN: I'm really glad you asked that question. We were disappointed
in him yesterday. The last ten minutes of defense, no question, but I think
both Jeremy and Shabazz and I both talked about you've got to go compete, and
he's a baby. We're telling you, as big as he may be, he is a baby. He's a
wonderful young kid, and I really get into him just privately about all‑‑ I
don't care what he does, he's got to compete, and he competed today. He
competed today.  
It's another step forward for him. He's got a lot more steps to go, but in
order for us to be good, next week, he's got to compete again, because you
fall off of here, off the tight rope, you jump back, because you've got more
games to play. We go to play more games. Someplace we're going to play more
games. With him, you're right, competing the way he did today, we're so much a
better basketball team.  
  
Q. Jeremy and Shabazz, could you talk about what the zone did to you in the
last two minutes of the game?  
COACH CALHOUN: I'm going to tell you what they did. They took their zone,
because they had a tough time, and obviously who would you want to shoot the
ball? One of these two. So they put the zone in and they were three, four feet
beyond the top of the key, and they tried to get our big guys, begging our big
guys to come up and relief pressure. They're they can answer the question but
they're not going to have much chance to. The point being they went after the
two best players and made sure they couldn't shoot the shots. I had the theory
and I always have this theory and yesterday we saw a good example of that.
When it comes down to game time, and that was game time, four points, you want
your best players shooting the ball, unless someone else is wide open, and
they didn't get as wide open as you would like them to, and Jimmy, who's
coached a few games himself, he just went out and snuffed our two guys out and
we didn't‑‑ it just took us out of what we wanted to do. Do you guys have
anything to add?

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Kris Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22056)

### [James Southerland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23346)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  58  
CONNECTICUT - 55

  
COACH BOEHEIM: Both teams struggled shooting the ball, and both teams are very
good defensively. We couldn't really get anything going offensively, and then
we changed something just a little bit. Got a little bit more space. Kris got
a couple penetrations and got to the foul line, and then we made a couple
good‑‑ we got James open a couple times. He's a tremendous shooter. That's
James Southerland over there.  
He can make those shots, and he made them early in the year. He struggled a
little bit during the week, but he's been making them in practice. He looked
good the last game, made a big one, and we think he can make those shots and
be a factor for us, a big factor for us the rest of the way. So it was good
for him to get those looks.  
Our guys are very unselfish. They found him in there and got him the ball.  
We were really good with the ball today. Didn't turn it over. That's been the
strength of our team all year. We make up for not doing a great job rebounding
with doing a great job taking care of the basketball. But Connecticut is very,
very good. When they had the lead, eight or nine points, they were in great
position, and I thought our guys just dug down on defense, played a little bit
harder and got going on offense. It was a great comeback. It's very difficult
to play a team like Connecticut. They've had a couple games. They're loose. I
hate sitting around all week, and it's very difficult. I'm glad that we were
able to get a win. We haven't played that many games and we need to play
again. Tomorrow's game will help us, but this was a tremendous comeback. This
team has been very good down the stretch all year, and that was the case
today.  
  
Q. After you hit that second three, can you talk about what were the
emotions, the Garden was going wild?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: It felt really great out there, especially being at home
and all. I missed my first two shots. The first one I felt was good, the
second one was kind of rushed. It's good my teammates are here for me, they're
not giving up on me just because I missed two shots, and it feels good. It was
a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. What does it say about this team's depth that he takes that wild three
‑pointer?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I didn't think he took a wild three‑pointer. He took a good
job, but he wasn't having a great day. Dion was having a great day and Brandon
was having a great day. So it was just a matter of going with the two guys
that were playing better, and some games it's been those two, some games it's
been Scoop and one of them. But today Scoop wasn't making shots, and I thought
that the two best offensive guards we had were those two guys. I thought
Michael Carter had a great first half. He made three great passes, and I
thought Rakeem, we're using him coming in at center. He was huge in the first
half. He made a couple blocks and I think had four or five rebounds in about
eight minutes. I thought he was really good, and I think this was a good game
for him and gave us another guy in that center position. I thought he was very
good today.  
  
Q. For James and Jim, can you take us through James' journey as a freshman
to now being an impact player for the Orange?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, I think James is a very, very good offensive player, and
I think he hasn't scratched his potential. He's getting better every day. He's
got to help us more on the boards, but he's a tremendous shooter.  
  
Q. You've played this team so many times, particularly during this time of
year. What were you most concerned with?  
COACH BOEHEIM: With Connecticut?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, they have three guys that can shoot it and their guards
are very good off the dribble. Drummond is a big presence on the boards. We
left the middle open a little bit and gambled on those guys in there, and they
didn't‑‑ they weren't very productive in that area.  
I think Connecticut is a really good team. I would be shocked if they don't
win two games in the NCAA Tournament at the minimum. At the minimum.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the third time going up against this team?  
KRIS JOSEPH: Yeah, offensively I wasn't really making any shots in the second
half after making an adjustment and just driving to the basket, him being a
smaller player, and just trying to create other opportunities for my teammates
and for myself. I got fouled a couple times. A couple times I drove, and the
defense conversion, I found Dion, I found Brandon, and those are the types of
plays I need to make down the stretch.  
  
Q. With the NCAA situation, were you aware or have you been aware what's
been going on with the drug testing?  
COACH BOEHEIM: This was reported five years ago, and we're waiting for them to
make‑‑ finish the process.  
  
Q. You got a report of it five years ago?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Uh‑huh.  
  
Q. You say you hate sitting around all week waiting for a game to start, and
particularly a week like this with the news ‑‑  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, first of all, news doesn't matter. This is a media‑‑ this
is you people's thing. This doesn't bother our players or our team or me. None
of this. This is a media thing, period. If things were bothering us we
wouldn't be 31 and 1. Nothing bothers us. We come ready to play. That's what
you should do in life. Everybody gets bothered. Everybody has problems. I'm
much more concerned about my wife being mad at me than I am anything else, to
tell you the truth.  
I think that Manning should really come to the Jets, too (laughter).  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
KRIS JOSEPH: No, it was my other hand. It wasn't my shooting hand, so that had
no effect on me.  
COACH BOEHEIM: You can't shoot that bad unless you're hurt, can you?
(Laughter).

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Chane Behanan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23372)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  84  
MARQUETTE  71

  
COACH PITINO: Well, I thought the guys did a tremendous job of pushing the
pace tonight, getting a lot of easy baskets for us. We tired a little bit in
the second half because guys were playing a lot of minutes, and Marquette is
more than willing to run with anybody. When Gorgui went out of the game, Jerry
gave us a big lift, a tremendous lift. We didn't lose a whole lot. They
maintained their poise, and we did a really good job of offensively attacking
the whole night. Real proud of the guys. We got a chance to rest Gorgui in
unusual conditions.  
  
Q. You were really able to attack the offensive glass. Talk a little bit
about your effort rebounding the ball.  
COACH PITINO: Well, they're a big steal team, and we told Chane all night to
go along the baseline, and they helped go to the glass. We were going to bring
three guys back, but I said that‑‑ because they're such a big steal team, we
have an 0.2 rebound margin area so we were going to hit the offensive glass
when we could but we were able to attack offensively especially with Gorgui
out of the game. Peyton really tired down the stretch. I played him too many
minutes but I had no choice.  
  
Q. They had a season high of 26 turnovers that they finished with. Did you
feel pretty confident that you would be able to turn them over?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, you never know, but sometimes it's not necessarily the
turnover, it's the fatigue element. You get a lot of benefits by pressing when
you don't give up lay‑ups. You get the fatigue element, affects their
offensive shooting, and we were going to come into this game here‑‑ I think
some of you in Louisville don't understand that a lot of times the opponent
dictates the tempo, and you guys don't pay attention too much to South
Florida's play because probably they're not on TV too much, but they do that
to everybody, and there's nothing you can do about it. Tonight we knew‑‑ teams
like Marquette and Connecticut and Syracuse if you choose to try it, will run.
Other teams will not. So you have to pick your poison a little bit.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could just talk about the play of Peyton Siva
tonight?  
COACH PITINO: He played terrific, but I've got to somehow get him a few blows.
Going into this tournament we were hoping he would turn it around, and he is,
and we had a long talk. I used the analogy of the New York Giants, nobody
remembers the regular season anymore when they went into the Playoffs, just
matters what you do in the postseason. So don't worry about what you did in
the regular season, just be a great player in the postseason, and he's doing
that for us.  
  
Q. Is this your best win of the year?  
COACH PITINO: We've had a lot of great wins. We had a lot of great wins, but
this was good for us to get back to playing the way we wanted with pressing
and running and just pushing the pace. But we've had a lot of terrific wins.  
  
Q. Talk about Chane's development as a freshman.  
COACH PITINO: Chane is a young man with great pride, and he's a warrior. He
won't back down under any circumstance at all. He's a terrific young man, and
the sky's the limit to how much better he can get. But he's just a tough,
tough kid, young man, and he takes on every challenge. He told me tonight in
unusual circumstances, he grabbed me twice in the locker room, said, if Gorgui
needs a break when he gets in foul trouble, I'll play that five, and don't
worry about me. And sure enough, Gorgui got‑‑ I don't know if Gorgui knows
that a technical foul is a personal foul, as well. In Senegal I don't think
they have that rule.  
  
Q. Would you talk about when Gorgui went out they made a run but they never
caught up their way back up and you were able to build a lead and then at the
start of the second half, they came charging at you but you guys seemed to
respond when they made runs.  
COACH PITINO: Well, I thought we were playing beat the clock a little bit. And
I told our guys, if you do that they're going to win the game. I said they are
a great second‑half team. They have done it against Villanova, every team
they've played, they've come back in the second half and beat them. And I they
said if you're going to play clock run out‑‑ that being said, I didn't want
Russ to give a Magic Johnson look‑away on a three‑on‑one break. I wish he
would have brought it out and maybe used a couple of seconds, but we wanted to
keep pushing the pace.  
  
Q. You had enough of a spread that it didn't matter, but are you concerned
with some of the decisions the guys made at the end of the game?  
COACH PITINO: I think that is fatigue a little bit. Peyton made some really
bad decisions, but I think he's handling the ball the whole night. Chane made
a couple poor decisions on back‑door timing plays. But I think when you see a
lot of those plays, it's fatigue. We pushed the pace on every possession, and
then we turned around and pressed them on every made bucket. So that a little
bit clouds it, but we wanted to do‑‑ we've got to give Peyton a little bit of
relief, and Russ did it toward the end of the game. He gave him a little bit
of relief.  
But the answer is yes, of course, you don't want to turn the ball over.  
  
Q. You've said often you want to see the extra stuff from Kyle Kuric. Was
that tonight the rebounding and blocked shots?  
COACH PITINO: I read his line and it said, no assists, no steals, no rebounds.
We've got to have you step up some, and he did.  
  
Q. You've gotten a look at Marquette now and knowing they play a specific
style, do you think that smaller style can survive in the NCAA Tournament, or
if they run into a night where the other team is really rebounding well, will
they run into problems?  
COACH PITINO: I think the big guy has to get rest from time to time. I think
when he's in the game, they rebound fine. I think they're an outstanding
ballclub because they put so much pressure on you with their shooting and
their drives. We stayed at home and we tried to rotate at the end with our
bigs, and we stayed at home. Look, every team, with the exception of Kentucky
and North Carolina, I've watched every team in the country that I could this
year, and we all this weaknesses. Kentucky and Carolina just seem to be‑‑ they
shoot a very high percentage. Kentucky is also a great team defensively. They
have outstanding talent. They're well coached. Those two teams to me don't
have a major weakness.  
You know, they've been able to‑‑ Kentucky has been able to stay away from
injuries, and some people say their bench, but they haven't had an injury this
year. I think Marquette is like everybody else. We have our blemishes and our
warts.  
  
Q. Jae Crowder never really got into any kind of offensive rhythm. Just talk
about what it was like going against him and keeping him from being a major
factor?  
JARED SWOPSHIRE: I mean, it was fun for me. He's a great player, and me and
Chane talked about it when I subbed in that we wanted to keep him from getting
touches, especially in the paint area. So I feel like we were able to do that.  
COACH PITINO: For you guys that don't know, that's Barry White's son.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. Talk about how this pressing style pretty much poses an advantage.  
CHANE BEHANAN: The style, we go up and down. That's what coach wants us to do.
All the teams we played so far in the BIG EAST, they expect us to slow it
down. So now coming in, we agreed we were going to play up and down like we
was in the Bahamas. We've just got to get used to it and attack everybody the
same way in each game. That's how we've been getting up. That's it.  
  
Q. Facing either Notre Dame or South Florida, they're going to want to slow
the tempo way back down. Are you still going to try and force them into your
kind of tempo?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, but I'm not going to win. You guys don't understand that
in Louisville, you personally, you just don't understand that. West Virginia,
nobody could do it with South Florida. If Notre Dame wants to slow it down,
they will, because they have excellent ball handlers, they're excellent
passers, and we have to learn to play both ways, and we have this season. But
you know, sometimes‑‑ South Florida has gone a long way with this style of
play, so you've got to give them all the credit in the world. We have no
problem playing it. We played it against Vanderbilt this year numerous times
try and play fast but you've got to give the other team credit.  
Certain teams will run, certain teams will not run. You've got to face that in
the NCAA.  
We're going to run into a situation‑‑ I'm not happy that Gorgui got a
technical foul. I was just as upset with the calls as he was, but the thing
we've got to find out is can we play without Gorgui, and this young man
stepped up, actually drew a charge tonight, which was like the miracle on 34th
Street. So it's unbelievable for him to do that. He stepped up big, 12
rebounds. Now Chane knows when Gorgui is out that we can win without Gorgui in
the game, and that was great for us to find that out tonight.

### [Pat Connaughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23387)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

NOTRE DAME  57  
SOUTH FLORIDA  53 (OT)

  
Q. Talk about what you got out of this game, such a close, contested
finish.  
ERIC ATKINS: Think we just got out of it a toughness. We were poised down the
stretch, especially on the defensive end, knowing who to help off of, and just
rebounding. They're a huge team inside. They usually beat up people on the
boards, so I think that we definitely got tough on the boards tonight.  
  
Q. Eric, what's your confidence level like when you hit that shot?  
ERIC ATKINS: I tried to be confident all throughout the game. I really didn't
hit anything all game, though. But coach gives me the confidence to just keep
playing, keep shooting. You know, I got the balls thrown to me, and I just
knocked it down.  
  
Q. Mike, have you ever been involved in a stranger final few seconds of a
basketball game?  
COACH BREY: No, that was very unusual. We threw the bomb to Pat Connaughton,
and he got fouled. I turned to Coach Solomon, I go, "this is getting wild."
But proud of our group. That's a little bit how we played all year, like
that's a little bit of when it gets down to those last two or three minutes of
really believing. You know, I hadn't really seen that much the last three
games. During our nine‑game run we stole many like that, and it's nice to see.
Maybe we can keep that recipe going.  
  
Q. You guys have been to the semifinals a bunch of times in the tournament
but never made it to the finals. What about this team makes you believe that
you can end that run?  
COACH BREY: Well, I really believe this group, of all my teams, is most
equipped to get to Saturday night. It's something we talked about in our
program for a while. It's the next step. I think our program has been
extremely consistent and solid in the BIG EAST, but playing on Saturday would
mean a lot, and I think this group has really digested it. Of course we played
the same guys who stopped us from getting there last year in Louisville, and
every time we play them it's never regulation. The last six, seven games, it's
unbelievable.  
  
Q. How much did what you guys have been through help you tonight down the
stretch?  
ERIC ATKINS: Think it definitely helped a lot, especially we believed that we
can win, get into overtime. I know I believed that we can get it done. I don't
think we've lost in overtime yet. So I just believed in our team, and we
stayed poised down the stretch.  
  
Q. For both players, you only had four baskets in the second half. How do
you keep plugging through that and thinking we're going to score?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: I mean, we wanted to focus on defense. We knew they were a
defensive power house, and we wanted to show that we could play just as much
defense. So I think the shots may not have fallen, and to make them down the
stretch when the shots weren't falling at the beginning of the half, the
beginning of the game, really kind of shows that we have an extra gear and we
have a clutchness about us.  
ERIC ATKINS: We're going to have to score more baskets tomorrow. But I think
we did a good job just staying poised and believing in each other, especially
getting to the foul line. Once we got one‑on‑one, we wanted to keep attacking
the hoop. We're going to have to shoot better tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've played these guys before so you know what's coming, but how much
of a grind is it to just stick with it?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: Well, we knew they were a different team than when we played
them the first time. They went on their win streak. But we also knew we were a
different team. I think just going to the game we were just talking about
defense because they had the reputation of being that defensive team, that
team that holds teams to 40 points, and we wanted to show that we could play
defense, too, because we held them to 49 points at our home gym when we beat
them. They do play very good defense, and obviously it disrupted our shots at
the beginning of the game. But because we all picked each other up and had
each other's backs we were confident down the stretch even if we weren't
making them at the beginning.  
  
Q. How important will it be to offset Louisville's fast pace and everything,
especially playing such a very intense game?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, well, they'll really try and speed us up. They always do.
The game double overtime down at Louisville, they were after us the whole
game, but we controlled the tempo really well. That will be our challenge here
tomorrow night because they'll really come after us and try and speed us up.  
Our team ball handling is one of our greatest strengths. We're really going to
have to rely on that. And sometimes we're going to have to attack pressure and
just reset and catch our breath.  
  
Q. How important was it for your guards and your wings, especially Pat and
Scott Martin to rebound?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I was on Jack the whole game. We're going to need more than
that tomorrow night to stay alive. But our guards were fabulous. Coming down
and helping us there, Pat was great, and Scott Martin‑‑ Scott Martin was a
double‑double guy against them last time. He was 15 and 13, and I talked to
him about we're going to need that again.  
  
Q. Pat, a couple pressure free throws there. What were the thoughts going
through your head?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: It was just make them. I was thinking back on the UConn game,
and I was just going through my routine, just like we practiced. Go through
your routine and don't think about what the free throws mean. They're free,
you should hit them, and obviously I failed to hit one of those.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Maalik Wayns](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20824)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Mouphtaou Yarou](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20760)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SOUTH FLORIDA  56  
VILLANOVA  47

  
COACH WRIGHT: I thought South Florida's defense was outstanding. That's not a
surprise to anyone that's seen them this year. I know they're going to do
damage in the NCAA Tournament because they play a style that is very, very
difficult to play against. We were down 10 at halftime, and down 10 to them is
like 20, 25 to somebody else because of the way they control the tempo and the
way Collins just controls the game. He was just incredible. We didn't have an
answer for him. We know they're going to keep the ball in his hands, and he
was outstanding.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you got some good looks, though?  
COACH WRIGHT: I did, but I think part of it is that it's never one thing. We
did get some good looks, but part of it is they kind of sucker you into
settling for jump shots. I thought early in the game we just settled for
jumpers. We didn't get the ball inside, we didn't drive the ball, and
therefore they were shooting free throws the whole first half and we were
shooting jumpers, and you're down 10 at halftime, and I'm proud of our guys,
they just battled in the second half. Our guys never quit, they've never quit
all year. They've played until the last second. But I thought a big key was
being down 10 at the half to them. Most teams, it's not that big of a deal.  
  
Q. What do they do differently?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, they get Mouph, they get our bigs in foul trouble and
we end up having to play small against them and that's when they get us. Mouph
has been outstanding. The last third of the season here for us, just
outstanding. Him getting two fouls in the first half, then we played small,
played with Markus Kennedy, a freshman, and that's when they took advantage of
us. Maurice Sutton got in foul trouble. That's what gets us.  
  
Q. What is it about their defense that makes them so difficult?  
MAALIK WAYNS: They're real long. They just keep you in front of them and clog
the paint and there's no driving lane, so they force you into taking jump
shots.  
  
Q. It looked like you got some good looks. Can you talk about that?  
MAALIK WAYNS: Yeah, I got my shot. I didn't hit it today unfortunately, this
is the tournament. You have a bad day, you go home.  
  
Q. Mouph, can you talk about their big guys, what they did to make it so
tough to get the rebounds and work inside against them?  
MOUPHTAOU YAROU: I think they're both seniors, they know how to play. They
keep me off the offensive glass, and they make me work on the defensive glass.
I think they did a great job. It was tough. It was really tough.  
  
Q. How do you assess your team's future? You've got everybody back next
year, coming off a disappointing year.  
COACH WRIGHT: As I said, this was a disappointing year, but I feel great that
our guys never quit. They never gave in. They came to practice every day.
Right until the last second here, they played hard for us. We've got great
leaders in these two right here, and we learned a lot this season. I think
we're going to come back very strong. I think this season is going to be
something that we always refer to as a group. I'm excited. I'm excited about
this group coming back, I really am.  
  
Q. Specifically what did you learn about the way they handled adversity,
injuries, real tough losses?  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, we had to play a lot of different styles because when we
lost‑‑ everything kind of revolved around Maalik and then we lost Maalik for a
while and then I thought we got Ty Johnson some great minutes, so we gained
some confidence in Ty. You know, Maalik is our leader, and when he wasn't
playing, I thought Mouph really stepped up and gained the respect. JayVaughn
Pinkston came into his own, and I just think everyone individually really
improved as a player, but we could never get that‑‑ we could never get that
rhythm as a team.  
I thought last night we kind of played that way, but it was the first time we
were all together in a month, and then tonight this team was too good to miss
shots and still find a way to win. I wish we had more games to play together
and everybody healthy.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Otto Porter, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23299)

### [Henry Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22866)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGETOWN  64  
PITTSBURGH  52

  
Q. No.14 on your team, I didn't see a lot of before today. Who was that
guy?  
COACH THOMPSON III: The same guy that's going to show up tomorrow (laughing).
I disagree. I think Henry has been pretty good most of the year. I thought he
was very good today in terms of his effectiveness on the block, his
effectiveness as a passer and, his decision making out there. We're pretty
good when we get that kind of effort out of him, smart effort, when he
produces like he did today.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yes and no. I say that because they know what time of year
it is. This is their last time here with us, and they've been through the ups
and downs, the highs and lows that it takes to be successful and the
experiences that are necessary to be good this time of year.  
Now, that being said, we also had a few freshmen out there that had stepped
out pretty well, also. So I expect someone to step up. If a couple of them do
we'll be okay most nights.  
  
Q. Talk about Ashton.  
COACH THOMPSON III: Gosh, it felt like he made a lot more than that. Our zone
was effective tonight. I think Greg Whittington was very good at the top of
the zone. The first time we played them, our back line wasn't good, and they
ended up with a handful of lay‑ups and dunks, and I think they got a few
today, but I think our back line, the communication of our back line in that
zone was much better today.  
  
Q. You've seen Henry take a large step from where he was the past three
years. Can you talk about what went into that?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I mean, I think that it's growing up. I think it's
evolution maybe in Henry's case. But you come in, everyone think back on when
you were in college. I know I was a much different person as a senior than I
was as a freshman, and Henry has had, in what I think in many ways, is a
progression in terms of how he views everything, whether it be life off the
court, on the court. But we have seen a steady progression to where tonight
was probably one of his better games, if not his best game, wearing blue and
gray.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Otto's outburst in the second half?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yeah, and I think if you go back and look at it, the guy
sitting next to him probably threw him the ball on most of those plays, and I
think it had come to a stretch where Henry had had a little bit of success and
they were starting to pay attention to him, and I think they were doubling a
little bit off of Otto. And so he hit a couple of shots in the middle of that
zone, and then he got to feeling good and his teammates did a good job of
finding him for open looks.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask Otto, you were very vocal out there. You're a
freshman, but you and Whittington played major roles. How mature do you feel
at this point compared to the start of the season?  
OTTO PORTER: I mean, I just tried to step up for my team when it comes down to
playing hard and things like that. And me and Greg, we know that we've got to
play our roles and step up and help this team throughout the rest of the
season.  
  
Q. Henry, what did you think of your performance tonight? And since the
regular season ended did you have that moment when you realized that this is
it?  
HENRY SIMS: I had that moment over the summer, honestly. But when it came to
this tournament, you know, last year we had an early exit, and me and Jason
talked and we didn't want that to happen this year, and I did my best to make
sure that didn't happen today.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about giving a lift to guys like Jason and Hollis?  
HENRY SIMS: They handled it well. They understand on any given night on this
team anybody can step up. Tonight it happened to be me and Otto. Tomorrow
night it could be Jason and Hollis. They know we've got another one tomorrow,
not to dwell on this one because you've got another chance.  
  
Q. Talk about the turnaround from the last time you played Pitt. Today you
shut them down.  
HENRY SIMS: That was a major focus, protecting the paint this game because
last time they had lay‑ups and dunks almost all their points, so we made sure
we held that to a minimum today.  
  
Q. The second half started, Pitt went right into the paint for three
straight baskets there, then the time ‑out. What did you tell your guys right
there?   
COACH THOMPSON III: Go back to the zone. I mean, we came out in the second
half and I wanted to‑‑ I gave one of those speeches at halftime as a coach
where you challenge the guys and say we've got to guard these guys. You've got
to step up and guard them man to man, and that might not have been the
brightest thing to do, because our zone was effective in the first half, so we
took their time‑out, said, fellows, back to the zone.  
  
Q. Otto, can you talk about the three ‑pointer you hit in the corner to
start the second half? Did you kind of feel the momentum shifting?   
OTTO PORTER: Yeah, I mean, I just stepped up and knocked the shot down. We
went back on defense. Also the pass was just great. They were just looking for
me all over the place.  
  
Q. The zone certainly played a part, but what does it say about your team
given how the first meeting went and you guys were able to control the glass
today?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yeah, I think it's a good sign. Going into this
afternoon's game, there were a few things that we wanted to stress, take care
of. One is their points in the paint, which in the first game they killed us
on. Two, limiting or trying to limit them to one shot, and us controlling the
boards, and that's something that's very hard because they're very good at
that. That's one of the things that down through the years‑‑ and their team
this year is no exception‑‑ that's something they're good at is getting second
shots and third shots, and Robinson in particular it is very persistent. We
wanted to limit that. That was one of our plans the first time, too, but I
think our guys just did a better job today.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Herb Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20581)

### [Jordan Theodore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20580)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  61  
SETON HALL  55

  
Q. Coach Pitino just talked about you didn't have any easy threes. What did
you see out there?  
COACH WILLARD: I mean, they're one of the better defensive teams in the
conference. We had some really good looks early in the game that I think if we
had knocked down we could have loosened it up a little bit. And we didn't
knock them down, and we kind of had a battle from that point on. Just really
proud of the way these guys played tonight.  
  
Q. Kevin, how much did Dieng's presence just change the whole equation?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, Gorgui, they've done a tremendous job with him. He just
sits back there and you go in there and he's got great timing. I voted for him
for Defensive Player of the Year just because of the way he's played all year
long. It was a big presence.  
  
Q. Jordan, Coach Pitino talked about he wanted to wear you out. Just talk
about the flow of the game.  
JORDAN THEODORE: Yeah, I think early on in the game they did a good job of
pressuring me a lot and wearing me down but toward the end of the game I just
didn't want to lose. I wanted to win so bad, and just not for myself but for
this guy, for coach. I just wanted to just leave it all out there for Seton
Hall and just go out there and battle.  
  
Q. Was Aaron still feeling a touch of the flu?  
COACH WILLARD: You just don't get rid of the flu. He wasn't 100 percent
healthy, but he was feeling better than he did yesterday.  
  
Q. I know you're disappointed somewhat about how this turned out, but it has
to be really valuable source of experience for the younger players.  
COACH WILLARD: Disappointed in what, the season?  
  
Q. In the way things turned out, you had up times, you had down times.  
COACH WILLARD: No, I'm not disappointed at all. I'm actually‑‑ win 20 games in
this conference and have five out of seven on the road and three in a row on
the road? We played the 15th toughest non‑conference schedule.  
  
Q. But I'm talking as far as experience and giving that type of experience
to the younger players that you have on the squad this year, to experience
winning, to experience the pressure of being ‑‑ this whole thing could help
you down the road?   
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, that's part of freshmen becoming sophomores, sophomores
becoming juniors. Eventually hopefully you have a couple guys like this. When
you have guys like this, you have a good program. I said that all year long.
We'd go as far as these guys take us, and they've taken us pretty darned far.
Again, to have the 15th toughest non‑conference schedule and to have only one
loss and our non‑conference RPI was fourth in the country. I'm ecstatic the
way the season went.  
  
Q. Those kind of numbers, taking all that in, where do you think you will
stand?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I believe this team deserves to be playing and its name
called on Sunday. Again, I've always been under the belief that it's the total
year, it's not just two games that you played bad maybe at the end of the year
or a tough stretch. Our total résumé is as good as anyone's out there. Our
non‑conference schedule, we played road games, we played neutral site games,
and we had one loss. We lost to a very good Northwestern team. We were No.4 in
the country in the RPI at the end of the non‑conference, and we played the
15th toughest schedule. So to look around‑‑ and then played with all freshmen
and sophomores and two seniors in this league. Unfortunately, for some reason
we were the only team that played three in a row on the road. That really hurt
us. That was our losing streak. We played five out of seven on the road and we
had three in a row on the road.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
JORDAN THEODORE: It's really tough. For me and Herb at the end of our Seton
Hall career, especially just leaving it up to the selection committee on
Sunday, we wanted to go out there and just prove a point, and we came up short
tonight, so it's a tough one.  
  
Q. Jordan, how difficult are these next few days going to be?  
JORDAN THEODORE: No, I'm just going to get in the gym, get better and just
pray. That's all we can do. That's all I'm going to do is just get better. I'm
not going to watch TV, I'm just going to get better, go to school and live my
life.  
  
Q. Jordan, you heard the coach make his case. What would you say to the
selection committee about why Seton Hall deserves to be in the tournament?  
JORDAN THEODORE: Well, from day one until now, I think we've done a pretty
good job of winning games and beating the teams we had to beat. We had some
tough losses, but I think we did enough to get in. But I just can't say that;
it's up to the selection committee, so we're going to see what happens on
Sunday.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
HERB POPE: Absolutely, definitely everybody is going to come into this
tournament and try and win it all obviously. For the long‑term goal for the
season I don't feel like we came up short at all. I feel like we overachieved
things, especially with the adversity we had to face and overcome, so I feel
like this season was a success for us.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
HERB POPE: You know, I've faced Brad Miller first game of the year and figured
out he's got a pump fake, so I feel like we handled him. He changed a lot more
shots than he blocked. He did a great job of stepping up. You've got to give
credit to their guards. He couldn't bounce pass anything in there because when
he would step up they were in there for the steal. He made you second‑guess
yourself when you got in the lane. I felt like he blocked shots, that's what
he was supposed to do, but he changed more shots than what anybody gives him
credit for.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Peyton Siva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22009)

### [Russ Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23323)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  61  
SETON HALL  55

  
COACH PITINO: It was a hard‑fought game for us. Russ is not used to playing
that many consecutive minutes. He's obviously a much better free throw
shooter. Normally he hits the rim (laughter), but he was so gassed because he
was playing so hard that‑‑ he's 112 pounds, so he just got really, really
tired. But he helped us. Payton I thought played his best point guard game of
the season with the exception of throwing it to Russ when we had the lead
there at the break because Russ pays no attention to clock, time, score. He is
just Pac Man. He just looks to gobble everything up and go to the rim. Outside
of that he played terrific.  
  
Q. Just talk about, I remember you were saying that at this point of the
year, this is kind of how you have to play a little bit. Are you expecting to
see these kind of games the rest of this weekend and next week, as well?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we're a mirror image of each other. We play the same type
of zone that's really man. We try to confuse the opponents. We press a little
bit more than they do.  
RUSS SMITH: Don't give away our secrets.  
COACH PITINO: I think they know now. (Laughter).  
But we really did a good job tonight especially in the second half of getting
the ball on the interior and making some plays. Real proud of our guys. I told
them it's just got to be about defense. Defense helps you advance. In the
second half we started hitting some shots and it was much better.  
  
Q. Do you have as much sway with the selection committee and can you get
Seton Hall in or do you think they should be in?  
COACH PITINO: Well, to show you how much clout I had with John Marinatto, if
you look at the schedule this year, I think Syracuse is 1, Pitt was 2 or 3 and
we played them both twice. I've been on the road four straight years at West
Virginia. On the road twice with Cincinnati. I wish Sauce (John Marinatto)
would get off his ass and follow the schedule and say one of my main guys in
life is getting shafted with the schedule.  
I will say this, because this was a big day for us with Temple. John
Marinatto, and you all know I love the guy, but he has done the most
incredible job I've seen in some time. I didn't even think he was up for this
Herculine effort. To get Boise State in football, San Diego State and all
those teams all at once, and then we had to have Memphis, we had to have
Temple. I'm real proud of him because he preserved the legacy of Dave Gavitt
[check], and all of us who loved Dave wanted to see the BIG EAST be preserved
and he went out and got Memphis with the culture of urban basketball, real
proud of Villanova for supporting their neighbor and getting them in, and
we're real excited to have them in.  
I say this joking around. This guy Joe Lunardi has no agenda. How would you
like to wake up in the morning and all you do is bracketology all day long?
Can you imagine that? He doesn't pay attention to his wife, he doesn't pay
attention to his children, all he does all night long is bracketology. So just
follow him because his batting average is incredible. The only thing obviously
is he doesn't know where teams go, so if he does they're in, they're in.
Everybody call Joe. Here's his number, by the way, just write this down. But
just ask him because he's really on the money most of the time. I think Seton
Hall is worthy to get in but you're all going to say well, he loves Kevin
Willard like a son. I think Seton Hall is terrific and they've had a good
year.  
Everybody says the BIG EAST gets so many teams. Look, Connecticut, they can
beat anybody in the country and they're in the bottom tier of the conference.
I think they do, but I've got no sway with that type of stuff.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to Marquette, as you guys trying to figure things out late
in the season.  
PEYTON SIVA: Definitely. Marquette is a tough team. We played them tough at
their place until the end. But like Coach P said, it starts with defense with
us. As long as we continue to play defense and continue to get steals, then
that's when we're at our best. When we just focus on offense and focus on
that, then we play bad, we have our slumps. Right now just focusing on
defense. Me and Russ have a little steal battle going on. I had six, I don't
know how many he had. Zero. So that's what we're going off of today.  
COACH PITINO: But Russ had 15 fouls.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Gorgui impact defensively? How much do you think he
bothered the other side?  
COACH PITINO: You know, one of the problems with having CL, and I think it
definitely affects our free throw shooting, I'm not playing enough guys to do
what we did tonight from a pressing standpoint. But our goal tonight was one
thing and only one thing, and that's to wear out Theodore. We just want to
wear him out. But what happens in that situation because I'm not playing a
whole lot of guys is that sometimes you lose certain things, but we did not‑‑
he is probably one of the top point guards in America in terms of what he does
for a team, so our goal tonight is just to make sure he had no legs the entire
game.  
  
Q. But he came back and hurt you late in the game.  
COACH PITINO: Tough shot, I mean, real tough shot, and speaks volumes to what
type of player he is. But tough shot, made good plays. But really, great
players make great plays, and he did certainly, but our guys made some great
plays down the stretch with some inside to outside, occur I can to Russ,
Peyton did a great job of running the team, and like I said, that was his best
point guard performance of the season.  
  
Q. Peyton, you guys seemed to be going at it pretty good in the second
half?  
PEYTON SIVA: Definitely, Jordan Theodore, like Coach P says is one of the best
point guards, especially what he do for his team. He runs their offense, and
our goal today, my goal, was just to try to force him into turnovers and not
give him open shots. We did a pretty good job in the first half. Second half
he got to our big mens' chest and got fouls. We always get up for any team,
and like coach said, just worry about defense all the time, and it showed
today?  
  
Q. Coach, just nine turnovers, last time you played them 24. What did your
guards do to handle it better?  
COACH PITINO: Well, Peyton worked‑‑ we didn't show him the tape of the last
game purposely, but today we spaced them real well. We got the ball inside
when they came after us, and we were going to run a certain offense whether
they were going to play man or zone. But what we did a very good job of‑‑
because last night they had great confidence, we were going to take away the
three‑point line, and we did a very good job of that. We felt if we took away
the three‑point line when we got to the foul line and made our free throws,
which we did not do, we were going to win the game.  
  
Q. You mentioned some similarities with the way they play and the way you
play. You watched them yesterday and you saw them today. Did you get the
feeling maybe they were one or two experienced players away from what they
‑‑  
COACH PITINO: No, I just think that we played really good defense, and we're
not the greatest offensive team, but we played really good defense. We're one
of the top defensive teams in the country. Last night they got open looks.
Tonight they struggled. Even when we fouled them a couple times, we weren't
going to give them an open look, so it's a credit to the defense playing
great. We had 39 deflections tonight, which is very, very high.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
COACH PITINO: I was infuriated by him in the first half because he passed up
three open looks. I use him as the analogy. We don't count misses here. An
open look, you take it. If you're guarded, ball fake, give someone else an
open look. I say this honestly because usually he takes challenged shots.
Tonight we talked about him, Russ, under ten seconds on the shot clock, all
twos. Anything under ten, do what you want, and he took all good shots
tonight. This is the first game where he took all good shots that we played.
But his mentality is contagious on everybody else because he has no fear. He's
a 6'0" New York guard that has no fear. He's bailed us out of more difficult
situations this year because of‑‑ and I wanted Kyle to do that because he had
so many open looks. He started hesitating and you can't hesitate. He also
started taking NBA threes. Sometimes the lines here confuse you.  
  
Q. What did you think of these jerseys?  
COACH PITINO: Unfortunately wait until you see the‑‑ these guys love them.
They're the lightest uniforms you've ever seen, and it's infrared. You're not
going to believe the color of the‑‑ now we become a visitor. This is modest
and mild compared to‑‑ Syracuse has played so well in those uniforms that we
thought we could take a page out of their book.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGETOWN  64  
PITTSBURGH  52

  
COACH DIXON: Well, congratulations to Georgetown, the win. Obviously I thought
we got to off a good start. We did some good things, attacked the zone, did
some pretty good things again as the game progressed. We didn't do what we
needed to do as far as rebounding, and that was clearly a deficiency in our
area, and then attacking the zone not as good a job as we normally do,
something we usually do a pretty good job of but did not get what we needed to
do. Proud of how our guys played, proud of our seniors. This is their last
time to play in the garden in the Big East Championship, and I know they
wanted to go out of here winning this thing, but we came up short, and
Georgetown played very well.  
I thought they were patient on the offensive end, and then defense, I really
thought their zone hurt us more than I anticipated. They played against us at
our place and we attacked it pretty well but did not in this game, and so we
didn't get more offensive rebounds which is something we usually do against
the zone, and that usually is a way that we hurt it, too, and didn't get that
done. Congratulations to Georgetown. Very proud of our guys, our two seniors
here and how much they battled and played. I wanted to end this at the Garden
here with great memories at the Garden. Played well last night, didn't play as
well today, but we'll‑‑ again, I'll say how proud of them, how well they
played.  
  
Q. Jamie, difference between the first time you guys played Georgetown and
today in terms of what they were able to do this game?  
COACH DIXON: Well, we got off to a good start. I thought we got some good
penetration, started out in the zone and we got some penetration against the
zone. Tray got in some foul trouble this game, as a number of our guys did,
and I think it just kind of took away from the aggressiveness that we wanted
to play with. Tray did a good job of getting in the lane. I thought we did a
good job of getting‑‑ keeping him out front early, but eventually they
couldn't get the ball inside, and they hurt us more inside this game and that
was something we didn't see, but I think the fouls had something to do with
that, taking away our aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Yesterday you guys kind of bullied the St. John's team and were physical
with them. How much did Georgetown's length present a problem for you guys?  
NASIR ROBINSON: It was a big problem for us. We was going in there, shooting
against two and three guys. They did a good job of rebounding, and they just
out worked‑‑ they were more physical than us.  
  
Q. How about J.J.?  
COACH DIXON: J.J. played hard. He hurt his ankle there in the second half, had
to take him out there, and I don't know that he felt comfortable. But we never
quite got him going. We never really got anybody going, offensively. And it
just didn't quite seem we got the penetration or interior touches against the
zone that we wanted to get and played inside out and that's what, I think,
hurt us again the zone. We got off to a great start early, I thought we got
some touches inside, but as the game progressed had less success getting
inside and less success with the penetration.  
I think it's a reflection of how we attacked it and a reflection of all our
guys really. We've got to do a better job and I've got to do a better job with
that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the NCAA?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, obviously we knew we had to win this tournament here, and
obviously it's been a nice streak and something that I guess only a few
schools have done more. But right now, it's all about this game and how we
feel after this one for us, for me personally I should say, and I just felt we
were going to play better. I thought we were going to play better. We played
well to start the game, did some good things. I thought we defended pretty
well, but as the game progressed, we continued to foul and then our attack
against the zone just did not live up to what we needed to do.  
  
Q. For two guys that have spent pretty much your entire careers at the top
of the rankings and playing in some very memorable NCAA Tournament games, will
it take a minute to sort of gather yourself and get geared up for the NIT or
is that an opportunity ‑‑ are you eager for that opportunity to go out on a
nice note?   
NASIR ROBINSON: Yeah, it's tough. I mean, obviously this is the first time in
our lives we've gone through this situation. We're just going to finish off
strong, NIT or whatever, we're just going to finish off strong and keep
fighting.  
  
Q. So you guys would want to play in the NIT if they invite you?  
ASHTON GIBBS: Yeah, I'll play NIT. It's basketball at the end of the day.
That's what we came to college for is to play basketball. Just wherever we can
play, we're definitely going to play our hardest.

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Anthony Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23335)

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Victor Rudd, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23336)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SOUTH FLORIDA  56  
VILLANOVA  47

  
COACH HEATH: Well, it's hard to beat a team three times. Villanova, they're
very aggressive, and it's hard to run anything. But our defense is what's got
us here where we are right now, and we've got to hang our hat on it. I'm
really proud of the effort the guys gave out there on the court. We've got to
play a little bit better tomorrow, quite a bit better tomorrow, but we'll
enjoy this win for a moment and try to steal another win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the jump you got off to, especially what Victor
did, to have control of the game early?  
COACH HEATH: Yeah, he came out on fire, and we needed that. We needed somebody
to jump start us a little bit, and I thought he did a great job of attacking
the basket. He knocked down the three, got out in transition a little bit,
too, and really looked like we had a chance to maybe open the game up a little
bit. But Villanova came back. But we did get off to a great start, and I think
that was a big key to the game.  
  
Q. Do you almost see some similarities with Notre Dame?  
COACH HEATH: Absolutely, yeah. I think there's a very good comparison. Both
teams in the non‑conference. Didn't necessarily have all their parts, and
we're trying to figure a way to be successful out there on the court. Once we
got all of our guys towards the end of December when we got Poland back and
Anthony after his six games where he was out, we became a much better
basketball team. As time went on during conference play, you could really see
us gelling on the defensive end and figuring out ways we can be effective
offensively.  
  
Q. Ninth straight game where you held your opponent under 60 points. Could
you speak to the level of consistency you've shown on defense?  
COACH HEATH: It's a little bit of both. When we're grinding out possessions
that helps, too, but you can't deny the fact that normally teams, their
scoring is down, but their field goal percentage is down, as well. We were
No.1 in field goal percentage in the BIG EAST Conference. It is a statement
that, one, we don't give up a lot of easy baskets, we challenge shots, and we
really help each other. I think the trust level on our defense is extremely
high, and that's why I think we are so effective.  
But it's something that we're very proud of, how well we're defending.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the significance of being in the Big East
Tournament quarterfinals for the first time in this program?  
COACH HEATH: Yeah, it's definitely a step in the right direction, and it shows
that our program has improved quite a bit. You know, we want more. We're still
very hungry. You can tell there's a newness about our team out there tonight
because we played sometimes like it was our first time. But once we settled
in, we started playing a lot better. But definitely our program is on the
rise, and I think tonight is a testament to that.  
  
Q. You guys have accomplished so much for your program this year but there's
still that question of what that's all going to mean next week. How
frustrating is that?  
COACH HEATH: You know, 12 wins plus a tournament win in this league, and
there's questions. I don't know. I don't know why there should be, but there
are. But it's good fuel for us, and we continue to use whatever things we can
to keep us hungry, and I think our guys, when they hear those things, it
motivates them.  
  
Q. The post play wasn't there very much. Can you talk about the guards?  
COACH HEATH: Yeah, normally we are much more effective with our post play, and
tonight for whatever reason we didn't finish a lot of shots. Gilchrist had
some shots around the basket and Anderson never really got involved and seemed
like fits couldn't get it going, either. But it's good that Vic picked up the
slack and AC really turned it on in the second half. It's been a team effort.
We're one of those teams where I don't think we have a double figure score, so
it's been different guys on different nights all the time.  
  
Q. You guys held Maalik Wayns to just nine points tonight, which is a rare
occurrence. Can you talk a little bit about your plan for how you guys handled
him?  
COACH HEATH: Yeah. Well, he's a great player, and he's fun to watch when
you're not coaching against him. You know, Anthony I thought did a fantastic
job just staying in front of him and not allowing him to get to the basket or
get some clean looks, and as time went on, we were able to switch and put Hugh
Robertson, a little bit longer defender on him, as well. We had kind of two
fresh guys out there that were doing a good job staying with him. But our
defenses, I think, were really solidified. When you've got a guy like Ryan
Anderson in the back calling out screens and helping and helper and things
like that, I think that really helps our defense. He missed some shots he
normally makes, but I thought we did a good job, as well.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could sort of look back to that Notre Dame game in
early January and talk about what you remember from that and how far you guys
have come since then.  
ANTHONY COLLINS: We've come a long way offensively and early in the year we
kind of struggled a lot. Now we're starting to pick it up a little bit. We
were still close in the Notre Dame game the last few minutes, I believe,
because our defense, of course, if we just come out on offense and execute, we
should give ourselves a chance.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the first couple minutes, just your energy and
the start you had getting things going?  
VICTOR RUDD, JR.: I was just trying to get things in the flow, and that's what
I did. I ran the floor, got easy buckets. I hit a three when I was wide open,
and that's pretty much what it was. I was being aggressive attacking the
basket not trying to settle for a lot of threes.  
  
Q. Was there an urgency? What was the urgency you felt in this game?  
VICTOR RUDD, JR.: I think we just wanted to win. We're trying to get in the
tournament. We've got to win to get in the tournament, and we know what we've
got to do to get those wins. That's pretty much what it was.  
  
Q. You kind of joked about this as you got up on the podium, but what can we
expect tomorrow?  
COACH HEATH: Well, I think both teams will value possessions, and they're very
good defensively. Jack Cooley has had big time games against us the last
couple years, so we've got to do a good job with him, and Jerian Grant has
been very good, as well, and Martin. They can shoot the three. They have an
inside presence. They're a difficult team to guard because of that, and they
execute well. You know, I don't expect it to be a high scoring game, but if we
get a chance to get it up and down the court a little bit, we'll try. But if
not, we know we're going to have to work real hard for good shots, too.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, they cut your lead to five at one point in
the second half. What kind of confidence do you have in your defense, though,
that when you need to get stops, you can get them?  
VICTOR RUDD, JR.: I think we have great confidence in our defense. We've been
in games where we have to defend when we were up by one point and we had to
get a stop to win the game. We rely on our defense for a lot of things, and it
came through for us.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CONNECTICUT  71  
WEST VIRGINIA  67 (OT)

  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, needless to say, I think probably, I'm not sure what
Bobby would have said, but‑‑ actually I loved coaching against Bobby and all
of our guys that I know and some of these other guys I don't know all that
well. But he knows that next week is an important week for all of us.  
For us, we got pounded on the boards. We know that. It's kind of been
happening a little bit, and we couldn't get our front court woken up. I think
Alex did a good job. I thought both Roscoe and Andre did not play well early.
But we hung in there. We were right there, okay.  
And then the constant pounding, because you see all those offensive rebounds,
you also remember that about six or seven of them are blocked shots. They seem
to get every blocked shot that we had. So not that it's misleading, but we
played defensive a little bit different than maybe some other teams, and down
the stretch it did help since we blocked two of their lay‑ups.  
Point being is that I thought we were going to win the game in regulation.
Once Shabazz made his three, it was true, we were only down four at that
point, or two, and we ran out of‑‑ we got into overtime, of course losing
Shabazz and all the things that did happen.  
But as I see the second half and I see the overtime, Jones who was a
tremendous basketball player, and I just got a chance to tell him so, I don't
think he scored a heck of a lot over the last 15 minutes. As a matter of fact
I don't quite frankly remember him scoring.  
And I think that Bryant had a very difficult time. Shabazz did an incredible
job on him. We all did a good job switching because at times Shabazz was just
great‑‑ wasn't good defensively, he was great. Bryant is a hell of a player.
And then we ran a little something late in the overtime which eventually
became the game winner, and that's kind of a Ray Allen. All we did was kind of
change up our circle play and sent a cross screen with Alex across for‑‑ and
they were waiting for the whirlwind and we went straight at him and came off,
and we were just talking about this a game or two ago when he didn't shoot the
ball, and I said no, the other guy is what we want to shoot it. That's your
job. Your job is to shoot the basketball. What a great job for most people. We
changed it up a bit and he got open and there wasn't an ounce of hesitation
and made a big three and we hung on down the stretch.  
I couldn't be prouder of our kids. I think for a team that obviously has had
its ups, downs, no coach, no Boatright, all the various things that have
happened to us, that's not‑‑ those are things that happen and they happen to
other teams. But I can't judge that. I only can judge mine, my family, my
guys, and my guys have come back, won three in a row, and I truly believe that
a coach couldn't be prouder. And I honestly mean this. It's a funny word to
throw around because you know you've had some moments to be proud, and
honestly bigger places because you know what the Big East Tournament means to
me, but that's one heck of a win. It's two teams finding different ways there,
front‑court power, backcourt quickness. We had some terrific steals for
lay‑ups. So it was a great battle, and if they had won the game, they could
have won the game, but my guys weren't going to let them, and again, I'm so
proud.  
I thought Shabazz was close to magnificent. I thought Jeremy stepped up like
the big time player that he is, Alex Oriakhi was great. And let me just get
back to Andre Drummond for a moment. He didn't play 30 minutes very well. He
didn't compete the way I want him to compete. He's young. He's still learning
what this whole deal is about and you guys know what Madison Square Garden and
March is about. It's different, and even the games themselves are different.
But with ten minutes to go, I think my guys would say the same thing; he grew
up a little bit and played a hell a play and held the scorer and did a
wonderful job. I couldn't be prouder of our kids. Niels Giffey coming off the
bench. A strip, two enormous rebounds down the stretch by Shabazz. So again,
I'm incredibly proud.  
I think West Virginia is a very good team. But that was a 20‑second game
against top level competition. I'm not going to politic. I'm just telling you,
if you look at our record, you say, well, they only have 20 wins, yet we
played some people. We played some people, folks. Knock off four of those. So
we've got four. I'm telling you the honest truth. This team has been through
something and maybe it's a little different and maybe some of the guys I see
every single day would tell you, I don't know what it is but they look a
little different in how they respond to different things, and once again, I
couldn't be prouder of them. Thank you.  
  
Q. How big, especially tomorrow, is it going to be for Roscoe to play a big
role?  
COACH CALHOUN: Yeah, and maybe just the way it worked out today, he didn't
have such a great game, and that's fine, because we can go back and forth to
different games and the three of us can talk about, this game and that game
and so forth. Roscoe is going to be there for us. He's starting to understand
who he is, what is he. He is a hell of a basketball player is what it is. He
can do all kinds of different things. He couldn't get himself going today.
That happens. He got posted up by big guys. He normally plays threes and fours
defensively, can play any perimeter person, but yeah, he'll be big tomorrow
because we've got to crack that zone.  
  
Q. That was West Virginia's last Big East Tournament game ever. Can you talk
about the significance of that and what the league will look like without them
and Temple next year?  
COACH CALHOUN: Yeah, first of all, I think Temple is a great addition. I can't
get a word in edgewise with Rick praising Temple. I always thought Temple
would be a great addition being in Philadelphia. That's not against Rick, I
don't Twitter or Tweet or any of those things (laughter). You know what I'm
talking about.  
But my point being is, Temple will be a great addition to our league. They've
got a tremendous coach, it's a great city for basketball, and I know that it
will make an incredible trip there for a lot of folks.  
But West Virginia leaving is sad in many, many ways. One of the great
experiences that UConn ever had, 1987, '88, we go down there and we're down
two, Tate George makes a bank shot to send us to overtime and we hadn't won
anything from a national perspective, and we win. We go on to win the NIT that
year, beat Ohio State in 1988, my second year there, and I remember walking
around the coliseum, got the early update of the shoot‑around, looking at the
history.  
I'm going to miss them greatly. I'm going to miss Bobby, going to miss the
competitiveness, that's the kind of game you play against them, and he's
heading on his way to being a Hall of Fame coach. I don't think this league
needs to be losing Hall of Fame coaches. I know it's not basketball driven,
but I'm going to miss them a great deal. I think West Virginia has been a
great addition to this league, and from Jerry West to all the other great
things that have happened, we're going to miss them a great deal. They run a
tremendous program, and my good friend John Bilein was there before and now
Bobby, I'm going to miss them personally. It's a place I like going. It was
tough. Yes, I'm going to miss them a great deal.  
  
Q. Shabazz, given the way you played on pretty much both ends of the floor,
what was the feeling checking out with 2:30 to play?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: First, I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know I had
four fouls, and then when I heard a lot of West Virginia fans going crazy,
then it kind of hit me, wow, I got my fifth foul. I didn't know that at all.  
But I have faith in my teammates no matter what. I know Jeremy, I know boat, I
know Andre and them guys, they're going to miss me, but I love watching them
play because they play with a lot of heart. That's exactly what they did. I
told Jeremy, you've got to be willing to shoot now, you've got to be looking
for hits, and when he came off that curve, there was no doubt in my mind it
was going in because that's what he works on in practice, that's what we work
on in practice. I yelled at boat for missing three free throws, but boat is
always there for us. Go back to the first game he came and he knocked down
three free throws we needed for Florida State. That's what he gives you, he
gives you a lot of heart no matter what. He played with a lot of heart like
Andre. Andre is young but even out there he gave us all he got. He played
Kevin Jones for the last minute and that's all we want from everybody on the
team, you just want them to show up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that play, that three ‑pointer you hit?   
JEREMY LAMB: Well, yeah, I knew we needed a score, and in the game yesterday,
Coach told me to shoot, and I didn't take a shot. You know, Coach was just
saying, I want you shooting the ball.  
So today they ran a play for me. They set great screens and I was able to get
wide open, have a little time to set my feet, and I just shot it with
confidence, and thank God it went in.  
COACH CALHOUN: Alex made the adjustment. Alex made the adjustment with the
side screen across as opposed to down screen, and the kid was starting to come
up the lane, he whacked him, and he made it.  
  
Q. I'm thinking about what you said, the front court couldn't wake up ‑‑  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, their front court dominated the game for most of the
game. Our backcourt held its own and then took over and won the game for us.  
  
Q. And as I was watching in the other room, at the end your team's momentum
picked up. What happens at that moment when you have to really dig to end up
where you are right now?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: You know, we've been through a lot this season, not having
Coach, not really understanding the chemistry, not really understanding the
leadership, and sometimes we questioned our heart and how we played. But after
that Pittsburgh game, all that went away. We dug deep in that Pittsburgh game.
We tied the game up, we were down by one point, and we could have quit, but we
dug deep and we learned from our mistakes. The Providence game before when we
lost by two, and today we did the same thing. We dug down deep. We were down
by nine with three minutes and 40 seconds left. We dug down deep. At the end
of the day Coach told us one thing, we've got to lock up the game. We have
everything to lose. Why not go out there and give it your all. You're playing
in one of the best stadiums in the country, Madison Square Garden, who doesn't
want to play there. Everybody just went out there and played as hard as we
can, win or lose. As long as, like Coach said today, as long as you get on
that pillow and said I give it my all, what else can you say and what else can
you do?  
  
Q. Have you talked to these guys about this is sort of a fresh start?  
COACH CALHOUN: That's the exact words I said. We don't have, as we normally do
during the season, before the game we put 16 up, 17, as we go forward, and
then getting ready for the DePaul game we put one up. I said, look around, new
season. The old one is done. Me being away gave me a different perspective on
my guys. It was a better perspective because I knew who they wanted to be, we
just had to find a way. The moment I walked back in the gym on Friday, I
looked at the guys' faces, that's not what I'm talking about, I'm talking
about the connection we all have with each other and just the fact of what we
were going to do. And over the last three games we've done things quite
frankly during the season that we haven't done. In some ways it's been
attributable to a terrific schedule, the best schedule in the country. Some of
it is attributable to us. We didn't do the job. We admit that. But yesterday
was No.1, today was No.2, tomorrow will be No.3. This is the wild, wild west
and you all know how crazy it can be. But it gives you a chance not to undo
anything because I never feel that way. I feel that tournament play is
wonderful.  
One of the reasons I think we do well in tournaments is because we play with
even a little different attitude. We don't have anything to lose. We're going
home. In my opinion we're going to play next week someplace, but we've got a
hell of a lot to gain. We're going to really show some people that maybe some
of it is caused by us, some of it is caused because maybe we've got to talk
about different things, and we're pretty good. We did lose five games by three
points. All the other various excuses that you eventually make. Bottom line,
you're probably looking at a little different basketball team than maybe you
saw during the year, and that's good. I'm not talking about making shots and
all that kind of stuff. I'm talking really about just the stuff that teams win
with, and we won with that stuff in the past, we've won with it for 25 years.
UConn will continue to win with it for a long time going on beyond this in my
opinion. This is the program.  
And it may take us, and it did. No doubt, you are 100 percent right, much
longer than I could ever anticipate, and I was gone for the last eight, to
find it. Is it magical? No, it's just us. It's just us understanding each
other, how much we can benefit, okay, if we each give all that we have, and I
think we have.  
  
Q. Last year, last regular season you lost to Notre Dame. You had a practice
where you felt like the practice was great.  
COACH CALHOUN: Tremendous.  
  
Q. This year you're starting to say the same things.  
COACH CALHOUN: But I'm going to talk about Jeremy and I'm going to tell you
and Shabazz is going to tell you and coach is going to tell you, last year and
this year, two completely different deals. This is not Kemba Walker. He's a
totally different player. In the last week that I've been around Shabazz, he's
a different player than he was three weeks ago. He's a different player. He's
not a different person, but he's found some other things, like even himself
because he has so much stuff to give, and I mean that very honestly.  
And Alex got a technical yesterday. Really didn't mind it. Alex is now
standing up. We all know what we're talking about when we talk this year.
Texas, Tennessee, Michigan State, Kentucky, I think any comparisons are unfair
to last year's team and unfair to this team. Kemba is making a lot of money,
just built a house, doing great. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Given that last year was unique, it was its own piece of work, but here
you are, and you're two wins in. Does it feel like it's happening again? Can
it ever happen again?  
COACH CALHOUN: I don't think it can happen again, but then again, I said it
could never happen in the first place. Would we like to give it a shot? Yeah,
but when people said to me, you guys are defending national champs, I said,
no, we're not. I saw the trophy case right at UConn. We don't have to defend
it, we have it. It's true, we don't have to defend anything. We're the
national champs. What we have to do is create our own stuff. We've got 20 wins
now, so it's time to create more. My point being simply is that are there
things out there we'd love to do? You named one, okay. But I think‑‑ I'm not
sure how many teams will ever do that again. Would we like to take a stab at
it? Everybody out there would. Everybody out there would. We're just going to
try to play tomorrow's basketball game to take it where it may. When we beat
DePaul and Georgetown we weren't thinking about the rest of the stuff, nor are
we today. We're thinking about we're playing one of the best, in my opinion,
along with Kentucky, the best team in the country tomorrow.

CONNECTICUT  71  
WEST VIRGINIA  67 (OT)

  
Q. Kevin, I know this is tough, but can you talk about your emotions right
now, last Big East Tournament game and what's going through your mind?  
KEVIN JONES: Just a little bit of disbelief, disappointment. My team played
their hardest. We didn't make the correct decisions at the end. We didn't hold
on to the ball. They stole it, two turnovers for lay‑ups that they really
didn't earn. It's just tough because me and truck definitely wanted to go out
winners of the Big East Tournament our senior year, and it's tough. But it's
the past now. We've got to keep on moving forward and hopefully make it into
the tournament and try to make a run in the tournament.  
  
Q. Did UConn switch up their defensive looks in the final six minutes?  
KEVIN JONES: I think it was a little bit of‑‑ it might have been that they had
Andre Drummond on me, which is a total player, making it tough on me for my
shots. But Coach ran a couple plays for me, which some of my teammates weren't
able to find me in the right spots. UConn made the correct plays at the end to
win the game. They played how they were supposed to.  
  
Q. Truck, you guys were 0 for 11, field goals in overtime. Do you think it
was more legs tired or nerves or anxiety or what do you think was going on?  
DARRYL BRYANT: I think it was just the fact that we didn't execute down the
stretch like we were supposed to. I mean, it just was a rough game. You got
up, got a big lead and feel like you're about to put the game away and then
the game slips away from you. It's rough. When teams go on a run, we all know
it's basketball and it's a game of runs, but it got tough down the stretch.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel that slipping away the last few minutes? They seemed to
turn up the pressure.  
DARRYL BRYANT: I mean, I don't think‑‑ I felt that we still had the game. I
mean, it was still a close game, two, three‑point game, so that's one
possession. I don't think we was down on ourselves. We all thought as a team
we were going to win the game, even when we were down four. One of us will hit
a three and then we'll get a stop. But that didn't happen.  
  
Q. Six or seven games where you've had sizable leads in the second half, is
there a common theme in these close losses and stumbling down the stretch?  
KEVIN JONES: Well, I think it's just our execution offensively down the
stretch. When coach asked us to run a play, we have to execute it as well as
possible, and I don't think we do a good job of that, and also, we don't do a
good job of staying strong with the ball. We let people take the ball from us,
and it's kind of a matter of getting out‑toughed the last five minutes?  
  
Q. Can we get your thoughts on the fact that this was the last Big East
basketball game for the program?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, it's been a good run. We've enjoyed it, most of it
anyway. I mean, there's nothing like coming to the Garden to play in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Do you think you're in the NCAAs?  
COACH HUGGINS: We've played more games against top 100 people than anybody in
the country. They say play a tough schedule, we have. We've played more games
against top 50 teams. We've done everything they've asked us to do other than
maybe win a couple games. You all know that there were some‑‑ and several of
those games there were some other factors that were involved. It wasn't just
us. You know, you hope that the committee looks at that.  
  
Q. It seemed like Kevin really dominated that game for a long time but there
was a seven ‑ or eight‑minute period where he didn't shoot it much or take too
many shots. Can you talk about what was going on there?   
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah, he was playing with a bunch of freshmen that don't have
any idea what the hell they're doing. I mean, we run a set to start the game
with him and he's wide open and we look him off. They don't mean to. They're
good kids, they don't mean to. But to do what this guy has done, both of these
guys actually, to do what they've done with seven freshmen and a junior
college transfer‑‑ and the junior college transfer didn't really play until
the end. We couldn't ask them to do any more. You hope that your freshmen get
better and start to understand a little bit better. You can't give them the
ball at the end, and knowing full well it's hard to guard him at the foul
line. It's hard, so you can't hand him the ball.  
  
Q. Williamson's shot at the end, what broke down on that play there?  
COACH HUGGINS: He made a hard shot.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Welcome, everybody. The Big East has announced the addition of
Temple University as a member of the Big East conference.  
We're going to ask everybody for some opening remarks and then we're going to
ask for some questions from the media.  
JOHN MARINATTO: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for coming. Today is
an exciting day for the Big East conference. I'm pleased to formally announce
that Temple has accepted an invitation to join the BIG EAST conference as a
football playing member effective July 1, 2012, and as an all sports playing
member effective July 1 of 2013. The BIG EAST Conference, board of directors
voted unanimously this morning to extend an invitation for full membership to
Temple University upon a motion made by Villanova University father Peter
Donahue and seconded by the president of the University of Louisville, James
Ramsey.  
I would like to welcome Temple University and its 22 varsity sports and almost
700 student athletes, alumni and fans to the BIG EAST Conference. The addition
of Temple gives the BIG EAST a total of 18 full members and 13 that compete in
the sport of fast break.  
Temple Athletic Director Bill Bradshaw and I first met to explore possible BIG
EAST Conference membership well over a year ago, and our discussions
intensified over the past several weeks. I also had the pleasure of working
with Board Chair Pat O'Connor and General Counsel George Moore to bring a
potential partnership together.  
It didn't take long for us to confirm that Temple University would be a great
complement to the BIG EAST Conference's future makeup. Our decision to invite
Temple was based on a number of important factors, including its long‑standing
tradition as a basketball powerhouse, its renewed commitment to competing at
the highest level in football, and the great value in adding the Philadelphia
television market to our football footprint.  
In addition, Temple University is a highly regarded academic institution that
is nationally ranked by U.S. News and World Report.  
As we prepare for the future and our new membership structure, I am proud to
say that the BIG EAST Conference has improved its total television household's
footprint by over 20 percent, including 13 of the top 50 markets, spanning
four time zones. We have added the potential for a football championship game
as soon as 2013. We moved to a balanced eight‑game league schedule in
football, and our members represent six of the top‑ten football recruiting
states in the country.  
In men's basketball, the new BIG EAST features 16 teams that have competed in
the Final Four, for a total of 50 Final Four appearances. That's four more
than the present day membership encompasses. We are extremely pleased with our
expansion efforts and are very confident that the future of the BIG EAST is as
bright as it has ever been.  
To that end, we will take a pause on the expansion front, having met our
expansion objectives. We now transition our focus to the future and
specifically our upcoming television negotiations.  
I would be remiss if I also didn't take this opportunity to formally and
publicly acknowledge the leadership that Villanova University demonstrated
during these negotiations. Father Donahue and his team were supportive of
adding their long‑time rival and worked very hard with us to address the
potential and any potential conflicts that the addition of Temple could
create. The BIG EAST membership is grateful to Villanova and its dedication to
the conference.  
In closing, I would like to once again offer my sincere appreciation and
gratitude to President Hart and Bill for their patience and support as we
worked to create this partnership. I look forward to having the two of you on
our side of the table when we work together in the future. Thank you all again
for your interest.  
JUDY GENSHAFT: Well, this is a very exciting time today, and as we welcome
another outstanding institution to the BIG EAST Conference. Adding a
traditional academic and athletic powerhouse like Temple University to the new
BIG EAST Conference will provide further brand quality, competitive strength
and academic prestige to our ongoing membership makeup.  
Temple University is nationally ranked and is an urban public research
university that offers 40 doctoral degree programs, 121 Master's Degree
programs, and many programs that contribute to research and scholarship. The
Temple University student‑athletes are among the best the institution has to
offer, both on the field and in the classroom.  
Last year, 343 student athletes were honored for earning cumulative grade
point averages above 3.0 for a semester. 11 Owl teams compiled GPAs of above
3.0 for a semester. In 2011 fall semester, 80 student athletes made the
conference honor roll.  
As chair of the BIG EAST board of directors and president of the University of
South Florida, I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the
outstanding support and collegiality that Villanova President, Father Peter
Donahue, has demonstrated throughout this process. Villanova University has
been a proud member of the BIG EAST Conference since 1981 and is a significant
contributor to the BIG EAST as any in the history of the league.  
I know I speak on behalf of all of our presidents when I say that we
appreciate all of the support from Temple's administration and look forward to
working together with them and competing with them in the very near future.
Thank you.  
FATHER PETER DONOHUE: As you know, Villanova University has been a member of
the BIG EAST for 30 years, and in that time, we've seen, or we've proven
ourselves athletically with many successes, 10 NCAA team titles and over 75
BIG EAST Conference champions in one sport or another. Our men's basketball
team played in two NCAA Final Fours and taking home the national championship
in 1985.  
Over those 30 years, we've seen many changes, both in the BIG EAST and in the
Philadelphia sports market, and today's announcement is positive for all three
organizations, for the BIG EAST, for Villanova University and for Temple
University.  
Since other people will talk about the competitive and rivalry between
Villanova and Temple on the athletic field, I'd like to just talk a little bit
about the collaborations we've had for a long time in other areas, as well.
Our two great Philadelphia institutions are about 12 miles apart. I think
that's about the same distance as Duke and Chapel Hill.  
But when it comes to working together on issues of higher education in the
Philadelphia region, there is no gap between us. I recall that since 2005 our
College of Engineering has been a partnership with Temple University on a
storm water management project called the Temple‑Villanova Sustainable Storm
Water Initiative. For seven years now, our students, Temple and Villanova,
have worked together. Our students have learned together. And we have applied
for and won grants together. And we have helped small municipalities implement
their best practices.  
Last fall, our region saw flooding and record rainfall that made this project
even more important. Now, I'm not comparing college athletes to storm water,
but you can take it whatever way you want it. It's because our two
universities have had a long history and mutual respect for each other and for
the greater welfare of the Philadelphia community. Today's announcement is
another step in our work together. This time athletics, and Philadelphia
sports fans are among the many beneficiaries of this. We work closely with the
BIG EAST Conference presidents to insight Temple University into our
conference in a way that strengthens the conference and boosts both individual
schools. This is a foundation for how we move forward and for all to succeed
in the nation's fourth largest media market.  
This move enhances our rivalry and recognizes the equity that Villanova has
built for the BIG EAST athletics in Philadelphia over the last three decades.
The BIG EAST also gave us a vote of confidence in our football program by
helping us to position it to move forward for a possible FBS level
competition, and I want to express my gratitude for the strong demonstration
and support that Villanova has received from the BIG EAST. In fact, every
aspect of today's announcement ultimately relates back to strengthening the
conference and its member institution's athletic programs, and that is good.  
So I believe that everyone sits here in front of you today very proud with the
outcome that we are able to move forward collaboratively, and to be consistent
with the missions of our institutions and the values that we place on student
athletes.  
It's critical that the conference and both universities succeed in
Philadelphia, even as my loyalty and obligation is to Villanova, we recognized
early on that we could not achieve‑‑ that we could achieve this win‑win‑win,
which ultimately we did. We just needed time to work through all the issues
together, and so to the BIG EAST I want to say that we look forward to a very
bright future. And to Temple, I wish you good luck in Atlanta City, and we
look forward to our continued friendship and partnership on the court and off
the court. Thank you.  
LEWIS KATZ: Well, on behalf of Temple, we're happy that the commissioner and
the president and my friend to my left had all the time they needed to let us
to come home to the BIG EAST. It's a wonderful, wonderful day for Temple
University athletics, for its student body, and for all in Philadelphia that
love the rivalry that used to be something called the Big Five.  
So we come, I speak for our president, our chairman, our athletic director,
our two extraordinary coaches, Coach Addazio and Coach Dunphy who's with his
team in Atlantic City and couldn't be here today to tell you that by accepting
us, you have given us the opportunity to change our programs, not only because
our financial world is now stabilized as a result of the BIG EAST allowing us
to come in and helping us to come in in the most generous fashion by helping
us to exit the MAC, but more importantly, for me, I'm one of the old timers,
so when we left I was the only one up here that remembers leaving.  
So to my friend, we're happy to be back, and I also look forward to our
continuing athletic competition on the court, our friendship off the court.  
It's good when schools in the same community can accomplish what Villanova and
Temple have accomplished, and I'd also like to thank a man who's not here, Al
Golden, who really started the Temple football program with extraordinary
recruitment to begin our rise to the top, which has been picked up and
actually excelled through Coach Steve Addazio.  
And lastly, sometimes the people that work in the ditches don't always get the
proper recognition. There's a gentleman in the back who has worked day and
night for years to bring this to fruition. He's our incredible counsel, George
Moore, who's sitting as usual in the last seat, who has put himself through
all kinds of gyrations to bring this agreement to fruition. So George, we at
Temple University are very proud of you and proud to have you lead us in this
venture. So everybody come on down and watch us kick Villanova's butt one more
time. (Laughter).  
BILL BRADSHAW: So at 6:30 this morning, I'm driving down the Schuylkill, right
by the Gladwyne exit heading east to Temple and the sun is shinning and there
is not a cloud in the sky and I turn my radio on, and it's Ruby and The
Romantics from 1963, and the song is "Our day will come," and I said, this is
going to be a special day. So that's how it started out, ladies and gentlemen.
And I just want to thank the president of the BIG EAST, the athletic
directors, particularly Commissioner John Marinatto. John, for your patience,
your poise, your professionalism through all the ups and downs of conference
affiliation and the changes. Ladies and gentlemen, don't let your sons or
daughters grow up to be commissioners or athletic directors. It's pretty
unhealthy.  
The leadership at Temple University I want to thank, particularly the board of
trustees, Chairman Patrick O'Connor, Lewis Katz, chairman of the athletic
committee of the board who you just heard from, and everyone else associated
with the senior administration. So on behalf of our coaches, staff, our
student athletes, I thank everyone who made this very special day possible.  
At the same time, I want to acknowledge the successful relationship Temple has
enjoyed with the Atlantic 10 Conference for three decades and our recent
meaningful football membership with the Mid‑American Conference.  
Some of you here today might see this announcement as a solution to the BIG
EAST football scheduling dilemma. Many of you here today who are more familiar
with Temple University and Temple athletics firsthand realize about the
significant changes at Temple University since March of 2001. Those people
know about our 39,000 students, they know about the 13,000 students who live
on or near campus, the 300,000 alumni that we have in the United States,
160,000 of them that live in the Philadelphia area, 18,000 of them that live
in the New York City area. They know about our home for football, Lincoln
Financial Field, one of the nicest football arenas on the planet. They know
about the Liacouras Center where we play our home basketball games, one of the
nicest home basketball arenas anywhere.  
Those people who get to see us up close will appreciate the overall value
Temple brings to the BIG EAST Conference, and I trust all of you know about
the value that the BIG EAST Conference brings to Temple University, and we're
very, very grateful and appreciative. We're appreciative of this opportunity.
We're excited about the future. And we thank all of you who came here to be
with us today on this very special day.  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Obviously I want to thank John Marinatto. I want to thank Nick
Carparelli in the back. A lot of work has gone into this. I also want to thank
you for your vision. It's great vision having Temple come into the BIG EAST
Conference. I've been in the BIG EAST Conference before as a football coach in
the late '90s, and I'm looking forward to coming into the conference again.
There's great rivalries, geographic rivalries, and now with the national scope
of the conference, it's really exciting right now what's going on in the BIG
EAST.  
For us as a football program and as a University, as an all‑sports athletic
program, we know how well respected the BIG EAST is and how powerful the BIG
EAST is and what the BIG EAST value and name and brand is throughout the whole
country, and now the whole country really gets to experience it. I can't wait
to have an opportunity to fly and go play the teams across like Boise and play
San Diego and Houston. It's exciting. It's a whole‑‑ college football is
expanding in a whole new way right now, and there's a lot of great times and a
lot of great new rivalries to be forged as we move forward here.  
We're excited. Bill mentioned, Lewis mentioned, obviously Philadelphia is the
greatest sports city in the country, and with Villanova and Temple in the same
city, it's just really a tremendous place. What a place to go watch college
basketball, college football, and Philadelphia has changed. Like Temple has
evolved, Philadelphia has evolved. Our facilities right now at our University,
I just want to make this point, where we are right now, we're not trying to
fumble around and see if we can find our way into major college football. This
is a plan that's been going on for quite some time. With our non‑conference
schedule that we've played, we've played several non‑BIG EAST opponents with
our facilities ongoing and our basketball facility is a brand new multimillion
dollar facility, our football facility will be finished on July 1st. I mean,
it's unbelievable what's happening. It's a new state‑of‑the‑art dormitory on
Broad Street. I could go on and on and on. But I know this: It's an exciting
time for Temple. It's an exciting time for the BIG EAST. John, we're so happy
to be a part of this BIG EAST family. It's a special, special day. It's a
landmark day. And we'll make you proud, I promise you that. And we're going to
run a classy, first‑class program, everything done the right way, and exciting
times ahead. So thank you so much for coming, and we really appreciate it, and
looking forward to the future.  
  
Q. This question is a joint question for the Commissioner and President
Donahue regarding going and exploring FBS. The process of exploring FBS
started last September and there was a long discussion, there was some action
in April, so I guess my question is how much more exploring does Villanova
actually need to do? What's the extent of that exploring, and what does the
BIG EAST need to see from Villanova to make that happen?  
FATHER PETER DONOHUE: I don't think it's necessarily a position of exploring
it more. It's how will this fit into the strategic plan of the University. But
also how the BIG EAST will continue to expand and what it needs to expand. So
it's a joint project in terms of looking at how it is.  
But we've looked at all the issues. We've examined all the issues. It's not a
matter of kind of keeping going back and examining it. We know the answers.
This will change in a little bit. At the time we were looking at it, Temple
was not a part of it, but now there could be, in the future, two schools
sharing a BIG EAST football conference within the same city, so we have to
look at that, what implications that has for both of us. And also, the
invitation has to come from the BIG EAST in terms of they wish to expand even
further than they are now in the football arena.  
So we are poised to move forward, and if it fits into our strategic plan and
the strategic plan of the BIG EAST, we can move forward with the idea. So
there's no time frame on it right now. But we've answered the situation for
ourselves. I mean, we've looked at it. So it's not a matter of exploring it
more.  
JOHN MARINATTO: The Conference's position is it wants to support all of its
membership institutions, and especially in this case, Villanova. And toward
that end in our discussions over the course of the past several weeks, we
actually made that commitment in a tangible way so we're going to support
Villanova on a number of fronts moving forward to further explore how this
fits into the strategic plan over the next several years.  
  
Q. Is there a definite invitation in the future? It sounds like there isn't,
and if there isn't, and Villanova decided, for example, if they wanted to go
and there was no invitation, would you help move them into another
conference?  
JOHN MARINATTO: Well, as Father said, we don't know what's going to unfold
over the next several years. Who would have predicted everything that's
happened over the last five months would have happened. So in terms of future
conference expansion and where we are, as I said earlier, we're taking a pause
right now. We're going to continue to explore with Villanova regarding their
FBS potential moving forward and we'll see where we ultimately end up. But for
the meantime, as I said earlier, we've made a financial commitment, we've also
devoted a lot of resources, and we're here to support all our member schools
in terms of everything they want to do, and in this case the FBS possibility
of Villanova moving forward.  
  
Q. John, did Villanova receive any concessions?  
JOHN MARINATTO: What we're working on is a way, moving forward, to explore how
two schools that are, as father mentioned, 12 miles apart, coexisting in the
same marketplace, maintaining their separate identities there, and continuing
moving forward to share the BIG EAST Conference brand. So it's a conference
initiative, something that we've taken on as a conference perspective, and
we're going to hire someone moving forward to help us, because we can't think
of all of the things that might or might not today become problematic.  
  
Q. Did you give any money to Villanova?  
JOHN MARINATTO: No. We made a financial commitment to explore FBS and a system
in that regard. We've also put aside dollars within the conference to hire a
consultant to help us work with the two institutions to identify and to try
and exploit what we can in order to ensure that they both maintain their
identity and share the conference brand in the most productive and optimum way
moving forward.  
And before we ask another question, Lewis, I wanted to follow up on your
shout‑out to George Moore, and also, at the same time, George, thank you for
all your patience over the last several weeks. And at the same time I want to
publicly, like you did, thank Peter Zern from Covington & Burling who's been
with us the last five months literally every day.  
LEWIS KATZ: But he gets paid a lot. George doesn't.  
JOHN MARINATTO: We're going to take care of that. Peter, thank you for
everything you've been doing with us over the past five months and over the
past two years, because equally, as George has been on the side of Temple,
Peter has been at our side for the last two years.  
  
Q. Bill, you mentioned the football scheduling issue. Now, when you spoke a
year ago, laid the groundwork, what was that conversation like, and was the
scheduling problem the tipping point that got it done?  
BILL BRADSHAW: The scheduling issue, the eighth member, when John and I first
got together, we talked about a lot of things at a little diner in New Jersey.  
JOHN MARINATTO: Bill and I met for the first time 16 months ago at a place
between New Jersey and New York. I think it was called the State Line Diner.
It was literally on the line, and we had breakfast there. You had a football
game, I had a football game at Rutgers, so we decided to meet in a very
clandestine way at this little diner.  
BILL BRADSHAW: Yeah, at the crack of dawn, and we were really talking about
sort of the mutual interest, and John was catching up on a lot of the changes
that were going on at Temple University in athletics and academics, the
mission, some of the construction. He was asking me questions about Temple, he
was asking him questions about the conference, particulars, we shared a lot of
information. It was a terrific meeting, but it was very preliminary because a
lot of the things John was faced with and things that were happening were
fluid, and so I would just call it sort of an introductory meeting, a meeting
to share some ideas, some thoughts about the future, and really we left it at
that.  
So scheduling wasn't part of that particular meeting that we had 16 months
ago.  
  
Q. John, there's been reports that the BIG EAST is either paying Temple's
exit fees to the MAC and the A10, or is doing so in lieu of future revenues.
Is there any truth to that and what can you comment on that?  
JOHN MARINATTO: I don't know what purpose it serves to actually get into
specifics, but I will tell you that the conference is assisting through future
revenue distributions Temple with its payout, but I don't see any point in
getting into specifics.  
  
Q. Bill or Lewis, was it ever awkward, these conversations, because of the
way things ended several years ago?  
LEWIS KATZ: He wasn't here.  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Neither was I.  
LEWIS KATZ: I'm the only one that was here. It was dreadful several years ago.
I mean, I guess it was 2002 when they actually voted‑‑ we went out in 2004‑‑
it was 2001 when they actually‑‑ and I was in charge of athletics then, and I
remember I had friends at these other colleges. You know, we didn't deserve,
truthfully, to be in the football competition in those years. But it's hard to
get kicked out.  
Everything you've heard about Villanova and Temple is accurate. When we
started to negotiate to come back in, I thought it was just a wonderful,
wonderful way to remove a blemish on our football program. And now, people
don't realize it, for the last two years, Penn State won in the last 30
seconds, minute. We're going to kick Notre Dame's butt next year. We have a
football program. We have a real football program.  
So we think we're going to give the BIG EAST exactly what they deserve, and
really they've given us financially the opportunity to run a stable program. I
mean, without the specifics, you guys have changed our athletic budget by 800
percent next year. That's extraordinary. So we're so grateful, and we're going
to pay you back by bringing in the fans, by promoting the BIG EAST, and I have
a feeling that this Villanova‑Temple talk is only going to get good for the
city, good for competition. He has an incredibly wonderful athletic program, a
beautiful school, and I'm really looking forward to someday seeing a real
football rivalry, as we've had, between Temple and Villanova so that the
entire city of Philadelphia can turn out and really support the BIG EAST
program.  
So I hope that that happens in the future, and trust me, Temple will be very
supportive, very supportive if Villanova ever seeks to come into the BIG EAST,
you can be sure our vote will be let them in because it's good for our
community, and we deserve to play each other.  
  
Q. Coach Addazio, starting BIG EAST competition this fall that means you'll
be competing against your son at Syracuse. Talk about that.  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Well, yeah, that's exciting. We already started that teasing
back and forth. He said, Dad, I can't talk to you that week. His uncle is here
right now. Maybe you can talk to his uncle. His mother might not talk to me.
But we're excited about it. He's excited about it. When you talked earlier
about geographic tie‑ins, this is all the cool stuff. Obviously it's a
father‑son, but there's families, there's husbands and wives, who goes to one
school, who goes to another. It's what makes college football great. It's
going to be exciting times ahead on a lot of fronts for a lot of people, so I
can't wait to see it all unfold.  
  
Q. I don't know if this is a better question for John or Bill, but why bring
in basketball in 2013 and not 2012?  
JOHN MARINATTO: As I mentioned, when hoops asked a question relative to the
market, we're using the current year as a transition year in order to analyze
what we can by hiring a consultant to explore how we can best exploit the
marketplace moving forward, and as I said earlier, to retain each school's
individual identity, a brand that Villanova has worked on for over three
decades with the BIG EAST and how to incorporate and associate that with
Temple.  
So for the next 12 months, what we're going to do is with the two
institutions, the Conference's initiative, explore how we best move forward in
order to ensure that we accomplish that because it's in the best interest of
the conference obviously for the two schools to coexist in a very, very
positive way, and one of the things we want to do is ensure that's the case by
doing this.  
  
Q. John, in the 2013 ‑'14 basketball season, will there be 18 teams or 20,
and what's going to happen at Pitt and Syracuse that year?   
JOHN MARINATTO: You know, our membership, given the speed and success of our
expansion initiatives, I think it's open to having the discussions with both
Pittsburgh and Syracuse about them having an early departure. So we haven't
actually had those conversations yet, but our membership is certainly willing
to do that at this point given where we've landed.  
  
Q. My other question is about basketball specifically. Villanova has made
use of the Wells Fargo Center for big games in basketball. Obviously Temple
has a bigger on ‑campus arena but the Wells Fargo Center is bigger. Are there
any plans for Temple also to use the Wells Fargo Center for big games?   
LEWIS KATZ: Well, you might not know this, but this year we played a team
called Duke in the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. I guess they were in
the top three or four that game. We like the Wells Fargo Center. Certainly the
results of that game would show that. So we will play, where appropriate, in
the Wells Fargo Center, and I think part of the discussion in the next year
is‑‑  
FATHER PETER DONOHUE: Is just that kind of thing.  
LEWIS KATZ: Figuring out how to do that.  
JOHN MARINATTO: We've talked about that, and as I mentioned earlier, we're
hiring a consultant to help us with all these things. Temple has actually
played, as Lewis said, games at the Wells Fargo Center, but it's also their
intention, moving forward, to play their games on their on‑campus facilities
because they've got a phenomenal, relatively new, campus facility. So based on
past practices‑‑ and the Conference obviously also has a say as to which games
are play in a large arena. In fact, our conference policy allows us to move
games or not move games as we see fit. So the Conference will play a large
role in that. Moving forward, I will say it's our intention to continue to use
the past practices as a guideline.  
  
Q. Commissioner, about the BIG EAST brand, how much in the next couple
years, five years, how much of the BIG EAST brand will be affected by all of
the things that you've brought in?  
JOHN MARINATTO: That's a good question because we had obviously a presidential
meeting this morning in order to take the vote. We were here talking about it
today, but at the same time, we've gone through a lot over the past five
months, and we ended up in a very positive place. We feel very comfortable
with where we are both in football and basketball, and the most important
thing moving forward is obviously our upcoming television negotiations, which
are due to open up on September 1 of 2012.  
Overall, the conference right now, as I mentioned earlier, is in 31, almost 32
million television households, which is twice as much as any of the other
conferences in the country, twice as much as any of the other five major
conferences in the country. We've got 14 schools in the top 50 medium‑‑ 18 in
the top 50 media markets in the country. So we've got a lot of assets moving
forward.  
As I mentioned earlier, too, we also opened up two new recruiting areas that
are in the top 10 in terms of football fertile states, Texas and Southern
California. So rebranding the conference and taking a stand in regard to a
little bit of pounding our chest as to where it is we've landed is going to
take place, and we're going to get professional assistance with that, too, by
hiring a firm that will assist us in doing all that in the months coming
ahead‑‑ in the upcoming months.  
  
Q. You're about to open TV negotiations in September. Down the line, having
secured this Philadelphia market the way you have, how important is it that
the huge market for Comcast, and what does that mean to the future of the
league?  
JOHN MARINATTO: We've always claimed that market because of Villanova's
presence in the conference over the last 30 years, but you're right, we added
football and we solidify a presence in that area, and that's obviously a very
important thing. The geography, the rivalries. One of the things that Paul
Tagliabue told us who worked with us as a consultant for a year and a half
told us is you drive value through rivalries, that's really what people want
to say. Father mentioned Duke‑Carolina, which is obviously a major rivalry.
Lewis talked about the fact that obviously Villanova and Temple have a long
standing rivalry. We expect that to continue to grow. So we've got, as I
mentioned earlier, the assets all there. We've just now got to figure out a
way to properly position ourselves moving forward to exploit them to our
advantage.  
  
Q. Navy doesn't come on board until 2015, so does that kind of ‑‑ is there a
window then to add another football school to balance the division?   
JOHN MARINATTO: Yeah, it's our intention to obviously have equal divisions of
seven moving forward, and over the course of the time between now and our
television negotiations, as we better position ourselves to attract a quality
14th partner in football, we'll be looking to move forward in that direction.
We want to get to even divisions, and I think we're looking specifically for a
western partner to help us with that.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Thank you, everyone, for your interest and your attendance.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2012

  

### [Maalik Wayns](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20824)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Mouphtaou Yarou](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20760)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VILLANOVA  70  
RUTGERS  49

  
COACH WRIGHT: Great defensive second half for us. Monday afternoon, we had
everybody at practice for the first time, and we're just having fun. We had a
lot of fun being together, being healthy, and just happy for our guys that
they've really stuck to it this year. A lot of teams have struggles. Everybody
goes through it. We do, too. But I'm just happy we got everybody healthy and
able to play tonight, and they played well.  
  
Q. What did you guys do differently in the second half?  
COACH WRIGHT: Just extended out on them a little bit more. Their guards in the
first half, Carter, I think, had three threes in the first half, and Mack had
one, and Dane Miller had one, Seagears had two, I think, in the first half.
They were 7 for 11, so we just extended on them, and our forwards had to do a
good job if we got beat on the perimeter, and Mouph and Mo Sutton did a great
job in the paint.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WRIGHT: Wow, that's a great defensive effort, it really is. You know, I
don't want to BS, we just haven't been able to have Cheek and Maalik and James
Bell on the floor at the same time with our point guard, what's his name?
Maalik Wayns. We just haven't had those guys on the floor, and then to have
the two big guys in there, Mouph and Sutton, has been good. We've been trying
to get to that. They did a great job defensively.  
  
Q. What did you think of the way Maalik played?  
COACH WRIGHT: Just awesome. Great composure all night long. A couple plays
where he gets a little excited, but he really did a great job. And I really
think Ty Johnson did a great job. He gives great defensive intensity on their
guards. They're small guards for us, as you know, we play bigger, that's tough
for us, so we had to go small with Ty. He did a really good job.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MAALIK WAYNS: We practice it every day. We come in early in the morning. I
come in extra myself to shoot free throws. I've got confidence, so every time
I step to the line, I think I'm going to make it.  
  
Q. Maalik, you talked the other day about a clean start coming up here, new
season. Did it kind of feel like that?  
MAALIK WAYNS: Yeah, I mean, I think that's definitely how we're looking at it.
Anything that happened, and we're good enough, we've got everybody back now,
everybody has been practicing together. We had some great practices. Our young
guys are getting more comfortable, guys getting more healthy. If we keep
playing the way we're playing and defending, everything takes care of itself.  
  
Q. Can you talk about having Ty Johnson out there on the floor with you,
especially a little bit more in the second half? Does that help open things up
for you?  
MAALIK WAYNS: Yeah, it allows me to get off the ball a little bit. It allows
me to not be blitzed and double teamed on ball screens. A lot of our offense
is ball screens. When I get a chance to get off the ball, I can make plays for
other guys to going one‑on‑one. I can get my shot. I can do different things,
instead of just being up on the ball all the time. I think it helps me a lot
when he is in the game. Even defensively, you can pick up a point guard full
court, so he does a lot of great things for us.  
  
Q. When you look at the freshmen guards does it remind you of how you were
as a freshman and can they become as good as you are?  
MAALIK WAYNS: Yeah, definitely. I think all three of those guys are great
players. I'm surprised none of them were on the All‑Big East rookie team. I've
got a lot of respect for those guys being young guys. I think they're going to
be great in this league.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MAALIK WAYNS: Yeah, after I came back from my injury, a lot of guys got going,
JayVaughn, Mouph, Cheek. A lot of those guys had it going. They were playing
great for those two games and I just wanted to come back and just fit in and
gets those guys shots, find my shot within the offense. That's what I've been
trying to do, fit in and try and take my shot if it's there and if not make
the right passes.  
  
Q. Mouph, you had a great defensive effort the second half. Can you talk
about that?  
MOUPHTAOU YAROU: As a team, we try and focus on the defense. We know we can
score. We try and focus on the defensive end. We know we can stop people. We
try to rebound the ball better and focus. On the open court, they can try
really good and with JayVaughn and Mo and Marcus trying to stop people,
rebound the ball, not let anybody pass the ball inside. We know we can score
if we try and stop people.  
  
Q. Before half time, did you feel like the foul was a turning point in the
game?  
COACH WRIGHT: We had three straight run‑outs there off of our defense, and I
thought that was the key. Like that was the third one, so even if we didn't
get the attention, I thought three straight run‑outs off defense to take the
lead I think got our energy going defensively.  
  
Q. How big is this for your freshmen, for Ty and Marcus and JayVaughn?  
COACH WRIGHT: JayVaughn really‑‑ JayVaughn is hurt, and his ankle is just not
right. And he doesn't say anything. It's still swollen. I saw it, and I said,
I don't know how he's playing. The trainer says he says he can play. He's
hurt. He's terrible.  
  
Q. But just the experience ‑‑  
COACH WRIGHT: Oh, it's great. It's great for him to go through a game like
this and us win. It's great for Ty Johnson, great for Markus Kennedy. And
James Bell is like a freshman for us. He's coming back from injury. He did a
great job tonight. Every time we can play together it's going to be important
for us.  
  
Q. Was something wrong with Dom tonight?  
COACH WRIGHT: Uh‑uh, no, I joked with him after the game. I said, I could use
a couple more threes out of you but he played great defense and he rebounded.
You know, I think last game he really got hot on them, and I think they really
stuck with him, and it helped off of him and allowed us to go inside and
drive, and he just played offensive rebounding.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of great guards in your coaching career and Maalik has
got it. When you look at those Rutgers guards, what's their up side and can
they get it going there in a couple years?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, those three guards, you look at some of the damage they've
done, they beat Florida, beat a lot of good teams in our league. They're just
freshmen. And there's three of them together. Usually, like Maalik got to play
with Corey Fisher, and he got to play with older guards. Those guys are out
there by themselves doing a hell of a job, and they're going to be together
there for four years. They're going to be really good.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, when we play bigger they can speed us up, and you saw
sometimes where they sped us up we turned the ball over. Last time they
pressed us a lot. It was very important when we got the lead not to worry
about getting fast break opportunity, just be strong with the ball and make
sure we got to the foul line. I thought Ty Johnson really helped us with that
hand on the ball.  
  
Q. Maalik, talk about how much you enjoy trying to keep the season going.  
MAALIK WAYNS: Well, this is probably the easiest Big East Tournament I've
played in since I have been here. My freshman year we had a little action.
Last year we were searching for a win, playing not to lose and tonight no
pressure going in here rebounding, listen to whatever coach tells us to do. We
just try and take it one day at a time?  
  
Q. Rutgers, a pretty good shooting basketball team, 3 for 25 in the second
half. Was that your best team defense execution in the half this season?  
COACH WRIGHT: It was. It really was. As I said, I think that we‑‑ together we
get Maalik Wayns and Ty Johnson and James Bell and Cheek out on the floor with
those two bigs at the same time, we just haven't been able to do it. We knew
we needed to get to that to defend teams that have good perimeter shooters.
That's what's hurt us all year our three‑point defensive field goal
percentages not being good. We've had to play big. So it was good for us to
get those guys on the floor together. It shows us some things we can do next
year, but it also shows it can give us a chance in this tournament right here.  
  
Q. You guys have played USF twice already this year. Both were losses. What
can you take from those games into tomorrow?  
MAALIK WAYNS: Well, they're a good team. They control the glass. They control
the tempo. They slow the game down. We've got to try to speed them up, turn
them over and just do what we do. We can't do anything different. We've just
got to come in and do the same thing we did the last two games, just try to do
it better.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2012

  

### [Herb Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20581)

### [Jordan Theodore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20580)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SETON HALL  79  
PROVIDENCE  47

  
Q. Talk about the first five minutes or so when you were getting outscored 9
‑0\.   
COACH WILLARD: I thought we got some good shots. We didn't go down, and then
we just‑‑ these two guys have been, since the plane ride back from DePaul,
they just said everybody relax. We just relaxed and made a couple shots and
got back to what we do best, and that's defending.  
  
Q. Talk about for Jordan where you see that leadership coming up and keeping
this team alive.  
COACH WILLARD: You know, nothing has changed all year long. We've been a very
good basketball team all year long for two reasons: Jordan Theodore and Herb
Pope. They've led us both on and off the court, and I've said it a million
times: We can only go as far as these two guys go. When they play that
dominating, I don't think there's too many people that can beat us.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the players of your two freshmen that came off the
bench, Mobley and Cosby? Seemed like they gave you a huge lift.  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, you know, Brandon has been steadily getting better the
stronger he gets. He's been really progressing nicely. I mean, for missing the
whole first half of the season, he's really been doing a lot of good things,
using his length well. And then Aaron Cosby, he had 103‑degree temperature at
DePaul and he tried to fight it out, and I thought he gave us a big lift
hitting those two shots.  
  
Q. Freddie Wilson seems to be giving you a lot.  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, any time I can get Jordan a couple breaks, whoever it is
that's giving them is doing a great job. Again, Theo played 33 minutes, so he
usually plays 37. Any time I can get him some breaks‑‑ whoever is going in
there and can keep us in the rhythm does a good job.  
  
Q. Herb, what was the mindset for you guys, when they were up 9 ‑0 what were
you thinking?  
HERB POPE: Trying to get consecutive stops. That's what we were talking about.
We weren't worried about our offense. It was going to come and we have great
shooters and a great player in Jordan Theodore.  
JORDAN THEODORE: The same. It was 9‑0, all I kept thinking in my head is that
it's going to be all right. We're going to be fine. We're going to knock down
some shots when we get them, and we've just got to get stops.  
  
Q. Jordan, seemed like you guys were able to execute in transition. Were you
able to get in the right spots?  
JORDAN THEODORE: I just think everybody was on the same page tonight. We were
able to get rebounds. Normally if we don't rebound we can't run and get it out
on the break and I was able just to find guys.  
  
Q. Herb, you were telling your teammates don't put your hands on your
shorts, something like that?  
HERB POPE: Yeah, it's just something that I observed because the guys on the
wings, they can stop the dribble penetration, I won't have to get in foul
trouble or anything like that and we just tried to contain the ball, just
harass the guys on the perimeter all night because you know they have Cosby a
great shooter and likes to drive and we were just trying to get our hands on
any type of ball and get any kind of reflections.  
  
Q. You were off your shorts?  
HERB POPE: I used to do it, grab your shorts and try and act like you're
getting lower but just keep your hands up and get a good chance to get a
deflection.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about going up against Coach Pitino tomorrow, obviously
kind of a mentor, does that have added significance for you? And do you feel
you've done enough now with 20 wins to get into the tournament?  
COACH WILLARD: You know, going up against Coach Pitino is always a little
difficult. I spent ten years of my life with him, so it's tough to explain to
people ten long, glorious years (laughter), but tomorrow's game is huge for
us. And as far as the NCAA Tournament, I've been saying it to these guys all
year long: Our total body of work is pretty darned good, and I think I have
two of the better seniors in the country I think that led that. The last two
games before this game, we played a tough rival game, Senior Night, need a
win, and then the other night at DePaul they played real well and we just
struggled. The overall body of work I think is pretty good.  
  
Q. Herb, when Brandon is out there with you, how does he help you?  
HERB POPE: He's a great rebounder. He has very long arms, and he has a knack
just to go get the ball. He's a lot stronger than what people think. He goes
in there, he bangs, he throws his body around and he's a big presence for us
in there.  
  
Q. Jordan, you haven't even talked about the NCAA tournament as a goal since
the season started. Did you feel that was a message coming in here about what
was at stake for your team and not losing a first round game and kind of
keeping this thing going?  
JORDAN THEODORE: Well, to be honest, I have talked about the NCAA all season,
but coming into this game, it wasn't on my mind, and I know a lot of people
have been talking about us, but it wasn't on my mind at all. The only thing I
was worried about was leading my team and coming in here and getting a win.  
  
Q. If the selection committee were watching tonight, what kind of impression
do you think you left?  
JORDAN THEODORE: I hope a good one. I hope they seen that the Pirates is not
the team that was at DePaul and that we're a good basketball team and that we
deserve to get in.  
  
Q. Kevin, when you were going through some of the struggles last season, how
much of a sounding board was coach Pitino for you?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, you know, I'm a little different in this league from the
fact that I worked with Mick Cronin and I'm very good friends with Mick. We
vacation together every summer, and obviously Coach Pitino is a father figure,
so I actually leaned on both those guys very heavily. I probably talked to
Coach Pitino once a week and I probably talked to Mick twice a week. The great
things about Coach Pitino is it doesn't matter what time you call, he'll pick
up your phone. He has been tremendous‑‑ he was great this year when we were
struggling and lost a couple games in a row, and Herbie was battling some ribs
and Theo was getting a little worn down. He just kind of said‑‑ he called me
twice during that stretch, which is unheard of in this league. I'm very lucky
to have him not only as a mentor but as a father figure.  
  
Q. Jordan, last time you guys played Louisville you defended well, held them
to 60 points. What do you have to do differently against them to get the
offense going?  
JORDAN THEODORE: I think we've got to get everybody involved. The last go
around we played them, I took too many shots and I didn't get guys involved
enough. I think that's going to be the key for us tomorrow, and just playing
great defense like we did tonight, just being able to stop Peyton Siva because
he is going to try to get in the lane. He has been doing that all season, and
Russ Smith. We've just got to play team defense and see what happens.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2012

  

### [Cleveland Melvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23283)

### [Moses Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23282)

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CONNECTICUT  81  
DePAUL  67

  
COACH PURNELL: I thought Jeremy Lamb was awfully good in the game from start
to finish. He really kept us at bay in the first half. They got enough balance
with some of their inside guys scoring, mainly Drummond did a nice job in
there of giving them some balance, but it was really too much Lamb.  
We rebounded the ball decently in the first half and we couldn't keep them off
the offensive boards in the second half. They got just enough in transition.
They got a lead. I really admired our guys' fighting spirit to get back into
the game the second half, but you've got to give Connecticut credit and
particularly Lamb who played extremely well. And Boatright really played well,
too, and they got their big guys involved. Again, I admire our guys' fighting
spirit, and I'm really disappointed it's over, but we lost to a better team
today.  
  
Q. As you look back on the season, what did you see from your team?  
COACH PURNELL: Well, I thought we got better as the year went along. We had a
resilient team. I thought we had an awful lot of things occur starting back in
the summer from injuries to losing guys to Moses' episode with a concussion
and some other things‑‑ he missed four or five games in the heart of the
season, and we lost some close games that we were right there with a chance to
win.  
You know, I think an average team or some average character guys could have
and would have maybe folded it up. These guys continued to come back and work
and play hard, and I thought obviously our closing game of the regular season
was our best, which was nice to see, and nice to have the seniors go out that
way. And we can build on that. We've got most of those core guys back, and
we've got at least three new guys coming in next year, athletic guys that we
like, so we can continue to build on that.  
But I think J.K. and Krys helped us build a foundation. I think any good
program, any good anything has to have a solid foundation, and we're indebted
to those guys for being a part of that. I think we're seeing a cultural shift
in terms of guys really working and staying together, and I think any time you
have a work ethic and you stay together with good chemistry and you add talent
and ability, then you can't help but move forward, so that's what I see moving
forward.  
  
Q. When you get your guys in, a couple years to indoctrinate them into your
system, would you expect that third year would be a leap year in a way?  
COACH PURNELL: I expect we'll be a lot better. That's always been my approach
is every year you get better. I think with leadership from these guys, I think
them getting better themselves, and with talent and athleticism, we expect to
be better.  
  
Q. Coach Calhoun was very complimentary on you and your staff as far as
DePaul not being an easy stop for conference opponents. How has the community
around DePaul University embraced the new team going forward?  
COACH PURNELL: Yeah, we're treated great, and our fans are great all year
long. We average 8,000 or 9,000 fans all year long and they were solid and
they were there all year long, and our students were great and very
supportive. I think I understand where we are, but more importantly I
understand how hard these guys are working. That's one thing that keeps our
momentum going within our community, on our campus. It's easy to see that
these guys are working extremely hard and they're competitive and they're
right there, so we've had nothing but solid support, and for that, we
appreciate that.  
  
Q. Moses, what will you take into next year?  
CLEVELAND MELVIN: Just got to work on maintaining our focus and just keep
grinding and working hard on the court, staying positive when we're playing in
a game, just coming out playing with that energy and playing for the whole 40
minutes.  
MOSES MORGAN: I feel me personally, I have to work on leadership and bringing
the new guys in and just getting them to where we're at and then just building
from there as a team.  
  
Q. Moses, do you feel you guys are close and why do you feel you guys are
close?  
MOSES MORGAN: Yes, I feel that we're close, just the fact that we work hard
every day, and even though we lose, we don't hang our heads. We just go out
and play hard, and today we wanted to just leave it all out there knowing that
this could be our last game. But just the fact that we work hard every day no
matter what, no matter who we're playing or what the circumstances, we just go
out and play hard.  
  
Q. How do you feel you guys have progressed from last year to this year?  
MOSES MORGAN: I feel that we've progressed a lot, and our coach kind of
touched on it a little bit, just our chemistry as a team. This is probably one
of the best groups that I've been with, even when I was in high school. I love
all the guys, and we just know each other very well.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH PURNELL: Oh, I think it'll help. I think it's a process of building your
team or building your program is getting two or three good recruiting classes
and growing them up with positive experiences. We would have liked to have a
few more of those this year like senior night and conference wins, but there
are a lot of positive experiences along the way, and then we've got another
group coming in, and we need to have a lot more positive experiences next
year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2012

  

### [Mike Dunlap](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23285)

### [Moe Harkless](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23286)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

PITTSBURGH  73  
ST. JOHNS  59

  
COACH DUNLAP: The difference between the first time we played Pitt and the
second was that we were able to rebound with them a little bit better, but we
weren't able to finish at the rim. We had a lot of easy baskets that didn't go
in. And I think when we came out in the second half, that impacted our ability
to play probably a little bit more intense. We let that bleed into our
defense.  
But the story was we had plenty of good looks, we just couldn't finish.  
  
Q. Looks like you did a pretty good job the first half, you had a lead. Is
there wear and tear having two players play a lot of games in a very short
amount of time?  
COACH DUNLAP: Well, from our vantage point we never forwarded that, so when we
go in at halftime, we tried to lock in on two or three adjustments. I'm sure
that your question, it's factored in, but that'll be down the road. Because
the journey, this journey, is over with, we're not going to give ourselves the
luxury of evaluating in that form. There were some tactical things in terms of
I just thought we moved the ball great. We had some great player movement. The
game had a tone to it of a playoff game. But I think that what really played
in, we had some guys that were 1 for 8 or whatnot, and I think that that kind
of took a little bit of the wind out of our sails.  
  
Q. How much of that do you think is attributed to you? You've got a good
team.  
COACH DUNLAP: The seeds are there, and the wisdom that was gained this year
and where we're headed. Certainly we have steel girders in terms of the
players that we have now. Now to add to them and to advance forward, and there
was never, the entire journey, where we got down. This team was resilient. We
came back and played a quality team in Pitt, one. But two is the way we
played, the esprit de corps was high, high level, and that's kind of the way
it's been all year long with our guys. They were a joy to coach the entire
year. We didn't have one player miss one practice and we didn't have one
player of the six that went down with injury. So it's attributable to a lot of
our support staff, whether it's weights or trainer, but also to these guys how
mentally tough they grew over the course of the journey.  
  
Q. Mo, it was a pretty physical game today. Sometimes you guys were on the
floor with no call. Does that get frustrating after a while?  
MOE HARKLESS: Yeah, definitely, because I think we didn't get a lot of calls
that were like clearly fouls. But you've just got to keep playing through it
and you can't really worry about it too much and not worry about what the refs
call and just play the game?  
  
Q. D'Angelo had it going in the first half and he got cold as the game went
on. What changed in the second half?  
COACH DUNLAP: Well, I think some of that is our sensitivity, as we grow, that
to play the hot hand out, and I think Mo was 5 for 7 from the floor going in
at halftime, so we tried to point out those two things. We have a couple of
actions for them and we isolated them quite a bit in the second half. But I
think some of that is attributed to how well coached Pitt is.  
You know, you definitely‑‑ they know who D'Angelo is. I think it's a
combination of the two.  
  
Q. That late first half run you guys got up 6 and then they ran off 13 ‑2\.
How deflating is that going into the locker room?   
COACH DUNLAP: As they say in the Westerns, we had them right where we wanted
them. We knew what was hurting us. We had a two‑minute patch, and again, you
have to give Pitt credit. Towards the end of the first half, and I think some
of that had to do with just the intensity of the way we played in the first 18
minutes, and also as they wear you down physically, because they're much
heavier in the pockets at their fours and fives, where they're pushing you and
driving you and playing physical, as we tried to. But I think we got a little
bit weary with the short patch in there. So during halftime, we didn't even
address that phase. We just told them here is what's good about what you're
doing and we tried to replicate that in the second half.  
  
Q. At one point in the half you guys hit a lull in rebounding. Was that
attributed to foul trouble?  
COACH DUNLAP: Combination of foul trouble and also Pitt's ability to wedge on
the weak side and use their thickness and height to drive some of our smaller
players under the basket because they're going to do that all game long and
you've got to be sturdy and withstand that kind of thing. So that's full
credit to Pitt.  
  
Q. When they went on the 13 ‑2 run and the game got quick and you guys
didn't get the kind of offensive stuff you wanted, did you feel that you were
hurrying, that the game was getting faster and you guys were maybe shooting
the ball a little bit?   
MOE HARKLESS: I think we like to play a fast‑paced game but I think when the
pace switched, we were rushing a little bit. A lot of shots that we took
during that time were bad shots and I think if we would have slowed down and
took our time, I think we would have been able to overcome that hump.  
  
Q. For Mo, obviously all year with basically six guys, can you describe how
tough that's been to go 32 games that way?  
MOE HARKLESS: You know, it's pretty tough, but I think our guys on our team,
everybody is like‑‑ everybody is tough on our team. Nobody gave up on each
other. Everybody just kept at it every day, even on our days off we'd be in
the gym playing pickup and everything. I think this group has a bright future.
A lot of guys on this team are young and we're talented, and I think how this
team, they never give up. A lot of people didn't expect us to even play this
way, the way we did this season. A lot of people expected us to do a lot
worse, and I think we did a good job keep fighting. I think as coach said we
showed a lot of resiliency, and I think we have a bright future?  
  
Q. Ashton Gibbs has struggled, but what do you make of the way he played
today and what have you seen from him in those two games?  
COACH DUNLAP: Well, the one thing about him is he's always going to come back
to his better self, you just don't know when. He ran into a really tough patch
when Woodall went down, so it forced him to change his game a little bit, and
when Woodall came back, he got back to his natural position. Unfortunately, we
were probably the recipient of them feeling that whole situation out and he
came back to his better self. We know he's one of the better shooters if not
the best shooter in the Big East, but if you look at his field goal percentage
from the three, it was down because he was taking more contested shots because
Woodall wasn't there to drive gaps and kick and all that kind of stuff.  
Again, it's just a very fine player wearing us out a little bit and doing a
good job, and he's got a little mojo going. He's just playing off momentum
right now, and he's found his better self.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

PITTSBURGH  73  
ST. JOHNS  59

  
COACH DIXON: We defended well and did enough rebounding wise, and I thought we
were patient offensively, took pretty good shots, shot a good percentage
against a good defensive team. Obviously St. John's with a match‑up zone
bothers a lot of teams. We played pretty well in both games against them and
took good shots for the most part and today we cut down on the turnovers and
gave us another good opportunity.  
Another good win. I think we had a lot of guys give us good performances. We
had ten guys out there giving us good minutes and that's something we're going
to need. So I'm proud of how our guys played, I'm proud of how our seniors
played, and we're trying to get better every day. I think we've gotten better
the last couple weeks and it's a good sign as we go forward here. We've got to
defend defensively, and I think we did that today and we'll continue to do
that here as we go forward tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is it kind of weird you guys have never won a Big East Tournament, now
it's your senior year. How much do you want this?  
ASHTON GIBBS: Yeah, it's definitely a little weird, especially the past three
years we had a lot more success during the regular season. But it was a good
win for us today. I think it started on the defensive end, and we let it carry
on to offense. We did a good job of moving the ball, and it's something we've
just got to continue to do throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ASHTON GIBBS: Yeah, I think it's definitely possible. We're just going to take
one game at a time and worry about our next game and keep going.  
  
Q. Nasir, this is the second straight game that you've had to defend Moe
Harkless. What is it like covering a guy that size?  
NASIR ROBINSON: He's a good player, real skilled. I wanted to make him shoot
tough shots. He hit some real tough ones, and I just wanted to make him make
tough shots.  
  
Q. You guys had a pretty tough Big East season. Do you feel like you're
peaking at the right time during the tournament?  
COACH DIXON: Well, I think we're a little bit‑‑ about as healthy as we've
been. We've had a number of guys miss practices last week, but we have
everybody available. We didn't have John last game, John Johnson, but he gave
us good minutes today, so that was valuable. But I do believe that we are, and
I tell our guys that I believe our best basketball is in our next game here,
so I told them that going into this tournament. We did some good things today.
I think we can be a better team tomorrow, and I believe that that's what you
want to be. We've obviously had some injuries and had to battle through some
things, but we're still around and we're getting better in some areas that
we've focused on.  
I think we are playing our best basketball here going forward. And we've got
some guys healthy right now, so I feel pretty good about where we're going.
We've got a good team to play tomorrow, so we'll see what we can do.  
  
Q. There was a play late in the first half where the ball seemed to go after
the back of the backboard. Did you sense them getting frustrated?  
ASHTON GIBBS: Yeah, I heard them arguing, a couple players arguing going back
and forth on the court. We just wanted to keep our team together. When it hit
the backboard, we wanted to keep playing until we heard the whistles, and we
just wanted to keep playing and stay together.  
NASIR ROBINSON: Yeah, same thing. That's one thing we've been stressing in
practice really is just to keep playing, whether the ref blew the whistle or
not. That's what we did. It got a little frustrating, that part of the game,
but at the end of the day we played together as a team from beginning to end
and got the win.  
  
Q. How about having to play back to back games like that?  
NASIR ROBINSON: Yeah, I feel good. Throughout the season I've been struggling
with it, just been fighting through it, trying to do what I can for my team.
Towards the end of the year I've been feeling good. I've been doing what I do
with my trainer, and it's feeling good.  
  
Q. How about the way you guys played against the press in the second half?  
COACH DIXON: They're going to force some things. I think we can do a better
job of getting‑‑ advancing it and maybe attacking on the backside of it. It's
something that we've looked at and tried to do. But hopefully it'll get us
better and help us down the road, but 13 turnovers is still a little bit too
high, but against a pressing team, and looking at what they were doing, I
think it's not a horrible number. Better than we had in our last game against
them. We took good shots. That was the most important thing.  
I think at the end of it, we took a good shot at the end of the press, and we
didn't get rushed into shots, and I think that's the most important thing,
too.  
  
Q. Given what Ashton has meant to this program, is this the time to let him
do his thing?  
COACH DIXON: Well, we're just playing like we're trying to play. We've
encouraged him to take open jump shots and more threes than he's been taking,
and that was a good thing about today, I think he took nine of his fourteen
shots were threes and off the catch, and four for nine is a good percentage
from three. That's what we want to do. They did a good job on the defensive
end, too, and that's what we need and that's what we've been stressing from
our guards is they need to get our defense going. They need to be the big‑‑
they need to be the energy, the charge, the direct and get us where we need to
be defensively. So I thought he did a good job in that area.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2012

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SETON HALL  79  
PROVIDENCE  47

  
COACH COOLEY: First, congratulations to Seton Hall. I thought they played a
great game. You know, I thought we picked the worst time to have the worst
game of our season. Everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong. They
were better than us at every single position, one through five, no matter what
we did. They played with a sense of purpose.  
I think they're a team that deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament to begin
with, and we played a tournament team today. We picked our worst time to have
our worst game. I don't think we were physical. We weren't attentive to
detail. You know, hopefully this is a learning experience for our program as
we build our program to continue to move forward.  
It's unfortunate, today I thought we looked tired, and I don't know why. I
thought we had a couple of great days of practice. I don't know if it's the
year, playing a really small lineup and small group for multiple minutes. It
seemed like it all caught up to us at the worst possible time at a great place
to play. I'm proud of our guys. We had some good games and we definitely had
some bad games, and today was the worst. But I don't want our players to have
their head down. I think we achieved a lot given the circumstances, and we'll
look forward to continuing to build our program.  
  
Q. What did the defense do to really upset your offense?  
COACH COOLEY: I thought it was more what we were doing offensively because we
had open shots. This is back to back games where I thought we had really good
looks, we just couldn't put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. So you don't think the zone bothered you?  
COACH COOLEY: We have seen zone all year, run the same things. Again, I
thought we had open looks. When you look at our guys that normally shoot the
ball, LaDontae is a 40 percent three‑point shooter, Cotton is a 40 percent
three‑point shooter, our interior guys. Again, we missed a lot of shots.
Credit them. What did we shoot, 2 percent? I don't even know what it is. We
just missed a lot of shots. They had a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. How quickly will it take you guys to get past this ‑‑  
COACH COOLEY: I'm never going to get past it, my man. I didn't come here to
lose. I'm never getting past it. We'll move on. We won't forget about it, but
I've got to do a better job building our program.  
  
Q. All season long there's been trouble with ball screens.  
COACH COOLEY: Again, we've tried to mask a lot of shortcomings with our crew.
I'm really concerned with ball screens. I think all coaches are concerned with
ball screen defense, especially in this league when you have the best guards
in the country night in and night out, they really exposed that with some of
our guys. Hopefully we can get better at it. But they did a really good job
with their offense. They played well.  
  
Q. On a brighter note, you're only graduating Bilal Dixon, talk about that
aspect moving forward.  
COACH COOLEY: The fact that the guys played in the game like this, hopefully
they can learn something from it. I'm excited about our future, but our
present, we've got to make some adjustments. We need to continue to add depth
to our front court and to our backcourt. I like the guys that we have
committed to us, but recruiting is an everyday process for me. I go to sleep,
I think of recruiting, I wake up, I think of recruiting. First thing I do when
I get to my desk, we recruit. We have recruiting meetings night in and night
out. Recruiting is the way to build a program.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VILLANOVA  70  
RUTGERS  49

  
COACH RICE: Obviously, it's very hard to win a basketball game only scoring
three field goals in the second half. We made some mental errors that led to
their transition, led to their wide‑open looks in the paint, and it just
snowballed from there. A young team might not have responded as well as I
would have liked, but these things happen. Learn from it. Hopefully use that
as motivation in the spring and the summer to improve, to get stronger, to
maybe be able to finish some of the shots down in the paint. But that's life
when you have a very young basketball team.  
  
Q. Can you just comment on Maalik Wayns and how he was so difficult for you
guys to handle?  
COACH RICE: Very difficult, especially in the second half. I thought he was
somewhat corralled in the first half. He's going to make very good plays. He's
very dynamic with the basketball. I was okay at halftime, and then the second
half, our rushed shots, our response to missing lay‑ups, instead of springing
back in transition and getting to the gap and helping, do all the things that
we talk about, they just didn't do, and guarding him one‑on‑one is not a
favorable match‑up.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH RICE: Well, when you make only three baskets, that's how it does. I
don't know how many lay‑ups it was, but it was a ton of missed lay‑ups and
opportunities. The execution wasn't there. We didn't execute like we did in
the first half for some odd reason.  
Again, maybe it was a case of not responding after you miss a lay‑up or miss a
shot or something happened. We just didn't‑‑ and I couldn't reel them back in
during the huddles. They kept snow balling. Maalik Wayns just kept the
pressure on and made all the right moves.  
  
Q. When you look at what Maalik is, is that what you envision Eli and Myles
being in a couple years, and how confident are you?  
COACH RICE: I am very confident. It's going to happen. Rutgers is going to
happen. I keep telling anybody who's going to listen. You get bigger and
stronger. We need to be‑‑ we now know what we don't know going into October.
They all thought they knew it. They had the answer. It's hard to win a
Division I basketball, and it's hard when you have a pro playing a point guard
position on the opposition.  
But these guys will get it. They had incredible learning experiences. They all
developed. But yeah, I mean, the person right in front of me had a half that
was as good a half as a freshman had all year. Very consistent. Didn't respond
exactly, but they'll get there.  
  
Q. Is it kind of good that this off season you don't have seniors now
because you don't have turnover and you can say this is what we did wrong?  
COACH RICE: Sure. Again, when you have everybody back, it's always a good
thing, as long as you like that team, and this team is going to get bigger and
stronger. They're going to understand what makes Division I teams successful,
what makes winning basketball teams, making winning plays, playing for one
another, doing your job, doing all the little details that goes into it. I
love that I get to work with them in the summer. I get to work with my whole
team, spring, summer and fall, including Wally Judge. Yeah, I'm encouraged.
Boy, it's a tough second half.  
  
Q. How frustrating has this year been given the fact that you didn't ‑‑  
COACH RICE: After this half, it's a high on the frustration meter after three
field goals. But again, I didn't know what I didn't know going into it because
I never had experienced something like this with so many young players.  
And so I had to learn on the job to be honest with you. Would I have liked us
to be more consistent? Yes. Would I have liked to learn things at a quicker
pace? Yes, but it's a process. Again, this will be something that's going to
be brought up time and time again when maybe our work ethic is not good, 12
percent and 3 field goals against Villanova, pretty big stage in the Big East
Tournament.  
  
Q. Eli, Coach is talking a lot about these learning experiences. What have
you learned in the last two, three weeks about basketball?  
ELI CARTER: Just how hard you have to work to compete at this level and to be
a good team in the Big East.  
  
Q. For Dane, what have you learned, and how did the season match what you
thought going in with the highs and lows and everything?  
DANE MILLER: As a team, we've just got to stay consistent, and every
possession just play together and play hard and leave everything on the court.  
  
Q. Eli, did you feel like you had an opportunity to stay home and do
something going in, stay home from New Jersey?  
ELI CARTER: I definitely did, but now I know I can take a little bit of time,
work hard in the off season and hopefully make it half.  
  
Q. Dane, you guys now know what you have to do in this off season. Is it
kind of clear and crystallized in this last month, month and a half?  
DANE MILLER: Yeah, definitely. I think a couple things we've got to work on is
attention to details. I mean, locked in and being real focused on both ends of
the court, and I think now as the games go by, we saw that you can't win a lot
of games like that without being focused. We just come in in the off season
and listen to Coach Rice and the coaching staff we should be successful.  
COACH RICE: We're going to lock them in the weight room, too.

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Jeremy Lamb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22087)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CONNECTICUT  81  
DePAUL  67

  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, it's crazy. Saturday was a very emotional time for all of
us. It's been a different kind of season. But through it all, somewhat by
separation, I realized how much I cared about these kids. Just as Caron is
here in the locker room and all these kids and the guys who hold up the
trophies and maybe sometimes you don't hold up the trophy, but they're your
kids. Someone said I only have two years left on my extension. I don't know if
I can make two more minutes. For them to think, I'm grateful about that, I
don't know if I have two more years in my contract, now it's like I'm calling
the shots.  
Someone better pay me for two more years. That's what I'm saying. My point is,
I'm trying to coach this basketball team, and that's my job. But it's also my
love. It's also my love. And that's why I came back to my basketball team,
because I felt I owed them something.  
And during those eight games, I don't think there's many people here, but I
turned the sound down, everyone, what an absolute pleasure. Surprising for a
couple of you guys, I actually would read, and it was actually pretty good.
Some of you actually understood the game. My point being simply when you see a
team and you see them lose five games by whatever we lost by in every sort of
possible way, then I think if you feel you can do anything, maybe just being a
fresh voice coming back, whatever, with these guys, then I owed it to them if
I could get back, and I did, and obviously the last two games have been very
fulfilling, and I thought that‑‑ DePaul is going to be a tough place to stop,
by the way, going down the road. What all of it teaches is confidence, and I
really thought when you're  
down 22, Big East tournament, whatever it may be, and you bring that thing
back to nine, yeah, we held them a little bit, but they kept playing, and I
give them credit. I think DePaul is not going to be an easy stop. Coach
Willard is a great young kid and a terrific coach. They're going to be good in
the way they play, and they're different than most of our Big East teams, and
as they get other kids and more experience, they're going to be good.  
But our kids hung in there. We hadn't been in that position too many times. We
fooled with it a little bit. You can't fool with the Big East. Two things
aside, we played I believe the most difficult schedule in the country, if not
the second most difficult. And secondly, we played the most difficult schedule
in the Big East. And third, only three teams in the country, Villanova,
Vanderbilt and Connecticut, played 21 top 100 teams. So out of that 31 teams,
we had ten breathers. Who are those breathers? UNC Ashville? Oh, by the way,
they're in the tournament, and I can keep on going. So we didn't have time
sometimes to build up our confidence as I look back on the season and think
maybe we would have done different.  
But I'm extremely proud. I thought Ryan did not have a great game against
Chicago the first time. I don't say DePaul, the say Chicago the first time,
and he wanted to show just how good he was, and he did today. To get 16
minutes out of Shabazz Napier and have Boatright step in like that, that's
when we needed our first team all Big East player to show up, and he got us
started, that being Jeremy.  
And I thought down the stretch when we went back and forth and they made their
run, we extorted to lock them, get the rebounds, do some intelligent things,
and I'm very proud of them.  
  
Q. When the lead slipped they let it get away. What did you do today that
you didn't let it get ‑‑  
COACH CALHOUN: Same thing we did Saturday. Saturday we were up 14 and they
came back at us. We just talked about, okay, there's 14 to go, I'll see you
here on the 12th, just make sure we're in better shape than we are now. So we
stopped worrying about what this meant in the standings or what this meant in
the grand scheme of things, but there was three minutes, and I think they'll
probably tell you that. Just play the next three minutes, come back and see me
at 11, come back and see me at 7. It's old school, but we tried to keep the
game shorter and just talk about the things we need to do at those particular
points in both games. Think about it, different scores‑‑ 13, 14, at the same
time, we go off this time, we didn't go off there, but the same situation. It
was nine as opposed to being down two, but we kind of were smart, it was just
about the same thing.  
  
Q. You guys won 12 postseason games. Can you talk about what is it about the
postseason that makes you step up?  
JEREMY LAMB: Well, when we go into the tournaments obviously it's a new
season. You go into the tournament and try to work hard, and then this year,
like you said, playing without Kemba, all year we've been finding ourselves
and everybody on the team has been stepping up and just been‑‑ we've been
preparing all year for this time. Now that it's here, we just want to give it
all we've got and don't look back and just take it a game at a time and just
try to get wins.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
JEREMY LAMB: Well, no, I'm not trying to be Kemba. Of course everybody wants
to lead their team to championships, but I'm just trying to do what's best for
this team. The whole team knows, we've got five great players, Boatright,
Shabazz, Roscoe stepping up. We also got great big men, so it's a great team
effort.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about playing DePaul. You didn't
get to go to Chicago last year. Can you talk about what coach had mentioned?  
COACH CALHOUN: I'm sorry, we played DePaul at home.  
  
Q. Right, but you didn't get to go home, and also I wondered if you had
played against Crockett?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: I really didn't look at it as trying to‑‑ just trying to show
off for DePaul. The first time we played them it was basically like we needed
to get a win, we needed to get our roll going, and I felt like I pressed a
little too much in the first game and just missed a lot of easy shots and a
lot of careless turnovers, and in this game Coach talked to me more, said I
didn't play very well the first time but he said at practice before he got
here, he said you're going to have a great game.  
When I came out today I just tried to do the best for the team so when I came
in and get the start by playing defense, the offense came to me. I've played
Jamee since I was like 13, 12 years old. We were in the same neighborhood, so
we were playing AAU and high school ball since we were kids, so I've played
him a lot of times.  
  
Q. This has not been a great three ‑point shooting team in Big East play but
you were seven of the first seven and you got three of those. Can you talk
about how the threes really dropped in the first half?   
JEREMY LAMB: Well, I think today we moved the ball well. Early I had a couple
open shots. I tried to set my man up, and our big men had great screens so I
was able to knock down a couple. I think anything leaks on to the rest of the
team, whether it's you're playing good defense or bringing energy or hitting
shots, the whole team is going to want to do that, and it brings the whole
team up. So today we really moved the ball, and we had a lot of open shots and
we were able to hit some.  
  
Q. When you saw that you guys were going to be playing DePaul to start the
tournament just like you did last year, did you start to think at all, here we
go again, such familiarity or such a similarity from last year's tournament?  
JEREMY LAMB: I mean, it's a coincidence, but this is a whole new year. No, we
didn't go into it like, oh, here we go again. But we was like, we're playing
DePaul, okay, we need a win, and let's do our thing as a team.  
  
Q. I'm assuming the pain is there after the operation. How are you feeling
now? How are things working out?  
COACH CALHOUN: The pain is a different kind of pain, it's a muscular pain.
Thank God it's no longer a nerve pain and I'm not walking with a cane anymore.
I couldn't walk on with a cane on the sidelines because the officials might
have been hit. There was always the fear of pain of some sort. But they told
me to wait two weeks and I felt if I went out and walked on Tuesday, I got
home at 5:00, I think, I was under anesthesia for three hours and they were
aiming to take bone chips out and stuff. But to alleviate that pain was
incredible. It took us three weeks to find the right solution, which wasn't to
put rods and fibers and fuses and all that stuff. We had a three and a half
hour‑‑ as that can be‑‑ procedure, that was pretty intricate but not
transforming in the sense that it's a hole in my back and it's sore, but
nothing like a win or two wins now to make that‑‑ but without question, I will
definitely try to get more rest than I normally do.  
By the way, speaking on that note, I would be remised if I didn't thank,
generally speaking, almost everybody in the media for the way you've treated
this. You reported what happened, you didn't make value judgments about it. I
know people are going to talk about retirement, any other thing, because we're
talking about the sport. But I have great respect, and generally speaking, for
the way you've treated me and my family and allowed us to get through the
situation, and I mean that. And I really, sincerely thank you for that. That
meant a lot to me, and quite frankly all those periods up there and screaming
on the sidelines, almost to a man or woman, you showed me and my family a
great deal of respect during this, and I really appreciate that.  
  
Q. Jeremy, I know it's only two in a row, but do you feel like you're
starting to get some momentum?  
JEREMY LAMB: Well, I mean, yeah, I guess you could say we get momentum. We had
a great win, and then coming into the Big East tournament, just got another
good win. Coach came back, so there's a lot of things that go into it. But
yeah, I can say we're getting momentum, yeah.  
COACH CALHOUN: I'd say the biggest thing overall, and this is two games,
watching, I thought we played terrific, quite frankly, against Syracuse. A
game we could have won. We had a lot of heart coming back at Villanova.
Everybody in this league is tough, so when you go to Villanova and we're not
there, that kind of team, the schedule‑‑ if the schedule did anything, it
supposedly made us‑‑ hopefully is going to make us tougher down the line. But
if anything, it took away some of our confidence. That was the most noticeable
thing last Friday when I walked in. I can't believe some of the guys didn't
have the confidence, and that schedule will do that to you.  
But getting back to your point, we had six bad minutes against Providence.
Other than that, we had control and played well. I thought Pittsburgh played
terrific in the second half, made shots, etcetera, so I do think, yeah, over
the last five games we have played better basketball and certainly could have
come up with at least one more win, including Syracuse maybe two more wins,
and we've got to play better basketball. You can't afford the six minutes and
we had it, and in all those games we got leads against‑‑ on the road or
against Syracuse and so on. They should feel better about themselves and
hopefully we'll feel better when we play West Virginia tomorrow.  
Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now we have Minnesota head Coach Tubby Smith. He is entering
his sixth season with the Gophers and returns 4 starters and 11 letter winners
from last year's team.  
TUBBY SMITH: Good morning. Thank you, appreciate it. First, it's another year
to see where we are in our program and our team and I like the sound of having
11 returning players. Certainly we believe we've got a good nucleus to be able
to compete with anybody in the Big 10. So we've got to stay healthy and if we
do that I think we will have a good chance.  
  
Q. Tubby with Williams' performance in the NIT has he turned the corner from
great athlete, good player to consistent player and potentially great
player?  
TUBBY SMITH: When you put the tag or label "great" on someone, it's‑‑ but
Rodney has the capability. I think he has turned the corner, he did everything
for us last year, rebounding, blocked shots, steals, he was an all‑purpose
player. When we switched him to the power forward spot after Trevor went down
and we were trying a lot of different combinations, that's when he stepped up
and became more comfortable playing that role for us. Another thing is he's in
great shape and I think you're right, there are things he's worked extremely
hard over the last year and probably the last season was his condition and go
his strength.  
So I see him making that next step to not just being a good player but being a
dominant player for us, and carrying the role of being a leader on the team,
not just a great athlete. I think that's where Rodney has grown, in that area,
as far as leadership is concerned.  
  
Q. With Trevor's legal status being clarified last Friday, can you talk
about ‑‑ explain what his status is with you guys as you go forward into the
season?   
TUBBY SMITH: Well, Trevor Mbakwe had been‑‑ he had a DUI back in the summer
and had been suspended for a few weeks and had to‑‑ he had some requirements,
that affected another area and he's on probation for another two years, but
through it all Trevor is a fine young man, hell, I've never had a problem with
him on the basketball court or in practice or in the classroom, he's
graduated, he's working on his Masters degree.  
I think with stability in his life and now that he's over‑‑ recovering from
his knee surgery‑‑ there are a lot of things that he had to deal with last
year, and I think he has that under control, both mental and physically. I
think he's in the right place. He's a guy that will bring a real inside
presence. Last year we struggled rebounding the ball and Trevor is one of the
best rebounders I've ever seen, the best I've ever coached so he'll‑‑ so we
expect him to step in and contribute. He's looking good in practice, icing his
knee down before and after practice is beneficial to him, he has a brace. He
has gone through our practices full‑tilt.  
At this juncture he will be able to step in and contribute, but we're going to
bring him along slowly to make sure that his knee is completely healthy.  
  
Q. There is anticipation with the league this year, five teams in the top
‑25\. Do you have any thoughts on how many teams would be appropriate for the
NCAA Tournament if all goes well?   
TUBBY SMITH: Well, we had, what, six or seven last year and I would imagine
with the depth and the‑‑ of this league, of the Big 10 with so many talented
players and so many good teams, we're going to be in a position to have more
than we had in the past, I would think. Selected to play in the NCAAs, let's
hope we're one of those teams. We have expectations going forward this year.  
So we're looking forward to putting ourselves in a position, and that takes
winning. So I think the conference is well positioned with all the teams we
have and I think everybody has really improved themselves and certainly with
Indiana being the number 1 seed in the country and certainly we had three
teams that were tied for first last year and all of those teams are back with
pretty good players.  
I think you will see more teams than we have ever had in NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, best of luck this year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The first coach joining us this morning is head coach Bo Ryan.
He welcomes back 12 letter winners and four starters from last year's squad
that advanced to the Sweet 16. Coach?  
BO RYAN: I think the obvious statement is how does he look? I thought he was
parking cars when I came through the lobby, that's why I asked him‑‑ 12th
year, huh? Seems like it was just yesterday. Happy to be here, looking forward
to the season. We could be better teams this year, but I don't know if the
records will show it with everybody in the league.  
I think there is going to be a lot of parity. I haven't said that every year,
but I think this year it's going to be pretty obvious.  
  
Q. Bo, you have had a series of great point guards play under you, now
you're starting over at that position again somewhat. What is the plan at
point guard and how important is that in your offense?  
BO RYAN: Well, it's extremely important. I appreciate the fact that you like
some of our guards because we liked them, too, because of what they brought,
the confidence, the control. They controlled games.  
Thank goodness for the new rule. We had a chance to see Josh Gasser this year
following up on who is next. The two hours that we had a chance to work with
him and then the couple of hours in the fall, I'm glad that we had that,
because Josh will be the point guard.  
He's learned from those before him. I'm very pleased with what he's done and
how the guys have rallied around him. So I think we will be still in pretty
good shape, maybe not the point guards that we have had with Hughes and Taylor
that can beat you off the bounce, low to the ground, real thick shoulder‑type
guys but Josh is a different point guard but just as effective so far, and
hopefully that will happen in the games, too.  
  
Q. What does Josh do in your offense to compensate for the fact that he's
not as much as of a blow ‑by guy like the last couple?   
BO RYAN: He's a little longer, Mike. His handle‑‑ he's going to be tough to
take the ball away from. He can get it into position to start whatever we're
doing. Might not see as many ball screens this year. It depends on how we keep
evolving. Defensively he is so much better at this point than a lot of the
other guards that we've had at the point, because of his length.  
The other guys were pretty good defenders, but Josh is a step above that
defensively, and because of his height, I think he can see things very well.
So he's thinking another pass ahead, like some of those hockey guys that make
the pass that leads to the pass that gets you a bucket. He understands angles,
and he's extremely competitive.  
  
Q. Bo, how does Zach Bohannon compare with his older brother and is it the
intangibles and how does he fit in your lineup?  
BO RYAN: You said it, tries to help the referees probably more than anybody
we've had, because he thinks every call should be the color of whatever jersey
he's wearing. But he loves the game, competes hard, taller.  
He's not the‑‑ he can shoot from three, but, you know, Jason was pretty good
his last couple of years with the bounce, too, gettin' to the rim. Jason was
deceivingly athletic and Zach brings moxy. Offensively he does some things,
and it's nice to have a guy that's played in the system where you're pretty
well taught to make good reads when he played at Air Force, some of the
Princeton stuff, the backdoor stuff, overplays, read and react situations.  
So he was a little more ahead of most guys coming in. Now that we have him for
two years, I think he will help us. I don't know how many minutes, how much
time, but having him on the floor would not be something where we go, oh,
well, we got at that get this guy some rest, so we will let him in. He will
earn minutes.  
  
Q. What do you feel the impact has been on the new rule that you can get to
work with freshmen and how does that change the probability that more of them
are ready right off the bat?  
BO RYAN: There is no question our freshmen are ready to compete a couple of
hours a week. They're playing basketball a lot more than two hours. They'll
play pick‑up for two hours against one another. Getting them organized, more
somebody like Sam Dekker and Zak Showalter, they've been to our camps and
they're way ahead of the curve, our two freshmen and the hours this summer
just multiplied that.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the league prospects with five teams in the top
25 and Indiana getting a lot of number 1, national attention.  
BO RYAN: It's good for the league. I think the league earned it, the fact that
they see guys back on a lot of those teams, especially Indiana. Where you
start is someone thing, as we all know, but to get that kind of information
out or to have that out there to the public and knowing the tournaments that
we're in, our nonconference schedules, the type of teams we're going to play.
We're going to have to back it up. We're going to have to play well, that's
for sure.  
There are certain teams now in our league that have that "X" that mark on
their back, but that's good. I think that's good, that quality competition,
that interest, the outside interest of people saying, "Well, we think this
team is pretty good." This team is pretty good. That's okay, that's great for
the league.  
  
Q. You bring up the mark on the back, I think you guys are in the top 25,
but there are four teams ahead of you. Your team has been at or near the top
for the last decade, is that an unusual position for you guys to start the
season maybe a little farther down? Is that something that you can use to
motivate your guys?  
BO RYAN: Not really. I don't really have to go anything about that and the
fact that four of our breath they are ahead of us, that's okay and a lot of
play between now and the end of December, early Jan. There is reasons why
certain teams weren't in certain positions and I understand with our team,
with the point guard position being new, maybe inexperienced to some extent, I
can understand that and the teams know we're going to play most of them twice.
Great for the RPI, the league, you can beat up on each other but you can
still, with certain statistics look pretty good with the RPI and other things.
So I think our players welcome it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us head coach for Purdue, Matt Painter, Coach?  
MATT PAINTER: We're excited about this year, in a little bit of a different
position for us with losing technically four guys that started the majority of
the season. But we have some good talent, we're very inexperienced, we have
four true freshmen that I feel will play, we have red shirt freshmen that will
play. It's going to be a youth movement for us, and like I said earlier I do
like our talent level, I don't like our experience.  
We made a trip to Italy this summer, which was great timing for us to get the
four games, the ten practices and spend time together as a group. I think the
timing of allowing us to have workouts this summer was great and for this
particular team like in all of college basketball. So we're excited. We're
excited about our opportunities this year, we have a good nonconference
schedule. So we're definitely going to be challenged and hopefully we will be
prepared for a very tough, Big 10 preseason.  
  
Q. Last time you were this year you came a game away from being the winner
of the Big 10. What do you see happening this year?  
MATT PAINTER: I think anytime someone is predicting you to be in the lead
they're trying to fame your success. People may say this is not this team's
time, it's going to be in a year, but it's always your time. There are two
teams that made The Final Four three years ago that didn't receive any votes
at all in the top 25 in the preseason and one of those had to win 25 games to
get to the Final Four.  
So if you stick together and play hard. We had some tough losses with that
team, nonconference. When Hummel and Johnson were fresh we know we got beat by
a mediocre Iowa State team, we were down 16‑0 against Florida International
going into Big 10 play. We had struggled in our first couple of games, even
though we were 2‑1 we struggled in those games, and then we were able to go
15‑3 and Brian Butch doesn't bank in a three in Indiana we win the Big 10.  
So there is a lot to go said by continuing to work hard and stick together and
I talked about it yesterday at practice. The teams normally that fade or drop
off have a lot of distractions and have guys thinking about themselves instead
of about what's important for your program.  
  
Q. Just maybe if you can assess the Big 10, we have five ranked teams, a lot
of power, just the way you see that from a national standpoint?  
MATT PAINTER: I think last year I felt we had the best league in the country.
I think you've got to prove yourself all over again. I think it looks like we
could do that again on paper but you have to go out from a nonconference
standpoint and solidify yourself.  
But we have talent in our league from top to bottom and I think that's maybe
what separates us, obviously those teams that have been voted in the top 25
are all worthy of those rankings, but I think the teams that are at the bottom
in the rankings are teams that can push to the top and put themselves in good
position come March.  
So time will tell, but the bottom half of our league is so good, however you
want to categorize that, I don't know what teams you want to put there but
that makes our league pretty special. There is no easy outs throughout the
season.  
  
Q. With Indiana getting all this attention after a long climb back, what's
the view from Purdue on the Hoosiers?  
MATT PAINTER: I think they have a very good team, and I think everybody they
have been able to accomplish they have earned and they've done it the hard
way. When we took over at Purdue we were in last place, too. So I understand
that climb. Now last year them getting fifth place and getting to the Sweet 16
which was a huge jump from where they were before and they were making strides
before, they just needed that "impact" guy and I think they have that in Cody
Zeller, which I considered the best in college basketball, Jordan Hull's work
ethic, Victor Oladipo, Will Sheehey, that gets contagious and they have a
chance to contend for a Big 10 championship and anybody who can do that is
good enough to get to the Final Four and put themselves into a position for a
national championship.  
  
Q. Going on that, you're in a lot of the same living rooms and open gyms as
Indiana. What is Purdue's message amidst the high? What do you say to sell
Purdue?  
MATT PAINTER: I think you start with education, you don't worry about other
people. Our education is top flight, I think we have great people at Purdue
and last time I checked this is a "people" business. So if you want to go in
there and talk about rankings and different things, we talk about trying to
make it work two ways for a student athlete. You make it work through
education and through basketball. We have graduate every player in seven
years, I think our guys have gotten better.  
We haven't signed any NBA players but we've put people in the NBA. Anybody can
sign an NBA player but can you take a guy that no one else in the league wants
and four years later he gets drafted in the second round. I think you're doing
something as a staff when you can say that. But probably the number 1 thing I
learned from Coach Keadyis be honest with your players. They will respect you.  
  
Q. How does Johnson compare with Jackson?  
MATT PAINTER: Anthony Johnson is a very good player he's a quintessential
point guard, he looks for his shots a lot and I want him to do that, I want
him to be aggressive and I think he will make an impact on our team, I think
he will make an impact on our league. He's just a great decision maker. He
sees a frame ahead, his teams win in high school, in AAU, in competition, in
practices, he makes other people around him better.  
In comparison to Lewis, he's bigger than Lewis, he can shoot better than
Lewis, he sees the floor better than him. Lou was tough, he had ultimate
quickness and a huge heart and I think Ronnie has some of those same
intangibles, but I would take either one of them.  
  
Q. Coach, what about A.J. Hammons? I know he went to Cal. Does it fit what
you haven't had?  
MATT PAINTER: No question, he's a true freshman and I think Oak Hill helped
him to prepare from an academic standpoint, helped him prepare in that sense
and Steve Smith has been doing it a long time and helped him in term of his
work ethic, but with all that being said I thought the people at Carmel did a
good job his freshman and sophomore year, sometimes it helps a young person to
be able to get away and get a focus, doesn't mean something was wrong, just
different, times just different. He's ahead defensively right now, I would
say, in terms of blocking shots and rebounding and passing and thinking the
game.  
He's very good in those areas. Offensively he can make an open shot to 17
feet. He's got to get polished in the post, a go‑to move and feel more
comfortable down there on the block. You would think someone who has always
been huge, that's that what they would be in terms of a low post guy, he would
prefer to float but we're trying to anchor him and understand that we will get
him the basketball if he will work to get deep position and then work to get
position and score the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Nebraska coach Tim Miles. He enters his first season
as the head coach with eight letter winners returning this season. Coach?  
TIM MILES: Excited to be the Nebraska head coach and excited about the Big 10.
Questions?  
  
Q. In terms of recruiting, looking at the state of Nebraska probably hadn't
produced an abundance of All ‑American basketball players. Where do you go and
how will being part of the Big 10 help you to get into the major metro areas
in the midwest? Is that an area you're going to look to?   
TIM MILES: I think we will definitely recruit the footprint of the Big 10, the
old Big 12 north. I think you have to pick population basis, when you're in
Nebraska, California, Texas, Florida, the northeast, you have to decide can I
fish every pond and you can't. We're going to go to Texas, we recruited from
Texas in Colorado at CSU, so we're going to keep going back there.  
We have to develop guys, no doubt about it. We have to do a good job of
developing our players and hopefully our style of play makes that happen in a
better way, but you're in an elite league with elite players and we're going
to have to lock under any rock possible and go anywhere in the world and
recruit.  
  
Q. What was your view of the Big 10 before you got in the conference, trying
to get a real coach's look at the players in the Big 10?  
TIM MILES: Technically, I haven't had my brains beat in yet, but I would like
to thank Rick and the Big 10 for starting us at home against Michigan State,
and the beginning of the schedule, thanks, Rick! Santa is going to give him
some coal in his stocking.  
It's a great league. My view watching Big 10 when I was a little boy, when you
grow up in South Dakota and get two channels, you pay attention what happens,
on the one that carries basketball so the Big 10 was always one of those teams
we would see, Tom Davis and his press for Iowa, the Golden Gophers from
Minnesota.  
Our game has changed a little bit, certainly, but it's a league that you have
Hall of Fame coaches, you have unbelievable teams with traditions and we're
trying to put our markup there with them. That's the best I can do without
answering the question.  
  
Q. What are the challenges of coaching at an athletic program that's
dominated by football and trying to make basketball something that people get
excited about?  
TIM MILES: When I started coaching at Northern State in Aberdeen, South Dakota
I was the assistant and I got $3,000 a year, and the next year I was the
assistant at $2500, all the same I was excited and I remember doing an
interview and my mom asked me "Tim, what did you want to coach for?" And I
said "I want to turn Notre Dame into a real basketball school" I thought I
would like a real challenge, so I took the Nebraska job. It's a school with
remarkable fan support, administrative support, and at the end of the day when
you look at things, I don't care‑‑ peel back the onion. Volleyball is great,
wrestling is in the top 10, track and field is good, women's gymnastics won
the Big 10 last year. You don't have to go far to see our athletic department
through and through is outstanding. Women's basketball has been terrific. We
need to get men's basketball up and running where it should be, it's been
since 1988 since we made the NCAA. Trying to think how old I was back then?  
  
Q. Can you describe the impact of the new facilities that you guys have put
in? Obviously you talk about getting basketball in a bigger place in the
hierarchy at Nebraska but the way you have upgraded the facilities, can you
speak to that and the impact on your program?  
TIM MILES: Well, we put in the Hendricks Training Complex last year, a $20
million project and we have had everybody and their brother through there
check it go out. Utah comes next week, the Brooklyn Net who were there this
week, Bulls were there, every college has been there.  
Everybody is looking at it as a model, and it's really well done. We would
invite you all to come but you might, so I'm not going to! Our day‑to‑day
operations are as good as they are in the country, and when we put our‑‑
pinnacle bank arena is going to be a $200 million project and we were looking
at the organization of the coaches locker rooms, the players' locker rooms,
and I can't tell you how well thought out it is, it's going to be an amazing
place and when you combine those two within two years of each other, it's an
amazing physical capacity of what we're doing. We just got to get some guys
and have some fun with it.  
  
Q. Starting out with a new program, would you prefer to have a roster of
veteran guys who played for another coach or preferred the situation you're in
where everything seems ‑‑ there aren't many guys that are left over that
played a lot and you're going to have to build it from square one?   
TIM MILES: This is my fifth start‑up, you know? Hence the gray hair! You
prefer as much talent as possible, I'm just going to tell it you that. You
would prefer the team to be in great shape. There is the acclimation part, you
go as far as your seniors will take you, if their buy‑in is good and their
mental capacity for a learning curve is good, they're going to pick up a new
system, all the stuff that goes with that, you're going to be further down the
road. We could play as little as eight scholarship guys this year, up with or
two of those guys couldn't break into the rotation last year, so that's why
we're picked where we are. I like this group, they're hard working, but we've
got a lot of work to do.  
We've got some good players we just need to add to it.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on this at the beginning. Talk about the depth of the
conference and how many teams are at the top of the league.  
TIM MILES: The three that are in the top 5 in the country or the ones after
that only in the top 20? It's a great league! I don't think you have to go
very far to find a great coach, a great program, knows exactly what they're
doing, plays the game the right way. I'm really excited to be part of the
league, but I think every night in, John Beilein told me, he's a Cardinals fan
and we struck up a conversation this summer, I'm a Cardinals fan, apologize to
the Cub fans here, I know we've been doing it a long time to ya!  
At the end of the day, John said "I've been in a lot of leagues and there is
nothing like the Big 10 on" the environment, the on‑campus arenas, the fan
support, there is nothing like it.  
My daughter taught me this funky thing, you do "options" panorama here we go.
Slow down, I'm getting direction! Just like at work! I got the Big 10 mic in
there. You guys can tell all the kids you're in. Thanks for participating. See
ya.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, good luck this year.

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is Fran McCaffery, he welcomes back 10 letter
winners and three starters from last year's team.  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I am very excited about our team and our potential and I think
we have to be cautiously optimistic because we're still a very young team
despite the fact that we have 87% of our offense back there is going to be a
lot of young players in the mix. I think we're the biggest we've been in a
long time and the deepest we've been in a long time, and I think we have a
chance to be very good.  
The challenge anytime you're coaching in this league is are you going to be
good enough? Because there are so many good teams, and I think that's the fun
of it. That, as I said, is the challenge, to see how we progress, how we
develop, especially early with our young players.  
  
Q. Fran, yours is a team that people keep mentioning as a dark horse,
somebody that isn't picked high, they could do real well. Do you embrace that
idea? Do you think it's a good place to be? Seems like you're confident about
that.  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I think I would be foolish not to embrace that. I prefer to be
much more optimistic. A lot of coaches try to temper any level of enthusiasm
to take the pressure off themselves. I prefer to challenge our team and our
players.  
I recognize just how good this league is. As good as it's been since I've been
in it this short time, I think it's even better now in terms of quality teams
1 through 12. The difficulty that we all experience winning on the road is
huge, but we have some pieces. We can score. We have multiple options I can do
to in terms of personnel, I can go big, I can go small, I think we can
pressure more because we have more depth.  
The key is, as you know, and you saw us, is defensively. We didn't defend last
year, we didn't defend consistently. We defended some nights but we gave up
high numbers from three, from the field, and the players in this league are
just too good to play the way we played last year defensively. Part of that
was we played fast. I thought in terms of turnovers and assists, I felt we
were pretty good. We have to get better there, turnovers have to improve,
despite the fact that we're playing fast and we have to play better defense
and I think we will be a better rebounding team, which should limit the other
teams shooting percentages a little bit. If you put it all together, obviously
we hope to be substantially improved.  
  
Q. Coach, how does having the size of Woodbury affect what you guys are
going to be able to do?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: When you have a legitimate 7‑foot post presence and I refer to
him as a post presence because he's pretty good offensively in the post, but
what he is a guy that really understands how to play.  
So you can run your offense through him, even if he's not getting 25, his best
attribute offensively is passing. He will throw it in there, skip it to the
weak side, we have a number of three‑point shooters, but he is a presence
physically. He closes up the lane, holds his position, bangs people.  
When you're going up against the really good post guys in the league like
Zeller it gives him somebody who can match him physically in terms of size.
Last year we had a tremendous player in Zach McCabe, and though he's 6‑7, it's
a difficult task for him so it presents more promise for the teams that are
preparing for us and gives us a weapon that we didn't have before.  
  
Q. Following up on that, what are the most important things for a freshman
to not just be able to play in this league but to contribute to winning?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: It starts quite frankly with how you live your life. The
hardest thing for freshmen to do is to understand the discipline required to
be good. From the minute they arrive on campus, organizing their day, getting
through class, training and conditioning, training table, practice, academic
appointments, get up and do it again and, again and, again and to have that
discipline and then to understand the scouting report process, learn the
position, learn more than one position and approach this thing not like an
eight between year old freshman but as a professional. The ones that excel are
oftentimes not necessarily the ones that are the most talented, they're the
ones that are the most mature. I think Adam Woodbury is that kind of person.
He's focused, he's diligent, his work ethic is incredibly consistent and
that's how Aaron White ‑‑ last year, you looked at him, he was a skinny
freshman, but he was mentally mature in his approach. There might be somebody
who works as hard as Aaron White but there is nobody that works harder.  
When you have a team consisting of players like that, then you have a chance
to certainly be better and ultimately be very good.  
  
Q. Fran, establishing an offensive tempo on the road in this league is maybe
one of the more difficult challenges, do you think that the freshmen like Mike
Gesell and Pat Ingram can do that?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Absolutely they can do that, are they going to have bumps in
the road, yes. They're going to see incredibly defensive teams and hostile
environments. The other thing I can do is to put Roy Devyn Marble in that
position who has played it for two years and played it extremely well and I
still play him there a lot and make sure he is ready to go if I need him but
his length, he's almost 6‑7 and his ability to understand how to play, I think
you look at him and you think he's a 6‑7 scoring guard, averaged 28 in high
school, slasher, city guy but Roy Devyn Marble is incredibly cerebral, he
knows where to lineup in the 1, 2 and 3 spot in anything we do, he knows how
to engineer victory, he likes to feed the post, he's probably our best
low‑post feeder, we have the most low‑post guys in terms of opportunities to
throw it in there that we've ever had, certainly since I've been there.  
So I think from that standpoint it gives us the versatility to go with him if
I need to but I have two guys that not only push it and make the decisions but
they both can score and they both defend. With all due respect to Cartwright
last year what was a great leader, a great offensive player he doesn't defend
and that was his struggle and it affected our team and part of it was because
I was playing him a thousand minutes and these guys can get rest and put
better pressure on the basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is Ohio State coach Thad Matta. He enters this
year here, he returns two all‑Big 10 selections including Defensive Player of
the Year, Aaron Craft. We will go ahead with an opening statement.  
THAD MATTA: Obviously glad to be here, this means basketball is on! I think
with this basketball team, with what you lost last year, I have been pleased
with what the guys have done in the off‑season, the effort they have given us
thus far. I think they're very aware of the challenges that lie ahead, and
like I said, I like their demeanor to this point.  
I've always said this: I don't start thinking about the Big 10 really until
late December, trying to keep my sanity, knowing how good this league is going
to be this year. It will be another, like I said, great challenge for this
team and the guys are ready to go.  
  
Q. Hey, Coach, last year Deshaun transferred himself, was very athletic,
what areas of improvement has he made in the last six months?  
THAD MATTA: I think first and foremost, Deshaun has made the progress that you
make from your freshmen to your sophomore year. He changed his body, he's
kinda changed it again, he's a lot thinner this year than he was last year. I
think the light is on for him in terms of what he has to do to be a fully
effective player.  
The biggest thing, that I have seen, is he now has such a better understanding
of the game of basketball and knowing that there is a lot of different ways
that he can affect the game rebounding, his defense. I've been pleased with
what he's done defensively in practice thus far. The other thing is the
overall mind‑set of‑‑ he understands his teammates, he understands the system
that we're trying to implement better and how he fits in. It's been amazing to
see his attitude, just his leadership that he has provided for these guys.  
  
Q. Thad, you've got a lot back but you lost a pretty big guy. Size up your
team and what you're expecting, what people should expect from the Buckeyes?  
THAD MATTA: I think anytime you lose two players of the caliber that we lost,
we lost the third all‑time leading scorer in Ohio State history and Will won
120 games in his four years there, you lose a first‑team All American, Jared
is definitely one of the greatest players I've ever coached and you see that
now with what he is doing in the NBA with the Celtics.  
Those guys, you can't replace them, and I think that's one of the challenges
you have with your guys is saying, look, I don't need you to be Jared or
William, I need you to be yourselves and the best you can be. In terms of
assessing our team, I've seen all of our guys get better. Individually, which
obviously makes us better collectively, I think from the standpoint we're
going to have more depth this year and probably more interchangeable pieces,
guys that can do different things. We've got speed, athleticism and hopefully
we can continue to play as fast as we possibly can.  
  
Q. Thad, obviously a number of freshmen have come in the past few years and
had a big impact. What's the key for a freshman to be ready to not just play
in the Big 10 but to contend?  
THAD MATTA: I think they have to have it physically. They've got to have a
good body, and I think in the years that I've coached in college probably the
most college‑ready player I've ever had come in was Aaron Craft and what he
did with his body before he even got to college was incredible.  
But I think the next thing is the mind, they have to be able to think quickly,
make quick decisions. They have to understand it's a different basketball game
than it was in high school, than it was in their AAU careers. I think that's
probably the biggest thing, you try to get freshmen to understand the thinking
component of the game of basketball, and not just going out there and playing
and‑‑ you know, the freshmen that come in that have a great impact appear to
understand the game maybe a little bit better than others.  
  
Q. I know you've only been gone for 10, 12 days so far, but the two spots
you do lose somebody, the wing and the center position, who are the guys that
have stepped up, not necessarily naming a starter but out of that group of
guys that we talked about on media day who are the guys that have really shown
you something here in the first couple of weeks?  
THAD MATTA: You know, I'll be honest, Steve, I think in my mind I've been
pleased with how everybody has played. Like I said, I've seen improvement in
each guy's game, you know, from Amir Williams making tremendous strides, Evan
Ravenel being our own senior, we mace the season with only one senior like we
did last year, Trey McDonald has come leap and bounds in understanding the
skill set, LaQuinton Ross is getting the meat and the potatoes of putting the
system together, which he didn't have that luxury last year. Sam Thompson has
surprised us with his overall play, Amedeo being the only freshman, you talk
about a freshman being ready, he understands the game as well as anybody I've
ever seen. He can knock down shots as well.  
So I don't know if I can pinpoint just one guy because like I said, I like
what I've seen from everybody in terms of improvement.  
  
Q. We know that you've lost a lot of the scoring from last season. Going
into this year, is there a particular player that you think is going to need
to step up to shoulder that burden or more of a scoring by committee
approach?  
THAD MATTA: I think scoring by committee approach. From the standpoint of who
we have‑‑ and I've always said the best teams I've ever had you never knew
going into a game who was going to be the leading scorer. It kind of emerged
throughout the course of the game, and I view this team as that's what is
probably going to have to happen for us.  
  
Q. Thad, I think your are the fourth or fifth coach to come through and say
this is a great league this year. What is the difference? You guys have been
fairly constant since you took over, fairly near the top of the league but
what is the difference that's brought the league to the level that it is now?
It's not that long you guys were eighth in conference RPI as a league.  
THAD MATTA: I think the Big 10 told us we had to say that‑‑ I'm kidding you!
What I've seen over time in the Big 10 is you have great coaches, you have
great programs, I've always said winning on the road in the Big 10 may be the
most daunting task in college basketball, night in, night out, the
environments that you go into.  
But I think one of the biggest things I've seen in my time is the level of
player has really increased, and you couple all of that with the guys that are
coaching, I think that's what makes it a great league. I don't think any of us
can walk up there and say I looked at their schedule and I know we're going to
win this game. I think that's why I don't look at it until Decemberbecause I
don't want to think in terms of that. It seems like everybody is at their
best, you know, a lot of times‑‑ as Ohio State did for a long time, up down,
up down, and everybody appears to be on the upward swing right now.  
  
Q. Coach, John Groce is a guy who has worked for you before, what can the
rest of the league expect to see from him as he progresses with that program
over at Illinois.  
THAD MATTA: John is‑‑ we were together for eight years, I think it was, and
he's a guy that number 1, has the passion to teach and coach the game of
basketball. He has energy, he understands the game, he's proven in terms of
what he's done at Ohio University. The other thing, in just with talking with
John, he has great passion for the University of Illinois, which I think makes
a huge impact from day one. I know that he feels the need to do his best there
and it's obviously year in, year out, a traditional power house. He's
accepting that challenge and I think Illinois fans will be happy with him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, good luck this year.

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us Michigan State coach, Tom Izzo, 18 seasons, 11
letter winners from last year's squad. They advanced to the Sweet 16. Coach?  
TOM IZZO: Eleven? We must have had a lot of walk‑ons. Okay. You know, I've
been‑‑ in my 18th year, my 30th year there and kinda go through a lot of
phases but I like my team.  
I like the fact that we have depth, I think we have some youth, I think we
have some guys that have been in a Final Four, won, so we have experience at
the highest level, some of these guys have won a couple of Big 10
Championships, and we need improvement out of guys, especially Keith Appling,
Adreian Payne, Derrick Nix, and maybe the best present is it looks like
Branden Dawson is healthy, he's come back with no signs athletically of any
issues, hasn't missed a practice, hasn't sat out a minute since we've got
going so that's encouraging. You add to that a couple of our freshmen,
especially Harris, Valentine and Costello, that gives us depth and we have a
chance to put together a pretty good team and unfortunately it's in a tough
conference this year and that's going to make a difference.  
  
Q. Coach, you named Russell Byrd as your team captain, he's not one of your
older players or productive players. What went behind the decision in that?  
TOM IZZO: In all honesty, the team named him, which is even better because I
always say that championships and great seasons are won in locker rooms, hotel
rooms and airplanes, and he did a heck of a job this summer in the locker
room.  
I didn't mention him but he was a kid that came in, a big‑time shooter, 6‑6,
6‑7, and he had a broken foot in high school, it never healed properly, it
took toward the end of last year before he could practice every day and he,
too, is injury free and has been playing very well, so the fact that they know
he's a good player but he's an incredible kid who has rallied our guys
together, one of those leaders that doesn't lead by example only, I think
those guys are cop outs, I think he leads by playing people in, he had Keith
Appling every night and they were shooting a lot and a lot of other players.  
I think he's been a great selection even though he hasn't shown to be a great
player yet.  
  
Q. I was wondering the keys for a freshman coming in and contributing right
away, what attributes do they need physically as well as the mental
approach?  
TOM IZZO: I think physically is important, that's why I think of Dawson last
year, Chris Weber, strong enough to handle things as a freshman and Dawson was
that for us. Gary Harris and Valentine are athletic, they're able to take a
pounding. I told Harris a couple of days ago, he's an illegal alien because he
plays both ends of the court and that's something laws a lot of freshmen don't
guard as well and Dawson at the end of the year last year was one of our
better defensive players and I think Harris is going to be that off the bat.  
So I think strength is the key, understanding the speed of the game is a
little different, and being tough enough to be good enough defensively because
you look at Gilcrest last year and that's what I think he was.  
  
Q. You played Adreian and Derrick alternate last year, two such good
players, is there any way you can play them in tandem?  
TOM IZZO: They're going to have to and inning the one thing that's going to
be‑‑ what we have to come up with is Adreian is a very good shooter and that's
a misnomer. He's probably the Beth athlete on our team. What he lacks that has
to come is we used to run our offense through green‑‑ offense through Greene
and he may be doesn't have the decision‑making skills, but he's a good passer,
on the other end of the floor, he can guard quicker on guys, and they will
play together a significant amount. That will be one of the keys.  
Like all the teams that I have had that have been good, we can play big or we
can throw a Dawson or Byrd in there and we can go small. I think that's
advantageous, especially with our schedule, we're playing all kinds of
different teams but they will play together.  
  
Q. I want to ask about Gary Harris, a lot was made of his recruitment, one
of the top players in the midwest last year, throughout the country, and what
has he shown you so far? I know it's only been ten days but you get a chance
to work with him what has he shown?  
TOM IZZO: First of all it's because of the greatest rule that the NCAA came up
with two hours in the summer, I enjoyed that because it gives us a chance to
work with the kids and have fun. During the year it's pressure on them,
pressure on us, that was great and I learned a lot about Gary then. He's been
better than I thought he would be, shooting better than I thought he would,
and he picks up things so fast.  
I tease his dad because his mother played in the WNBA and she was a very good
player at Purdue, so he's a chip off her block, I guess, but he's just a great
kid to coach, he's a great student, he picks things up and he's been shooting
the ball better and better. Defensively I give his high school coach credit
because he had it before he came here. He's very, very intelligent defensively
and works very hard at it.  
  
Q. All the coaches talk about the rule allowing them to work with their
players as a big deal but it's only two hours. Why is it a big deal? What do
you get done in two hours?  
TOM IZZO: Remember now for 20 years it was illegal to talk to them, you walk
by them in the hallway and you can barely say hi because you're afraid
somebody is hiding out behind the garbage can or something.  
So it's just the relationship you build with them. What you do, like in any
profession is you hope they change their free‑throw, you hope they change
their jump shot so you work with them in the spring and you don't see them for
four months and there is nothing worse than work, on something to try to get
better at it and doing it the wrong way. This gives us a chance to check in
with them, it wasn't like we put in a new offense or defense, so Septemberand
Octobercame and it wasn't foreign.  
But I would say developing the relationship, letting him know what practices
are going to be like. You know sometimes I went three 40‑minute ones,
sometimes I went two, one‑hour ones, and I think it made me coach better,
because you have to condense what you want to do in a shorter period of time.
That's how you learn to speed things up, guys have to think at a faster rate.  
I think you'll find‑‑ because I'm on the NCAA board or NEBC board, I'm not
sure I've heard a coach that didn't like it and administrators should realize
we want to work more and so do the players.  
  
Q. I wanted to get your thoughts on the strength of the league this year,
three teams in the top ‑5\.   
TOM IZZO: I knew somebody would ask that, why ruin a good day.  
  
Q. How does it compare to past years when you've been in the Big 10?  
TOM IZZO: Early on when I was assistant, as Jed would say, I felt like the
league was really good back then. You had incredible coaches and I think right
now this league has the best coaches that we've ever had and a lot of it
starts there.  
Some of the new guys that have been brought in the last couple of years have
done a great, great, great job and then just players, some have five, some
have six in the top 25, some have seven or eight and inning some of the teams
they leave out of those, you can only put so many in. They're going to be
difficult.  
I think Tubby is going to have a great team, I think Fran has done a great job
at Iowa and that's going to be a significant jump. I think Northwestern is
going to be right up there, they have a lot of players back and a couple of
new ones in, so they're going to be much better and Indiana is worthy of its
high ranking that it's gotten so far.  
When you put all those things together and considering I think we play all
five of those top teams that are ranked, it's going to be a tremendous
schedule. Fun for the fans, fun for the media and hard on the coaches.  
  
Q. Can you comment about the sportsmanship initiative, the bench decorum,
howl that impact the league? If you get a young one not used to talking to
coaches, will that initiate a technical?  
TOM IZZO: I told Fran he can't throw anymore chairs so it's going to be hard
on him but the rest of us should survive just fine. All seriousness, it all
goes hand‑in‑hand. The officials have to do a good job and we have to do a
good job. Sometimes it's all pointed at one group. The good officials can
handle a coach and the good coaches can handle the officials, as long as both
parties are doing their job.  
In basketball it's different than football where you're so close and you get
so caught up in the emotion of the game. I hope we don't start overlegislating
against the game, meaning, you know, fans, you can't have noise makers, you
can't have this or that. Sometimes I think we overlegislate. There is still
the excitement of the game and as far as young officials or old officials,
God, aren't they all bad? No! They're not!  
I don't think that matters, I think we have a lot of good officials in our
league and you just don't have many problems with the ones that are good. You
really don't. It's not as bad as you think, and they will probably tone us
down, but our jobs aren't aligned, and things are important to us, too, and
Jed used to say a good game makes us all better, and it did!  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our final Coach is Illinois head coach John Groce. He enters
his first year at the Fightin' Illini program, and he inherits nine letter
winners from last year's team.  
JOHN GROCE: Well, the biggest thing thus far is our players have been terrific
from their effort, attitude, they're excited. It's been maybe as fun as
anytime I've been in coaching to go to practice. They're excited to be there,
they're passionate, they want to learn, they have exceeded my expectations in
that regard.  
That part has been really neat. Obviously the development of some of our guys
from spring to fall as you're learning about your players is rapidly as we
have, over the course of seven months, that part has been fun. Our staff has
done a great job working with the kids and I have three position coaches that
work with the position groups, so just the improvement that the guys have made
in a short period of time has been exciting as well, so practice is going
well.  
I feel like we're getting better every day, we have a long way to go, but
we're going to keep working at it and let the chips fall.  
  
Q. Can you talk about who you have seen improvement from? There were a lot
of guys who didn't see a lot of playing time last year, so talk about who you
have seen improvement from.  
JOHN GROCE: The guy who's stood out the most is Nnanna Egwe. Nnanna made
20,000 shots on his own this summer, eight weeks of school. He's watching
films, watching DVDs, you will see him early in the morning. Sometimes I will
ask him if he wants the lights on, he is shooting in the dark, and he loves
the game, can't get enough of it.  
I told him the other day, everything that you get‑‑ the way he's playing right
now, he played well the another night in our orange/blue scrimmage, "You've
earned it." His attitude, his effort has been off the charts.  
I think Myke Henry has made a significant jump, he's been our leading
rebounder in the scrimmage on Monday night, a little bit undersized at 6‑6 but
as a knack for the ball. He's shot a high percentage, he picks up things
quickly, so he's gotten better. I think Abrams and Brandon Paul understand
more what we expect out of the point guard position, those guys have gotten
better. Tracy Abrams is probably more natural, but Brandon is willing to
listen and get better and balance playing that position as well as the 2.  
We have asked him to make the sacrifice for this team because we feel like
that's what we need, so those guys have gotten better. Joseph Bertrand is
shooting over 50% from the three in practice, and he's not been known in the
past as a jump shooter. He's worked hard and has been getting better.  
The one thing that's exceeded even our expectations how hungry they've been,
how excited they have been, how hard they work, how much they're in the gym.
You love going to practice and coaching this team because they're hungry. That
part has been neat and a lot of those guys I've just mentioned have improved
over the course of the seven months since our staff has been at Champaign.  
  
Q. Brandon Paul has been inconsistent over the last few years. What are you
expecting out of him and how have you worked with him to find consistency in
his game?  
JOHN GROCE: I think the biggest thing is the mental side for him. People ask
me what we expect out of him. He's a guy right now that I'm talking a lot to
about making guys around him better, who did you touch today? Who did you help
today? Who did you help to get to play at a different, higher level, who are
you helping? I think that's a big thing with him and the consistency piece you
just hit on.  
I use the Pat Riley quote with him: "Coaches will take consistency over
greatness any day of the week." How do you do that? I think you do that by
understanding every practice matters, every rep matters, every little thing
that we do matters. That's how you become more consistent at what you do, and
he's embraced that, Shannon. I've seen him embrace it at a higher level as we
move forward, and I'm hoping that bodes well for him in terms of the
consistency piece.  
  
Q. How does your previous experience in the Big 10 as an assistant help you
now?  
JOHN GROCE: Well, it helps Jeff from the standpoint of the appreciation of the
league. Obviously I think right now our league has great stability and
continuity, a lot of players returning, we had a great year last year as a
league. The depth of the league is maybe, you know, a little deeper than it
was during my last tenure, if you will, in the Big 10 as an assistant or
associate head coach. I think that makes it even more challenging.  
I think there is no question that having been in the league before certainly
helps. I think the experience that I had at Ohio helps a lot as well, to be
honest, going through that and understanding that it does take time, that the
learning curve right now when I'm dealing with our 14 players from the
standpoint of what they are trying to learn and what we're wanting to do, it's
like having 14 freshmen, 14 new guys.  
Being patient, being more detailed and repeating things and understanding that
repetition builds mastery and slowing things down for them, that experience
helped me as much or more quite honestly than my previous stint in the league
in terms of how we're handling this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Best of luck this year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Indiana head coach, Tom Crean. He enters his fifth
season and returns all five starters from last year's team that advanced to
the NCAA Sweet 16, including Big 10 preseason player of the year Cody Zeller.
Coach?  
TOM CREAN: Well, I would like to thank the Big 10 first of all for continuing
to have what is an incredibly first class event, and for all the people that
participated in that, thanks to all of you. Thanks for coming and covering
this league.  
I don't think any of us take it for granted; I know I don't. When you coach in
a league like this and you coach against the teams and coaches that we go
against and you know it is a big deal every time out, to have this kind of
attendance is a big deal as well. As far as our team right now, there is no
question that our whole mindset is, our goal to get to where we want to be as
a team, to get the identity that we have to have is to make sure that we feel
like we're just a little better every day.  
It sounds cliche, but it's the truth. The thing I can always look at and back
it up with is we wouldn't be in the position we are in right now without
having that mindset from before. The bottom line is if your team is improving,
led by your best players, then everybody else has to fall in line. There is no
doubt that the attention the team has gotten has been good, and in the sense
of that they have worked very hard to get back in the conversation, it makes
for good conversation.  
But the daily challenge of trying to improve and trying to deal with all the
things that we need to do to be a better basketball team is what's most
important, and that's where our focus has been, that's where it's been as
coaches and fortunately that's where it's been as a team inside of our
practices. It's our job as coaches to create that environment every day where
the challenges are there, dealing with adversity, trying to put them in as
many situations as we can to improve them and to take it head on, and it's up
to them to make sure they come in every day with a mental preparation that's
strong, with an energy that's really good and a mindset to compete.  
If we do that, then improvement will be there and that gives us an opportunity
to move forward. As far as the league to me, when you look at this league, I
don't think you can do anything, in my mind, but look at the fact that
Michigan State, Michigan and Ohio State won the championship last year and
until somebody unseats them that's the way it is. It's a new season and all
that, but those teams didn't get any worse, they're probably even a little bit
better.  
When you have all the great programs in this league, you know that it is
absolutely going to be a hard‑fought, grinded out, in the sense of‑‑ not
grinding the games as much as grinding through what it will be all about and
getting your team up to that challenge through your practices and through your
nonconference is so important because you don't know what the league holds
other than it's going to be a battle every night.  
To me that's where our focus is. As far as individual guys, Cody Zeller
epitomizes so many things about the program and number one is the humble
spirit he has. He's confident but he has a humbleness, and he has a desire to
improve.  
Like I said earlier, when your best players lead the way with improvement in
your team then you have an opportunity to keep getting better. There is no
room for taking a seat in the back or for taking a day off for anybody else in
the program when your best players work that way. He continues to improve.
He's got a lot of things that he can get better at, he knows it, we know it
and if those improvements continue we can do a lot of things with him.  
As far as our three seniors that are with us, Jordan Hulls has been a classic
example of what you want your program to be from start to where it is right
now. He's never come in and wavered one day in his work ethic, he's never come
in‑‑ you can probably count on one hand the number of days he's taken off out
of 365 days a year.  
He's always in the gym, always in Cook Hall or Assembly Hall and he's a great
leader for us. Christian Watford shows what happens when you continue to
improve. He went from a 32% shooter as a sophomore to 44% as a junior and had
much of the year where he hovered around the 50% mark. The biggest thing for
Christian this year, if our team is going to get better, is he needs to model
the consistency day in day out that he needs to be, to be at his best, which
he is fully capable of.  
And then you have your best players leading the way. Derek Elston had an
injury on Saturday night, during our Hoosier hysteria. He's been playing
pretty well, his weight was at a great place, his strength was at a great
place, and just as happens sometimes, something happened inside that game that
nobody can pinpoint. He has some knee issues, we got him MRI'd right away and
he is going to have surgery tomorrow.  
He will be out a period of time and we have a baseline of what we're looking
at that but you can never tell until they get in and do the work and start the
rehab process with him. We have a lot of other players and I will open it up.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of hype surrounding this team, something that your team
hasn't had to deal with so far. How do you prepare your team to stand up to
that pressure?  
TOM CREAN: Our team has had to deal with a lot of other hype that wasn't
necessarily positive. I think it's easy to look at the couple of years we
started and say, well, Indiana was down and Indiana wasn't doing this or that
and that's all true. The target of being an Indiana Hoosier has never changed,
and Indiana is synonymous throughout the country for being a lot of thing in
basketball, and it was always a big deal when you were playing Indiana or
Indiana was coming to town and that hasn't changed.  
Will it grow some? Maybe. But I think the bottom line is a year ago when there
really weren't those outside voices talking in a totally positive light about
where the team was at, that didn't phase them, they continued to work. They
might respond here and there but it didn't phase them.  
The work ethic I see from this team is the same thing. There is no question
that they're receiving a lot of attention and we're trying to keep our
business as usual approach as much as we can inside the balls of the building,
and you keep the regularity that you have to have and deal with it as it
comes. The bottom line is when those guys hit the practice floor or the weight
room or when they go into the film room starting more this weekend, they're
working toward where they want to work, none of that matters.  
What matters is, are they challenging each other? Are they competing? Are they
absorbing the competition and are they hungry to get better? I don't see any
sign of that not being the case.  
  
Q. Going back to your Marquette days and even now, you've coached a lot of
great players. Where do you think Cody Zeller ranks in terms of the better
players you've coached? Do you think there is a lot of pressure on him this
season considering the preseason accolades he's received?  
TOM CREAN: I don't think Cody is somebody who has responded to pressure, I
think that's what makes him as mentally tough as he is at his age. To me
that's never wavered. He's not easily rattled. His confidence is high, but I
don't see anything from Cody that would make you think he thinks he's arrived
or achieved greatness. He's not like that. I don't want to compare players
when you're still coaching them. Those are for days when it's all said and
done, but to me ‑‑ I will go back to what I said when we signed him. His
mental toughness is phenomenal, his character is phenomenal, he's a great
teammate, he has a great work ethic, those are the things that stand out and
if that improvement continues the way that it has, he will have an outstanding
season for us.  
  
Q. I know this is early but how do you see Derek's injury affecting the
dynamic of the front court this year?  
TOM CREAN: We have been dealing with other injuries this week, with Evan
Connor out again, and you hate to say it's part of it, but the disappointment
is for him in the sense that he's been playing at a good level, working hard,
improving, and I don't see this taking away a season or anything like that.
Certainly surgery‑‑ I'm not a doctor so we will find out, and I did have to
stay about 10 miles away from here, because we couldn't get into this hotel.
It wasn't a Holiday Inn Express, but it wasn't right here!  
I think from everything we have heard from our doctors, it should be good. It
happened in high school to him, before he ever got to Indiana, so we will see
how it all turns out. I think he's a senior, he's been a tremendous leader,
without question. He's been as good as anybody in the program at trying to
help younger players. I don't think that will change even if he's going
through the rehab.  
He knows what's expected of him and he knows what we do, and I think that will
help him when he comes back; there won't be a great learning curve. He's been
through it, he can make shots, he can get rebounds, he knows what we're doing,
so he will be back, but in the meantime people will have to grow into what
they are trying to get to and at the same time do more with the veterans.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the strength of basketball in the midwest this
year with yourself, Kentucky, Louisville, Michigan all coming in toward the
top of the ranks.  
TOM CREAN: Don't forget Ohio State, Purdue, Wisconsin, Michigan State, Iowa,
Northwestern, Minnesota, Illinois.  
  
Q. And how that can change the landscape of college basketball.  
TOM CREAN: I think there is more attention paid to it maybe a little bit
nationally, but anytime ‑‑ Indiana, Louisville, Kentucky those are always
going to be names that are big everywhere when it comes to college basketball.  
The fact that all three are getting the attention that they're getting now I
think brings a little more attention to it, but for somebody like me and
others that live in the midwest maybe a little more appreciation. I know it
feels good for us to be back in that conversation, to be back, mentioned in
the same breath of other great teams. Not only having a great program, which
Indiana has been for decades, but back to having a chance to be successful.  
Again, we didn't mention Cincinnati, we didn't mention Marquette, Xavier,
Butler, Notre Dame, the midwest is absolutely loaded, and there is a lot of
excitement for fans, whether they are at the games, reading it, watching it on
television and it makes it that much more competitive for all the coaches and
the players going against one another.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Best of luck this season.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is Patrick Chambers. He enters his second season with
the Nittany Lions and includes nine winners, including, Tim Frazier. Coach if
you would like to begin with an opening statement.  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I'm excited for the second season. First season is always a
great challenge when you come into a new situation, but I'm proud of the way
those guys competed last year and I look forward to this season ahead with Tim
being a senior and more experienced and getting some of the younger guys, some
good experience and knowledge going through the Big 10 for the first time, so
I'm looking forward to a great season.  
  
Q. Tim Frazier did a lot for your team last year, what more can he do this
season or what would you like to see him do better this season?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: The most important thing for Tim is to be a great leader. I
think we all know he needs to work on his jump shot and he's done that. In
practice so far he's shooting his three's at a high clip, which is great for
us, almost makes him unguardable, but it's off the floor, in that locker room,
being the hardest worker on the team.  
It's not getting caught up in the headlines or the blogs or Tweets or whatever
you want to say. To remain humble and hungry and grounded, and trying to win
as many games as we can. That's got to be his focus, can't be anything else.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you learn as your first year in the Big 10 and what did
you plan to take into the second year?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: This league is awesome, incredible league, great coaches,
adjustments on every time‑out, halftime, great players, great talent.  
One thing that really stuck out was the home court advantage that most of the
teams get in the Big 10. Everywhere we went was sold out, didn't matter if we
were 2‑12 or 4‑14, which is where we ended up.  
They were coming out and the enthusiasm for their teams is pretty amazing. To
win on the road in the Big 10 is huge. We didn't do it last year. We're going
to have to do this year, it's that difficult. We're going to have to do it
this year. Coming from the Big East, you could find empty games and find a
way, but here, it's difficult.  
  
Q. What advice would you give to Tim Miles as he goes into the Big 10 for
his first season?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Tim is a great guy, great coach, excellent tweeter, he loves
to tweet. I would tell him he's going to have to be patient because nobody
turns the ball over in this league, that's one thing I probably should have
said as well, so you have to defend, you have to rebound and you've got to
recruit winners, and I know Tim is going to do that, I've seen the guys he's
got coming in.  
But as far as his team, his players, he needs to be patient, go through it one
time‑‑ he's a great coach but know it's difficult on the road here.  
  
Q. Obviously the controversy that developed on campus within the last year
was disconnected from your program, but how much impact has it had on your
efforts to try to rebuild the Nittany Lions in basketball?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Obviously it's been a great challenge for us offensively,
because your hearts go out to the families and what's going on, you know, it's
on TV all the time, in the newspapers all the time and dwindled a little bit
because of Bill O'Brien and his football team doing amazing things on the
field, which is great.  
But it's there, and there is no denying it, and I try to stay out in front of
it, especially when it comes to recruiting, I talk to the parents about it and
the kids about and, I don't want it to be the elephant in the room, I would
rather get it out in front of us and let's discuss it and if there are issues,
might not be the right place for you, and if they're okay with it. Then you
are going to get amazing kids that are serious about getting degrees, that are
winners and that want to help build this program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us Northwestern head Coach Bill Carmody. He enters
his 13th season with the Wildcats and returns four starters and seven letter
winners from last year's team. Coach?  
BILL CARMODY: Good morning everybody. We have four starters back, we lost a
good kid in Shurna and four starters back sounds great, but we have nine guys
on our team that have never played for Northwestern.  
So we're trying to integrate the veterans with these new guys, and a couple of
them aren't rookies, they're not green. You have Tre, a transfer from TCU who
sat out last year and Nikola and then we have Swopshire, a fifth year guy, he
played at Louisville, in the Final Four last year, so he's new to Northwestern
and not new to college basketball and the high level of college basketball.  
We're just trying to get some of these guys‑‑ all of the sudden last year we
had a number of injuries, we thought we were deep and by the end of the year
we had seven guys because we had four or five that couldn't play. So we had to
go small. But we've gotten big quickly and so we are just looking forward to
trying to get some of these big, young guys into the fold, into the mix so
they can be ready opening night.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of brought up the loss of John Shurna. He's been the face
of the program the last few years, who do you think takes over that role? Do
you think it defaults to Drew as the leader in the face of the team?  
BILL CARMODY: Yeah, Drew Crawford was the co‑rookie in the Big 10 three years
ago and he's had a nice career, I think he averaged 16 or 17 points a game
last year, and he may have deferred to John a little bit and I may have called
John's number more than Drew's at different times, but he's certainly a
terrific year and I think he's going to have a break‑out year if you can say a
guy who started for three years and scored a lot of points and been a quiet
leader for us, I would say, I think he can have one heck of a year this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of Reggie Hearn from a former walk ‑on
player to a full‑time starter last year?   
BILL CARMODY: He came in in high school and when you say "walk on" sometimes
you think these guys don't know how to play, he was a good player in Fort
Wayne, Indiana and he had some offers and he said he was going to get better
and I told him if he came and helped us, I would give him a scholarship. He
looked good as a freshman in practice. I wish I'd red shirted him now, but
last year he started every game. Hard worker, back‑to‑the‑basket player in
high school and now he's in the backcourt and last year he was with Dave
Sobolewski bringing the ball up the court and he's worked on his skills, so
it's great to see a guy like that come around.  
I don't think of him as a walk‑on anymore, really good kid, excellent student.  
  
Q. In tournament in Chicago this year, can you talk about how that might be
important for Northwestern and a great home court advantage?  
BILL CARMODY: I was always in favor of‑‑ if you're going to be in Chicago‑‑ I
liked Indianapolis, but I was always in favor of alternate, just because
Indianapolis gives you that collegiate feeling, the hotels and the restaurants
and the venue is right there but Chicago is media‑‑ it's a different place,
and it's great, and I'm real excited about us being there.  
I think it will just be good for the University, for Northwestern and the Big
10 in general. As far as advantage, we haven't played there. I'm trying to
think if any of our guys have played there, so I don't think it's an advantage
but the fans will be able to get there more easily.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the loss of JerShon and how you fill that role
there?  
BILL CARMODY: We have some‑‑ we play a center and four guys around the
perimeter so we have a few freshmen who I think are good, Kale and Sanjay and
with the addition of Jared I think we're going to be okay in the perimeter so
did he Shawn has to take care of business and we will welcome him back next
year.  
  
Q. Last year the lack of rebounding hurt you, what are you going to do this
year?  
BILL CARMODY: Just throw out some raw steaks on the court? What are you going
to do? You can do rebounding drills forever, you gotta get the ball. The guys
have to go after it that's all I can tell it you. There is some talent
involved, some ability involved but you're right, we clearly have to get
better at that because I think our defense is okay, except once it goes up,
and that's part of the defense, you have to finish the play. I think we keep
our bodies in front of guys, but kids getting second and third shots killed
us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, best of luck.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Michigan head coach John Beilein, welcoming back 10
letter winners and they won a Big 10 championship last year.  
JOHN BEILEIN: Pleasure to be here. Always exciting time when you've seen your
team for almost two weeks now and then have the opportunity to try to put the
puzzle together. It's been my‑‑ probably a big word I've used several times
today. We love the young men we have. I think with just three returning
starters, we have challenges because so few of our players have a lot of game
experience. There is only three of them with significant game experience.  
So there are challenges there but there is great opportunity because of the
young talent we have and the returning players who haven't played a lot but
have worked hard at their game.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple of weeks ago you were going to need time to figure
out your starting lineup. Do you have a better idea what that's going to be?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We are narrowing it down a little bit and we're basically trying
to figure out what's the best way to use each guy rather than who are the five
that are together.  
You try and move‑‑ I would love to have a multi positional players, but we
don't want to put them in opportunities where they're comfortable while we
grow their ability to play different positions.  
If you saw our practice yesterday we had four different combinations out
there, and I don't think any one of them was‑‑ blew our coaching staff away of
working as well together as they all have to be successful, so we are just
continuing to experiment with it. It will happen probably‑‑ hopefully we will
have something in place by the start of the Big 10 season.  
  
Q. Seems like you've got your program in place the way you want it to be
after a building process. Talk about how long that takes, what's reasonable
for a fan base and what the obstacles are.  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think the biggest obstacle is the other teams aren't going
away. I mean, you really‑‑ in a place like the Big 10 if you look back‑‑ I
came in here five years ago and there were five or six programs maybe Thad it
really going. Basically they still all have it going.  
So to get to the sixth, the seventh, the eighth spot which we were able to get
to is one step, now making that next step is really hard. I think anybody
building a program has to understand, it is difficult, because people weren't
stepping back and saying, hey, let's let Michigan have their turn. It's hard
to get there. If you establish the culture and get the right breaks here and
there, anything can happen.  
  
Q. Can you describe the way you're going to be looking to Tim Hardaway, Jr
this season? He's an upper classman, has a lot of experience. Can you talk
about his role?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think defensively he's been one where he has been‑‑ our young
players, it's very difficult to expect a lot from them defensively. There is
so much they have to learn. Now he's at a point where he's priding himself in
how he has grown defensively. Offensively, I think that our‑‑ when he plays
the 3 or the 2, how much he has the ball off the dribble, off the pass, I
think he's growing comfortable no matter what he's doing and learning about
his strengths. Love coaching him every day, intensity is incredible can Tim
Hardaway, Jr and we just continue to work with them.  
  
Q. What can the first few weeks of practice tell you about what we can do
they college level.  
JOHN BEILEIN: What it can tell me is they are receptive to continued to be
coached. They really want to learn whatever we can teach them and what their
teammates can teach them and just when you go out to a practice, there is
enough there is enough going on with a player when they're receptive to
practices and pick things up quickly, that's refreshing.  
We have been fortunate to have a lot of players over the last couple of years
that have that type of attitude and these 5 seem to be in union son to be able
to grow as a group, whether they're playing or not on the same team, grow as a
group in how much they can take in and then put into action.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Burke leaving Michigan and trying to go to the NBA,
what did it mean to your program this year to get him back and where did you
want to see him go from year one to year two in his progress?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We had similar opportunities for Morris the year before and we
were very fortunate that Trey Burke was able to step in and fill in so
admirably as a freshman. While it worked well, when you don't have a freshman
coming in at point guard, at that time we did not, it is difficult to continue
to rebuild through that position.  
So having him back has been helpful because he's a good player, he is a
winner, he's proved he's a winner and having talent is one thing, teaching
winning is another thing. He's been through a year where he was so helpful in
that Big 10 championship in games both at home and on the road.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, good luck this year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2012

  

### [Draymond Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20678)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Brandon Wood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23462)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  68  
Ohio State  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Izzo make an opening statement, and then we'll
go to questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH IZZO: Well, it's nice to know we're playing on Sunday. It's like in the
Big Ten Tournament, it's been so long I forgot. But I thought it was one of
the tougher, better games that I've seen watching this thing over the last
years, and I guess I'm prejudice, but it was big time plays, couple mistakes
here and there by both teams, big time shots.  
I thought it was just a hard‑fought game. Ohio State played awfully well.
There was times they made their run and then we came back and made our run,
and that was the difference in the game. And then down the stretch, Day‑Day
self‑admitted it wasn't his best day, and yet we said we had set up a couple
plays to go through 'em with the pass or shot, and then a couple plays at the
end that we knew we were going to run through 'em.  
And I think Keith was the guy who made a good pass to 'em on the one play. He
didn't force it in and hit that big 3. Deserving. It's deserving. You can say
he didn't have a great game, and like I said, my admission is he didn't
offensively.  
But you always go to the people that brought you here, and that's what we did.
And I had no other thought in my head and who we were going to go through. And
thank God, we answered the bell.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brandon, you knew you grow up about 60 miles away from here, so how good
does it feel to rep Kokomo in an environment like this where basketball is so
important?  
BRANDON WOOD: It felt great. I know quite a few of my people from back in
Kokomo came to the game, and it just felt great. Coach has put me in a good
situation, and Draymond believed in me and my team believed in me, and they
just wanted me to stay aggressive on offense and play as good defense as I
can. And that's what I've been trying to take pride on is actually wanting to
play defense because it's really a mindset to play defense, and I started to
enjoy it. So I think that's what made me successful.  
  
Q. When the game was over, you literally just kind of heaved. Was it just
glad it was over? Was a hilarious moment because it wasn't what we're used to
from you because it was almost like: Let me lay down and take a nap.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: It was a rough one. Definitely a rough one for me personally.
And last minute and 30 seconds, we went 05, I swear I felt like it was five
minutes left in that game and felt like it was taking so long.  
But just to survive a game like that, you know, with us‑‑ the lead was back
and forth and they went up seven and then we went up five. It was a great
game, a great championship game. You don't see it often. But you gotta give
these give these guys a lot of credit. I was 4 for 15, played just as bad as I
could play. Brandon Wood stepped up big. I went out on the bench and I guess
he had 8‑0 run or something, I heard about. So those guys stepped up huge.  
Yesterday we talked about we had to give our guards a lot of credit for this
win. I think this one, you can give our guards a lot of credit, but you can
give our bigs a lot of credit as well.  
Sullinger had 18 points and nine rebounds. He worked for every single rebound
and every point he had. So give these guys a lot of credit. Of course you're
going to see something about Draymond in the paper or something, but me
personally, I know what happened for us to win this game.  
This guy was a huge part of and it the rest of our guys on our roster was a
huge part of it as well, including our guys on the bench bringing energy.
Anthony Ianni constantly staying in my ear, Austin constantly staying in my
ear, which is what gave me the confidence to take that shot with a minute or
whatever it was left and gave me the confidence to knock it down.  
  
Q. Draymond, can you quantify a little bit how emotional this game was on
the court and how much that was because of a week ago? Like how much last week
fed into this game. And then also talk about that last shot and what you saw
in your confidence at that point.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: One thing we always talk about is we never play for revenge at
Michigan State. It's never about getting someone back. They took the last
game. They did screw up some things for us, but it's more so looking ahead.
And we were playing for a No. 1 seed, which we knew that was a possibility.
And we were playing to do something that hasn't been done here since '99,
2000. That's all the motivation we needed.  
We talked about leaving a legacy, leaving our footprint in the sand. Another
one of those teams that you keep stepping your footprint in there and keep
stepping in your foot. Eventually that footprint can grow very huge.  
So I think that was the main thing going into it is we had the opportunity
that something that hasn't been done since Mateen Cleaves' group. And when you
got opportunities like that, you have to really seize the moment. For a
minute, it started slipping away. These guys started stepping up huge and they
got us back in the game and we were able to hold on to it.  
  
Q. Draymond, what impressed you the most about Brandon's game tonight?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: His defense. I'm not impressed by the shots because I know a
he's a shot‑taker and a shot‑maker. We're not impressed by him driving,
getting on the fast break because I know he's athletic enough to finish on a
break.  
I was mostly impressed with his defense, and that's an area Brandon has been
growing in since he got here. We all know Brandon wasn't the best defender at
Valparaiso, but once he got to Michigan State and became one of our lock‑down
defenders.  
You know, you lose a Brandon Dawson, and everybody's worried that William
Buford gonna go off. If I look at the stat sheet, Buford finished with 11
points. He had 10 at half.  
So you gotta give this guy a lot of credit on the way he defended. Not more so
with his offense. We already know what Brandon can do on the offensive end.
Maybe some people are just really seeing what he can, do but we've been doing
that. We see it every day.  
But the way he defended is what kept us in the game. And one thing we always
talk about is Jared is going to score. They go to him every time. He's gonna
score. And if we can contain Thomas and Buford and the rest of those guys, we
can win the game.  
Buford's a great player, so for him to contain Buford like that, I think
that's what won us the game.  
  
Q. Brandon, back in October, you told me you came to Michigan State for big
games, for tournaments, and all of that. It hasn't been an easy road, but now
you're a No. 1 seed. You won your first tournament at Michigan State. Will you
walk us through what you're feeling right now at this moment.  
BRANDON WOOD: Man, it's crazy. I was actually talking to my dad last night
about this, just the whole decision of me choosing to transfer. And we were
talking about how we'd never been a hundred percent sure on a decision. But
it's kind of hard to say this decision wasn't a hundred percent, a positive
decision for me and for my team.  
So it just feels great just to be a part of this group and just to see
personally my hard work pay off and for me to make it to this point. And I
gotta give all the thanks to Coach and Draymond just for believing in me and
accepting me into the program.  
  
Q. Draymond, what does this tournament win do for you guys heading into the
tournament conferencewise?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: You know, it just keeps helping your confidence grow more,
keep growing. But one thing it does, it give us a momentum going into the
tournament. It's not like we're just ecstatic because we beat a good team
because we put ourselves right up there with the Ohio States, with the Dukes,
the North Carolinas, the great teams in the nation.  
So it's not like, ho, hey, we beat a top team. We're ecstatic about that, but
it does give you momentum, and it just shows you different things that you can
do. It also gives guys individually confidence.  
Brandon stepped up in the big game already, so when you need him to step up in
another big game, you can say, hey, you already did it. Not like we're asking
you to do something that you haven't done.  
It's a confidence builder and a momentum builder. And that's really the
biggest thing it was. Of course it helped to get a No. 1 seed.  
  
Q. Draymond and Brandon both, what was going through your minds when you saw
that "1" come up on the screen that you were in fact the one in the last?  
THE MODERATOR: Brandon, please.  
BRANDON WOOD: I kind of knew that we were probably going to get the No. 1 seed
because I watched some shows earlier and they said the winner of the game
would probably get the No. 1 seed. So we were all excited.  
And just to be a part of the tournament for myself, it's something I've always
dreamed of. And to now be a part of that with these guys, it's just a
once‑in‑a‑lifetime opportunity for me. And I'm just proud that we did it on my
one time.  
THE MODERATOR: Draymond.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I can't say I was sure that we were going to get a No. 1 seed.
I thought we'd probably get a 2. But it's a great feeling. It's just another
one of those things that I haven't done in my career. The highest I've been is
a 2 seed, so I think that's just a great thing.  
Oh, Cleaves had a 1 seed before, I think. So I just try to do a lot of stuff
like Mateen Cleaves do, but like I said before, I couldn't have gotten a No. 1
seed in my career if it wasn't for these guys who I've been surrounded by.  
It was just a great feeling to see that No. 1 seed pop up. We always see the
No.1 seeds pop up and the people celebrating, and every year we saw
celebrating, and the camera has never been there to where saw ourselves
celebrating on TV. So it's a great feeling to see yourselves pop up as the No.
1 seed and being able to celebrate it and watch it on TV after the delay.  
  
Q. Draymond, you told me in the hall that on that last 3, you saw the ocean.
What was it that sort of clicked at that moment?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, first off, I shot a 14‑foot‑shot on a 18, from a
18‑footer, I shot it 14 feet. So I know I had to do something to make up for
as bad as I've been playing. But one thing I was just talking with Coach about
back there, everybody's gonna talk about that shot. But nobody's talking about
the pass that Keith gave me. It was right in my pocket. I didn't have to move
the ball an inch. I just caught it and fired it.  
And I know my team is going to come to me when we need a play down the
stretch. And for me to be having the game that I was having, Keith could have
forced it in, he didn't force it in. And then he could've tried to draw, and
he had enough confidence to come to me. And I knew when I caught it I had to
let the shot go. The shot clock was running down.  
But most importantly, I would be less of a leader to not take that shot in the
moment like that. And I knew I had to let it go, and I just tried to shoot it,
keep the textbook form and instead of trying rush it. I knew I had enough size
to get it over Thomas when he came to contest. So I just tried not to change
my shot and just let it go.  
  
Q. Draymond, I want ask you a question that Jim Nantz asked you after the
game on the air. Is this one of the best teams that you've played on or the
best team that you've played on here at Michigan?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I think it is. One thing I talked about is my sophomore year
team was pretty good. We lost Kaylin. We fought through some adversity, but
nobody's crazy. The tournament bracket did play out a strange way for us to
reach a Final Four.  
My freshman year team, I think that team was great. We had every single part
that we needed. We had guys coming off the bench. We had everything. And I
think this year's teams stack up just as well, if not better, with that team,
especially with the adversity that we've fought through. You know, playing
through the top teams the first two games in the nation with five freshmen who
had never played, a transfer who had never played at this level. Me, the only
guy who had averaged over 20 minutes. I thought Keith was right there, over
20, but for the most part, no one had any experience. And the way we just kept
fighting, kept fighting. We lost two in a row. We could've lost a lot of
confidence but we fought through adversity.  
So with the way we fought, I would have to say this is the best team that I've
played on for the simple fact this team constantly fights through everything.
You don't often get a team that fights through every single thing they go up
against. And losing Brandon Dawson, you would think that would have killed us.
He's been the great for this team, but other guys are stepping up, and that's
what we've talked about. So I think this is possibly the best team that I've
played on.  
THE MODERATOR: Last one for these guys.  
  
Q. Fans and media will say, hey, great season, but for you, having been in
that locker room and endured last year ‑‑ and it really wasn't enduring ‑‑
does it make this more special considering what you've fought through?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, one thing we were past this last year. You know, as a
year down in the books, we made it to the NCAA Tournament, kept the streak
alive.  
But this year's been phenomenal. It has nothing to do with last year. Because
I think this year stacks up with the first two years that I was here. Final
Four runs we made.  
This year has just been ecstatic. We love being around each other. We love
being on the court together. This is a team that has showed on the court we
love playing together, so we're able to fight through those things.  
I don't think it's more so about it makes it feel better than last year. This
year feels better than any year I've been at Michigan State, just the way we
love playing together.  
When you can just sit in the locker room for hours after practice, everybody
wanna go home. Been there forever. Been at the gym for probably five hours
with the preparation for practice, getting early shots up, shooting after
practice, you know. And you've been there for so long, and you could sit in
there for hours after practice and just joke around. That shows how much that
we love to be together, and it just makes this year that much more special.  
And we're not done yet. We're not satisfied with a co‑championship and we're
not satisfied with the Big Ten Championship. This year has been ‑‑ this
program has been based around hanging banners. And there's no banner better
than the National Championship banner, and we haven't got that feeling yet, so
that's what we're pushing for.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You may return to the locker room. Good
luck.  
Questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. Tom, you talked last week about an opportunity that you guys weren't able
to come through with, and today was another opportunity that you guys
obviously came up big. What does that say to you about this team, your team,
kind of moving forward, what could be two, three more weeks of play?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I could reiterate what he said, but I'd have to agree with
him without trying to reiterate.  
I keep talking about different opportunities. This is another ten‑year span
we've gone without a championship, not even playing in the game. That's not
really acceptable either. And yet coming off that loss‑‑ and then let's face
it, he did not have one of his better games.  
And I think everybody felt like the only way we can win is withDay‑Day. You
know, the other night he was out for a while with the foul trouble, and today
he was just not characteristic of himself and for no reason. Just not a lack
of prep or lack of effort. He's probably had, you know, in the last 20 games,
a couple of games that way.  
But we still are learning to really guard people. And I think Brandon Wood, we
hold them‑‑ they're showing 50 percent every day. We hold them to 39 and 23
from the 3.  
The only discouraging stat has been our rebounding, and it's hurts with Wood
and it's hurting a little bit with Austin. He just doesn't mix it up like he
could because I think he's come through it a little rough at times.  
But it's really been a good team effort, and this was a big win for us because
it kind of validates maybe that we belong.  
And I even questioned it. I'm not gonna lie to you. I even questioned: Are we
good enough? And if we would have been a 2 seed, I would have completely
understood that, too.  
  
Q. Tom, I'll ask you the same question I asked them. What was going through
your mind when you saw the one come up in the last?  
COACH IZZO: Well, again, I gave up a few years ago thinking that that really
matters. But there is a prestigious point to it for our league and for our
team and for our program.  
And I think players get to leave and say, I was a 1 seed, there's only four of
them each year. That's a little different than, I got in the NCAA Tournament.
And it's kind of a measuring stick, like Final Fours are measuring sticks.  
So I was proud of them. I really was. I was proud of this team. They didn't
have to fight through a lot of adversity as far as any problems. In fact, I'm
not sure I had any yet. I think I missed curfew tonight just so I'll have one
myself.  
But we did have to battle that stuff schedule, and I think one of the reasons
we got a 1 seed is we played everybody. And I looked at that list, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, you know. I remember telling people, Lehigh is pretty good. And
everybody kind of laughed and they're in the tournament.  
So that's what makes me feel good about it. The system that we developed,
Day‑Day just said, you know, you been here before. Glad we played all those
tough teams.  
And every once in a while, as you know, I slap my own face on that. But I felt
good about it.  
  
Q. If I would have told you two weeks ago or even three weeks ago that
Brandon Wood would be talking about most important thing in the world to him
is defense, you probably would have said I was on drugs. But we both would
agree he demonstrated that today. Would you talk about his maturation,
please.  
COACH IZZO: I think my assistant video coordinator, Doug Herner, said to me
after, you know, this might be one of your great success stories because it
happened in such a short period of time. He'd only been on campus, what, seven
months. I mean, Day‑Day said it. So as long the players said it, I can really
say it.  
I don't think Brandon was noted for his defense, and when Brandon Dawson went
down, we really spent some time talking to him and telling him and pushing him
and pulling him. And he has improved. He's improved. He had stretches where he
played better, but he's now becoming a consistent defender.  
And the other thing that he's been more consistent on, he wasn't running his
lanes. Our fast break just was not a good fast break. So it shouldn't be a
surprise to me. Just like I say about some of those other guys like a Byrd.
It's going to take some time for guys.  
Brandon Wood, when you look at it, has probably done an incredible job of
gaining the system, playing in these big games. You can tell that he's from a
little smarter level, yeah, I thought we'd be a one seed, like you pick it off
a tree or something, you know. So he has come a long way, and his defense has
been real good in his last couple games.  
  
Q. Tom, back in January, I guess, in Ann Arbor, Wood maybe didnt handle the
moment and the pressure offensively, kind of getting away from his defense.
You come to this day of all that pressure out there all that intensity and a
physical game and he shows maybe what you saw back in the summer.  
COACH IZZO: Yeah. You know, and I'm looking at Draymond. I was trying to
figure out a way to give him credit because he deserves it. But I told him we
gotta speed this process up when we got him. That's when Day‑Day said you can
live with me, kind of takes him in, finds a three‑bedroom instead of a
two‑bedroom. Not many guys that will do that.  
And getting the break going in helped Brandon Wood, and yet Brandon Wood was
part of reason the break wasn't good because I'm not guarding well enough. We
were all taking the ball out of the basket enough and then not running that
lane. And now he's starting to put it all together, and App has been pushing
it harder, outlets have been better.  
If we getting our rebounding back on track here‑‑ and I'm not sure we will
with some of the people we've got, but if we can get that going a little bit,
I think we can get our running game going even more, and that will help this
team.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask Draymond about how last week impacted the feeling out
there. It had kind of an epic feel to it from the get ‑go. Did it feel that
way to you, and do you think that carried over?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think they were two teams that were pretty evenly matched.
I made no bones about it. I think Ohio State has got a very talented group. I
think there's two, three rows on that team, and that doesn't take nothing away
from them, meaning they should win because of that.  
But I just felt like we did a lot of things that you needed to do to take away
some of their strengths. They did some things to take away ours. We could not
penetrate on Craft. He's really good at it. Knocked a lot of balls loose.  
But that was an epic battle. I mean, that was two heavyweights going at it. I
think what makes me feel good is we're standing toe to toe with most people
we're playing right now. And I don't know how far that can take us. I mean, I
wouldn't look at us as the most talented one or two seed, but I'd look at us
one of the better team one or two seeds there is out there.  
  
Q. Coach, when Draymond was talking, you kind of sat there and nodded your
head to some of the stuff that he says. Talk about your relationship with him,
and where does he rank in terms of the players that you've coached in terms of
players smarts?  
COACH IZZO: Draymond has done a lot for me. And a lot of times coaches do a
lot for players. And a good deal, as my old coach used to say, is good deal
for you and a good deal for me. It's not usually one way. And if it's a real
good deal, it's a special relationship. I look at some of the guys I've had
that with. I helped them and they helped me.  
And Draymond can say what he wants because when we talked this summer, I don't
think we were talking about one seeds or not even winning the Big Ten
Championship. I don't think we were talking about him being player of the
year. We were talking about getting better, getting better, getting better.
And I think we both pushed each other. And that's what's cool when you have
that.  
Because he said it, and he's right. I want the things for him that I've been
able to go through myself. I think we all do that with our kids. You always
want your kids to have it better than you had it. I want him to have more than
I've had. And I've had a lot here, so he's got his work cut out for him, and
we'll see how good he is in the next three weeks.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm from Columbus. Any particular thought on playing in Big Ten
country, and what kind of following will you have in Central Ohio?  
COACH IZZO: I think it will be good. We've had a lot of Ohio players. I think
Ohio State, the people there will pull for us. I think we have a good
relationship with them.  
It reminds me when we went to St.Louis in Illinois was there, and I think for
the most part all Big Ten teams pull for one another except you've got those
one or two rivalries that are off the charts, as you would know even better.  
But I think our fans‑‑ it's a three and a half, three and 40‑minute drive, and
a lot of people from Detroit, it's even less. I think we'll get a lot of fans
down there. If it's anything like here, it's about the same distance, I think,
even a little shorter. So I'm looking forward to it I've been in that arena a
couple times for a hockey event when our former‑‑ well, he passed away now,
McConnell, the former owner of them. And great place. I'm looking forward to
it.  
  
Q. John, when you came out to watch the warmups, if someone had told you
today they would be 4 for 15 and you'd get  
out‑rebounded 43 to 30 and you'd win, what would you have said?  
COACH IZZO: I'd say we would lose. Because those two things have been pretty
much staples for us now. If we did a better job of them, maybe we'd get credit
for it. With all those offensive rebounds they had, the second‑chance points
for 15 and 11, so we didn't get killed on that. And, still, the ones they did
make, I mean, that would even have made our defense better.  
I thought our defense was really good, and our 3‑point defense was really,
really good. And that's what you gotta live and die with. How many times do
you hear coaches tell players your offense isn't always going to be there, and
players say, oh, you're full of it and, shazaam, it happened.  
They did play pretty good defense. Thomas has been play awfully well, and to
hold him to 11 points and 6 rebounds was a great effort.  
But I'll close by saying Ohio State is still every bit as good. I think they
can make a run in this tournament, a big run. I think there's a lot of Big Ten
teams that can. I don't think there's anybody or very many teams that are that
much better than rest, unfortunately. A lot of us aren't that much better than
the others either. So it should be a heck of a tournament just like it was a
heck of a league race, and I'm hoping our defense and our togetherness and our
camaraderie and our staff as far as knowing what do in the NCAA Tournament can
make a difference. We'll see if we can make a run. Thanks a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  68  
Ohio State  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from Coach Matta, then go to
questions for Aaron and Jared. Coach?  
COACH MATTA: Well, this game came down it, as we thought it, would making big
plays. Like last Sunday, we made the plays, we made the shots. Today they did.
And it was a back‑and‑forth battle. The 10‑0 run they had on us when we got it
up to 7 was a big key.  
But we gotta pick ourselves up. I told the guys, we gotta pick ourselves up;
we gotta get back to playing our best basketball. When we take the Court next
time, we take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Aaron, you had a ‑‑ sat during in the two Michigan State games during the
regular season. How frustrating was it to have to go to the bench after
picking up those two quick fouls in the second half?  
AARON CRAFT: Definitely frustrating. You want to play in big games like this.
Just try to keep my head. We have‑‑ Shannon's a very capable person to go in
there and perform when we need him to do. Just tried to stay as positive as
possible with those guys. Unfortunately enough, we didn't come finish it up.  
  
Q. Jared, you're disappointed now. Do you feel like you played well this
weekend, though, that you guys are clicking now that the games really count?  
JARED SULLINGER: Yeah, we are. We just didn't execute this game and we didn't
play to our best ability this game, but fortunately, we have another day of
practice. Now we're going into a tournament where it's just won and done. You
don't know what's going to happen the next day so you just gotta give it your
all.  
  
Q. Jared, compared to the first two games against Michigan State, was this
game more physical, as physical? And did they let you guys play today more
than they did the first two games?  
JARED SULLINGER: A little bit of both times. There's times when they let us
play, times when they didn't let us play, but I mean, that's the life of the
Big Ten, like I always say, but we just gotta move forward and focus on the
NCAA Tournament to find out where we're going.  
THE MODERATOR: Additional questions for student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Jared, it seemed like Michigan State did a good job playing physical.
Like you just mentioned, sometimes they'll let you play, sometimes they
didn't. You had yourself a pretty good game, scored 18 points. It seemed like
the rest of the guys maybe struggled more or less with that. Could you talk
about overall how team played through that physicality and whether that was
something that was affecting the shots not going down.  
JARED SULLINGER: We knew it was going to come in and play physical, so it
really wasn't no brain shocker. So we just didn't execute, like I said, and
now we just move forward and put this game in the past.  
If we keep thinking about this game and move on, lose track of what's really
the main goal is to win the national championship, so we just gotta focus on
that and one game at a time.  
  
Q. Aaron, a little bit off of what Jared just said about putting this behind
you quickly. You've won one of these things last year, and now you've lost one
in the final game. Does it hurt as bad losing as it feels good winning? Or if
you lose this thing, you've still got the NCAA Tournament to look forward
to?  
AARON CRAFT: We're all competitors, and you never like losing basketball
games, especially when it comes down to the wire like that. And I think we're
going to go back and look and see that they were various things throughout the
game that we could have done better to hopefully change the outcome.  
But like Jared said, we still have to come back and find a way to get better
and find a way to continue to be a better basketball team tomorrow. And by the
time we get to our next game, hopefully we are a better basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: One more for these guys.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, do you have a preference where you go in the NCAA
Tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Aaron.  
AARON CRAFT: I don't even know the possibilities, to be honest. We've tried to
focus as much as we can on one game at a time. So after this, we'll see where
it goes, and hopefully we can‑‑ once again, it's about us and not where we
have to go. It's about finding a way to make ourselves a better basketball
team.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thank you. You may return to the locker room. Good luck
in the NCAA Tournament.  
Questions for Coach Matta?  
  
Q. Coach, Brandon Wood comes out of the horizon and does what he does today
on the big stage. Can you talk about how important he was in this game
today?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah. Very similar to the kid, young man we had, Ron Lewis who
came out of Bowling Green. He was on it today, making shots, and that's what
he's known for. Happy for him that he has an opportunity to play in this game.
And he was feeling it from behind the line there and hit some difficult shots.
We didn't get matched up quite as quickly as we needed to.  
  
Q. Thad, you mentioned about this game was another case of which team made
plays, and Jared mentioned that you guys didn't execute. What did Michigan
State maybe do to take you out of what you wanted to do compared to last
Sunday?  
COACH MATTA: You know, to be honest, it almost goes back to Game 1. Down the
stretch there, we had some what appeared to be good looks, and you needed to
make those where you look Draymond Green hit that big 3. Deshaun was right
there on the challenge and it goes in. He made an incredible pass on the end
of the shot clock. The one time, it was like a spectacular play where they
shoot it over the head and it goes in.  
That was kind of the plays‑‑ we had the ball on the rim a couple times. You
thought they were going down, and we missed a couple free‑throws where it
could have shifted the momentum for us, and we just we didn't get it done.  
  
Q. Coach, this game, the atmosphere kind of felt almost like a regional
final at times, an NCAA Tournament. How do you go about making sure that the
team is able to put this behind them quickly and it doesn't detract from the
progress that they've made over the past couple weeks?  
COACH MATTA: We talked a little bit about that, and I think that being in this
game the last four years, in six of the eight years wave been at Ohio State,
you have to take and you have to learn.  
We lost this game three years ago, Will's freshman year. In the NCAA
Tournament, we got beat in double overtime in the first round in the
eight‑nine game.  
So looking and saying, okay, let's put this behind us, you know, these guys
have to clearly understand from this point on what's at stake. One bad half,
we learned that last year against Kentucky.  
So getting them prepared and, more importantly, understanding the focus we
have to have every time we take the court, be it practice, walk‑through, film
session, whatever game, we have to have the mentality of we have to play our
best basketball. There's no excuses.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about how Jared played this weekend. Had a lot
of energy, played pretty well, got tired today. But you think you have the
right Jared at the right time?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, absolutely. I think that leading into this, Jared probably
had his three best practices of the year. And that was‑‑ I knew he was going
to play well.  
So we've got to continue to get him rested, get his body taken care of, and
that's the hard part when you play three games in three days here and thinking
you could be playing in, what, three days or four days or whatever it is
again.  
  
Q. We've made light of Deshaun's defense, but I would think you'd be pretty
impressed with how he played today with Green.  
COACH MATTA: You know, I thought Deshaun did a good job. You look at all the
times they went to him and it was kind of exclusive from the standpoint of
every time down, they were kind of making sure he got a touch or something ran
through him.  
But there was a couple times we didn't rotate the way we were supposed to, he
had his feet where they needed to be, but we didn't give the help. Aaron did a
really good job in the first half, and we probably locked on our guys a little
bit too much. But honestly, that's what a great player does. He scares you
because he can not only score, but he can pass it.  
THE MODERATOR: Last one right here.  
  
Q. Back to the missed chances, Jared and Deshaun were so dominant inside in
your first two wins here. They had more trouble, it seemed like there were a
lot more bodies between them and the basket today when they were in close. Is
that just indicative of how Michigan State plays defense?  
COACH MATTA: You know, it is, yeah. And the physicality of what was going on
down there, quite honestly, we didn't see that in the first two games.  
And there was banging, there was walking through on the shots. It's been that
way the whole season, so there was no surprises there as Jared alluded to.  
But their size, and Payne was‑‑ blocked a couple shots and really, really did
a nice job there.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck.  
COACH MATTA: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2012

  

### [Draymond Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20678)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Austin Thornton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23442)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  65  
Wisconsin  52

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have the coach make an opening statement, and then we'll
take questions for the players.  
COACH IZZO: Bizarre game. Never felt comfortable and yet we played awfully
well. Probably 30‑some minutes, maybe some of the best basketball we've
played. Struggled early.  
Give them credit. They played some plays, and I didn't think we did, but some
of that was them. And other than that one run they had, I thought we played
very, very well. We rebounded the ball pretty well, at least one guy did. We
shot the ball extremely well. When you can shoot 50 percent against Wisconsin,
that says a lot. And the 66 and the 3 is something we haven't done, but we
didn't take that many of them either.  
So I was ecstatic about the win. It's been 11 years, I think, since we've been
in this championship game, and I'm going to try to enjoy this part of it.  
THE MODERATOR: (Off microphone.)  
  
Q. Draymond, over to your right. This might a little bit simple, but do you
guys win this game without Austin and Wood sparking you as they did in the
first half to turn that deficit around?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: No, definitely not. Especially when Austin came on to play, he
did what a leader does. One of us was down, and I've been saying all year, a
lot of the credit came towards me, but this team wouldn't be where it's at
without Austin. I've always said we complement each other so well. I'm kind of
a guy who's up front and all that and Austin is just behind the scenes, does
the work. And today everybody saw what he was capable of doing when I started
off the game struggling very bad.  
He hit a few big 3s and got us back in the game. And then from there on, we
were all able to pick it up. But the way him and Brandan played, that was
phenomenal.  
Give Keith a lot of credit as well. That guy has been playing great. With the
assists he's been getting and not turning the ball over, I think that was
phenomenal as well.  
So a lot of our wins has been based around our bigs this year, but I think you
have to give a lot credit, and you got give this one to the guards because
they really carried this team today.  
  
Q. Austin, can you talk about the job Tom did today. Obviously you guys came
out, you were a little bit sluggish when he called that timeout. Maybe talk
about what he does. Sometimes it's not even adjustments, just things he
says.  
AUSTIN THORNTON: Yeah, he did a great job. He felt that we were a little bit
lethargic there at the beginning and it showed in our play. And he's a
spitfire. He got us going. He did his job. And we responded well and glad we
came out with the W.  
  
Q. Austin, how foreign is it for this team to have Draymond struggling like
that and have to have other guys step up in this kind of situation?  
AUSTIN THORNTON: Well, that's what makes this team as special as we are,
because there's been times all year long where guys haven't been playing as
well or guys have gone down with injuries or guys have gone down with injuries
or guys haven't played as much, and other guys have stepped up and increased
their roles.  
So that's why being a part of this group has been a lot of fun. That's what a
team is supposed to do. That's why we play a team game. And it was just a
great job by our guys stepping up and playing plays there.  
  
Q. Draymond, as it gets to their making the run to get back to about 46 ‑50
and you're at the free‑throw line, you missed the first free throw and Austin
came up behind you and said something right there. Can you talk about that
exchange, and then also, the shot to make it 49‑40 coming out of the timeout
how important that was?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I'm happy somebody is finally noticing what Austin does.
He does a lot. He came up to me, he said, "Hey, you're a big‑time player. Just
focus, calm down, and knock the shots down."  
And I think I still missed it, but he stuck with me through a time. Austin's
dropping in my head about missing a free throw, he's right there. He's, "Okay,
you're gonna make the next one." I came back, hit a few after that.  
So it just goes to show the type of leadership that he has. Like I been saying
all year, so underrated, but then, like I said, I get a lot of credit for it,
but this guy does so much for this team and for me personally. He just always
makes me keep my head and not necessarily keep my head but keep me positive,
because when you're struggling like I struggled, you tend to get down on
yourself. But one thing he says, you rebound the ball, keep going off that,
keep working on those shots are going to fall, the free throws are going to
fall.  
So I think he did a great job of helping me out and did a great job of helping
himself out as well.  
  
Q. Austin, Rob Wilson, obviously had a big game from yesterday with 30
points and seven 3s. What did you guys do today to limit his looks?  
AUSTIN THORNTON: Well, it's pretty simple. Don't let him get any shots off. We
were able to get in the gaps and help and recover pretty quickly on him.  
Give him a lot of credit. Yesterday was, for him to come out and do what he
did, was a special game for him, special game for the other team. But we
didn't want him to do it to us, so we wanted to limit his touches and limit
his shot attempts.  
  
Q. Draymond, I recognize you're not a bracketologist, but do you think
tomorrow you're playing for No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament? And if you are,
does that matter to you guys, the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, you know, the way this conference has gone, in my
opinion, it's been the best conference in the nation all year. So you would
probably think that there's a possibility that you are playing for a No. 1
seed whoever wins this next game. I mean, whoever wins that championship game,
probably playing for a No. 1 seed. So no, but we would love to get a No. 1
seed because one thing we always talk about, leaving your own legacy, doing
something that hasn't been done here in a long time.  
I think the last time we had a No. 1 seed was 2001 or something like that. So
it's just another one of those footprints you can leave in the sand.  
But at the end of the day, those things will take care of themselves; we just
have to focus one game at a time. Tomorrow's going to be a tough and critical
game, regardless of who we're going to play. Both teams are very good and,
like, you can tell how good this league is. For the first time ever, one, two,
three, four is in the semifinals, so it's going to be a tough game regardless.  
And you can't go in looking for a No. 1 seed because, if you do, it's not
going to happen. You just gotta go in trying to win a Big Ten championship.
One thing we pride ourselves on is hanging banners, and that'll be another
opportunity to hang one.  
  
Q. Draymond, kind of getting back to ‑‑ over to your right‑‑ to Austin's
comments about defending Rob Wilson. This is the third game you played
Wisconsin this year. All three games, they haven't been able to get open looks
and made shots poorly. What in general has been the key to your defensive
success against these guys?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I think when we played Wisconsin and everybody else, but
really Wisconsin, they shot a lot of 3s. And Coach, one thing that our
coaching staff with Coach really hits on is stopping them from shooting 3s.
They're gonna beat you from the 3‑point line, and one thing we always talk
about is Taylor penetrating in. Majority of the time today he didn't, but
majority of the time, when he's penetrating in, he's looking to kick off with
those shooters. So we try to tell our wings and guards to stay home, stay on
those shooters.  
And you gotta give 'em a lot of credit. They played very tough and trailing
those pin‑downs, they were all on their hip. And you also have to give our
bigs, Adreian and Derrick, a lot of credit because when our guards were behind
a little bit, they were right there stopping the curl and not letting those
guys get open jump shotters.  
It was a complete team effort, but like I said before, gotta give this game to
the guards because they did a great job essentially carrying this team and
they also did a great job defensively, stopping those guards and wings from
getting 3s.  
  
Q. Draymond, as Coach alluded to, this is your first trip to the Big Ten
Tournament. What makes this tournament so much more challenging compared to
the NCAA Tournament where you guys have had so much success?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I'm not sure. It's just sometimes that's the way the cards are
dealt. You're sometimes not successful at some things, but a lot of people
always say Coach Izzo takes off the Big Ten Tournament to get ready for the
NCAA Tournament. That's such a myth.  
But, I mean, I think one thing that this team has really done is the focus
level. And then a lot of things people don't remember is‑‑ I think it was
2007, one of those years where Wisconsin came and knocked us off and we were
on our way to a championship. So it's just different things that take place.
And like I said before, sometimes that's the way the cards are dealt.  
But one thing we really talked about with this group is really focusing in and
trying to get wins because it's something hasn't been done here in a long
time. And when you talk about leaving the footprint in the sand, it just
another way to get it done.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. Coach, any thoughts on last week's Ohio State game, any reference of who
you play tomorrow? You had them down 24 ‑9 as I recall.   
COACH IZZO: You know, I really don't care, and I probably wouldn't say if I
did, just because I got our arch arrival, one, and I got a game that cost us
the Big Ten championship out right in the other. So can't say I'm in love with
either group as far as I got motivation for both, but I'm sure they feel the
same way.  
And I respect both teams a lot, both coaches. Michigan had a heck of a
comeback last night, really did, and played well. And Ohio State played really
well last night.  
But as those guys said, sometimes it's all about match‑ups. A lot of years we
didn't match up good with Wisconsin. I think what made me feel good today is I
didn't know if was one of those years losing Dawson because they were big, you
know. But they had a cover us, too, and maybe that was a problem the other
way.  
  
Q. Does this team resemble some of your better teams in that you can play
completely different style of teams and be comfortable it like you did
yesterday?  
COACH IZZO: I'd say yes, but I'd almost have to say no. With D.J., I thought
we really were like that. Now we just have some lineups out there today that I
didn't know who to go to. And the advantage, I think, that we haven't had here
in a lot of years is when I don't know who to go, we got Trice and maybe App
and Brandan Kearney, so we're really young on the perimeter a couple times,
then we said let's get the ball inside.  
So maybe not with players, but as far as with plays, we can run. We can go
inside; we can go outside. And I still think key of the game was we got a
running game going after that bad start. And Appling can push it and we can
run, but Wisconsin's not an easy team to run against.  
  
Q. Coach, what's it takes to beat a Bo Ryan ‑coached team three times in one
year?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it's almost impossible. He's probability beaten us‑‑ I know
he's beaten us more than anybody that we've played. He's had our number, and
still does in a lot of ways.  
But, you know, I think like us this year, they've had a heck of a year, too.
They lost some key people; we lost some key people. And for some reason, we've
been able to check pretty good against them, and yet we've been able to check
pretty good against a lot of people this year, and that's probably the
difference, because they run their stuff. They run it well; they're well
coached.  
I think the only thing we had an advantage of is, one, getting it inside and,
two, our fast breaks. So those two things helped us a lot this year.  
  
Q. Tom, the stretch in the second half where you were a little bit ragged on
the edge ‑‑ it just cut off. Sorry. You could hear, we could hear from the
court Austin yelling to take care of the ball. And we heard him several times
today kind of yelling out, directing certain things. And then after that, I
think that third 3 where he pumped his fist, I'm not sure I've seen him show
that kind of emotion all season. What was going on with him today?  
COACH IZZO: He was well possessed, which was good, but we didn't take care of
it very good. I should've probably got Trice in there more. I had some strange
lineups and they did struggle. The guy's been so consistent since the Illinois
game, which was back in the middle of January. The guy's been as consistent as
anybody in the country. And he made some uncharacteristic bad passes and I
think let things get to him, and thank goodness he keep rebounding.  
But we didn't take care of the ball very good. We only had 12 turnovers, but
we didn't do a very good job of that. And I think for the most part, we were
pretty consistent other than that one stretch. And Kearn threw that one
lay‑up, then we threw the one Wood lay‑up. We just didn't have maybe our best
ball‑handling team in there.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had some real players step up and play some key roles
during this tournament. Does that kind of remind you of the 2000 team when
your guys like Chapelle and Granger kind of step up with big times?  
COACH IZZO: It does. But those four or five pros we had on that team, they're
absent right now. So the step‑up guys might be doing a pretty good job, but it
was the original guys that are a lot different.  
But you are right. Hey, Kearney came in and did a pretty good job defensively
today. And Nix is‑‑ he's a sixth man of the year candidate, or was, because
he's done some pretty good things for us. And Trice, who played pretty well
yesterday, just didn't get as many reps because of their bigger lineup. It was
a real problem. They post their guards a lot, and that's what we missed in
Brandon Dawson?  
But we are getting some more play out of more guys. Hey, Russell Byrd, those
were four, five good minutes that he played today for us. So we're starting to
get a little comfortable with more and more guys. And if Russell could keep
coming now next week, that gives us another weapon. Trust me. Another weapon.  
  
Q. Coach, with Rob Wilson hitting so many big 3s yesterday against IU, was
there any special kind of game plan today to kind of take him out of the
offensive equation?  
COACH IZZO: I feel good for Bo but bad for Tom Crean because here's a guy
averaging three points a game and he has 30. There's where‑‑ Jarrod would have
killed me and said the scouting report was bad or something.  
But we did put a little more emphasis on a couple things. We had our
walk‑throughs and walk‑throughs and walk‑throughs, and every time he touched
the ball we wanted somebody's toes on his toes.  
And that's respect. That's respect for what he did. And I thought for the most
part we did a lot of that. We did a pretty good job of it.  
So we weren't great today, but at moments we played really well. It's the
consistency now that I think we have to keep building on. And you don't have
those runs against us. And it's happened a few times this year. And so we
gotta do a better job of that. But it was a big win for us against a very good
team, and I can't tell you how excited I am to be in the championship game no
matter who we play. We'll play the Pacers. I don't care. Anybody. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH IZZO: Thanks a lot.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Ryan Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23443)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

### [Jordan Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20658)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  65  
Wisconsin  52

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Ryan make an opening statement and then have
questions for Ryan and Jordan. Coach?  
COACH RYAN: We'll just go to questions for the guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Jordan, for three games now you guys have not shot the ball well against
them. I'm curious, in your mind, what is it they've done in those three games
to not give you guys good looks?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: They're good defensive team. They do that to a lot of teams.
But we didn't do a very good job moving without the ball and some other
things. And me, myself forced a lot, especially there late. But they're a good
defensive team. We just have to try and correct that for the tournament.  
  
Q. Jordan and Ryan, you guys were up 11. It looked like you kind of had
things going your way and all of a sudden you look up and you're down 19. What
happened?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, start with you, please.  
JORDAN TAYLOR: They just outworked us for that, whatever time span that they
took that lead, and they were doing things we weren't and they were doing it
the right way and it just got away from us.  
THE MODERATOR: Ryan?  
RYAN EVANS: They made a run just like last game we played them, and it really
hurt us, especially going to the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. For either guys, Rob Wilson had such a standout game yesterday. Was there
anything Michigan State was doing to limit his touches today?  
THE MODERATOR: Ryan?  
RYAN EVANS: I don't think so. I think he had a good looks. He just wasn't able
to knock them down this game, but hopefully he still has that confidence going
into the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student‑athletes? Okay. Questions
for Coach Ryan?  
  
Q. Rob played 32 minutes today, a season high. How important is it for your
players to know that if they play well, you're going to reward them with more
minutes?  
COACH RYAN: Our guys have known that for a long time. We chart every drill in
practice, every possession. Guys know they're shooting. Our guys had shooting
percentages kept on them, assisted turnover ratio. We compile every stat,
every drill, every practice. So our guys know, even before you see it in game,
if they're getting things done in practice, they get to play. So it's not
anything different.  
But Rob with that confidence and then plus maybe a couple other guys are
struggling a little bit so he gets to take his minutes plus somebody else's.
Will that be the same in the NCAA tournament? I don't know. But I'm an equal
opportunity guy. If you're getting things done, you get on the floor. And you
can stay.  
But he didn't have as many looks. There's no question. Ryan was being kind.
He's a good teammate in his answer. He'll be governor of Arizona one day.  
But Michigan State did a great job of not giving him those looks. Just like we
try not to give guys looks. Everybody tries. Sometimes you're more successful
than others.  
  
Q. Bo, after the strong start, Nix got him going. He had seven points right
in a row and then Thornton hit the three 3s. How much did that hit mean as far
as turning momentum?  
COACH RYAN: The three 3s really hurt because there were a couple things that
we didn't do according to our rules. So some teams make you pay more than
others if you don't stick to your reads on defense. People talk about reads on
offense. I like to talk about on defense. It's the same thing.  
So we missed a couple assignments. We didn't do what we were‑‑ what we talked
about in the scouting report as a unit, so we paid.  
You know, these guys, that was a hard‑fought game yesterday. It was a
hard‑fought game today. That 13‑zip run in the second half showed me something
about our guys. I don't know what we had left. Michigan State obviously had
more. But there were some runs in that game where‑‑ more so than usual. I
mean, as far as‑‑ I don't know how many times Michigan State has had a team
score 13 straight, and I don't know how many times we have, but I don't know‑‑
what was their largest where they scored X number of points in a row? You guys
always have those stats somewhere.  
What did they get? 12? 15? There was a run they went on, too, from 9 to 18. At
least nine straight. Was there more than one run like that?  
When you're playing from behind‑‑ like Jordan said about shooting percentages
sometimes. You're playing from behind. Are they a little tougher shots, are
they‑‑ are your feet not set? Are you rushing?  
Percentages do tend to go down overall. You might hit one streak like we did,
but after that, trying to not get separation the way we normally do or not
finish on a shot, you gotta do that. We get it to six and we're right there,
but we didn't have enough after that.  
  
Q. Coach Ryan, you said today you all didn't get the looks. What do you have
to do to get the looks ‑‑  
COACH RYAN: No, I said Rob didn't.  
  
Q. What did Rob have to do to get the looks.  
COACH RYAN: Well, nothing else. I mean, just we tried to limit looks of other
guys. And if you ask them what do you have to do to get better looks against
Wisconsin or‑‑ there's other guys on the team that can score. It's not like
they did anything out of the ordinary to any one particular guy.  
But you gotta be opportunistic when you get them. You gotta make 'em if you
expect to compete. You don't have to make all of 'em. But you gotta go a
little bit better than the guy that won the batting crown batting 347. You
can't, in basketball, get $800 million as a baseball player hitting that
number. Basketball players, it's got to be a little higher percentage.  
I don't know. What did the American League batting champion hit this year?
Three something. You gotta shoot better than that. And we have some guys that
didn't score. We need it from everybody. We need bunches scoring. And when we
get that, we've proven 24 times we can get some things done.  
  
Q. Coach, you had that double ‑digit lead on the Spartans early in the first
half. How did your coaching strategy change as the game develops and you start
to lose that lead and then it becomes a deficit?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I tell my guys in the huddle, make your shots and don't let
the other team score. That's all you can do. If a guy didn't hedge this way or
if we didn't stop this‑‑ you can't go possession by possession and say, okay,
this is what you have to do.  
Defense is reading and reacting. Block out. Don't give up. I don't know how
many offensive reboundsI thought we did a heck of a job on. I guess I was
right for once.  
But we did a heck of a job on them on the glass. They're one of the best
offensive rebounding teams in the country and they get 6, we get 10. I thought
we were opportunistic there.  
But we couldn't get the put‑backs. We didn't finish when we did get the
offensive rebound, as much as we would have liked to. There were some things
in this game we did well, but when you see a score you say, ah, you got
kicked. But as coaches, we break it down. We've got some work to do. Hey, but
we get to play again somewhere.  
  
Q. Coach, Rob's confidence definitely seemed to go down as the game wore on,
dwindle as the game went on today. His shoulders started to slump a little
bit. Why keep him in?  
COACH RYAN: I didn't see that. That's your interpretation. And I'll play the
guys I want to play and turn 'em loose.  
If you look at his posture, he's not‑‑ to physically attack somebody that way
is not, I think, a good thing to do when his posture really‑‑ not everybody
stands straight up with their shoulders back. And when you're playing, some
guys get down a little more. I don't agree with your comment.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2012

  

### [Aaron Craft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21919)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Deshaun Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23455)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  77  
Michigan  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Matta make an opening statement, then go to
questions for Aaron and Deshaun. Coach?  
COACH MATTA: Well, this game definitely was about our defense. I thought that
we had great activity on the ball, off the ball. Our ball screen defense was
good. Our bigs were extremely active. I thought we had great communication.
Challenging shots. Offensively, we got off to great start. The ball was moving
and we were able to maintain. Knew Michigan was going to run at us, and these
guys countered. I thought the start to the second half was really, really big
nor us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Aaron, what do you have to be most conscious of when you're guarding Trey
Burke, and what were you trying to do against him? And based on his
performance last night, was it kind of a personal challenge to take it on
today?  
AARON CRAFT: A little bit. But stopping a great player like him, especially
with how he was feeling from yesterday, it was definitely a team effort
tonight. And just trying to not make it about me against him because that's
not what it's about. And our bigs did a great job hedging ball screens today
and everyone else did a good job of zoning up and not giving easy baskets for
the most part.  
So it was definitely a team effort on him today much. He's a great player, but
fortunately enough today, he didn't make too many shots.  
  
Q. Aaron, after the way that ‑‑ I guess it took 30‑odd minutes last night
before you guys turned the game in your favor. How much of today did you talk
about right off the jump just pouncing on them and, as you guys like to say,
step on their throats and not give them any hope?  
AARON CRAFT: I don't think we're that mean. But, no, I think we started off
well yesterday also, and that was was just what we wanted to come in to do
today. Be the aggressor and don't try to just feel our way through the game
and see‑‑ and have all these other things kind of get in our minds.  
We came in with a good game plan and we were able to execute it today, and
fortunately enough we were able to do it for majority of the game. That helped
us out.  
  
Q. For Deshaun. Over the last seven or eight games, you've played it seems
some of you best basketball, averaging right around 20 points a game. You had
two 22 ‑point games here in Indianapolis. Just what's really come together for
you here the last three weeks or so?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Really, just working hard and listening to Coach, you know,
and listening to my teammates. A great leader, Craft, and just coming in with
my mind right and just be ready to play and take my pride on defense because I
know the defense brings offense. And we always preach that, and so I'll just
take pride and that and just try to come in and just play as hard a I can.  
  
Q. Deshaun, building off that question on your offense, you're one of three
guys on this team averaging at least 15. No one else is in double figures. How
do you avoid putting pressure on yourself you create as an offensive player
and get your points?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: I mean, just we're a team. We got many guys who can score. One
day I'll be hot, Will, or Craft. So I just try togo to the offensive glass to
get easy baskets, and don't‑‑ try not to throw a bad shots and just do the
little things. Get the extra rebounds and extra kick outs and get it back
inside.  
  
Q. This is for Aaron and Deshaun. The team has Michigan State tomorrow. Is
that a match up that you and your teammates have been looking forward to and
‑‑ yeah, if you could just address that?   
THE MODERATOR: Aaron, start with you, please.  
AARON CRAFT: I think your organization. But, yeah, they're a great basketball
team and that's the type of basketball teams you want to play this time of
year and we split during the regular season. So we need to get some rest
tonight, figure out what we need to do for tomorrow and just try to come out
and execute and play good basketball and see where it goes from there.  
THE MODERATOR: Deshaun.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Well, they're a great team. We know it's going to be a battle,
and we just want come in and try to hit them first, like we've been doing for
these last two games.  
  
Q. For both players. You guys have a chance to win your third straight
tournament title tomorrow. What's it say about where this program is if you
can win that title tomorrow?  
THE MODERATOR: Deshaun, start with you this time.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: It's going to be history, coming in, trying to win another
title, three titles in a row. It's going to be special for us and the program
at Ohio State.  
THE MODERATOR: Aaron.  
AARON CRAFT: I just think it goes to show the type of coach that we have and
his ability to have his teams ready to go and be successful at this point in
the year.  
So with that said, it's definitely not going to be given to us tomorrow, so we
need to come in and hopefully just try to continue to play our best basketball
and see where it goes from there.  
  
Q. For both you guys, given the quality of the league this year, does
tomorrow's winner deserve a No. 1 seed and something that's important to you
guys?  
THE MODERATOR: Aaron.  
AARON CRAFT: The Big Ten is a really tough conference. Every team you play,
you have the chance to lose if you're not ready to go. So but as for the NCAA
Tournament, that's not something that we're‑‑ we're not worrying about right,
we haven't talked about much either as a team or with the coaching staff.  
Right now our focus is on Michigan State tomorrow and what we have to do to be
successful in that game.  
THE MODERATOR: Deshaun, do you want to add anything?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Well, like Craft said, we're not worried about it right now.
We worry about Michigan State and getting the Big Ten title.  
  
Q. For both players. Between yesterday and today, this looked like the Ohio
State team that a lot of folks anticipated. What's been the key to this late
surge and how do you all maintain this?  
THE MODERATOR: Deshaun, back to you.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Just coming in being ready, staying focused, getting the rest
we need. Because you know it's going to be a big game tomorrow, and just, like
I said, listen to Coach and reading the scout report real well and just coming
in ready.  
THE MODERATOR: Aaron.  
AARON CRAFT: Yeah, just understanding it's a team game. We play our best
basketball and we don't rely on one person to try to score a lot of points.
And we're playing great on the defensive end, and everyone's talking,
everyone's into the game. I think we're starting to understand that's where
we're at other best and that's what we need to do for however many games we
have left to play, just continuing to go out there, have fun, be positive with
each other, and enjoy it.  
  
Q. Deshaun, when you were in here last night, Thad told a story about how he
called you Shaun until you deserved to have "D" in your name. I wondered, when
is the first time you remember him saying that to you, and was that a
motivation to you to improve your defense?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Honestly, I don't remember. But he always, you know, gets on
me with the defense. But, I mean, in high school, one of my coaches, they took
the "D" off and called me E‑Shaun.  
So I see what Coach Matta means because I had to learn a lot coming into Ohio
State, knowing that defense can win the game instead of just let‑‑ not helping
my teammates and not getting over there, taking the charges. So I learned a
lot and thanks to Coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thanks very much. You may return to the locker room.
Good luck tomorrow.  
Questions for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. Thad, have you noticed something different about this team in recently
weeks, and how much of that is attributed to what Deshaun and Jared have
done?  
COACH MATTA: They've obviously played a significant role in terms of this
team's development. I think both guys touched on it. We have a very good
togetherness right now, a very good understanding of how we want to play, what
we want do, how we want do it, and I think those are the things that we've
been striving for all season.  
And it's good to see, over the course of the last couple weeks, just the
energy and the enthusiasm this team has had. And I think it carries over to
the court for us as well.  
  
Q. Thad, all season people have kind of pointed back to that Duke game as
the bar that you guys set for a 40 ‑minute effort. Where would you put today's
game as far as how this game stacked up to any other game you felt was
particularly good for you this season?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I would say we'd probably be in that category only from the
standpoint of what we were able to do defensively against a high‑powered
offensive team. I mean, Michigan, you talk about a problematic offense, and we
were able to blow some things up. We had active hands.  
When you're playing a team that is‑‑ timing is very important to them, and I
thought we were able to take away a little bit of their timing just by doing
two things at one time, and that was one of the things we talked about with
the quick turnaround of activity on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, how important has it been the last couple of games just to have
Jared Sullinger just completely impose his will early on?  
COACH MATTA: Well, it's obviously been big for us, and it's good to see him
get going. I know everybody's looking at 24 points today, but I thought his
defense as good as it's been all season today and just his activity and got
his hands on some passes. He's really taking ownership for this team.  
We gave up a couple offensive rebounds. We were talking about it in the time
out, and he said, "Hey, I'll get the rebound; that's my fault." And it wasn't,
but he wants that right now and that's good to see. It's refreshing for me.  
  
Q. Coach, with today's win, that means William Buford will play in the Big
Ten Championship game for the fourth time in his career. What does that say
about the state of this program right now and the way that you guys have been
able to maintain excellence over a four ‑year period?  
COACH MATTA: I think we talked about it last night for William. That's an
incredible feat when you stop and think about it, four straight years. And you
look and do this because I can't count them all, all the different players
that William Buford has played with in his time at Ohio State, it's amazing.
So for him and I think our program, it's obviously a great accomplishment
because of this league and all the change that has transpired, all the great
players, all the great coaches. I'm very, very happy for William.  
  
Q. Obviously you got two great teams tomorrow, but you got the ‑‑ let's say
you get to see two big men just go at it. Can you talk about what Green and
Sullinger have meant against each other and what a special match‑up?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think this, and I've said this, Draymond Green has been
eight years in the Big Ten ten, is one of my favorite players. I think he's
just‑‑ he's got multiple talents in terms of what he can do to help them.  
You're looking at two, I think, future NBA great players, going to be going
head to head. And it's funny, we were talking this morning at pregame about,
today, if you were a basketball fan, and you got a ticket to this game, you
saw No. 8 versus No. 12 and No. 7 versus No. 15, it doesn't get much better
for the City of Indianapolis. There's some great basketball. I think tomorrow
you're kind of looking at the same type of situation.  
  
Q. You talked about what you saw now as togetherness and understanding, and
that seemingly has come together in a span of a few days between the game that
you lost at home against Wisconsin and the game that you won at Northwestern.
Was it just a realization on the part of these guys that, last week, there was
a championship to win, this week it's a championship to win. It's won and
done. Is there a greater sense of urgency with your guys now or what?  
COACH MATTA: I don't know if I can put my finger exactly on how things have
transpired. I do think that all good things do take time to develop, and
there's a lot of times in a season where something can happen. Maybe it was
Michigan State getting knocked off the Tuesday night before us.  
But doing this now, I hate to say this, but for a long time, you get a sense,
you get a awareness with your guys, and it can be what they're talking about,
why they're talking about it, energy.  
Yesterday morning at 9:00 o'clock we had a very, very high‑energy 30‑minute
shoot‑around. And as I talked about last night, I was eager to see how we
played in terms of coming out. And hopefully we're learning.  
So much of this is just the mental preparation of getting yourself ready to
play. And I think Deshaun, and he touched on it, it's so important for him.
Early in the season, he was using like the first five minutes to warm up of
the game. And so we kind of got that corrected and told him he had to have a
bead of sweat before in the starting lineups, then we knew he was ready to
play.  
But all guys have certain things in terms of preparation they have to do, and
hopefully we can continue to learn that.  
  
Q. Thad, Jared was talking about how those bad games he had, how he watched
the films over and over and over and how painful it was, how he almost cried
seeing himself play like that. Can you kind of address that? Did you see him
get like a new motivation or something from the way he was playing?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah. I think that‑‑ I'm trying to think back. Even looking today
at Game 2 against Michigan, he was looking at some of the shots that he had
that didn't go down. He was looking at the defense he was playing and getting
split in ball screens.  
And Jared is an extremely prideful young man. And I've said this from the day
he got to Ohio State. He's a winner. And Jared wants to do the things that he
needs to do to help this basketball team.  
And I think that when he doesn't play up to his standards, that becomes very
personal to him. And probably the light went on for him in terms of knowing
what we need from him on a consistent basis. And I couldn't be more pleased
with the progress he's made down the stretch of the season for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH MATTA: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2012

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Stu Douglass](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19657)

### [Zack Novak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  77  
Michigan  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get Coach Beilein to make an opening statement then go to
questions for Stu and Zack.  
COACH BEILEIN: I've seen some really good teams being‑‑ I think this is my
20th year as a DivisionI coach and played some really good games. That's as
good a game as I've ever seen a college team play. Talking about Ohio
obviously.  
They're tremendous, the talent, and what's really good about it is they play
together. There was no selfishness. They made the extra pass. They made the
right plays. It was an incredible performance. And unfortunately they made us
play poorly and we certainly did not have a lot of success in a lot of areas.  
So proud of our kids, though. I liked that we fought. We stayed together and
got humbled quite a bit, but at the same time, not the first time this year
we've lost a game, and we've usually bounced back because of the type of young
men we have on the team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Stu and Zack?  
  
Q. For Stu, you guys obviously didn't play your best basketball this
weekend. Do you worry about the confidence level of the team going into the
tournament, and how do you turn that around and get it back?  
STU DOUGLASS: No, I'm not worried at all. We bounced back after every loss. We
realize what's at stake. It's good for us to experience this, what it'll take.
I guess, they will take the win, and what happens when you don't play well,
how you can just be blown out and your season can be ended very quickly.  
We'll come back, learn a lot from it, watch film, stay focused and practice
like we have been every single time after a loss like this.  
  
Q. Stu, you just said that you guys bounced back after every loss. What is
it about this team that you guys are able to do that so consistently?  
STU DOUGLASS: Just the mental toughness, the mental focus, just taking the
game plan, trusting coach, trusting all the assistant coaches and the game
plan, and just playing Michigan basketball.  
We talk about it every day. We don't try and get outside of ourselves, and we
realize when we do that, when we have tough games and we lose games, we get
outside of ourselves, and we pull each other back in and just focus on what's
important.  
But it's coming down to, can't have these games where we'll have two great
games and then the third game, we just kind of lose focus. Can't have that. So
we gotta to have more sense of urgency coming up when the tournament starts.  
  
Q. Trey was really taken out of the game. What did they do to stop him?  
THE MODERATOR: Zack, take that one.  
ZACK NOVACK: I think you gotta give Craft some credit there, just his
on‑the‑ball defense was pretty good today. And I thought that their bigs did a
good job hedging. And they just they never really let him get comfortable.  
And I give Trey credit, though. He had a rough day, but by his demeanor, you
couldn't tell it, and he just stayed up and he was rock solid, like he has
been all year.  
  
Q. This is your guys' first time playing two games in two days since Maui
when you lost to Duke. Is fatigue a factor and is that a concern going into
the tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Stu.  
STU DOUGLASS: You know, everyone is going to get tired. They played yesterday.
Whoever you're going to play has played the same amount of minutes basically,
overtime games, it's the same situation for everybody. So that doesn't really
play in it. It's all about the mental portion of the game, the mental
toughness, and the focus we have on out game plan. A lot of stuff we kind of
just have to block out.  
  
Q. Zack, as one of the leaders on this team, how do you allow this game to
drive you going into the tournament and how do you channel that into the other
guys?  
ZACK NOVACK: Like we've said, we've responded really well to losses and to
adversity this year. I don't think we have to change our approach much on
that. I think, like Stu said, the guys realize what's at stake at this time.
It's March, NCAA Tournament. You can't afford to have the same little mistakes
that you had in even February. It's time now to get it together and play your
best basketball.  
And I think we'll bounce right back. And we've got a mature group that has
done that all year. So I've got no worries. We'll be all right.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Do you guys think tomorrow is going to be kind of a different experience,
not sitting on pins and needles all day waiting for the selection show,
knowing you're in?  
THE MODERATOR: Stu, let's start with you.  
STU DOUGLASS: Simply, yes. It's completely different. But you have to approach
it the same way. We had a great success in the first game and then came back
and it was a tough loss to deal with against Duke. I mean, there's going to be
great teams. No matter who we play, we know it's going to be a tough test, but
it's obviously a little different situation, less stressful. But we're still
as anxious say as ever.  
THE MODERATOR: Zack, do you want to add anything?  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah, I think without a doubt it's different. We've been in it the
last two times. I think last year we knew we were in, but we weren't exactly
positive. To know that you're in now and with the team we've got, I think
we're looking at this thing more like what's our match‑up going to be, what'
seed are we going to be, because we're in it to win it.  
And I think in the past years we were probably in it to win a few games. We
were not happy with where we were at, but we had exceeded our expectations
well beyond what a lot of people thought. And this year I think we're looking
at this thing and just saying with the team we've got, we've got a legit
chance to make a move in this tournament and advance. And a lot of that has to
do with match‑ups. So I know that's personally how I'll be looking at it.  
THE MODERATOR: Do we have one final question?  
Thank you, fellas. You may return to the locker room. Good luck tomorrow.  
Questions for Coach Beilein?  
  
Q. Given Trey's performance yesterday, was today a bit of a humbling
experience for him do you think?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, I wouldn't know if humbling is the right word. I just
think it's a learning experience more than anything for him. He just continues
to battle.  
His performance today, his attitude was outstanding the entire time. And
there's a lot involved in the intangible areas when he's playing. It's his
hometown team against the defensive player of the year. I never saw him get
shook one time, and that shows about who he is.  
  
Q. Coach, how big a factor was 45 minutes last night for Troy in today's
game?  
COACH BEILEIN: It could be. But Aaron Craft went 37 last night or 38 last
night. So I think it had a lot to do with how we could not stop them early,
their length offensively and then their gap defensively. They've got different
gaps than everybody. It seems like everybody's got long arms and they can get
in there. But I don't think it's a major factor.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about learning moments and using film to teach these
guys. Is this maybe a film that you won't show them again?  
COACH BEILEIN: No, we'll cut it up and we'll find some things. Because when
you're playing against a team like this‑‑ and, like I said, this reminds me of
the teams that‑‑ obviously the ball's got to bounce your way, but I'm talking
about the best UConn teams, the best Syracuse teams, the best Kentucky teams,
the best Florida teams. This is a heck of a team.  
But there's always something we can learn from, and they showed it the other
day when they won up at Michigan State. So we'll find some treasures in there
somewhere, as hard as they are to look at, so that we can get better.  
  
Q. John, you've talked about breaking the beginning of games into segments.
How important is it against Ohio State to come out and get a lead or at least
stay even, and how difficult was it with that 16 ‑3 deficit that you guys
started with?  
COACH BEILEIN: That buried us early. We missed a couple easy ones. We didn't
shoot the ball as well as we can. And I credit their length, because when they
come at you, they're a little bit taller and a guy in your face. But we needed
to be in there early. And they're a tough team to come back on because just‑‑
Craft just runs this team with incredible poise.  
He's just in command of the entire team. He looks like Brett Favre or Joe
Montana or Joe Theismann, John Elway. He's just directing the drive down the
field, and he does it over and over again. And they do not get bothered
because of his presence.  
So it's tough to come back on them. And we need to get off to a good start.
But, frankly, they got just tremendous, tremendous talent and they're very
well coached, and it's tough to do it.  
  
Q. Coach, did you think Ohio State did anything different from the last two
games to get Sullinger going or is it just a matter of him making shots?  
COACH BEILEIN: No. I mean, he's very good. He got a little bit deeper in the
post than we wanted him to do and he made some shots. His first couple ones
were really tough shots that he made.  
But Sullinger was one thing. Deshaun Thomas just is tremendous. I mean, he's
got every bit of impact on the game as‑‑ when you look at those four guys,
whether it's Sullinger, whether it's Thomas, whether it's Buford, Craft, and
then Lenzelle Smith knows exactly where he fits in on this team. And they've
got a lot of bullets, rockets in that gun, and they use them very well.  
  
Q. How much different will tomorrow be for you guys than it was last year at
this time?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, it is interesting because we're trying to‑‑ it's been
exciting two of the last three years that we've been on, we were somewhat on a
bubble. We were in bubble talk.  
If you follow the accounts, we're not. And it will be a little bit different
until the name is announced, and then we all just get to work and go. I think
certainly there's not the anxiety that we had the last couple of years. Just
have to be prepared for anything.  
  
Q. Coach, there's no question about it that Trey Burke has exceeded everyone
on the outside of your program with his exceptional ability to mature as the
season went along, and you mentioned that today would be a good learning
experience for him. Is one of those learning experiences today that when you
get down like 16 to 3 and those segments like that, that he can't just go
down, push, and do everything himself, that he's got to play within the game
that's taken him there all year?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think everybody in our team will learn about what we call
hitting singles. You know what I mean? And he's no different. He's very young.  
But when we got down early, we tried‑‑ a few guys tried to be heros at that
time. We made some just plays that just‑‑ if we were going to get back in that
game, it was going to have to bea lot of singles being hit, a lot of just two
at a time. And whether it was a fast break, a lob that we threw or just I
gotta hit this 3, our kids care a lot and they want to do it certainly as fast
as they can. They want to fix things. And sometimes that's our own worst
enemy.  
  
Q. Looking at the season as a whole, I think you've obviously had a
reputation of being a really good offensive coach, but I think the good
defense that the team has played this year kind of took everyone a little off
guard. Is that something that you really put an extra emphasize on this
season?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, I don't know how to answer that. I think we've always
played pretty good defense, but we've probably mixed up zones a lot and
created more turnovers through our defense because of the different zone
looks.  
We felt that this team was better suited for man‑to‑man, and we emphasized it,
but we still practice about 45 minutes of defense every day, 45 minutes of
offense.  
Yeah, we've changed some things, and our players understand things a lot
better as well. Our percentages are good. I'd like us to create more
turnovers. I don't think we do enough of that to get transition baskets.  
But our coaching staff and me personally grow every year in changing your
approach to what makes this‑‑ what's the better way to coach, how can this
team grow as a team. And obviously sometimes you have importance in some
areas. Defense has always been important, but we spend a lot of time on it.  
  
Q. John, not to put too much emphasis on one play, but the fast break where
Trey's coming down and Craft takes the charge, is that maybe the one turning
point of the game where if Craft gets his second it goes one way and Byrd gets
his second it goes a different way?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, I thought that was important. We had three good officials
on the game, so you gotta trust their judgment in the game. But that was
probably‑‑ if it had gone the other way, it would have certainly had an effect
on the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Rodney Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23370)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  73  
Minnesota  69

  
MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Smith to make an opening statement and then go to
questions for Andre and Rodney.  
Coach?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I thought we played extremely hard. We narrowed our bench.
I thought‑‑ obviously Michigan made the baskets at the end of the game to get
the tie. Their last three baskets were 3‑point shots, and the 3‑point shot was
there to send it into overtime. But I thought our kids played with a lot of
heart and with a lot of courage. I'm really proud of them.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. This question is for Andre. Can you just talk about the experience of the
Big Ten tournament? Obviously the first game, being able to carry the team to
a win, and it got close in this last one, but what are you going to take away
from it?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: This is a great experience for all of us. I think it's a
testament to what we can do as a team. Unfortunately, we didn't execute at the
end. It's just the little things that count. And we let them get some
second‑chance shots and they‑‑ you gotta give Michigan credit. They hit every
one they needed, and we kind of let the game slip out of our hands.  
MODERATOR: Additional questions, please.  
  
Q. Rodney, I saw you shaking your head like right until the end there. Were
you upset particularly about the free throws or was it just the way of the
game?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I was definitely upset with myself about the free
throws. Looking at stat sheet, I was the only one that missed free throws out
there tonight. So that was something that definitely upset me at the end of
the game.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Rodney, you positives that you can take out of tonight and the last three
games that you guys have played?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: Tonight we definitely played hard for all 45 minutes out
there. If we go into the post‑season tournament, we can definitely build from
that because we played the No. 13 team in the nation, no doubt, to the very
end. So we can definitely build off that.  
And if we don't play again, we've definitely got a really, really good team
coming back next year. We're just losing Ralph, and we may get Trev back. So
going into next year, we definitely can contend to get another shot at the Big
Ten title.  
  
Q. You guys had the momentum for most of the game and then in overtime
Michigan got it. Was there something different that they did, or did you guys
make an adjustment that didn't pan out or ‑‑ like what would you pinpoint as
the change?  
MODERATOR: Andre, will you take that, please?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Like I said before earlier, I think their last four‑‑ well, one
of the last three possessions in regulation were 3s, and they were all second
shots. They got the offensive rebound, and that's one of the toughest things
to guard in basketball is the second shot where everyone is scattering.  
They kind of‑‑ Stu Douglass hit a big 3 from a offensive rebound, and that
just kind of put us in a hole. And then Trey Burke hit a 3 off of a
pick‑and‑roll, and the 3s killed us tonight. That's one of the things.  
MODERATOR: Any final questions?  
Thanks, fellas. You may go back to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Smith?  
  
Q. Coach, second year in a row there's a possibility that you might not play
in the NIT. What were you able to tell your team about to prepare for this
weekend? And are they going to get together and watch any selection shows or
anything like that?  
COACH SMITH: No, we really didn't talk about that. I just kind of toldthem ‑‑
I said, hey, let's hold out. Let's keep hope alive that we will get an
opportunity to play.  
But fate was in our hand and we didn't really‑‑ we just didn't get it done.
We'll just have to wait to see what happens. But we won't be doing anything
special.  
  
Q. Is it a good time for you to see a guy like Andre Hollins thrive in a big
pressure situation like these last two nights for the future of this
program?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, I'm very proud and encouraged by the way he played. Andre's
got a lot of heart. He's a very skilled basketball player. You can see just
by‑‑ he makes shots. He really played great. He has stamina. He has good
endurance. Tonight, 44 minutes. And chasing Trey Burke around is a tough job.  
But I think we're well positioned with him at the point as our future point
guard, and he's just going to get better throughout the year. He had some ups
and downs this year, but he had more ups than he had downs, and especially
finishing the right way with these two games in the tournament to show just
what he's capable of doing.  
  
Q. Tubby, does this feel similar to ‑‑ you guys obviously had a lot of
really close losses this year, or did you see anything different from your
guys tonight?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we made some mistakes. As you mentioned, we gave up those
3s and we didn't really‑‑ we just got lost with some‑‑ you have to make those
plays in the games and you have to make the stops. So that's sort of what we
had issues with all year long.  
But, again, we won the one last night, and this again tonight was very
similar. I thought we had‑‑ you know, we felt comfortable in what we were
doing and the way we were executing, but you can't‑‑ we can't afford to turn
the ball over the way we did. And we do the job on the boards, but that's sort
of what we've been doing is we've got to find a way to win and find a way to
finish off people, and we didn't do it once again tonight.  
But I think we're learning from these experiences. Certainly putting the ball
in Andre's hands has been good for us.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Rodney mentioned Trevor, hoping that he comes back. When do you think
you'll find out about that, and how do you think it looks with him?  
COACH SMITH: You know, I think it looks good. We'd love to have him back. I
think he's done all the things we've‑‑ it's in the process now. It's just
going to take time for the NCAA to make some decisions‑‑ to make the decision
whether he comes back or whether‑‑ but he's a young man that deserves an
opportunity, all the things he's going through, a lot of it that he didn't
have much control over.  
And I know the NCAA is working hard to justify, and they're student friendly,
and that's biggest push now is just trying to protect the student‑athletes.
And this is another eligibility issue, and I think he'll‑‑ I think he'll have
another year. He's doing fine, I think, with his rehab. It's going well.  
  
Q. It seems like the guys have had more energy and more intensity in these
last three games than maybe all season, at least consecutively. Do you feel
like ‑‑ I mean, do you think that's true? And do you look at that and say, you
know, things could have been different if you'd had that maybe earlier in the
season?  
COACH SMITH: I think it was just one game we really didn't have much firepower
to us. But I thought all year along we had a good effort. We've been missing a
lot of people over a lot of‑‑ off and on throughout the season, and that's
hard to get that type of continuity, not just in games but in practice.  
So I was impressed with our guys' energy the last three games. But I think our
guys have played hard all season long. I can pinpoint maybe one or two games
that I thought‑‑ a lot of it has to do with going through a losing streak.
It's hard to maintain your intensity because you keep losing close games, and
it can take a lot out of you.  
So that's what I attribute it to, and being a very young team, and that hurt
also.  
MODERATOR: Any final questions? Thank you, Coach.  
COACH SMITH: Thank you.

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Matt Gatens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21898)

### [Devyn Roy Marble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23400)

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  92  
Iowa  75

  
MODERATOR: Coach McCaffery will make an opening statement and then we'll go to
questions for the student‑athletes.  
Coach?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We lost to a very good team today, a very good team who
played really hard. I thought at the start of the game we came out the right
way. I thought we had a good beginning, and then it got away from us there a
little bit, and I thought we fought hard in the second half. But that's a team
that's going to be playing for a long time.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Matt, now that the tournament here is wrapped up for you, what are your
expectations? What are you hoping happens now moving forward for you guys?  
MATT GATENS: For Iowa? You know, this year we'd love to continue playing, but
we know we'll find out on Sunday. But the future of Iowa, I know I'm excited.
It's in good hands. There's a lot of good young talent returning, and the guys
I'm proud of for fighting this whole year and stepping up in big spots, and
there's some good talent coming in. So it's looking good, and I'm excited for
it.  
MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. For the players, obviously, how much would you like to play a post
‑season game in one of the non‑NCAA tournaments?   
MODERATOR: Matt, let's start with you, please.  
MATT GATENS: Yeah, I think it would be great for the program to get an NIT bid
and continue playing and fight for something. The young guys need it. More
practices, more games is great for the program, and we'll find out.  
MODERATOR: Dev?  
DEVYN ROY MARBLE: I think it would mean a lot to the team and the program.
Guys like Matt haven't had a chance to play in the post season yet. Of course
we wanted to play for them, so hopefully we do get chosen.  
  
Q. Hey, Dev, you really get a sense in the locker room that you guys were
playing for Matt and the other seniors. I know that's usually the case when
you have seniors. But what was that like trying to get another game for the
guy next to you.  
DEVYN ROY MARBLE: It means a lot, especially a guy that's just done so much
for us this year. He's carried us, he's led us, he's done everything for the
team, and to see him upset and to feel that we came up short for him, it was
just‑‑ it was heartbreaking to the whole team.  
And when you have a guy like Matt who you all love, you just want to see him
have as much success as possible here. And we all know we gotta make the most
of our opportunities, especially guys like me, Aaron White and Melsahn who
know‑‑ I mean, we got two years and three years left, but you don't ever want
to just give up opportunities like we have had this year.  
And that's one thing I've learned. You always want to make the most of your
opportunities because you never know when you might not make a post season or
lose and win this game.  
  
Q. For both Dev and Matt, toughness was an issue up in East Lansing a couple
months ago, but it looked like early on especially you made that a focal point
not to allow you to be the punk team or whatever out on the court. Was that a
focal point going into this game?  
MODERATOR: Dev?  
DEVYN ROY MARBLE: Yeah, it was. We felt like when we went to East Lansing they
outplayed us, they out‑toughed us and really just were more physical. And so
that was a key thing. When we came into today's game we wanted to make sure
that we came out and they knew that it wasn't going to be easy.  
Unfortunately, they out rebounded us. And I don't think that was the lack of
us not being tough. It was just‑‑ it felt like they were just quicker to the
ball, they kind of out‑jumped us and we weren't able to adjust. And when you
got guys like Draymond and Adreian Payne who are excellent rebounders, it's
difficult.  
MODERATOR: Matt, your thoughts, please.  
MATT GATENS: Yeah, it's obviously a point of us just coming in after what
happened up there, and it was a quick turnaround from yesterday, didn't have a
ton of time trying to prepare for it or go through drills on the court.  
But we knew it was going to be a battle, especially on the boards, because
that's what they're known for. I'm proud of the guys the way they came out and
fought right from the start. We were battling. It's tough for 40 minutes, but
I thought we gave it our all, but it's a tough team.  
MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes before I let them go?  
Okay, fellas. Thank you very much.  
Questions for Coach McCaffery.  
  
Q. Coach, twice this season Michigan State has I think scored more than 90
points on you. Between that first game and this game what adjustments
defensively were you trying to make?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, the biggest problem we had up there is we turned the
ball over 21 times and they ran it down our throat. Today we turned it over
nine and didn't give them as many transition opportunities.  
At half court they were pounding it inside. We went from man to zone and back
to man, back to zone. There's not much else you can do. We pressed a little
bit. But we give up a lot of size to them.  
MODERATOR: Others questions?  
  
Q. Coach, without the benefit of knowing what the future is with the post
season here, can you just speak to what Matt Gatens has done, his impact on
this program going forward.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I don't know that I've had a better captain‑‑ I've had some
really good ones, and that's an amazing statement from me‑‑ not only in terms
of the example that he set from a work ethic standpoint and how he conducts
himself off the floor and how he pays attention to everything that we do in
terms of game planning and his performance in the classroom. All of those
things combined just are an example of his tremendous character.  
But then on top of it he raised his game to a completely different level to
where he was virtually unstoppable and has played himself. Whereas at one
point in time I think most people respected what he'd accomplished, I think
now you look at him differently and say, wait a minute, this guy has clearly
got NBA potential. He's been invited to Portsmouth, and he'll go down there.
I'm sure he'll play well. He's in the best shape of his life, shooting the
ball extremely well, and I hope he plays for a long time.  
  
Q. Speaking of Matt, he didn't take a shot for a long time in the game. It
looked like they were really being physical with him, trying to keep him away
from the ball. What kind of adjustments did you make? Was Zach a focal point
at that point or just trying to find whoever was open?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, the only thing you can do, you can run motion or
you can set him up or you can run plays for other people. Zach's threes early
just came out of motion. We were running things in the second half for Josh
and for Marble for Melsahn.  
He's always going to be a focal point of what we're trying to do. We may go
away from him for a while, use him as a screener and try to get other people
involved, but pretty much we're trying to get him free the entire time.  
  
Q. Fran, I think it was like 22 ‑22 and Matt hadn't attempted a shot yet,
and then the bottom fell out pretty fast. They started hitting shots. But they
got four quick baskets on offensive rebounds. Is that just a testimony to
their size or was it a box‑out?   
COACH MCCAFFERY: That was disappointing. There's no question about that. I
mean, they're very good at it. They're plus nine, I think, on the glass. I
think that's best in the country.  
They're much bigger than we are. I would like to have seen us put a body on
somebody there. I haven't seen the film so I don't know exactly what happened
and where we broke down, but we were getting some stops in a tight game. But
it really does make a big difference when they're getting put‑backs. And it
improved their confidence, and I think they ultimately ended up shooting the
ball better as a result of put‑backs, and that's what we were trying to avoid.  
  
Q. Your Freshmen had pretty good performances. Josh scored 20 points, Aaron
had a pretty good, Olaseni came in off the bench. Do you think the future is
bright for those three?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Oh, they're going to be tremendous. They're already
tremendous. Gabe's got a little further to go. He didn't play as much as the
other two guys. But they certainly proved that they're certainly among‑‑ Aaron
is certainly among the best players in this league, Josh among the best
Freshmen. Josh has put some numbers up in some difficult environments, and
he's just going to keep getting better, and so is Aaron.  
  
Q. Coach, do you ever foresee a time maybe in the future where the team's
not playing as hard as you want them to play and you might pull out a Matt
Gatens tape and show them the guys running a hundred miles through 8 million
screens trying to get open and never stopping?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think that's a great teaching point. We've done that over
the years. Every coach. When I say we, it's any coach. If you have somebody
that's special, you'll go back and show somebody at that same position, like
you think you're working hard, you think you're trying to get open, you think
you're running off screens correctly. Let me show you somebody who did it
perfectly.  
And it would be a teaching situation completely. And we'll do it. And you'll
do it for guys in different positions based on how hard they play. And we did
it this year with Melsahn when he was struggling. We showed him tapes of
himself from last year: This is what you were doing last year. When he was
playing with energy like did he today in the second half, he impacts the game.  
MODERATOR: One final question. Okay.  
Thank you, Coach.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Thank you.

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Jordan Hulls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21909)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  79  
Indiana  71

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student‑athletes. We'll get
Coach Crean here shortly. So questions for these guys.  
  
Q. Did you guys sense the absence of Verdell Jones today?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, that one, please.  
JORDAN HULLS: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Having a good player like Verdell not
being able to play for us, it's pretty difficult, but a lot of years have been
the next guys stepping up, and we fully have the guys on the bench who can
fully do that. But you can't replace directly a guy like Verdell, but we just
gotta adapt to that.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to top a Wisconsin team when they're shooting like
that and seems like everything is falling from beyond the arc for them
early?  
THE MODERATOR: Christian, take that one.  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: It's difficult, but we did some crazy stuff. We just wasn't
playing intelligent on the defense end and made some shots.  
  
Q. Cody, you only finished with one rebound. What were they doing
defensively, keeping from you pulling down some of those rebounds?  
CODY ZELLER: I mean, some of it has to do with them shooting 3s, but a lot of
it had has to do with me. I gotta catch up at the boards harder. I gotta give
better effort.  
  
Q. Jordan, with the win yesterday and the competitive loss today, what did
you guys really, really get out of these two rounds?  
JORDAN HULLS: We always want to compete and obviously win, but I felt like we
played hard, but we have to play a lot smarter to carry that into the next
games that we have to play. So we gotta play more intelligent and get that
team chemistry and keep building on that.  
  
Q. When you guys didn't say you didn't feel like you were playing
intelligent on defense, what does that mean? What did you feel like you guys
were doing wrong? What wasn't working for you on that end?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan.  
JORDAN HULLS: Just whether it's switching. Whether it's closing out with the
hand lower than it needs to be on a shooter there, just rising up and hitting
shots and pretty much open, so just gotta communicate a lot better and that's
just part of being intelligent.  
  
Q. Jordan, until that 3 ‑pointer you took at the very end, you didn't
attempt one, Matt Roth didn't attempt one. Were they just taking that away
today?  
JORDAN HULLS: I was just trying to be aggressive off the pick‑and‑roll, so my
shots were just mostly pull‑up jumpers. I wasn't going to try to force
3‑pointers if it wasn't there. So for me, that's what I really felt. But as
far as Matt or anybody else, that's probably partly my fault too not driving
and kicking enough and finding an open man on the 3‑point line.  
  
Q. Christian, I know that you obviously don't want to lose in a tournament
in the second round, but having those couple of days before Selection Sunday,
does that give you guys a little bit of a chance to catch your breath and get
ready for the NCAA tournament?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: Oh, yeah, it does. But, like you said, we definitely didn't
want to lose today, but we'll go back home and we'll get ready and we'll find
out where we're playing and who we're playing. We'll be ready.  
  
Q. Before the game what, if anything, did you guys know about Rob Wilson?  
THE MODERATOR: Cody, do you want to take that one?  
CODY ZELLER: I mean, our coaches did a pretty nice job of doing the scouting
reports and stuff for us. We knew that he could shoot the ball, but we gave
him too many openings. Especially once he got hot, we didn't change anything
in our defensive strategy to get out on him more.  
THE MODERATOR: We've got time for a couple more for the student‑athletes if
there are any.  
Thanks, fellas. You may return to the locker room.  
Coach Crean, if you would please make an opening statement and then we'll go
to your questions.  
COACH CREAN: It was a high‑level game in a lot of respects. We shot almost 50
percent, they shot almost 50 percent. Rob Wilson had his best game I've ever
seen him play. I'm not at Wisconsin so I don't know if they've seen him play
better.  
But as we told our team, he was the most improved player on our team since the
first time we played him. He had a great game at Ohio State, and he really
brought a different dose of energy to their team when he was in the game.  
But to shoot it the way that he did today, in the last five games he hit seven
threes and today he hit seven threes. Now, some of them were reading screens
wrong, some of them were over‑help situations. The one late in the game where
we helped on the Taylor drive and left him was a mistake. No question about
it.  
But they don't put anybody out on the floor that can't make shots. But as far
as us scoring, we weren't having a lot of trouble scoring ourselves. We should
have made it a little harder for them, but again, it was a high‑level game and
we had some guys play very well, they had guys play very well. The different
was Rob Wilson played tremendous. And his aggressiveness and the way that he
shot the ball, sometimes we were right there draped on him and he made shots;
other times he was a product of good ball movement and our over helps.  
But the other thing I would say about the game is every time we were close to
getting momentum going back our way, they made a big play, and it was usually
Rob Wilson making that play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, kind of like what I asked Christian, the fact that you guys do
have a couple of days to rest up, get healthy for the tournament, what will
that mean to this ball ‑‑  
COACH CREAN: I'm not sure. We've been getting a lot of rest. As it is, our
guys have a lot of energy. They're fresh. We didn't lose today because we
didn't have energy, and it was‑‑ both teams had it.  
We won't make a lot of changes. I haven't really thought that far ahead and to
that structure. So we'll get together as a coaching staff and decide what we
need to do next.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of kind of stuttered on this answer a little bit, but in
terms of just defending the three and some of those things, just what all just
didn't particularly go right there?  
COACH CREAN: I think the over helps. I think the key with any great driver is
you've go to keep your chest in front of the ball, and a couple times we
didn't do that.  
And Ryan Evans played very well, without a doubt. And Taylor, as much
attention as we gave him, he did a good job of moving the ball today. And
again, they're a highly skilled team.  
And to have Rob Wilson playing that way for them, that's you can sleep a lot
better at night going into the tournament knowing that you've got a guy that's
got those capabilities. But again, we knew he was playing better, and but to
shoot it like that, he got hot. We didn't do a great of changing that. That we
put different guys on him, but a couple instances we went under screens.
Another instance we over helped on the post. And another instance we totally
helped on the drive when we should have stayed connected to him. We really
wanted to do a better job than what we did of staying connected to some of
their shooters. But at the same time, when you have breakdowns on the ball,
then that's going to created help situations.  
  
Q. I know Will returned to the game, but how's he doing going forward?  
COACH CREAN: It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell right now. Haven't had a
chance to talk to Tim Garland, our doctors. So we'll see here in a little
while.  
  
Q. Wisconsin did a good job taking away Victor Oladipo or at least making
him work for his shots, like making Victor Oladipo work for his shots. He
didn't shoot particularly well from the floor. What all did you see that went
into that?  
COACH CREAN: We still shot 50 percent almost for game. And we didn't take a
lot of 3s. Frankly, we didn't need to. We got the ball in the lane. We got the
ball into some post‑up situations. We wanted to get to the foul line.  
And Vic, it wasn't one of his better games. But there's a lot of room for
improvement in him and he's improved a great deal this year. So we fully
believe and expect that he will. We're asking him to do a lot, and he's been
doing a lot more for us since the first injury to Verdell after the Michigan
game or during the Michigan game and been a big part of why we've played so
well. And now with Verdell out, he's gotta do even that much more.  
But again, for him, so much of it comes down to how he's defending, and he did
some really good things and shooting the ball on a couple decisions, he'd
probably like to have that back, but we're very confident in what he can do.  
  
Q. Tom, did you ever get an explanation as to why they wouldn't go to the
monitor on the Elston charge?  
COACH CREAN: The one late in the game? It's not reviewable. They said.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Tom, I'm just curious what did your scouting report say going into this
game about Rob Wilson?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we said that he was‑‑ again, in the short time of
preparation, we watched as much film of him as of anybody. He was the most
improved player in our minds since we'd played him the first time, and he
didn't do a lot in this game. But really, the Ohio State game at Ohio State
was where he really, I thought, came to life for their team.  
So in the last five games, he was averaging six points but he'd made seven 3s.
He was shooting 39 percent, I think. And we knew that he was an x factor
because of his aggressiveness and his attackability. And there were times we
were there, but there were other times that we weren't.  
And certainly, when you begin your plan with Jordan Taylor and Ryan Evans and
Jared Berggren, but Rob Wilson was fully accounted for in the way that we
prepared. It just didn't look that way today, and he got really, really hot,
and then we didn't do a great job of taking him away.  
And again, some of the 3s he made, he earned them. And other ones he made
because he was open because we over helped on the ball. But we were fully
aware of‑‑ Rob Wilson's been a factor for them for some time. But again, he
really had been playing well for them.  
So in a short period of time we just didn't want to let him get a lot of
middle penetration. He's got a great burst and explosiveness. And again, when
you don't have your chest in front of Rob Wilson or you don't have your chest
in front of Jordan Taylor, those are problems. And there were too many times
today where we didn't have our chest in front, and they hurt us with quickness
and that created the helps.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're disappointed about today, but looking ahead, come
Sunday, knowing what that program has been through the last three years, you
know you're going to be selected. Just talk about what that moment is going to
be like for you and this team.  
COACH CREAN: I'm probably going to think more about that later. I'm not really
in that mode. But it's well earned. I know that, as I've said of this team
many times.  
You have to earn your way in that door. That is a tough door to get in. And
the door gets‑‑ the room gets a little smaller once you get in, and that's
where you don't want to beat yourself.  
And I'll be excited for these guys. They've earned their way in. There's
nobody that's handed them anything, there's nobody that ‑‑ they weren't
anointed, the group, to go back to the NCAA Tournament. They really, really
had to work.  
So in that sense, I'll be really happy for them and look forward to seeing
their faces and the families of the staff and my family's face. And about 15
minutes later, it will be time to start planning for who we're going to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [D.J. Byrd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23433)

### [Lewis Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20669)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  88  
Purdue  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Ask Coach Painter to make an opening statement, then go to
questions for D.J. and Lewis. Coach?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought our guys gave a good fight today. I thought we were
in a position to have come down the stretch to win the game. Obviously they go
on like a 17‑2 run or something of that nature. We were poor in transition. We
didn't get some shots to fall, and we obviously couldn't keep them off the
glass and keep the ball from going inside. And that combination just kind of
sealed the deal for Ohio State.  
But I thought our guys did a good job putting themselves in that position at
that point. We just had to play better in that stretch. But you have to give a
lot of credit to Ohio State. I thought Sullinger and Thomas were very good
tonight.  
And you look at the stat sheet, and they have seven offensive rebounds, and
you would think they had 17 offensive rebounds, but every one they got, they
made us pay either by us fouling or scoring the basketball. But hats off to
them, and I thought they were better than us and they did a good job of
finishing the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for D.J. and Lewis.  
  
Q. Lew, it seemed like there were a lot of junctures in the game, you got it
down to three, got it down to four, and just kind of a matter of not being
able to get stops, right?  
LEWIS JACKSON: Definitely. I think what Coach is talking about with the
offensive rebound with Sullinger and Deshaun Thomas, you'd think they had more
than that. And when we got it down in that stretch, we did get a couple
defensive stops in there, but we missed a couple rebound opportunities, and
they capitalized. And Buford got a couple leak‑outs and a couple and‑ones that
kinda pushed the game.  
But we did a good job. We just gotta do a better job rebounding as a team
collectively, and the whole game could be a different scenario.  
  
Q. Lew, what opened for you in the first half in terms of getting to the
basket, and then what did Ohio State do in the second half to kind of close
that down?  
LEWIS JACKSON: I think my first jump‑shot, honestly, kind of just made 'em
say, you know, we don't want 'em to just get jump shots and they was switching
Jared Sullinger on me. I just had a good chance of attacking the basket, and
just more so in the second half. They just kind of stayed back and made me
contest it.  
And Jared Sullinger, you have to give him credit. He played straight up. Got a
couple blocks in, and the ball just didn't go my way, but you have to take
your hat off to him for playing solid defense.  
  
Q. D.J., what did you think of the way Lewis played tonight?  
D.J. BYRD: Oh, obviously, as you can tell, he was really looking for his
teammates. I know when I was coming off a couple down screens and he was
driving, trying to give me shots as well as Ron and Rob, and one turnover,
that's a pretty good ratio right there. So he's done a great job all year
distributing the ball, especially today, and I think that will be beneficial
for us in the NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Lew, just you can obviously talk about the NCAA Tournament now. Where do
you think you guys fit in?  
LEWIS JACKSON: I don't know. Kind of been a funny year. Talking to all the
guys, we always kind of been like think the lowest I've been since I've been
here is fifth seed. You kind of just always hear it about on ESPN, but this
year I haven't really paid attention. And this team, all we went through, we
were just trying to make sure we got in position. And I'll probably look
tomorrow, trying to start figure things out.  
But honestly, once you get in, that's all that matters. So this team just has
to be ready to play wherever they send us and just know that we can do
something special.  
  
Q. D.J., Ohio State isn't really a very good match ‑up for you guys in terms
of their size. What can you take from this game to build for the NCAA
Tournament and then learn from it?  
D.J. BYRD: Well, it's a little different because NCAA Tournament, we'll
probably be playing a team that we're not used to playing against. Ohio State,
we know their personnel and they know ours.  
But this game, obviously one of the big things is rebounding, especially when
we go to a smaller lineup. It's important to box out every time and try to get
those 50/50 balls. So I think those are big things going into the tournament
that we need to do.  
THE MODERATOR: One more for either D.J. or Lew? Okay, thanks, fellas. You may
go back to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Painter?  
  
Q. Matt, from the looks of the box score, they held down Robbie pretty well.
What did they do in particular?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think they go a good job of switching our ball screen
even though I think we got some pretty good action off our ball screen stuff.
Even in the second half, I just thought we had some looks that didn't go down.  
I think Rob just kind of falls into that. He had some looks. We'd like to get
him some stuff more in the mid‑post, get him some stuff driving to the basket.  
But you have to give them credit. They did a good job defensively not on just
Rob but really on everybody else. And we needed to get to the basket more,
needed to get to the free throw line more.  
But I didn't think they did anything different on him than they had before.
They played him the same way. He had some shots not go down. I'd like to get
him a couple more shots.  
But it's one of those games that it's kind of free flowing for us. We're kind
of playing the mismatches. They're putting their center on our two or three
and then we're trying to kind of counter them. I'm just kind of waiting to see
who he's going to guard at times to see what we're going to run.  
So we're just trying to play off that mismatch more than anything. I know it's
not your question. But we can't give up 88 points and expect to win.  
  
Q. Matt, staying with Rob, how is his knee tonight?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought it was okay. I thought it was fine.  
  
Q. Did he have some swelling issues or anything like that prior to this
game?  
COACH PAINTER: Not to my knowledge. I thought he was all right. I went out
there to watch him in warmups. He was just going back‑to‑back days and I
thought he looked good.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously offensively you were better with the smaller lineup, but
how did you ‑‑ what were you trying to do defensively to counter their size
when you had that lineup on the floor?  
COACH PAINTER: A couple times we didn't‑‑ we were supposed quick double and
our guy just didn't get there. But we were getting buried so deep that
sometimes he would even go over the double and just score the basketball.  
So we were allowing it just too easy to enter the post, and we were supposed
to be there on the double, and if he was off and then dribbling it, we were
supposed to come with it.  
But give him credit. He's a good player. A lot of times defensively what we
do, we get pretty set in what we do. We just struggle when we go against pros.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say in the technical? And did you ever think you were
going to get a defensive stop on a fast break so long after your playing
career was over?  
COACH PAINTER: I didn't hear understand the second part.  
  
Q. Did you ever think you were going to a defensive stop on a fast break so
late after your playing career?  
COACH PAINTER: One of their bigs was just grabbing our players out in the open
on a ball screen defense, and I just pointed it out while he had two hands
around him to. One of their bigs just had his hands around him, so I pointed
it out to him and said he's got both his hands around him, and he stares right
at it and ignores it. So I can't repeat what I said to him.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I know you've had a relationship with Bruce Weber. Can you just
talk about coaching with him and your thoughts on him not being in the
league?  
COACH PAINTER: It's obviously very hard for me. He's a great coach and he's a
better person. I think it's Illinois's loss, to be honest with you.  
But the good ones, you know, he's going to bounce back and he's going to get a
good opportunity. There's no doubt about that. But it's hard because if it
wasn't for him and if it wasn't for Coach Keady, I wouldn't be here. And I've
learned a lot of basketball and I've learned a lot about life and how to treat
people from Coach Weber. You're not going to find a better guy.  
  
Q. Matt, I think I asked the players earlier. Seemed like every time you had
it within three or four they were able to go inside and were able to get
points out of it. Just like you said, you struggle when you go against the
pros.  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah. It's smart. We've had some good interior guys in Landry
and Jejuan Johnson. When things get sticky, you've got to get it to your
horse, and Jared Sullinger is a horse, man. He's a great player, and we had to
do a better job of keeping it out of the post and not in his hands.  
But that's easier said than done. We played a smaller lineup at times to try
to flip it on them and be able to score more points on the other end. We
weren't able to do that. But when we had size in there, he still had a lot of
success. But just impressed with him. He's a good person. Sullinger's a very
good player, and he's going to have nights like that with his skill and his
size.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH PAINTER: All right. Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  88  
Purdue  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Matta will make an opening statement, then go to
questions for William and Jared. Coach?  
COACH MATTA: I thought we started the game that was the biggest thing for me
is seeing how these guys started the game in a tournament format. You've got
really three guys on this team that have been significant players in this
situation, and I thought our preparation coming in was good. I thought our
minds were good.  
Purdue stymied us just a little bit there in the first half. They got us on a
ball screen. Then they started banking some 3s. We got some things figured out
in the second half, and I thought our offense executionwise was where it
needed to be.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Jared, what was different about tonight? You obviously were able to get
more shots, more freedom down low.  
JARED SULLINGER: Obviously in practice, we've been working on offense
execution, spacing, every little thing we always talked about in practice.
Coming into this tournament, I thought that was the biggest key for this
basketball team. And, I mean, this basketball team found me when I was open
and I was blessed enough to make the shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions, please?  
  
Q. Jared or William, I think the run was 17 to 2. What changed during that
time? It looked like you were able to get out in transition.  
THE MODERATOR: William, please.  
WILLIAM BUFORD: I think we eventually locked down on our defense. Cooled down
and used the pick‑and‑roll, stopped letting them get to the basket. We just
played together. We have five guys connected on defense. And we like‑‑ when we
do that, it's pretty tough to score against us, just let us get our run, let
our defense lead our offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. For both players, just what was Purdue doing that made it tough for you
guys to really break away from them really?  
THE MODERATOR: Jared, start with you, please.  
JARED SULLINGER: Honestly, coming into the second half, we was talking about
switching, and we kind of got messed up with it. Some people were switching,
some people wasn't. And then finally when we broke out on that run, I thought
our communication was great because everybody was talking. And like Coach
Matta always tells us, when we talk on the defense end, it always carries over
to the offense end, and I thought that's what made us break away.  
WILLIAM BUFORD: Pretty much what Jared said, we start talking on defense. We
told ourselves that we were going to lock down and quit trading baskets and we
did that and we got a lead.  
  
Q. Jared, the stat sheet says 48 to 18 in the paint. Was that something that
you guys targeted coming into this game that you think you could get done?  
JARED SULLINGER: I mean, honestly, not trying to toot my own horn, but we
played through me. Obviously, when we see the double, our guards understand
that if they get into the open spot, they're going to have a knockdown jump
shot, or if they don't double, they're going to let me go work. So I thought
that was the biggest key to this game.  
And our guards and even Deshaun found a way to find me in the post, and also I
was posting up deep, so I didn't really have to take a bounce or make a move
or wait for the double team.  
  
Q. Jared, at the beginning of that run where you guys pulled away in the
second half, you guys had an offensive rebound where I think you may have
tipped it, Deshaun tipped it a couple times, and Deshaun got a put ‑back early
in that run. It just seemed like na energy play where maybe it sparked you
guys. Can plays like that help the team get rolling?  
JARED SULLINGER: First off, you gotta give Deshaun all the credit. I was at
half court celebrating for Deshaun to get the ball and put it back in, so that
was all Deshaun's energy.  
But with plays like that, it fuels our fire on the defense end, and like I
said earlier, the communication was great because we were switching everything
and we limited a lot of people's touches.  
  
Q. Purdue ran a small offense or small lineup at you guys a lot tonight.
Michigan will probably do the same. Was it good to see what you saw tonight
and will that help tomorrow?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: Absolutely. It's always good to see good looks, so you know‑‑
not so you know. So we can ‑‑ it's good to see different looks because you
never know what you're going to see in the post season. So it's always good to
see different things that you just adjust. Our coaches did a great job
adjusting, told us what to do. I think it would be great for us.  
  
Q. Jared, we saw two Northland High School guys get 30 points each tonight.
Did you watch much of Trey's performance that first game? And maybe just
comment about your friend's performance and then your own performance
tonight.  
JARED SULLINGER: Yeah, I watched Trey play, played a great game. Hopefully not
tomorrow, but he played a great game.  
But, I mean, it's a perfect system for him and he fits perfect. And for me,
our guards, I was setting really good screens, and our guards understood that
if I set a good screen, my man has to guard them for a half second and they
just found me.  
Will was doing great with that, Craft, and we also got a lot of ball movement
going side to side, so it was easy for me and Deshaun to get into the paint.  
  
Q. Jared, you said a little earlier this year that the refs and the media
were maybe getting to you a little bit. Have you felt since that time that
you've had a renewed focus or a new focus?  
JARED SULLINGER: Can you say that one more time?  
  
Q. Earlier this year you said that maybe you were letting the refs calls
getting to you a little bit, or the media. Since then, have you been more
focused or what's been the difference?  
JARED SULLINGER: You just gotta play basketball. I'm not always worried about
what the refs is calling or looking for a foul or give you a hit, and you stop
playing through the contact, and I just refocused on that and just played my
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thank you. You may go back to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. Just in that play with Deshaun where he tapped the rebound a couple times
and got a put ‑back there, you guys don't get the rebound there, don't get the
offensive rebound. Maybe Purdue comes down I think and cut it to one
possession. Was that an energy moment at all?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I think it was. Especially from the effort that he gave to
come up with it because, like I said, I think he tipped it. It was tipped
about three times. He went and got it with two hands, gathered himself, went
up and put it back in. That was the type of play in games like this, when
you're going back and forth, when something can ignite you, maybe that was a
play that did.  
  
Q. Thad, in the first half, as you mentioned, Purdue was getting you with
the switches and getting Jackson on a bigger guy that he could go by. Did you
keep switching and just do it differently or how did you better cut that off
in the second half?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, you know, we had 10 points and '10 assists. We did a great
job on them. What happened when we went to the switching, then they went to
the hand‑offs and got us on a couple 3s there in the first half. We had to
communicate better in the second half.  
The thing was, we wanted to make Jackson finish over length, finishing over
size, and make tough 2s. And that was kind of the thing. Purdue, especially
since they played us in Game 1, has really started shooting the 3‑point shot
effectively. And once we figured out that they were on fire again, I thought
we did a better job locking down.  
And probably most importantly was we guarded the ball better. They weren't
able to do get inside our defense quite as easily.  
  
Q. Thad, I'll ask you the same question I asked Jared. What was different
about tonight in terms of the space he was able to get around the block and
the greater ease that he was able to get shots off?  
COACH MATTA: I don't think I can say exactly what I'd like to say, but I think
that there was‑‑ like he talked about, the ball movement. And Jared had a good
way about him in terms of his movement.  
In the first game, every time he tried to cut, there was collisions. And it
was good to see that we were able to move the way we wanted to move
effectively.  
  
Q. Coach, they talked about communicating better on defense. Is that
something that you touched on at some point tonight, or did they kind of pick
it up on their own?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I think if you went back to October 15th, we started
talking about it. When we do it, we're a better defensive team. And getting
guys to talk, as I always tell them, they never stop talking in a team mill or
on the bus or whatever. And there's times when I say, hey, look, if we could
just do this on the court, I think we got a pretty good defense.  
But to be effective defensively, you have got to have to great communication,
and we did a better job in the second half.  
  
Q. Thad, giving some of your struggles, is there more at stake in this
tournament for you than there usually is? Can you gain some momentum, kind of
correct some of your problems or whatever before you get into the other
tournament?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think the one thing that I was‑‑ and I talked about this
before the game with some camera‑‑ but I was curious to see how this team
performed tonight, how we started the game. We knew Purdue was going to come
with great energy off of a great win last night.  
With that said, you're in a tournament format. We're a young team. I thought
that the buildup coming in, not finding out until late last night who we were
playing, we had a late‑night film session, guys were asking questions, guys
are zoned in. We did get 30 minutes this morning at 9:00 o'clock on the court,
and I liked the way‑‑ so when they do it up today, I was kind of curious how
would they play in a tournament environment.  
So answering your question, I think we can continue to grow. I think that
these are the times where all the little things matter, and hopefully they're
continuing to pick up on those.  
  
Q. Coach, Deshaun Thomas is a player known more for the offensive spark that
he provides. Can you talk a little bit about his individual defensive effort
today as the primary defender on Robbie Hummel who was limited to six
points?  
THE MODERATOR: Deshaun is really taking to the defensive end. Deshaun is a
very prideful kid, and there's been a point in his career where I just call
him Shaun, because I'm saying there's no D in your game. I've gone back to
calling him Deshaun.  
But I joke with him about it because he's really done a nice job of accepting
the role, learning the game, studying the game, and that's the first thing he
talks about now after a game is the defense. One of the biggest things when he
makes a mistake defensively, he knows it, and that's important to me.  
  
Q. Thad, in the first half, at times ‑‑ and I don't know if this was
something they were doing, but it looked like you were back to settling for
some quick jump shots from distance. And I wondered if you had‑‑ did you
change anything at halftime to run better to execute better on offense in the
second half? And one quick thing along with that, is there any reason that
Shannon didn't play as much tonight as he has‑‑  
COACH MATTA: No.  
  
Q. ‑‑previously?  
COACH MATTA: I think with the‑‑ that was the answer to the second one.  
The shots in the first half, we did take a couple. And the problem I have with
them is we weren't set to shoot them. It was‑‑ our feet, we hopped into them.
We didn't one‑two‑step into them. And we talked about that. We felt like if we
didn't have a good one, we wanted to execute and try to get the exact shot
that we wanted.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH MATTA: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  79  
Indiana  71

  
MODERATOR: Let's start with the coach giving an opening statement then go to
questions for the student‑athletes. Coach?  
COACH RYAN: Well, needless to say we had a player that was in the zone and
teammates found him he worked hard to get open. And I think Rob Wilson's the
story of the game as far as our offense end goes. And defensively, we did just
enough to get by. But I think Rob has really stepped into his own here at the
end of the year, and I know his teammates are thankful.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rob, how often have you been in the interview room before and when is the
last time ‑‑ I know you haven't had this kind of game in college before, but
when is the last time you had a game like this in your life?   
ROB WILSON: High school maybe. I don't recall having‑‑ I mean the weight of
the ball felt like it was going in today. I don't remember that feeling in a
long time. I don't know the last time I've been in the interview room.  
  
Q. Rob, as you're heating up like that, what are your teammates saying to
you as you're just getting more and more successful from the 3 ‑point line?  
ROB WILSON: They saying the same thing they always been telling me. Just be
confident and always look to be aggressive.  
  
Q. Rob, at the end of your career, to have a game like this, what's it mean
to you right now? What are your emotions right now?  
ROB WILSON: Right now it's a good feeling that we get to play another game in
the tournament. And we get to go against a team that we failed to earlier this
year to prove something.  
  
Q. Jordan, a couple things I think you've said maybe even last year that Rob
has, some things maybe not to this level, but are you surprised by anything
you saw today? And then the second, part can you talk about the intentional
foul call? What happened on that?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: No. I think I meant to this level, I think Rob is‑‑ he's a
scorer. He can put it in the hole and he showed that tonight. But it's
something he's been doing here recently now, and I'm just happy for him. I'm
so happy, I wish I had 30, because the most important thing, we got the win.  
And the intentional foul, I just thought‑‑ I was just trying to get back in
front of him and I guess I grabbed him, so it was an easy call.  
  
Q. Jordan, you're kind of struggling there a little bit in the first half.
How important was it for Rob to pick you up like that? And also how much
better is this team with Rob performing like this this late in the year?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, it was definitely huge for Rob to step up like that.
That's what coach talks about a lot. When a teammate is down, you gotta pick
him up, and I think everybody really buys into that.  
And as far as being a better team, what he's doing now, I think we're
infinitesimally times better. Obviously teams are going to prepare for guys
who are‑‑ with the higher averages, but when you get a guy like Rob who may
not‑‑ kind of like a sleeper. We know what he can do but they might not, and
you come in and he made 'em pay today.  
  
Q. For Jared and Rob. Back ‑to‑back possessions where one fed one guy and
the other fed the other guy, could you take us back to those plays and what
did you see in each of those plays that you fed each other for hoops?  
THE MODERATOR: Jared, start with you.  
JARED BERGGREN: The first one, I think I got a touch on the block and started
to make a move, and I saw Rob cut to the basket, found him open, and I think
he pumped back and had a good finish, though. That was good. And then on the
second one, I had a little kind of wing screen action with Jordan going. And
first time, I think it might have been there, too, and Jordan kind of told me,
he's like, run to the rim. And then second time he went and set the screen, he
just yelled, read it. And then I read it, Rob came over the top, I ran to the
rim, had an open pass, Rob found me, and a couple big plays there.  
THE MODERATOR: Rob, your thoughts.  
ROB WILSON: Just like going off what Jared just said. He had the ball in the
post on the first, the plays you guys talking about, I just cut to the rim,
consistent movement. And Jared's a good passer, and he found me. On the second
play, Jared set the screen. He just made himself big and no one was on him so
I just found him.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Guys, Jared, Jordan, at what point did you notice Rob was really in the
zone and really going to stay and he wasn't going to miss?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, start with you.  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Just I think he hit two threes in a row there from the top of
the key, and I think on the second one, it was kind of like‑‑ he's got it
going, especially there in the second half. But like I said, we know Rob can
do that. I've seen him get hot, maybe not in the game to this point, but in
open gym, other stuff like that. We're with each other 45 weeks out of the
year, so I've seen Rob get hot before and it definitely wasn't surprising.  
THE MODERATOR: Jared.  
JARED BERGGREN: I don't know if I can pinpoint a specific point where I knew
that he was hot, but you could definitely feel it and you could see the
confidence in him and it was good. And, I mean, he's been doing this in
practice, in these last few games, and he's really been coming on for us. I
can't honestly say I expected him to have 30 before the game. I knew he was
capable of putting up good numbers, so it was fun to see.  
  
Q. Rob, knowing how well you've played this second half of February and
obviously now into March, knowing your career with Wisconsin is coming to an
end, is there any active change? Are you saying I'm going to go out with a
bang or anything like that?  
ROB WILSON: Yeah. You always want to go out with a bank, but it's that time of
the year when every team in the country steps it up and every player steps it
up because it's tournament time. So that's what I did, stepped up as a
senior's supposed to.  
  
Q. Coach Ryan, you had a ‑‑  
THE MODERATOR: Just student‑athletes right now.  
  
Q. For Jared and Jordan, you've all alluded to the defense did just enough
to get by. How tough is it to defend against Indiana? But also there were two
blocks. Jared, you had one on the jumper, and I think Ryan had one as well.
Those turned out to be key plays.  
JARED BERGGREN: Both those turned out to be pretty big plays. They were kind
of chipping away at our lead and trying to make a comeback, so any time you
can get a stop when they're trying to get a little momentum going, trying to
get the crowd back into it, things like that, both of them are big.  
And I thought we gave up a little more points than we normally do, a little
higher scoring game than what we are really used to playing in, so defensive
effort wasn't great, but like you said, it was enough to get by.  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Jared pretty much said it. They did a great job of just keep
fighting back. And every time we kind of pushed our lead up, they just went to
getting it right back down to two or three or whatever it was. And we just did
a good enough job, like Coach said, to withstand their runs.  
THE MODERATOR: Got time for one more, if there was one. Thanks, fellas. You
may return to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Ryan?  
  
Q. Bo, can you honestly say you saw that coming from Rob?  
COACH RYAN: Pardon me?  
  
Q. Can you honestly say you saw that coming or anything close to that coming
from Rob Wilson?  
COACH RYAN: You know, he's had some streaks on the scalp team. Last year we
probably should have red‑shirted him with the hamstring injury, but he kept
battling through it.  
And because he couldn't do some of the things that that he wanted to do, I
think he withdrew internally somewhat about the aggressiveness to getting
minutes and getting on the floor.  
So sometimes other guys come in and they're performing better. Josh Gasser,
hard to get him to the bench, hard to take his minutes away. It's a
competitive world.  
So what happened was we started talking about the clock ticking one day in the
locker room, and I should have used the term sooner. But with the assistance
and talking about it, it's like ever since‑‑ and he realized, hey, yeah, this
is it. So is that what it takes to‑‑ no, you still have to put the ball in the
basket.  
I mean, there are a lot of guys who can give‑‑ go out there and run around and
really hustle and will do this or that. But in order to execute, that's
something that comes from within.  
He believes every shot he takes is going to go in. We've got some guys on our
team that don't believe that. They try to get us to believe it, but if they
played defense, hustle rebound, things like that, guys can play for us. But
Rob is one of those guys where in streaks, he has done this in practice at
times.  
But did I see 30? No. But I've known some guys that got lucky for one night.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
COACH RYAN: But I don't think that was luck. I wasn't finished.  
THE MODERATOR: I'm sorry.  
COACH RYAN: But that wasn't luck. I mean, you look at those shots, he was
open. His teammates got him the ball. He was squared up. I think he might have
forced one shot, one shot that might not have been a solid follow‑through
finish‑type of shot, round the basket or from 3‑point range.  
And if you want to write down that I should have been playing him more sooner,
feel free. Where were you earlier to say: Hey, how come?  
But we sure enjoy having him and he's worked so hard. His mom was so proud for
Senior Day. First in the family. He's going to get his degree this end of the
spring. It's pretty good stuff. So but we gotta play tomorrow. We got another
40 minutes. So hopefully he has a lot more in him. Okay. That's it for Rob.  
  
Q. Wisconsin has struggled in the tournament in the last couple of years. I
know you're not thinking about the past; you're thinking about this year but
‑‑  
COACH RYAN: Where were you between '04 and '08? Were you doing your job here?  
  
Q. In the past couple years.  
COACH RYAN: Oh, okay. Bad timing.  
  
Q. But does that makes it extra gratifying to be getting a strong start this
year?  
COACH RYAN: I think we beat a good team. I think we came into a tough
environment I think for our guys. You have always want your guys to play as
many games as they can. So we didn't even talk about '08, '09 or '10 and ‑‑ we
just prepared for Indiana. So I can't say that it's any different. Feels good,
but that will die off. And we got a tough one tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. For those of us who don't follow your program, could you talk a little
bit more Rob, just the kind of kid he is, what he's gone through in his time
at Wisconsin, just who he is because he's very quiet.  
COACH RYAN: He is quiet, but, boy, he works. He's always done everything we've
asked.  
You know, as we grow as human beings, there's just certain times in our lives
where maybe things click. I've seen it happen to so many young people. Whether
it's on a basketball court or in the classroom or for people socially, they
become‑‑ they mature a lot. I always think of that cheese that doesn't get
passed because it hasn't matured.  
People mature at different stages and things click at different stages. I'm
just glad that this is his stage. And his teammates really appreciate that,
too, because there's no one who dislikes Rob Wilson. No one.  
  
Q. In addition to Wilson's second ‑half scoring, at halftime, what did you
tell the guys would be the key to victory ‑‑ not the key to victory, but the
key to sustaining the lead the second half, playing on what was essentially
home court advantage for IU?  
COACH RYAN: Well, we've been pretty good on the road so I wasn't concerned
about that. Our guys had confidence away from the Kohl Center. Not
overconfident that's for sure. But they believe they can get things done.  
We just needed to do a better job of‑‑ we had three turnovers in the first
half, and two of them were shot clock violations, not because we were
intentionally taking it down, but the ball got tipped away. And so while the
ball was rolling on the ground, especially on one of them, it gets off in the
corner and then we don't get a chance to get a shot.  
So we were talking about making sure we got a good shot whenever it appeared,
25 seconds on the shot clock, ten, 30. If it's a good shot, we're not knocking
it down. So we reminded them of that.  
And then defensively to try to keep the ball out of the post. Zeller has
improved so much, and I thought we did a good job of making them work, which
if you make somebody work on offense, they're not as good defensively. Or at
least we've seen that a lot of times with bigs.  
So that's what we talked about at halftime, just try to keep it out of post
and take away dribble drives. We must have been‑‑ when I look at the DVD, I'm
sure there were fouls so‑‑ or they wouldn't have called them. But I think we
were half a step behind on several of them. If we could have just gotten our
bodies over there a little bit quicker, we could have done a better job with
their penetration.  
  
Q. Coach, when you ‑‑ in the game in Madison, I think you guys made four 3s.
You made 13 today. Was it a more of a point of emphasis? Were the shots just
there?   
COACH RYAN: No, shots were there. I mean, that's what we got. Those were the
looks. I thought our guys moved the ball extremely well. Wasn't that Indiana
wasn't playing good defense. I just thought we made the extra pass several
times. And I thought guys spaced better than we had in some games. And I think
that allowed for open looks.  
  
Q. Some criticize the Wisconsin style. Do games like today answer that
criticism or how do you ‑‑  
COACH RYAN: I never heard anybody.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what Bud Foster has meant to the Wisconsin
program? I know that obviously you passed him in wins today, not about that
achievement, but what he meant to this program.  
COACH RYAN: Well, he won a national championship. There are schools that don't
have any. A lot of schools. Wisconsin has one. And that team he had was pretty
good. I had a chance to meet some of those guys and I had a chance to meet
Coach Foster. A gentleman, first class, a guy you definitely would want to
play for. Stuck up for his players. And obviously did a pretty good job
because he lasted 20‑some years in the Big Ten, and that's hard to do. Even
back then. He's a good man.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  73  
Minnesota  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Beilein to make an opening statement, then go
to questions for the student‑athletes. Coach?  
COACH BEILEIN: Minnesota, in the beginning of the first half, just showed
incredible quickness. We were‑‑ I think it put us back on our heels
immediately. We hadn't seen that, that type of defense, and it was great to
start the game. And it took us a while, dug us into a big hole.  
I'm really proud of our guys, the way we fought back. If you watched our team
on the floor, there was always poise; they were working very hard; there was a
lot of diligence involved in what they were doing. And just the ball got
bounced our way and it did at the end. We wouldn't get in that position if
these guys didn't stay persistent and keep their poise during that game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Trey, Tim, and Zack.  
  
Q. Zack, how hard is it to guard against complacency, when you win the Big
Ten and after what you went through last week and then to come into this
tournament?  
ZACK NOVACK: With this group of guys, it's not very difficult. I think if
anything, what we saw today is‑‑ we had a longer layover than we've had in a
while. And that team, they played really well. You gotta give them a lot of
credit. They made big shots. They played with a lot of energy, and it kind of
took us some time to get back into the flow of things.  
But complacency is not a huge thing that I worry about with this group. We're
pretty focused.  
  
Q. Guys, any of you can talk about the last sequence before Evan's 3
‑pointer that tied the game at the end of regulation.   
THE MODERATOR: Tim, take that one.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Talk about what now? Oh, every 3 was huge. I think that was
the first bucket that he made throughout the whole entire game and, you know,
it came out the a great time. We ran our play, out‑of‑bounds‑play. It didn't
work. Stu got the ball. Didn't force anything up, and then they left Evan wide
open, and he's been making shots like that in practice all year long and
throughout the season, so we had total confidence in him making that shot.  
  
Q. With about four minutes, to take that 9 ‑point lead on Rodney Williams'
dunk, Trey, can you just talk about how this team maintained its composure to
send this game into overtime and then win it?  
TREY BURKE: We maintained our composure the whole game. Once they went up, we
just continued to huddle up every kind of ball and every chance we got. We
just kept telling each other that we weren't going to win it on the offensive
side; it was going to be the defensive side that was going to help us come out
with the win. That's what we did. We got down late in the game and our bigs
stepped up and Zack, Tim, we all stepped up on the defensive end and we sent
it into overtime, and that gave us another chance to get the win.  
  
Q. Zack, talk a little bit about ‑‑ I think you guys hit five straight
3‑pointers at the end of regulation and three to start the overtime. Just talk
about that sequence right there, how that propels you for the win?  
ZACK NOVACK: Yeah, I think that's why we're a pretty dangerous team, because
we have multiple people that can get it going, an knock down shots when
they're open. So except for these two right here, our whole team had been
struggling. So you give guys credit.  
Evan, on the bench a long time, comes in the game, was able to knock down a
shot. Trey's doing whatever he wants, so I pretty much get wide open there for
one. I think Tim hit me on another one.  
And when you got two guys that garner so much attention, you know, and guys
can get wide‑open shots, then that's our job to knock it down.  
  
Q. Trey, can you talk about the momentum you felt at the start overtime
after having come back from nine points at the end of the second half?  
TREY BURKE: Well, we came without a different attitude as a team. Like I said,
it was the defensive end. We came out, you know, overtime, I think we had‑‑ we
didn't score in the first possession, but we knew that was gonna be on the
defensive end. We locked down, got on the boards, and we just came out with
another mindset as a team. As a team, we came out, we told each other that
we're already together and things like that, and we got the win.  
  
Q. Zack, how frustrating was most of that game for you? Was it just shots
not falling for you or just something that they were doing?  
ZACK NOVACK: You know, they just did a really good job just flying at me. And
they're so athletic and just long. So for me, struggled a little bit just
getting it over them. But thankfully, there at the end, like I said, these
guys were so hot that I was finally able to get freed up a little bit and
knock them down.  
  
Q. Zack, does this help a team agreed for the NCAA Tournament when you get a
game like this, a scrappy game like this?  
ZACK NOVACK: Without a doubt. Sometimes you like to see your team go through a
little bit of‑‑ through a little trouble like that to see how they're going to
respond and see how tough we are. I think we passed the test today. We played
a team that was fighting for their lives. They came to play and they played
very well.  
And for us, we didn't do some of the things that we typically do. To able come
out this game with a win is huge, and that's what you gotta do at this time of
the year.  
  
Q. Trey, you had scored 27 against Minnesota during the season. Did you
think you could get your shots against this team tonight? Were you trying to
be a little more aggressive looking for your shot? Or just your mindset
offensively tonight.  
TREY BURKE: Well, the coaches just tell me to take whatever the defense gave
me. We seen that in the first half. They had a little trouble guarding the
pick‑and‑roll action, so the top of the key was kind of open for an 8‑foot
jump shot. Towards the second half, they were kind of making me not use the
screen, so it allowed us to get be able to get down in the lane and shoot
lay‑ups. And a couple times they had pinched in, and that's when I hit the
shooters on the wing. Like we say, we knocked down big shots when it mattered.  
  
Q. You guys have been really good with end game adjustments the entire year,
but you didn't have the lead the first half. So can you talk about what you
did to adjust and actually grab the momentum in the second half?  
THE MODERATOR: Tim, take that one.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Yeah. I think just coming out and we've been in these
situations before, especially during the regular season versus Northwestern at
home. We were down by eight or seven at halftime, and we just worked our way
back, got in overtime, and made sure we took care of business.  
We're not afraid of these type of moments. We just keep on fighting and just
let the best come to us and just try to take what our defense gives us.  
  
Q. Zack, what makes it this team so good in late ‑game situations when it
comes down to the wire?  
ZACK NOVACK: You know, early on in the year, we did our back‑to‑back
situations every day where, you know, if you scored a bucket, it wasn't a
point and if you got a stop it wasn't a point. You had to do it on consecutive
possessions.  
And I think that's really what's propelled us is that kind of no matter what's
happening in the game, we're not making shots or they've exploited us on
defense. For whatever reason, that last four minutes comes and we just‑‑ we
become different people I think. And we've just‑‑ everyone's locked in and
we've been on it.  
And I think we've been through it so much times at this point with this group,
you know, with the exception of Trey, everybody played major minutes. They're
pretty much upper classmen now, and he's like an upper classman.  
But I think when you've got that type of group with that experience, late
game, when‑‑ there's nothing we haven't seen.  
  
Q. Tim, this is your third straight really solid game, scoring 20 despite
only making one 3 ‑pointer. Do you feel like you're finally getting into a
grove this season, near the end?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Yeah, most definitely. And it just comes from practice and
my teammates behind my back a hundred percent and just sticking with me
through rough times and the good times.  
So just getting in the gym, getting extra reps up. These guys right here and
Stu and Evans, as you know, is very key for me and just giving me momentum
going into practice to make sure I knock down shots and momentum going into
the game.  
  
Q. Zack, two guys sitting next to you combined for 50. At what point tonight
did you guys just say, let's get out of their way, let them take over here?  
ZACK NOVACK: Well, Trey had it going from the beginning. I think we saw that.
That's kind of how it typically is, though. I just kind of let them do their
thing. And if I've open, then throw it to me. And if not, do what you do.  
Then Tim came out in the second half and really got it going, hit some big
shots and jump‑started us offensively because we had struggled a little bit
except for Trey. So we got that other person going. Just looking at stats,
they both played incredible. Without them stepping up, we don't win this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You may go back to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously some struggles on the boards. How difficult is it to
just ‑‑ when you don't have that extra body in Jon Horford, some of the things
he's been able to help you with in the past?  
COACH BEILEIN: That was I think the most frustrating part of the beginning of
the game. That's why I'm so proud of them. We had‑‑ their athleticism. I think
we had three lay‑ups, two of them were pinned against the backboard. And then
coming down, sometimes it was four or five possessions. The ball's in the air,
we have to do a great job of boxing out and sometimes it's not enough.  
We missed that sometimes, but you basically‑‑ some of our young men had to
just‑‑ not even trying to get the ball, just get into the guys' legs and let
Trey come and get the rebound because if we're getting in a jumping contest
with some of them, we can't do that.  
It's been difficult all year. You see once we went to a four‑guard lineup,
that really has hurt us, but it's given us some things on the other side.  
  
Q. Zack and Stu didn't do much offensively for almost the whole game, but
they still came back and hit some really big shots near the end. Talk about
their ‑‑  
COACH BEILEIN: I think it was part of the Minnesota game plan that they were
going to not give help off of them. Some of the action we do is based on if
you're going to give help, we have one action; if you don't give help, then
we're trying to exploit the drives. We only got five 3s off in the first half,
which means they weren't giving help.  
It's sort of a middle‑of‑the‑court attack that we use at that time, and
certainly it allows us to play two on two or three on three. And that was
their choice. So it worked very well for a long time, and then we just got
enough penetration at times and enough confusion through some things that we
got some guys open. Got them open.  
  
Q. Down nine late in the timeout, can you look at your players and can you
see in their eyes that ‑‑  
COACH BEILEIN: I was very thankful. I think there was four or five minutes
left. That was enough for us, that we can do that. We just needed to get open
a little bit, and we had to really‑‑ we simplified things a lot at that point
and really tried to play off Trey's penetration.  
And I think even in that point, we missed‑‑ I think we missed a couple of foul
shots or a one and one. I think we missed two lay‑ups and a little pull‑up
jump shot all during that time. But they didn't‑‑ here's the big difference
for this team.  
When they have those times, we went down and guarded. When we didn't get
stops, we got stops. Or when we got stopped, we got stops on the other end.
That was big. That could have been seven or eight the whole time. It's nine.
We don't score, well, but then we score the next time because it was still
nine or it was because it was still six. Our defense won that part of it.  
  
Q. John what impressed you most about Burke's performance tonight?  
COACH BEILEIN: The story just keeps going on because I feel like sometimes I'm
talking to a senior. He is talking to me in the game about things that he
thinks we can use in our offense. And it's a pleasure. It's a wonder to have a
guy who understands basketball at 19 years old as a freshman like he does. So
he's easy to coach.  
He wants to win more than he wants to score points, but he also is not afraid
to take it at people. And then his foul line performance, although down the
stretch there of going four‑‑ I think it was four for four, when we were
trying to get away from them and we were trading baskets was huge as well.
Poise.  
  
Q. Timeout with about three minutes left, you had a big speech about all the
experience that they've had all season. Can you talk about what you said to
them?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think we've been in so many tight games, if that's the one
you're talking about, that we had beenthrough so much, this is nothing right
now for us to be‑‑ they had to win games. We have been winning close games.
We're used to that. We just gotta do the right things.  
And it was all going to be about our stops. It wasn't going to be what we
dialed up on offense. It was going to be our stops. And they got that, and
then when we did that up on offense, the kids had to make big shots. And just
all of them, the shooters said, what we need, tonight, you're practicing a
lot, we need you right now. So if you're open, knock it down. And sure enough
we did.  
  
Q. John, just getting back to Stu and Zack for a second, you mentioned that
Minnesota dictated their keeping them from getting shots early, but they still
had to make shots at the end when they're open after they haven't scored all
night. Can you talk about the mental toughness that ‑‑  
COACH BEILEIN: That was Evan as well. Evan was in foul trouble the whole time,
and those are big‑‑ that's who those guys are. They're not the guy that's
going to go in and be a highlight films. They are a highlight film in how to
play steady, good, solid basketball. That's their highlight film.  
You talk to a lot of coaches, that's what we prefer to have many times. You
gotta have those glue guys to get it done. And whether they get two or three
in a row early in the game or hit two or three in a row late in the game,
they're the same guy. They just want the ball in their hands if, in fact, it's
the right team shot.  
They don't get thirsty, so to speak, if they're not getting their shots. They
way wait for the game to come to them, and that's what's made our team so
resilient this year and so solid.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  92  
Iowa  75

  
MODERATOR: Opening statement from Coach, then go to questions for Draymond and
Keith. Coach.  
COACH IZZO: I thought Draymond didn't have one of his better games, even
though his stats did, and I see why now, because he can't even keep clear of
his water. But turnover.  
You know, I thought actually, I thought we started off kind of sluggish and
weren't very good defensively early. And then these two guys picked it up. I
thought they both played outstanding. I thought we got a lot of Adreian Payne
early, and after that 20‑20, I thought we really started checking better.  
But what did impress me today was our passing and our unselfishness for
three‑fourths of that game. I thought it reared its ugly head a little bit at
the end, but I thought we were very unselfish. And we had to get a lot of guys
in, guys that haven't played because of the foul trouble that he had. Thornton
was sick again and he was struggling and both Nix and Payne were in foul
trouble.  
So all of a sudden, Byrd comes in and he makes his shot, and, you know, we got
some minutes for him. We got Trice a few more minutes, which I was amazed that
he was able to play after the ankle thing again on Wednesday. And yet a lot of
work to do defensively now. But offensively, we really moved the ball and
played pretty well.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Draymond, for you, when you went out with two ‑‑ with two fouls in the
first half, the team seemed to really step it up for you. You've played great
games before and didn't win. Watching you on the sidelines as they started to
play when you went out, you became their biggest cheerleader. How important is
it for this team that they step around you?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: That's very important. I think Keith played a great game
today, and I thought that was big for us the way‑‑ you may look at his stats
and say he only shot three for three. He made all three of his shots. And the
big thing for me with him was six assists and only two turnovers, and that was
really big. Plus I think he played a great forward lane. And when I went out
the game, he really took the game over and got us some great things and that
was really big for us.  
So far as me going to the bench, I'm a big guy on history, and I just always
remember back when Mateen Cleaves was injured and the one memory that sticks
in my mind when they were down there beating North Carolina, the biggest
cheerleader on the bench, and that kind of lifts his guys up, and that's what
I tried to do for my guys as well.  
  
Q. Keith, how much easier is your job when Travis is heathy and playing well
like did he today?  
KEITH APPLING: It's a lot easier. It gives me break. I get to come off the
bus, I can kind of coach him when I'm on floor. It makes my job a lot easier,
posting and playing on the ball. All 30 minutes it hadn't changed, the other
team's best player.  
MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Draymond, you probably won't play him a whole lot, but if you get Indiana
tomorrow, can you talk about what it's like playing Cody Zeller, what issues
he presents?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Cody's a great player. That's why he's Big Ten Freshman of the
Year, and that's why that team is where they're at. They still have the
majority of the same guys, they just came and take that program to a
completely different level. But at the end of day, we still have to go into
this next game with open minds, knowing that it's not set in stone whether
we're going to play Indiana. Wisconsin is a great team as well.  
So it's going to be a brawl out there. We're just going to watch the game and
get a good feel for both of them. It's not like we haven't played both of them
twice, which is an advantage. Only had to play Iowa once, kind of get a better
feel for them.  
But if we do play Indiana, Cody, he went off on his last time down there, and
that will be something that we'll have to do a better job of, but when you're
playing a great player like that, you just try to contain him. It's almost
impossible to stop great players, but if you can contain him, you have a
better chance.  
  
Q. Draymond, can you talk a little bit about Adreian's performance today and
his career high of 16.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: It was a great performance for him. I was on the bench yelling
at him because he only had one rebound the second half, and that's another
step. We're trying to get him and Nix to take his rebound better. I think he
did a great job tonight. I think I started off really slow and he carried the
load for us him, and then Keith, so that was pretty big for us.  
But we know the potential that Adreian has and the things that he can do. It
was just a matter of him going hard every second that he's on the floor. And
today he did that and he came up with some huge rebounds for us, some huge
buckets for us. But I think the one thing I was impressed with early is how
unselfish he was. He finished first half with I think 12 and 6, and he was
very unselfish passing out of the post, so that was big for us.  
  
Q. Draymond, just talk about bouncing back from those two losses and how
important it is for you guys to start the month of March off this way.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: It's very important because, until Coach reminded us before
the game, I forgot we had two losses in a row before for the simple fact it's
a brand‑new season, and I just completely forgot about it. And knowing that we
were 0‑0 and we had new life and can start all over again.  
So to get a win coming out, like Coach said after the game, we're 1‑0, now one
step closer, but we gotta keep it going. And I think a part of that was when
ratcheted up on the defensive end, everything changed for us. And that's
what's been good for us throughout the season.  
If you look back at the last couple games that we did lose, first half against
Ohio State, we defended very well and we had a 17‑point lead. Indiana we
didn't defend at all and we lost by 17.  
So I think that's going to be the key to us, just keep on defending, staying
consistent on the defensive end. And we didn't start out good today, and
tomorrow if we don't start off good on the defensive end, it could cost us, so
we just gotta make sure we keep on nailing that into the ground.  
MODERATOR: Additional questions? Anybody? Okay, fellas, you may return to the
locker room.  
Questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. Tom, with about four and a half minutes left in the first half, we were
watching and Adreian started barking out and communicating with his teammates.
And for him, you've talked so much about the things he has to do to improve.
At one point you looked around, I think you looked at D.J., like, am I
watching what I'm seeing? Will you talk about how big that was, please.  
COACH IZZO: You head my mind. I said is that Adreian or an imposter. And
Adreian did a great job. I thought at the end we were trying to play‑‑ I have
so many new guys now that I gotta get into that rotation. One thing is Adreian
playing the floor so I can go bigger if I have to. One is those other guys
understanding that sometimes it's time to build the lead and hold the lead.  
All in all, I thought Adreian did a great job early. He blocked some shots, he
got some rebounds, but he is communicating better on defense. We made a couple
of adjustments on those ball screens right off the bat. First time out, they
hit three 3s I think early. He adjusted to it. It was the most focused I've
seen him, and he's had‑‑ we sat there on the bench before the game, had two
big, great practices, and we felt the number one key of the game was
transition defense, especially with the bigs because they run so well. And the
second one was rebounding because they had rebounded so well against Illinois,
and those two things were big for us today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about coaching against Bruce Weber and just your
thoughts on him leaving the league now?  
COACH IZZO: How about if we do this, because I do have something to say about
that. How about if we hold that until the end because I'd like to say some
good things about my team and I'd like to get to some things that I think are
not very good. I will come back to it, I promise.  
  
Q. With Payne, did the pace of the game help him or is he just at the point
where maybe he's able to play with the flow of the game more and not worry too
much ‑‑  
COACH IZZO: You know, I think he's growing. I think all sophomores‑‑ we're in
such a screwed up society, where we try to speed everything up. And normal
maturation process of kids is Freshman and Sophomore Years, most of them take
to get there, and we're in the Kentucky mode now where every Freshman and
Sophomore is supposed to be at a certain level.  
And I do think we got to remember he was out more or less all last year. He
lost the year because of the injury, and he's actually making some progress.
He frustrates me sometimes because I think he has so much to give, and yet
I've been really pleased that his practicing has been better. I think it's him
maturing, not the pace of the game. I thought it was him maturing because he's
getting stronger. He's able to bank more. He's got great skills in there. He
can shoot left and right hand jump hooks. And the little jump hook on the
baseline was a pretty play, so I think Adreian is starting to take some steps.  
  
Q. Tom, two parts: Can you talk a little bit about what Trice brought. You
mentioned the passing of the ball a little bit. And also Woods's defense on
Gatens.  
COACH IZZO: I told Wood, I gave him a little star at the end, pasted it on his
melon here. It was great because I think that was one thing he came in,
everybody questioned his defense, and he's been a little up and down and we've
missed‑‑ I didn't think he did as good a job on Buford but I'm not sure
anybody could have covered him. He hit three or four big‑time shots. But we
did a pretty good job on him.  
And I don't think Gatens was quite as fresh as he was yesterday. So it was
probably a combination. But it's nice to see Wood step up. He made some shots.
He got a couple rebounds and he definitely defended better than he's defended
probably in his life.  
  
Q. Tom, talk about the number of guys you gotta work into the rotation.
Russel Byrd, eight points tonight. What did you say to him? He air balls a 3
and then you guys have an exchange. What did you say to same at that moment?  
COACH IZZO: Let me give you the PG version: What the hell you doing out there?  
When a great shooter shots a air ball, it means it's a bad shot, he rushed it.
Right now, Russel is like a kid learning to walk again. It's been a year and a
half and he's‑‑ we've all been waiting for him to come back. Unfortunately, it
isn't going to happen this year like we'd hoped, but he is getting a little
better. And if he sets his feet, then someday he's going to be great, great,
you know, I'm hoping in the Diebler mode, a guy that can really just stroke it
if he sets his feet and gets himself ready.  
But Russ's mind is going a thousand RPMs and his body is going about ten. So
he's‑‑ the coordination of it just isn't there yet. So when he's really set,
he nails it. When he tries to rush it, I mean, you never see a great shooter
take two‑foot air balls, missed by two feet.  
And that's what I told him. I said, hey, it's your fault. You rushed it.
You're not there yet. Frustrating for you, but that's the way it is.  
  
Q. Zeller, has he met or exceeded your expectations /and in your 25 years
around the league, can you think of a guy with similar characteristics?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I hate to say this. I do hate to comment on it. I think
Wisconsin is awfully good, too. And this isn't a Zeller press conference, but
I do love the kid. I think he's a great a kid. I think he has a variety of
good skills offensively and defensively. I mean, I think he's‑‑ what he is is
an extremely solid player. When the date comes where there's some flash to his
game, which will, it will be scary because right now, he's just like solid
right hand, left hand. He can do things. He can shoot at the 15, he can make
free‑throws, he can block shots. His defense is pretty good. Nothing bothers
him. He does not get frustrated. You could probably punch him in the mouth or
you could kiss him and it doesn't seem to affect him either way. And I'm sure
some day he'll show a little more passion, and then he goes from very, very
good to, you know, I think one of the better players that has ever played in
our league if he sticks with it.  
But I've been very impressed with Cody Zeller, very impressed with the job Tom
has done with him, very impressed with the fact that some days he gets the
ball and some days he doesn't. And again, nothing bothers him. Impressive.  
  
Q. When you've had so many teams put it together in March, are there certain
thing you're always looking for this time of year? A look in the face, a look
on the court? And if there are, are you seeing them right now with this
team?  
COACH IZZO: That's funny because I wasn't real happy with my team the last
five, six minutes. And I was trying to explain to them in the locker room that
there's a time when you put the second team in and you just let them go. But
those guys are going to have to play tomorrow because I know where we're at.  
So we're still very inexperienced, but when you gotta have it, you gotta have
some toughness, we had some. And you gotta have a leader, and we got a great
one. And you gotta know that whoever you play, it's not going to be any harder
than North Carolina on an aircraft carrier with the President sitting there.
So you got things to look back at and say, been there, done that.  
And this team, it has I think the energy to make a little run. What worries
me, Thornton still worries me, you know, coming around, and the loss of D.J.
But Trice playing better today, I didn't know if he could play, guys, to be
honest with you. So he surprised me twice, and that helps.  
But you gotta have a go‑to guy, and we got one. We got one that can‑‑ he's the
only one that didn't make a three today. And right now he's been shooting the
best of anybody. And he gets five assists, he can hurt you in a lot of
different ways.  
And I think also you usually got to be able defend and rebound in this
tournament because you don't have many 90‑point games in the NCAA Tournament
or in this kind of tournament. And I think we do that pretty well most of the
time. Although today, it let us down a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR: Do you want to address the Coach Weber situation?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, what was your question? I'm sick about it. I'm sick about
it. And I'm sick about it‑‑ and make sure you understand the reason why.  
They beat us early in January and I beat Ohio State, and so I have three
problems. Bruce is a friend of mine. He's been here since the Gene Keady days.
He's done it the right way. He doesn't cheat. He man's up to his own
responsibilities. Incredible incredible person. I've recruited against him and
lost and I've recruited against him and won, and hasn't changed things.  
Number two, we have to understand that we blame kids for a lot of things. Kids
have changed. Now we have administrators that are pulling the rug under
ourselves in the middle of January when you're 16 and 6 or 7 or whatever it
was, and we publicly talk about‑‑ we'll make decisions at the end of the year.  
I don't know what you guys think of kids because they haven't changed much,
but if there's one place they've changed, they're a little more fragile. Not
as many two‑parent homes. Not as good a school systems that are holding kids
accountable and demanding. And so now we put that on those poor kids? And then
we're surprised that they lose nine out of ten?  
I don't know who's beaten me the worst, probably Bo, but second on that list‑‑
and I'm canonized as something some of the time.  
I think it was ridiculous the way that thing was handled. And if I take abuse
for that, I really don't care because I'm also the president of our
association. This isn't about a friendship. This is about a profession.  
And whenever you're in an organization, whether it be yours, whether it be
mine, or whether it be a business one, the only way you can be successful is
if, top to bottom, from the president to the trainer, we're all on the same
page, and that in five, six months you can determine something.  
I feel bad for the Illini nation because somebody's‑‑ somebody pulled the rug
out from under them. I feel bad for those players that have been there that,
in my estimation, weren't given a fair chance back about the middle of
January, whenever that famous statement was made.  
But if you look at that team from that statement, it went directly down. And I
feel worse for Bruce because we lost a good soldier. And yeah, friendship is
some of it, but it's not all of it. We lost a good coach. We got a coach that
beat me and my team more often than not, and I just‑‑ I can't figure that out.  
I can't figure out how you guys allow it. You guys are always figuring out the
negatives of things. I can't figure out how you guys allow it.  
And my wife and I shed a tear this morning over it, and it was half for Bruce
and half for my profession.  
But unless there's things‑‑ and I will publicly state this‑‑ that I don't
know, but when I heard those comments back in January, it made me sick and I
said there's a problem.  
And so I hope the administrators that made those statements have a good game
plan, but you guys lost a good guy, we lost a good guy, and I think‑‑ I just
hope he gets another job. And I'm going to do everything in my power to help
him.  
And I guess that's all I'll say because I'll probably put my foot in my mouth
because if it was HBO, we could get at it right now and I'd really be fired up
about it, because I just think‑‑ I can't believe‑‑ I can't believe nobody's
looked at when those comments were made and where that team went.  
I mean, this guy has won more games than anybody‑‑ percentage than anybody
that's been at the school. And he's done it the right way, and that's not easy
to do. And it's not an easy job there. And when a big time recruits father, I
think‑‑ watch what I say here‑‑ comes out and makes statements, I mean, you
better have a good idea the guy you're dealing with.  
And I know this. I've known Bruce Weber since the day I was a grad assistant.
There's not a classier, better guy‑‑ and I don't want to just hear he's a nice
guy‑‑ better coach. He's had some things thrown at him, too, with injuries and
guys leaving early and stuff like that.  
So I'm sad, more sad for my profession than I am for Bruce because he's a man.
I've seen him in his press conference. He'll man‑up and he'll get it done.  
So sorry I had to gun on a soapbox, but I'll leave it at that. And if there's
any other questions.  
MODERATOR: We'll let you go, Coach. Thank you very much.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Brandon Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20596)

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  79  
Nebraska  61

  
MODERATOR: Coach Sadler will make an opening statement and then we'll go to
questions for the student‑athletes.  
Coach?  
COACH SADLER: Well, I thought starting the basketball game, I was really
pleased with our effort, and I thought our guys played really hard and the
game was going along there. And there's about a six‑ or seven‑minute span
there in the first half that we didn't get the ball inside and we got them in
the foul trouble a little bit to where we could go with the bonus, but we
didn't take advantage of it as much as we needed to. But then we finished the
first half pretty strong and kept the ballgame down under 10 and started the
second half going inside and got some easy baskets, cut the lead and didn't‑‑
the whole night defensively they just kept us completely‑‑ they kept us
completely off balance.  
I mean, we knew going into the game that we wanted to take away the lane, and
that's something that we definitely didn't do. And you give a team 13 threes,
I think that's the same amount that we gave them before. Maybe they didn't
have 13 tonight, they had‑‑ yeah, 13 tonight also. And you can't give them the
lane and the 3‑point, and that's what we did, and we came up a little bit
short.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Brandon and Bo?  
  
Q. Brandon, just in general, how would you summarize this season?  
BRANDON RICHARDSON: It's been a tough season, especially not playing with Diaz
and Andre Almeida due to injuries. But we didn't never use that as an excuse.
We went out there and we competed and we gave it all we got. And we came up
short for the most part, but I'm proud of our guys. They stuck in there. We
fought to the end. And I couldn't be prouder of our guys.  
MODERATOR: Other questions? Anybody? All right. Fellas, you may go back to the
locker room.  
Questions for Coach Sadler?  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the first season in the Big Ten and your
overall thoughts about the transition going from the Big 12 to the Big Ten?  
COACH SADLER: Well, again, I think obviously both leagues are very, very good.
And I've said on numerous occasions the Big 12 and the Big Ten is two totally
different leagues, kind of like in football. In the Big 12 it's a more
athletic, faster league. In the Big Ten I think the players are more mature.
They're older. I think the teams are much tougher, and only because of the
upper classmen.  
But both leagues are very, very good. The five years that I spent in the Big
12, I mean, at times it was considered the best league in the country. This
year this league is considered the best league in the country. So I've had the
great opportunity to be in two great leagues for six years and it's been fun.  
Obviously we're disappointed in what we did in our first year, but at the same
time it's a fun league to coach in because you've got to compete really,
really hard. Possessions are going to be very, very important. It's just a
totally different basketball game than it is in the Big 12.  
MODERATOR: Other questions? Anybody? Okay.  
Thank you, Coach.  
COACH SADLER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Meyers Leonard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23350)

### [D.J. Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20660)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  64  
Illinois - 61

  
MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Weber to make an opening statement and then go to
questions for D.J. and Meyers. Coach.  
COACH WEBER: Well, I thought we played with great energy at the start, and
that was the thing we had talked about. You know, D.J. came out and made some
shots. When we had the opportunity, got it to Meyers. And then I thought a big
basket finished the half by D.J., gave us good momentum into the second half.
And then you get a little run, I think, 40‑33\.  
And to Iowa's credit, at that point in the game you can go one way or another,
and they made the plays. For us it's just that gut check part of the game.
We've talked about it, where you get to that brick wall in the game and you've
got to make a decision on how bad you want it and how you're going to maintain
a lead.  
But we turned it over. We got killed on boards in the second half. And they
made plays. I think Oglesby with the 40‑33, Oglesby with a big three, Gatens
with a three, and then I think the steal by Gatens.  
And then you could just see our body language. We kept trying to be positive,
pump them up. And, again, to our kids' credit, it's been a great group. I just
feel bad for them that they haven't had more success. And they didn't quit,
down to the last play.  
So we'll go from here. The NIT is a possibility. I think we're probably a
bubble. Just depends what happens in other things. But I think our kids want
to play if we have that opportunity, and we'll just see what happens.  
MODERATOR: Questions for student‑athletes. Raise your hand. I'll get mic out
to you.  
  
Q. For Meyers, can you just talk about how difficult the last few months
have been with the losing and just everything this program has endured
recently?  
MEYERS LEONARD: You know, it's been a very tough situation. Like Coach Weber
always says, we have a great group of kids and a great coaching staff and just
a great environment. Obviously we went through a tough stretch with all the
losses and just some down moments in the season.  
We definitely showed some great moments with the win against Ohio State.
Michigan State was a big win. And early in the season we had some success,
but, you know, like the last week in media we were just kind of missing that
one thing. I'm not really sure what it is and I still don't know to this day.  
We have so much talent. I was talking to Tracy after the game. We just have, I
feel, like every piece that a team could possibly need, but we're just missing
that one thing. It was hard. But off the court, great group of kids. Probably
the best team I've ever been a part of. Each and every one of them means a lot
to me, along with the coaching staff, and they always know if they call me and
need something, I'm going to be there for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. D.J., did any rumors with your coaching situation ‑‑ did that wear on you
at all? Did it affect things in recent weeks?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: No, not at all. You hear stuff going around campus, you know.
People say stuff here and there. But we still did what we had to do, and coach
still coached us, and he did a good job of just getting us through a tough
situation. And, you know, me and Brandon the upper classmen, being leaders, we
try whatever we can to help coach out on the court. We're out there, and we're
out there making the turnover. So coach is doing a good job of coaching, and
we just gotta do a better job out there on the court.  
  
Q. Both the players, could you talk about what was going on with Brandon
Paul today? He's obviously very talented and things weren't going well for
him. What did you guys see?  
MODERATOR: D.J., let's start with you, please.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Brandon kind of struggled tonight. He couldn't get it going
offensively. First half he did a pretty good job on Gatens. His offense wasn't
too good tonight, but first half he didn't do a good job on Gatens. Second
half we kind of switched off on him, and obviously he performed better. He
stayed consistent. He did some good things for us the last couple of games.
You've got to stay consistent.  
  
Q. You guys were up by seven, and then it seemed just within a couple
minutes they're up by seven. Can you describe what changed the momentum
there?  
MODERATOR: Meyers?  
MEYERS LEONARD: We had a couple crucial turnovers I recall. One on an inbounds
play. And kind of missed some defensive assignments. Oglesby, like coach said,
hit the three. Gatens got the steal off of us, hit another three. He just kind
of made a run. I'm not really sure what happened.  
We definitely lost focus there for a minute. And like coach said, we weren't
able to get through the wall. We didn't stop playing, but we just we missed
some assignments and maybe just weren't cutting enough, cutting hard enough
and just executing the way we should. Because whenever we went to whatever
coach said to do on offense rather than doing our own thing, it seemed to
work. So I think if we were more cut in and able to execute better, it
probably would have turned out a different way.  
MODERATOR: Time for a couple more.  
  
Q. Coach brought up the NIT. Is that the something that you guys feel that
you could get up to want to be in?  
MODERATOR: D.J.?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: I mean, it's always great to play in the NCAA. We have a
great group of guys, like Coach and Meyers said. We just want to keep playing
games. And it's fun being around these guys, you know. This is the best group
of basketball players I've ever been around. I love everybody on the team, and
we love each other.  
We had chemistry throughout the whole year starting in Italy. The NIT, you
know, if that's what we have to do, we'll go there and try and win some games
there and try to win the championship.  
MODERATOR: One more for these guys.  
Okay, fellows, you can go back to the locker room. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Weber? Anybody?  
  
Q. Bruce, obviously you've talked a lot, I guess, about the struggles
throughout the latter part of this season, but now you're at a point where you
know you're not going to make NCAA tournament, can you kind of reflect on
where this kind of went wrong for you all?  
COACH WEBER: Well, we were a young, inexperienced team going into it. I'm not
sure where people's expectations were. You always expect to be successful as a
coach. And it's a group. We went to Italy. I thought we developed, as they
said, some good chemistry.  
We started out pretty well. We didn't play pretty basketball, but we were
finding ways to win with defense and hustle and togetherness and won some
close games.  
You know, I think a lot of people probably feel maybe the Ohio State game was
maybe the turning point because all of a sudden expectations changed, mindsets
changed. And then I don't think it was really a good situation after Ohio
State to have nine days off, and that I think‑‑ and then you had two buys in a
short period of time and then all of a sudden you lose a couple close games.
Grumbling starts and‑‑ but, again, I've said all along, they haven't quit.
They come to practice. They have great spirit.  
I think they want to win sometimes too much. Like tonight when the other team
made the run, instead of, like Meyers said, just executing, guys would just go
try to make plays. And we've emphasized the whole time, you've got to execute
and let the team win the game, not the individual.  
So, you know, our spirit was tested. There's no doubt. But they hung in there,
and they hung in there until the end today.  
  
Q. Bruce, what was your take on Brandon's situation today? What was going on
with him?  
COACH WEBER: I think he's had a tendency all year to force things and try to
do too much, and then once it started going bad, I think he just kept, you
know, going and trying to do‑‑ trying to make the big play. And then you
start‑‑ you know, you hang your head, and now you're worried about the next
play and then he turns it over, whatever.  
And I think down the stretch he just was trying to make plays for us. And,
again, that's been one of our problems. Let the team do it. Move the
basketball. Get it to people. And so he did a good job on Gatens first half.
Second half he slipped a little bit.  
  
Q. Bruce, it's been such a rough ride for you and the team the last couple
months. Your thoughts ‑‑ is there relief here? Is it disappointment? Are you
playing‑‑  
COACH WEBER: When you lose and don't have success as coach, of course there's
disappointment. And, you know, that's why you coach, to help your team be
successful. And so you just‑‑ all you can do is come every day and give your
best effort.  
And I thought our staff did, our kids did. We just‑‑ you know, again, you have
zero free throws today. Certain things, sometimes it's not meant to be.  
You can go back to the Minnesota game, the call at the end of the game. We
should have won the game. And all those things just kind of add up, and
sometimes life isn't fair. Basketball's not fair. It humbles you, and you have
to keep plugging in life, you have to keep plugging in basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, have you ever been in a game where you show the no free throws as
a team?  
COACH WEBER: I don't think so. Not that I can remember. I didn't realize it
until about midway through the second half, and then I reminded the guys that
control that, but it didn't seem to do any good.  
So, you know, we shot‑‑ we shoot jump shots. They got to the free throw line
with offensive rebounds and they got it inside a little bit. But Meyers gets
fouled all the time, and it's really baffling to me how they can call touch
fouls away from the basket and then they can let people beat up big guys. And
it's almost a disadvantage to have a big guy at times, to be honest.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Meyers, seems like for stretches like he could dominate in that game, but
yet the last 10 minutes, touches, shots weren't there. What did you see?  
COACH WEBER: We turned it over. Quite a few possessions. We had some open
shots. Sam made the three, had a wide open one after that. And we haven't shot
the three very well all year.  
But that's where you've got to execute and be patient and make sure you get he
ball. When Meyers said what are we missing, probably a leader. And I think
early we had that a little bit with Sam. And then when Sam's didn't go in, you
know ‑‑ and Tracy did a great job. I think he's going to be a very good
player. He has a great heart. He loves it. He's kind of been our leader, to be
honest.  
And I said it before. It's the good and bad. If a freshman has to be your
leader, it puts you in a bind, to be honest.  
But, you know, all year‑‑ we're not great passers. And then Meyers, I think‑‑
I think he got a little tired. He gets frustrated. He leaves the post. He
stands up. And when you add it all together, you don't get many touches.  
MODERATOR: Time for a couple more.  
  
Q. Bruce, have you been given any assurance or do you expect to coach in the
NIT or beyond?  
COACH WEBER: I don't know. I don't even know if we'll be in the NIT, to be
honest. So I don't know anything.  
MODERATOR: Last one.  
  
Q. Bruce, coaching this game can give you exhilarating highs and crushing
lows, and you've seen both. When you've been at one end, had hard is it when
you're at the other?  
COACH WEBER: It's just like life. There's great moments in life and there's
moments that aren't so good, and every day you've got to approach life with a
positive attitude. If you just go in a pity party for yourself, nothing's
going to happen.  
And that's the whole message I've given to our kids this whole time. Sometimes
it's not fair. But what you do about it makes the difference.  
We showed the video last night, we've done it before, a professor from
Carnegie Mellon that was dying of cancer, and he went around, and his view,
approach to cancer and life and dying. And, you know, he talked about brick
walls, and they're there in life not to stop you but to see how badly you want
it. And we hit that brick wall in the game today. But they kept battling down
to the last play.  
MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH WEBER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Robbie Hummel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18227)

### [Anthony Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19859)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  79  
Nebraska  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach is going to make an opening statement, then go to
questions for the student‑athletes. Coach.  
COACH PAINTER: Well, obviously he we were able to get off on pretty good start
in the game. I thought the difference for us was our ability to make our 3s
and be able to thin them at the 3‑point line. And then the rebounding in the
second half, we were up I think a couple rebounds in the half, then ended up
being eight for the game, so got rebounded by six, but we had a stretch during
the second half where we made a nice run, making some shots, kinda pushed the
game out, but we also dominated the glass.  
So very important for us to defend them on the perimeter but not let them get
loose from three, and I thought we did a pretty good job of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rob, Anthony, and Ryne right here.  
  
Q. Rob, if you would, you and Lew both got two fouls in the first half and
Anthony and Terone just seemed to stretch the game out. Just talk about how
significant their play was tonight, especially in the first half when you guys
were in foul trouble.  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Yeah, I think it was a great job by those two guys and just
that lineup that we had in there. Anthony got a few baskets going to the rim.
Terone did as well, and then you had some guys make some 3s in there. I think
it was D.J. and Ryne.  
So I thought it was a great team effort and it was really a team win.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Robbie, your team has been one of the hottest teams in the second half of
the Big Ten Conference season. Can you just talk about how important it is to
come into here running the momentum like that and also to push that toward the
NCAA Tournament as well?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Sure. Yeah. I think the last five or six games we've played
extremely well. And I think that's what you always kind of strive for. You
want to peak at the end of the season and get your momentum going to the end
of the tournament.  
So I think that we can certainly use this tournament as a springboard for the
NCAAs. And tomorrow's a huge game for us, I think not only in terms of getting
our opportunity to play a ranked team, but it's an opportunity to improve our
seeding.  
  
Q. This is for Robbie. In playing the last date tomorrow, just what's the
biggest difference between Nebraska, between playing Ohio State? You guys were
able to hit your 3s and you were able get off to a great start against Ohio.
So what's the extra mile you have to go to get that win this time?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I think controlling the glass will be huge. I think when you
have a guy like Jared Sullinger, you always keep a body on. We definitely have
to do a very good job of boxing him out and then just guarding all the other
guys. It's pretty obvious, I think rebounding and defense are going to be
huge.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you talk about your game today and the progression
throughout the season. You've had some ups and downs, but do you feel like
it's starting click now?  
ANTHONY JOHNSON: I just try to come in and be aggressive and give it some
energy starting off with defense and rebounding. And if the offense comes,
then I'm going to take advantage of it. So I'm just really coming in, trying
to give my team a spark.  
  
Q. Anthony, you led the team in scoring, but what were they doing or what
were they not doing that allowed you to really got on a roll?  
ANTHONY JOHNSON: Well, I think it was our ball movement and them staying so
close to guys like Robbie, Ryne, and D.J. And that was giving me the
opportunity to drive the lane, and there was no help. And they're usually
packing it in, so I was able to get some easy floaters and some layups.  
  
Q. Ryne, in each game against Nebraska, you guys made 13 3s. You tied a
tournament record, single ‑game record tonight. They were different, I guess,
a little bit, but how much did it help that Terone and the guys were getting
to the basket, Anthony? And that seemed to really open some wide open looks on
the perimeter.   
RYNE SMITH: That's huge for us. I think when Anthony and Terone and Lewis can
get to the rim like that, it opens up just a ton of stuff for our offense. And
especially when we move the ball early in the possession and we can get open
lanes to drive, and they do a great job of kicking it. And thankfully, we were
fortunate enough to get some going down today.  
  
Q. Robbie, you had the opportunity to come back for this season, and
obviously this is what you come back for, a chance to play in post ‑season,
chance to get to the NCAA. How important is it to you to make a good run here
and then again in the tournament?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: It's very important. This is the end of my career, and same
could be said for Ryne and Lewis. So I think that we're all looking forward to
making a nice little run here to cap off four‑‑ or in my case, five‑‑ great
years of playing at Purdue.  
  
Q. Robbie, the last game at Ohio State was a 3 ‑point difference. Obviously
you guys made a lot of 3s in that game also. You talked earlier about defense
and rebounding. In your mind, is that what that last game came down to?   
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Yeah. I thought we did a pretty get good job on the glass at
Ohio State. It was just they've got so many weapons. They could be hard to
guard when you have a guy like Jared Sullinger, Aaron Craft, and William
Buford, and the list goes on and on. They have a very talented team, so it's
essential for us to stick to our defensive principles.  
  
Q. Ryne, in the first half there, you guys went on a 17 ‑0 run. They went a
good probably seven and a half minutes without scoring. What was working for
you guys at both ends of the floor there that you were able to kind of turn
the game around there?  
RYNE SMITH: I think we just started getting defensive stops. I think very
early on in the game, I think they got a couple easy buckets, and we weren't
where we needed to be defensively. But once you have got that squared off, it
helps us on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Anthony, will you talk about when Robbie and Lewis were out with the two
fouls, did you feel the importance to have to step up offensively to provide
more of a spark?  
ANTHONY JOHNSON: You know, when I come in, I just want to bring a spark.
Robbie, if Robbie and Lewis are in with me, I still want to try to bring a lot
of energy, so I didn't go in noticing that they are out like, ah, I need to do
this, I need to do that. I just wanted to come in and bring energy for my
team.  
THE MODERATOR: One final question.  
  
Q. Robbie, again, could you just talk about what going through the grueling
schedule of the Big Ten does for a team heading into the tournament where all
these different styles that are played?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I think the Big Ten Conference definitely does, if not the
best, one of the best jobs in the country of preparing its teams for the
post‑season. It's just such a physical league. I think the scouting is at an
incredibly high level from team to team.  
So it's something where I think it gives us a tremendous advantage because
you're playing against the best teams in the country and the best‑coached
teams in the country, night in and night out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You may go back to the locker room.  
We'll take questions for Coach Painter.  
  
Q. Coach, I know foul trouble played into it a little bit with Robbie and
Lewis, but they only played 25 and 26 minutes. And when you're trying to go
four games in four days, is it nice to have them not have to go 40 and then
talk about the production of some of the bench players to help them offset
that?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think more importantly, when guys go out and other guys
step up and play well, I think it really helps you. It helps your confidence
because it's going to happen in other games. You're going to get in foul
trouble.  
And I thought it was great that Anthony and Johnson came in and played within
himself but was still aggressive and was definitely on the hunt and looking to
drive the basketball, but he did some other good things. He had four assists.
He had six rebounds. He just didn't score the ball for us. So that was
definitely his best game of his career so far.  
  
Q. Just the same question I asked Ryne: That first ‑half run you guys made,
I think you turned it over. It was‑‑ I think you went on a 17‑0 run, just I
guess what was working at both ends of the floor for you there because you
were scoring and they weren't?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we got a couple things in transition. But we also‑‑ I
thought we did a good job of attacking them off the dribble and just kind of
making the right decision. They do a good job of stopping the basketball, but
if you get them on run and get them behind the play a little bit, you can get
to the rim. If not, you can still get the ball in the paint or penetrate and
pitch to the shooter.  
So I just thought we had a healthy balance of just making the right decision
and making the right play.  
  
Q. Matt, that first game in Columbus, your pick and roll game played a big
part in your success on offense. Two questions. I was wondering, did the
penetration come first and set up your 3 ‑point shooting, or did the 3‑point
shooting set up your penetration? And the second part of that question, with
not having Kelsey anymore, has that diminished that part of your game?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, he definitely was good in that area and his athleticism
helps you in ball screen action. Obviously Lewis does a good job with it.  
Terone is a little bit different. Terone does a better job of probing the
defense instead of just attacking in the open court.  
But I think the threat of those other guys that shoot the basketball also
opens up some things. And we still have some guys that can really shoot it,
and I think it's more important in our game, no matter who we play, just to
make the right decision, whether we're in screen action or whether we're in
ball screen action or rerun the set. Just the decision making.  
And I thought in the first half tonight we had way too many turnovers. We
ended up with ten for the game, but our average for the year is eight.  
So we gotta give ourselves a chance against no matter who we play and just
take care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, knowing what Robbie has been through, how satisfying is it and how
happy are you to see him have such a great end of the season?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, while you're in the middle of it, you don't sit around
and really reflect on it. You try to talk to him about what he can improve on
and what he can get better. The thing with him is he's been really confident
after getting into a good rhythm here in the past month, and you can just see
him getting better and better with each game.  
I think he's going to be really good here in a year or two. He gains more
confidence. He gets more comfortable on the court, but it's great for him. But
good things happen to good people. He never made an excuse. Even if he
wouldn't have come back and played, he wouldn't have been one of those guys‑‑
it's been hard for him, but he's never made excuses. He's always kind of
plugged and not said why me and just kept his head up and kept fighting. And
when do you those things, it's going to work for you.  
  
Q. Matt, what are the biggest concerns about Ohio State for tomorrow?  
COACH PAINTER: Just their personnel, when it gets down to it. William Buford
was great in the game we played. Obviously Jared Sullinger's one of the best
players ever in the Big Ten. We have a lot of respect for Aaron Craft and how
hard he plays and‑‑ just a winner. Deshaun Thomas can just score points in a
bunch. You can play good defense on Deshaun Thomas. He's a shot‑maker, and
he's really improved his game.  
And then you look at a guy like Lenzelle Smith who didn't play at all last
year, just a hungry player. Plays hard, defends, does whatever they need.
He'll hit eight threes in one game and might not shoot the next game. He's
helped them win a Big Ten championship, and that's what it's all about.
They're just a winning program, and for us, we're going to have to be able to
limit them in some area.  
So if you have any advice how to do that, I'm up for suggestions. But, no,
we've got a lot of respect for them. And they're dangerous. They're a
dangerous team. I know you can't allow them second‑chance opportunities and
you can't allow them transition opportunities because they're pretty good in
the half‑court, and then if you allow these two things, they're going to score
more points than you.  
THE MODERATOR: There's time for one last question for Coach Painter if there
is one.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the dynamic of your team since the incident where
you dismissed Kelsey? I think a lot of teams thought maybe that you would
struggle after that.  
COACH PAINTER: I think you want to keep your focus, as a coach, on what you
have instead of what you don't have. I think back and reflect on it a little
bit. Do we get in as much ball‑screen action? Probably not. Do we pressure on
defense as much? Probably not.  
We've tried to do a better job of just containing the dribble, not fouling,
and just trying to stay with just the strengths of our team. I think we're
still about the same team. But I think our guyshave ‑‑ and we had guys like it
last year because ETwaun and JaJuan are good players, and they didn't get
much attention. And any time somebody doubts you, I think it's just the best
motivator.  
A coach can try to do a lot of different things, but when people generally
doubt you like you can't do the job, I think that's the best motivator. And I
think our guys have really stepped up and played well, but also we haven't
tried to be a team that we're not. We're not going to outsize you and we're
not going to come with this unbelievable athleticism, but we are pretty
skilled, and we do have some guys that can shoot the basketball and we can
spread you out.  
We can be smart, we can take care of the ball, we can make shots, and that's
what we're going to have to do. And if we can't do that, then we're probably
going to get beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  75  
Northwestern  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have the coach make an opening statement, and then
questions for Andre and Rodney. Coach?  
COACH SMITH: Well, it was a good win for us, certainly a gallant effort to
come back and get a win against a very good team. Northwestern gives everybody
problems. I thought we were able to do the things we had to get done.
Hopefully they'll move on to the NCAA because they certainly deserve it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Andre, Coach has been saying all last week that you needed a guy on the
team to be that go ‑to scorer. Is that a role that you thought, coming into
this game, that you felt you needed to take on?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Not really. It was just the opportunity to present itself where
I had open shots and I just knocked them down, and I'm thankful my teammates
passed me the ball. It's not just one person to go to. If you have an open
shot, it's open. It's just everybody working together.  
  
Q. Question for Rodney. Once the game got into overtime, what was the
mindset of the team? It looked like you guys were playing a lot more
energetic, confident, thinking you were going to win.  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: You know, we've been in these overtime situations before and
we didn't come out on top. We knew that we just had to go out there and shut
down their 3s and get the stops we needed and get the shots we needed and then
convert on offense. We were very confident that we could do that and we went
out there and did it.  
  
Q. Andre, coming into the game, you looked pretty loose heading into this
game. Any nerves at all, being your first Big Ten Tourney game?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: No, it was no nerves, it's just I was excited to get out there.
And this is a great opportunity for us.  
  
Q. Andre, obviously your shots were falling today better than they have all
season. Do you feel more comfortable in this game than you have all season?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah. It just coming into a new season. Like Coach said, this
is a new beginning for us and we just‑‑ it's just an opportunity presented
itself, and I thought I was just feeling good tonight. Hopefully I can carry
that on this whole tournament.  
  
Q. Obviously, playing without Ralph coming into this game, talk about
Elliot's performance. And you guys went small down the stretch there, but you
were still able crash the boards and give the guys a chance to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Rodney, will you take that one, please.  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: Elliott came out early in the season, you know, Rob was out
with the ankle injury, and Elliot had to start up, play for him, and did he a
really good job. And we just reminded him of those games early in the season,
and he came out here and he played tough out here for us tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Additional questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. You guys have played under a lot of pressure for the last several games
down the stretch, and it seems like almost tonight, I guess you could have
looked at it a couple ways, as if you have a whole lost pressure on you
because you've got to win this and all of them, or you don't really have a
whole lot of pressure at all because you're a low seed and not a lot of people
expected you to win. Did you guys just feel looser tonight?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: I think we really didn't think about pressure and not pressure.
It's just going in and playing our game and playing hard. We know that‑‑ I
mean, we were well prepared for Northwestern. We played‑‑ this is our third
time playing them. And it wasn't any nerves or pressure going in. We just had
to be focused to come in and give a great effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Rodney.  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: Like Andre said, it wasn't really any pressure out there
because like you said, nobody's really expected us to come out here and do
anything. We just have to come out here and play our brand of basketball and
we'll come out with w's.  
THE MODERATOR: Got time for a couple more for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. It's been a long time since you've seen Michigan. It was right at the
beginning of the Big Ten season. Is that something that it makes it harder to
do or easier because you haven't seen them and you guys obviously look
different than did you then?  
THE MODERATOR: Rodney, start with you.  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: It's probably a little hard for us because, like you said,
it's been so long. But we know that they're a team that can shoot the 3 really
well, just like this Northwestern team, and they run the same kind of offense
and the defense as well. So we just gotta, like I said, we just gotta come out
and play our side of the ball, get stops and run the floor, and we'll be all
right.  
  
Q. Does that help? Having played Northwestern, you said they're somewhat
similar to Michigan. Does it help with the short put ‑up?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: That definitely‑‑ I think that definitely helps us because
they're a similar team, so we just gotta go out there with the same mindset
that we had tonight and we'll be just fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Take one more for these guys and let them go back to the locker
room. Anybody?  
  
Q. Have you guys thought at all about past the Big Ten Tournament, NC
Tournament, NIT? Has that been talked about before this tournament at all?  
THE MODERATOR: Andre, take that one.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Most definitely. We most definitely want to continue to play
this. We get that from our coach, the pass before the game, and we just want
to continue to play, play our hearts out. It's just the steps we have to take
in order to get to that point, and we just have to take care of Michigan next
in order to keep moving on.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thank you. You can go back to the locker room.
Congratulations.  
Now questions for Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Tubby, obviously Andre had a great night. Is this something that you just
seen him slowly building up to be the kind of go ‑to guy you've been looking
for?  
COACH SMITH: Well, he's been that way all year. He's been a real‑‑ he's got
the leadership characteristics that you need, and then he has the skill set.
He's got great form on his shot. His ball handling is improving. His defense
is the biggest thing that he had to improve on, and he's done a good job
there.  
So, yeah, we saw it, and that's what happens over the course of a season. You
expect them to get better, and he's gotten better and he showed it tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, which was the biggest difference for you between the game today
and then the game in Evanston just last month?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we were‑‑ you know, played extremely well there, and it was
on the road. It was‑‑ I don't know. Looking back, you know, it was a John
Shurna night. I think he was just passing. He had a great game, and he's an
excellent player. He's hard to defend. That was one our problems, just
defending‑‑ and we gave up a lot of easy baskets in the back door, and
that's‑‑ that was a real problem for us.  
And when you get behind like that on the road and you're a young team, you
just‑‑ you're inexperienced and trying come back. Today we're behind, we came
back and did a good job. So I think that was the major difference because we
did a good job on the boards there and everything else, but we didn't take
care of the ball. Today we did a better job up there. I think we had 21
turnovers and here we only had 14.  
  
Q. I wanted to say, seems like we saw more fight in your guys tonight. Do
you feel like you saw more fight?  
COACH SMITH: You know, I told them all that you want to respect your
opponents, but you don't want to have no fear, fear no one. And I thought
that's one of the things, don't go out there fearful of the one‑three‑one and,
you know, because I think that was just a tact. So we wanted to go with that
type of mentality. And in the second half, that's what we did. We changed our
defensive scheme and that paid off. It took away some of their 3s. We were
able to keep pressure on as far as full court pressure is concerned, and that
was huge for us because I think it kind of gets us going, gives us some
confidence, you know, that Coach believes in us and we gotta keep attacking
and not‑‑ play to win and not play to lose. So that's what I saw in them
today.  
  
Q. We noticed that after a while, you went with a smaller lineup. You guys
were able to ‑‑ after a while you were able to go with a smaller lineup and
still be effective, pressuring and causing some turnovers, getting in
transition.   
COACH SMITH: Well, we were‑‑ we thought that the rebounding edge was to us and
we just felt like we needed to have better defense on the perimeter. So even
though Elliot had four fouls on him also, Rodney had four fouls.  
So it was just‑‑ because of that situation, dictated us going small. We had to
get Julian because we needed good ball‑handling, better ball‑handling, and
wanted to get Chip in the game because he's a pretty good ball handler so that
was‑‑ that's why we went to a small lineup. It paid off.  
  
Q. Tubby, John Shurna never really got comfortable out there. End of the
second half, went into overtime. What was the key to shutting him down or not
letting him get going?  
COACH SMITH: What was the key‑‑ well, we wanted keep the ball off him as much
as possible, make him put it on the floor in the second half. He's a great
spot‑up shooter. And they set a lot of screens for him. So wanted to run him
off the 3‑point line as much as we could, and I thought we did a better job of
that in the second half, making him drive the ball to the basket.  
And that was our game plan. It was our game plan from the beginning but it
wasn't working. We changed that defense against the zone. They were just
carving us up and lighting up us from outside, so we went away from the zone
the second half and primarily played nothing but man to man.  
  
Q. Julian was back in there after two games. How do you think he responded
to having that extended layoff?  
COACH SMITH: Big time shots. He made a big 3 today. I thought he played tough.
He especially had a‑‑ really hadn't worked out much at all. Both he and Andre
Ingram. He was pretty well fatigued. He was only out there for a few minutes
and he was gassed. And I think that's when Julian hit the wall a little bit.
And that's what happens when your shelved and not able to play and you have an
jury injury. The conditioning part goes first.  
And I think he showed a lot of toughness and good conditioning today and that
was important. He did some good things for us, and I was impressed with how he
contributed.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for two more.  
  
Q. Tubby, Michigan, everyone says that Michigan has a tough press. Is what
Rodney said effective, that it's easier to do that in one day, or Michigan is
tough regardless?  
COACH SMITH: They're tough regardless. They're just playing with a lot of
confidence. They've got some talented players. We haven't seen them in a long
time, since early in the season.  
But, again, there are some similarities in their offensive style and their
defensive style, but it's two different teams, and they're very athletic in
key positions with Burke. So we really‑‑ we have our hands full, but it's
always tough to prep for a John Beilein team.  
  
Q. You guys obviously put the ball in Andre's hands for the last play of
regulation. Even though he missed it, it seems like guys were looking to him
in overtime as well. Does that just speak to obviously how well he was
playing, but also how much trust his teammates are giving him?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, he's got that ability. I said it earlier. He has all the
traits, and that's why we recruited him.  
Sometimes as coaches, we can‑‑ you're looking for other things and you're open
‑‑ but he's more serious‑minded now. I think he's matured a lot, and that's
helped a lot. He's always been an outstanding shooter. It's just more when to
shoot, when not to shoot, and that's the biggest challenge for players. And I
think he's learned‑‑ and when to pass, when not to pass.  
But yeah. The guys, I have a lot of trust in him, a lot of faith in him that
he can make plays for us. We were having problems with too many turnovers, so
we thought maybe we just put in one guy's hands. Wasn't so much‑‑ it was
pretty much to kind of cut down on the turnovers, to be honest with you,
because we'd been a little shaky, but we were better in the second half and
that helped.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

IOWA  64  
ILLINOIS  61

  
MODERATOR: Our format this afternoon, as always, we'll ask Coach McCaffery to
make an opening statement and then go to questions for the three
student‑athletes. Coach?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I'm very proud of how we played today. I thought we played
against a team that was ready, a team that was well‑prepared, a team that
fought extremely hard, as always. We knew what this game was going to be like,
playing a team like Illinois. It's always difficult. And I feel like until the
second half in particular we played with a lot more energy level on the glass.
I mean, we had zero offensive rebounds in the first half, 14 in the second
half. I think that was a big difference‑maker in this game.  
And we played not them not so long ago and, I thought, had a pretty good game
in terms of running the fast break. Didn't convert. 18 turnovers. And today,
six turnovers. So I'm really proud of Bryce and Dev.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the three student‑athletes? Raise your hand. I'll get
a mike out to you. Start right down here in the middle.  
  
Q. Hey, Matt, you guys were down seven in the second half. You got the three
and then you got the steal for the dunk, and then there's a timeout and you
were kind of exhorting your teammates on. Do you think that was your
leadership, you were trying to show them what it was going to take down the
stretch?  
MATT GATENS: Yeah. Down seven, you need to make something happen. I think I
just missed the three, and I came off, got a good look. Bryce found me in the
corner on that one. And we just needed something to happen. And I found a good
spot to get a steal there and a quick bucket and just in the timeout, just
trying to keep guys being aggressive and believing. And Coach said when we
were down seven, you know, it's only a couple possessions; it's not over. So
it was great to see our guys believe and be confident and put a run of our own
on them and go up seven on our side.  
MODERATOR: Right out here.  
  
Q. Aaron, like Coach said, the rebounding effort in the second half was much
better. Would you guys make adjustments defensively, especially on Meyers
Leonard?  
AARON WHITE: On the boards, we definitely talked about heading the crash off
at the boards. Didn't have any in the first half. So especially me and Zach, I
think, really tried to get down there, try and get one back if we couldn't
make 'em, because the bigs ‑‑ spark that run. If you miss a three and you get
it and you kick it back out, Matt hits a couple, make a couple lay‑ups, that's
how you spark something. I think that was big in the second half for us.  
  
Q. Matt, in the second half when you were down six, you seemed to be vocal,
trying to get everybody up, keep them up. How important was this game to you
based off your career, based off everything?  
MATT GATENS: Huge. I don't want to go home. I want to keep playing. I don't
want to take this uniform off. And I think all the guys up here and in the
locker room feel the same way. Personally, I haven't been past this first day.
Feels good to get past it, but you gotta get over that and go and get the next
one now.  
It's back to the film room and we gotta get ready for Michigan State and keep
extending this. We're playing for our lives. And it's a great feeling when you
get it done, and it's a great group of guys to do it with.  
  
Q. Matt, obviously you guys have played in a lot of really close games this
year, not just your team, but every time in the big ten. And a lot people are
saying that this year is the strongest conference in the Big Ten. Do you think
that?  
MATT GATENS: Strongest year?  
  
Q. Strongest conference.  
MATT GATENS: Oh, in the nation? I mean, people keep saying that, so, yeah, I
believe it. I am a little biased because I'm in the conference and see the
teams every week. But top to bottom, every team has knocked off a ranked
opponent. I think I've heard that.  
And there's no nights off in this league, no matter if it's home or away, and
that's how you've got to approach it and that's how we'll approach the game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. For a team like you guys that have to obviously go on a big run to make
it into the NCAA Tournament, does that give you ‑‑ does that help buoy you
because of the fact that you've seen this year that every team can beat
everyone?   
MATT GATENS: Absolutely, yeah. It puts that belief in ourselves. We have
proven we can we can beat ranked teams, and teams‑‑ we've been the underdog
and won. Anybody can beat anybody in this league on a given day, and we're
going to be try to prove that the rest of this weekend. Starts tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bryce, you've had an up and down season. How satisfying it was for you to
play a game like you played today, the way you controlled the offense, got a
lot of assists, just played the game like you've done so many times?  
MATT GATENS: It's been frustrating being injured, but when healthy, I know I
can play. I can play this game. So it was very gratifying today just to ball
like I did and get my teammate involved.  
  
Q. Matt, looked like you were matched up a lot on Brandon Paul today. You
only who four points, two of 11. Do anything particularly different on him or
just paid a lot of attention to him?  
MATT GATENS: Yeah, coming in definitely, because he's the leading scorer, one
of our main keys, and we approached the game with our eye on him. And last
game, he had 17 against us, so we knew he was going to be a key to stop but as
a team effort on him. I just wanted to be the aggressor and make it tough on
him, limit his touches and his easy looks, but other guys getting their hands
in there and getting their hands in his face and making his looks tough.  
But I thought overall, we did a good job on him. He's a good player.  
  
Q. Fran, exact numbers have gone down ‑‑  
MODERATOR: Student‑athletes only, please.  
  
Q. Just for any of you guys, Zach is really (Off Microphone)?  
COACH McCAFFERY: Aaron, will you take that, please.  
AARON WHITE: Couldn't really hear you, to be honest with you. I'm sorry. You
kinda cut in and out.  
  
Q. Zach, on the defensive end, as far as the dirty work ‑‑  
AARON WHITE: Oh, yeah. You know, being undersides at six‑seven, to go out
there and front Meyers like that, seven‑foot‑one, just unbelievable effort.
That's not the first time he's done that. He's done that in the Northwestern
game, denying the high post.  
I mean, in this league you got a bunch of centers. You got Zeller. You got,
obviously, Leonard. That's just a tough match‑up for him. But he's working his
tail off, really proud of him. Be out in front of 'em and fight 'em and then
go get a couple rebounds for our side was huge. So maybe his numbers aren't
slowing it, but he's definitely making a big impact for our team.  
  
Q. This one is for Bryce and Matt. After Illinois hit a three that cut the
lead to one, Bryce, you were inbounding the ball to Matt; Matt, you caught the
ball. Were you ‑‑ first of all, Bryce, were you looking for Matt? And second
of all, Matt, when you got the ball and then turned to dribble up the court,
were you looking to get fouled immediately and then you decided to just to
dribble it all the way up? Bryce, start with you, please.   
BRYCE CARTWRIGHT: Yeah, I was looking for Matt. He's our best free‑throw
shooter, so we needed to get the ball to Matt so he could ensure ourselves
some points.  
MATT GATENS: Yeah, when he got it to me, you're expecting to get fouled right
away. I think was like 16 on the clock. They tried a trap, and I just split
it. And at that point, I wanted to get up the court and waste as much clock as
I could. Those last minutes seemed to take forever, and you just want to run
them out, but they came from behind and got me and it was a good find by
Bryce.  
  
Q. Any or all of the players, you guys were down seven and then it seemed
like two minutes later you were up seven. Talk about what you saw there from
them. Did you sort of feel like you got into their heads? Did they sort of
lose whatever ‑‑ what was the changeover you saw from them?  
MODERATOR: Aaron, will you take that, please.  
AARON WHITE: The momentum of the game really switched. Matt really sparked
that run with that three in the corner and the steal and the dunk. And when
the momentum changes like that, you just feel really confident coming down the
floor, both defensively and offensively.  
So for us, we got a couple stops, started making our shots on the other end.
And the next thing you know, we're up six or seven points and the whole game
has flipped in a matter of a couple minutes. But, yeah, that was a huge part,
and I think Matt really sparked that for us with the three and the dunk.  
MODERATOR: One final question for the student‑athletes before I let them go?
Congratulations.  
Questions for Coach McCAFFERY. Right down here in front.  
  
Q. Coach, how satisfied were you with the rebounding effort in the second
half, particularly after the way the game in Champagne went?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I think not only the way the game went in Champagne but the
way the first half went. We didn't‑‑ you couldn't get any traction because we
couldn't get a second shot. We couldn't get a put‑back. We couldn't get an
opportunity. If we were going to effect some change in the second half or the
way things were going for essentially three halves, we had to get some
second‑shot opportunities and keep them on defense a little longer.  
  
Q. You were a little outspoken on Matt not making the all ‑defensive team.
Just talk about his defense on Brandon Paul today.   
COACH McCAFFERY: You know what, I could come up with a number of different
superlatives, but it's the same effort every night. That's why I thought he
deserved to be on the team.  
Now, I don't want to get too sideways about it because it's disrespectful to
the guys who made it because the reality is they're all terrific defenders.
But I think he's the best.  
  
Q. Coach, Illinois went this entire game without shooting a single free
‑throw. What's that say about the effort that you got from your defense for
all 40 minutes?   
COACH McCAFFERY: You know, I could kind of see it early. I thought our
defense‑‑ because our defense was in front our bench. I thought our effort
level was incredible. And then you look down at half‑time and they shot 14 for
28, shot 50 percent, and they had 11 assists on 14 baskets. And it just goes
to show you how well they were executing and what kind of players they have
and their intention to come in here and play well and play hard and compete
and win.  
So in the second half, it was much better, I think in particular in the first
five minutes. We really made a little real push, and then we had the 20‑to‑5
run, which was really evident when we got up toward ball and got the passing
lane and got a couple steals, Matt, Aaron White, Marble. You know, three big
steals there.  
  
Q. Fran, the first half, some of the guys seemed a little tentative going
against Leonard. And in the second half, they seemed to attack him attack the
post a little bit better. Was that a concentrated effort or just something
‑‑  
COACH McCAFFERY: No, you know what, Scott, when you're playing Illinois, your
effort has to be concentrated the entire time. You're not going to make a
whole lot of changes. You can't play behind them. You have to be in front of
them. Now you're worried about high‑low, you're worried about lobs over the
top. And so wing‑side help was pretty good, but our ball pressure in the
second half I think was a little bit better than it was in the first half, not
so much from the high post. It was good from the high post in both halves, but
from the wing, I thought second half was better.  
  
Q. Fran, (Off Microphone)?  
COACH McCAFFERY: The thing about Zach is, you know, it's great when he has
numbers. He had a stretch there where he was getting 18, 20 points. But he
affects the game in a positive way if he doesn't have scoring numbers because
he's going to defend and he's going to execute, he's going to make his
free‑throws. He's not a big mistake guy.  
He has got in foul trouble. If he's going to make mistakes, a lot of times
it's fouling. And obviously we were worried about that today because we were
going against a guy that's much bigger than you, you're worried about having
foul trouble and getting them into the bonus, but that didn't happen.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little about Michigan State? When you played there,
they shot the lights out and you're ‑‑  
COACH McCAFFERY: They shot the lights out, but the other thing they did was
they beat us up. They really took us out of what we wanted to do. So it was a
combination of both. It was an incredibly concentrated effort at both ends of
the floor. That's why it was a 30‑point game. So obviously we're going to have
to do a much better job tomorrow.  
  
Q. Fran, the key from your perspective, three ‑pointer by Matt, then steal
and dunk when you were down seven, through your eyes, how pivotal was that in
turning momentum?  
COACH McCAFFERY: Oh, that was the pivotal piece right there. That was the
pivotal part of the game. They're up seven. I mean, Rick, you've been around.
Seven can go to 11 quick. Or seven can go to one or two. And that changes
everything for the rest of the game. And as Aaron said, we then had the
momentum. They had it. And then we hit the three and the steal and the dunk.
Now everything's changed. They gotta call timeout and they gotta get
reorganized. We can change defenses. We just have a more confident bunch
coming out of that time out and we scored the ball.  
Now, we got to a point where we were struggling scoring the ball. And we did.
And a lot that had to do with how much they were fighting and their defensive
effort.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the press in the second half. I think you guys
got a couple turnovers ‑‑  
COACH McCAFFERY: We got a couple turnovers. Couple of times they took it right
through us, too, and that was unfortunate for us. They got a little bit
tentative one or two possessions there. And that's kind of what you want. You
want them to go a little bit sideways, a little bit less, especially when you
have athletes and a great big guy, you want them going a little bit more east
and west than north and south.  
MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Indiana  75  
Penn State - 58

  
MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Crean to make an opening statement and then go to
questions for the student‑athletes. Coach.  
COACH CREAN: We knew we were playing against one of the most mentally and
physically tough teams in our league, without a doubt. And we've had some
great battles with Penn State over the years. We've certainly had a couple
really good ones with them this year and we didn't anticipate it being any
different.  
And I'm really proud of the way our players played inside of the game, inside
certainly of the adversity of losing Verdell in the game. And I thought our
resolve in the second half, our determination defensively, and the adjustments
that we made‑‑ or I shouldn't say as much as we made as some of the things we
went to in the snatch were very good for us offensively and defensively.  
These guys did an excellent job. The three up here, to have Cody and Christian
get a double‑double, to have Jordan sit out so much of the second half at the
end and us to‑‑ first half, for him to‑‑ for us to play time and score with
him a little bit, and then for him really not to come out to the very end in
the second half, outstanding game from him. And certainly I thought Will and
Victor at times were outstanding on both ends as well.  
So really proud of the way that these guys played. Without a doubt, it's a
tough afternoon. You want to win, which we did. You want to play well. But you
want to do it with your whole team, and we didn't get that opportunity today.  
But these guys did an excellent, excellent job of playing through it, playing
composed, and very, very proud of them for the win.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, how did you all regroup after you see Verdell go down and just
talk about what you all did to kind of get back into a rhythm?  
JORDAN HULLS: I mean, first, Verdell has put so much into this program, so we
knew when we saw him go down and out of the game, we knew we had to step up
for him. And as a team, we just picked up a lot on the defensive end, and
that's really where we were struggling a little bit and not getting the stops
that we needed, but we were able to rally around him and stay focused as a
team and play hard.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you know about Verdell's ‑‑  
MODERATOR: Student‑athletes only, please.  
  
Q. Oh, I didn't know that. You guys mentioned some of the things you did
different defensively. What did you change and just do to give Frazier a
different look?  
MODERATOR: Christian, you want to start.  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: We just tried to take away a lot of his catches and just
make things difficult for him and get him out of his certain spots and stuff
like that. That's basically what we did.  
  
Q. To any of the players, it was 40 to 34. You guys went on a 14 ‑0 run.
Jordan, I think you hit the first 3 to start that. But just talk about what
that did for you guys inside the game and how that extended the lead.   
MODERATOR: Cody, you take that, please.  
CODY ZELLER: I think our defense picked up in that period. Our defense kind of
led into our offense. Like you said, Jordan hit the shot, but I think we had a
nice defensive stop right before that. And that's where we're most successful
is when we're defending and rebounding.  
  
Q. Christian, you had kind of the odd shooting night of the 2 of 11 from the
floor but 10 and 10 from the free ‑throw line. Is that something where you
just wanted to keep grinding along and find any way to score points?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: Oh, yeah. You just want to get attack, get in, get some
offensive rebounds, get some easy buckets. And my teammates did a great job of
putting me in position to where I could get fouled and went to the free‑throw
line.  
  
Q. Jordan, you had 13 points in the first ten minutes of the game. Were you
familiar with your surroundings? Have you played here before in the State
Championship?  
JORDAN HULLS: Yeah. It's not my first time playing here, but it's a different
shooting background. But shots were falling down for me. Teammates were
finding me when I was open, and I was able to create a little bit on my own.
So luckily, the shot was falling down and then I got in foul trouble there,
but the teammates picked it up and mostly on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Christian, you've had a lot of first in a long times with IU this year.
This is the first one, Big Ten Tournament, I think, in five years. What's that
mean to the team and is that just another step in progression for you guys?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: It was just another step. We're going to take it a game at
a time. But, you know, it's been a long time coming, and we're going to enjoy
it, but we know we got to get ready to pay Wisconsin next.  
  
Q. Jordan, this question is looking ahead a little bit. But just with the
way this season has gone, the way the Big Ten is, and with all the different
styles and all the talent in the league, do you feel like this has sort of
helped prepare you guys as players for the different match ‑ups you might face
in the NCAA?  
JORDAN HULLS: Definitely, but we're taking it one game at a time. So our next
base game is tomorrow, and but the Big Ten is a great conference, so we are
playing a lot of different styles so that will benefit us.  
  
Q. Jordan, you always get good crowds here, but how much does that help you
on the tight game like that and just to push you guys in terms of momentum?  
JORDAN HULLS: Yeah. The Indiana fan base has been huge for us this whole year.
Even when we weren't doing so well, they've been behind us a hundred percent.
So to have that, come over here to the Big Ten Tournament is definitely huge
for us. And but then once‑‑ further down the road or so, we're not going to
believe able to have that, so we've got to be able to create our own energy as
well.  
  
Q. Cody, seemed like Penn State did a good job bodying you in the post.
There are a couple times you couldn't get your shot off but got to the free
‑throw line in plenty of time. What exactly were you looking to do inside?  
CODY ZELLER: I just wanted to be aggressive. They were being physical down
low, which we've seen quite a bit this year. But I just tried to stay
aggressive, get to the free‑throw line and get rebounds, do all the things
that the team needed to win.  
  
Q. This is for Christian and Jordan. You guys have both alluded to your next
game. Obviously it's a team you're familiar with, Wisconsin, but haven't had
much success against. What are the keys going to be in that game? What's
important? What will it be to end that losing streak against them?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: It's going to be very important, but we've just been taking
it game at a time. So we'll go back to the hotel and we'll get ready. I'm sure
the coaches will come up with a game plan and we'll go out and execute.  
MODERATOR: Jordan.  
JORDAN HULLS: We just gotta prepare. We know they're a good team. This is the
most important game of the season for us because it's the next game, so we got
approach it that way and keep our mindset pretty focused.  
MODERATOR: A couple more for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Cody, there was a moment when you missed three straight free ‑throws and
then you got that fourth one to rattle home. You pointed at Will and you said
something to him. What exactly was going on there?  
CODY ZELLER: He was telling me to not worry about it. Told me to move on to
the next one, which is exactly what I did. I don't know how I missed three in
a row, so I don't know.  
MODERATOR: One more question for the student‑athletes? Thank you, players. You
may return to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what you know specifically at this point about
Verdell?  
COACH CREAN: Well, he's being evaluated now, and we've got a great team of
doctors that were with him, obviously, right away. And I was hopeful when he
went down that it wasn't as significant, but I'm going to keep holding on to
that hope, but I don't obviously feel good about that. And but we've played
numerous times. It's in the doctors' hands. It's in God's hands. And we're
going to just absolutely hope for the best with him.  
  
Q. Talking about the game, you talked yesterday about how you guys led the
Big Ten in free ‑throw attempts. 36 times there again today. Just talk about
how important it was getting to the line in this game.   
COACH CREAN: It's very important because it establishes everything for us. It
establishes the ability to set our defense, which we wanted to keep Penn State
out of transition as much as possible. We've got very good free‑throw
shooters, and just I think, if I'm not mistaken, Wisconsin was at 77.8. We
were at like 77.4. Wisconsin led the nation last year, so to be up in that
ballpark is really, really important. And it's a big part of our game plan.  
So again, we can get the ball in the lane through the post‑up, through the
drive, today certainly through the offensive rebounds. I think the fact that
we have three guys in double figure rebounds says a lot about the tenacity
that our guys played with, and they were rewarded with it a lot of times
during the game for going to the line‑‑ by going to the line.  
  
Q. Coach, has Cody met or exceeded your expectations?  
COACH CREAN: I don't coach like that. That's a hypothetical to me. I coach him
every day to be as good as he can possibly be, and I think Jean Miller did the
same thing. And his summer coaches and certainly his parents have done that
with him.  
So I don't coach with expectations in mind or where a guy is where a guy
isn't. It's all about where he can go and what he's doing that day to get
there.  
  
Q. Coach, Christian, touched on it a little bit, but what does it say about
a guy that makes 2 of 11 from the field but still work and get to the free
‑throw line, hit all ten of his free throw shots and have a double‑double?  
COACH CREAN: Says he's pretty good. And I thought there were a couple times
where he probably could have shot a few more, especially early in the game.
But we asked him to do a lot and he does a lot.  
And the tenacity on the glass, the responsibilities defensively, whether we're
man or zone or whether we're switching inside of the possession, those things
are not easy to do. And they're easy for him because he's so locked in.  
So he's an excellent shooter, and he's been that way for the entire year, and
we feel very, very confident when the ball is in his hands.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about x number of wins, x different ways. In a
tournament setting, how does the experience of being able to win those
different ways really help you guys?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, I think it does. I think it does. It was a unique day, and
you certainly don't wake up in the morning getting ready for a game and think
you're going to have to play a majority of it without a guy that‑‑ you know
there's going to be fouls, but you don't plan to have somebody like Verdell be
out, especially the way that he was out. But it happened. And I thought our
guys did a tremendous job.  
I tell you one thing, because I was on the out with Verdell, that really
deserves credit is our coaches. Because I know how much our players care about
one another and certainly how much they care about Verdell. And I didn't have
to be over there to know that that was being handled really, really well. And
when I got back over to the huddle‑‑ and I'm a bit stunned and shaken. There's
no question about it. They were looking right in the eye, they were ready to
go.  
And that's a tribute to the player. That's a tribute to the coaches. That's a
tribute to the resiliency of them. They've all been through a lot, and that's
where those experiences have helped them, too.  
But every game is different, and we're proud of where we're at with it, and we
know the task tomorrow is difficult.  
  
Q. You may have been asked this before, but how emotional was it for you to
see what happened with Verdell? And if you can go, where do the minutes go?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Well, the minutes‑‑ I'll answer the second part first. The
minutes‑‑ we didn't play Jordan very much certainly with the two fouls because
we were playing time and score with him. We could have definitely put him back
in, but I did want to try to save him because I was hopeful that we were going
to get back in that locker room and they were going to have cleared Verdell,
but the longer it went on the court, the more I didn't see that coming.  
And I think Remy Abell has got to play well for us. I think Dan Moore has to
be ready to go. I think the fact that Victor has handled the ball so much
since Verdell's first injury in the Michigan game this year has helped him?  
But I think we've got to be a low turnover team. I think everybody's got to be
involved in that. We've got to be strong with the ball.  
There's no question that we missed him. I could feel it, not just the
emotional part of it during the game, but I could feel it when he's not in
there. But we go through a lot together. These guys, we go through an awful
lot together. And Verdell Jones stands a lot for what's right here.  
And when you start to think about all the things those seniors have had to
endure and go through and now to be at this point, that's tough. That's a
tough blow. But the initial of just watching him in pain, that's hard. It's
like‑‑ there's no worse feeling than when your own children are sick or hurt,
and it's really a lot like that when you coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I think a lot of people expected this tournament to be really good
and really exciting, but considering the way the Big Ten season has gone this
year and the way that the Big Ten has performed as a whole in the NCAA
tournament in the past couple years, do you feel like this year will be
different as far as the conference really holding strong in the NCAA?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Well, I think there's a lot of great teams in the league. I
really do. I think these teams are hard enough to get ready for, and we've got
the off season where we have two, three, four days to get ready for. There's a
great toughness about this league, and there's certainly a lot of talent.  
The coaching speaks for itself. But there's a lot of different ways that teams
can beat you in this league.  
So in answer to your question, I would think it gives this league a great
opportunity. But at the end of the day, I mean, that's a week, week and a
half‑‑ or a week away from coming to fruition, and I'm sure everybody's really
just focused on what they're going to do here next. I know we are.  
  
Q. Tom, Tim Frazier, 19 in the first half. What was different in the second
half?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Well, the problem was we didn't play our game plan right in
the first half. We went under the screens. And he hit I think‑‑ at least three
shots come to mind right now where we went under the ball screen on him, and
we just can't do that. He's really, really improved. He is a great guard.  
And we felt like it last year. We've talked about this, that we put a lot of
attention on Talor Battle. We put as much attention on Tim Frazier last year
because of the way that he delivered the basketball. And in the way that he
has continued to improve, he's going to be an all American. If he's not this
year, he will be next year. He's really, really good. There's a lot of
different ways that he can beat you.  
And the one thing that he's really improved this year as he's shooting is his
long‑range shooting. He's been shooting more threes since Woodyard went out.  
But the number one key with him was to keep him out of the lane as much as
possible. But I think the job done on Marshall was really big because of the
way he was averaging 18 and a half in the last two games since Woodyard was
hurt. He was averaging rebounds, he was shooting better from the three, from
the foul line. And we put a lot of emphasis on him in the last couple days.
Whether we were man or zone, we wanted to know where he was at.  
But, again, when you limit Frazier's touches but, more importantly, you limit
his ability to penetrate and create havoc in the lane, whether it's his basket
or a basket for somebody else, then it gives you a better chance to win. And
that was the biggest part of our plan today.  
MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH CHAMBERS: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Tim Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21969)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Indiana  75  
Penn State - 58

  
MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Chambers to make an opening statement and then go
to questions for Tim and Trey. Coach?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Indiana played great basketball. Very tough, very physical.
Obviously the 20 or 16 offensive rebounds, 36 attempts from the free‑throw
line, we wanted to take away their threes. For us, we did a pretty good job,
but they drove the basketball. They did some good things.  
MODERATOR: Question for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. This question is for Tim. Tim, just talk about what IU did differently in
the second half to slow you down. You had 19 at half time.  
TIM FRAZIER: I think they went to a zone. They was able to try keep me out of
the paint.  
MODERATOR: Other questions? Anybody?  
Okay, fellows. You may return to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Chambers?  
  
Q. Coach, when you set up to play Indiana, how big an issue is Cody
Zeller?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.  
  
Q. When you set your team up to play Indiana, how big an issue is Cody?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, he's a problem, you know, because if they're not
shooting, then they can just put it inside. And he shoots at such a great
clip. He's just not a big, he's an athletic big. He's strong and he's
physical. He plays like a wily veteran. He's a very different match‑up for
anybody, especially us, because we're a little bit small.  
  
Q. Coach, your first year in the Big Ten. If you would, could you just
assess the 18 ‑game schedule and then the Big Ten tournament, just what it's
like being in the Big Ten?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I love it. I absolutely love it. I love this league. I love
being a part of this. I really enjoyed matching wits with some of the greatest
coaches of all time.  
And it's hard. It's hard to win on the road. Very difficult. But I really
enjoyed this year, I've got to be honest. I'm disappointed we lost, but I'm
excited about the future, and I look forward to getting to work tomorrow to
start building that future.  
  
Q. You talk about what Zeller brings to this team. How difficult is it to
get back into a game when you have a big guy that can shoot free throws like
that when they're working through him and the clock is running down in the
second half?  
COACH CHAMBERS: It was a little bit of both. They were not only putting it
into him, I think he had seven offensive rebounds. That was critical.  
And, yeah, to get a big man who can make free throws, it makes the game a lot
easier. When you're guard‑oriented, you're hoping your guard can get you to
the free‑throw line, but when you have a big who can make free throws, man,
that's a whole new dynamic.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

### [JerShon Cobb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23373)

### [John Shurna](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20628)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  75  
Northwestern  68

  
MODERATOR: Coach Carmody can make an opening statement and then we'll go to
questions for the student‑athletes.  
Coach?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, tough loss. I just thought at the half we should have had
more than a two‑point lead. When we went to the one‑three‑one zone we stalled
the ball about three or four times, sort of had breakaways, and we didn't
capitalize. I think we had four steals outright and a blocked shot, a missed
dunk, a turnover, you know, bad pass. And we didn't take advantage.  
And then in the second half they guarded us harder, and I didn't think our
offense flowed the way it should. And you give them credit. We weren't able to
contain 1, and he made shots in the first half. And then the second half when
they were coming back, he just took the ball to the rim and we didn't have an
answer for him. We didn't shoot the ball well. And so give them credit for
defending us well.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. JerShon, you were having a great night up until the overtime and you
turned the ball over right at the baseline. Did that deflate you and the team
or did you think you had a chance?  
JERSHON COBB: No, we still had a chance until the game was over, but it hurt.
But that was a bad turnover. It hurt the team.  
  
Q. John, how tough of a loss is this for you to swallow as a senior and
coming so close in the Subway Tournament? Whether or not you guys get there
obviously will be decided on Sunday.  
JOHN SHURNA: Yeah, it's disappointing. Obviously we've had a lot of close
games this year, and you have to give credit to Minnesota. They came up with
the extra play and they hit a lot of threes, I think, coming in. I think coach
said they averaged about six threes a game, and it felt like they did that in
like five minutes today. So it was disappointing, but you have to give credit
to Minnesota.  
  
Q. For both guys, do you just feel like an issue with this team has just
been poise over the last couple minutes of games and in overtime?  
MODERATOR: John, let's start with you, please.  
JOHN SHURNA: I mean, obviously I guess you have to look at that just because
we've had so many close games and we've lost a couple of them. So, yeah,
obviously it's disappointing and‑‑ but I think our team's dealt with adversity
the entire time, and when we're down, we're not out. We like our chances all
the way until the very end.  
MODERATOR: JerShon, your thoughts?  
JERSHON COBB: Just to piggyback off of John, this team is tough. We come back,
we fight through adversity where sometimes the ball just doesn't bounce your
way.  
  
Q. Is it getting to the point where you thought maybe the pressure of each
game being the biggest game in program history, was that ‑‑ did that ever get
to you guys at some point?   
MODERATOR: John, let's start with you.  
JOHN SHURNA: I don't think so, just because it's been like that for a while.
You probably could go from the start of February or the end of January or
something like that, and we've won some tough games. And I don't think‑‑ I
don't think we felt pressure. I think we just have to‑‑ we go out there and
play our game, and Minnesota played better tonight so you have to give them
credit.  
MODERATOR: JerShon, do you want to add anything?  
JERSHON COBB: I don't think it's pressure. We just go out there and we play.
We play no‑question basketball.  
  
Q. John, if you're not selected for the tournament on Sunday, do you view
this season as a disappointment or is there still something you can take from
it that's a positive?  
JOHN SHURNA: I don't know. Hopefully I won't be disappointed on Sunday. But I
guess we'll just have to wait and see. We'll be playing next week, and we like
to compete no matter who we're playing against.  
MODERATOR: One more for the student‑athletes if there is one. Anybody?  
Thank you, fellas. You may go back to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach Carmody?  
  
Q. Hey, Bill, why do you think the offense stalled so much, especially in
overtime?  
COACH CARMODY: You know, it's funny. I think we had‑‑ we must have missed
seven layups tonight. I don't know if it was just overtime that it stalled,
but I think in a stretch of the second half it was that way. I think what John
said was that you have to give credit sometimes that they were playing us real
hard, and I didn't think we were moving as well as we could, and we didn't
seem to be able to get open and to make the offense really click. And what
happened was then you come down to sort of one‑on‑one situations, and we
didn't fare that well. So I don't know if we were tired or whatever. I think
they just outplayed us in that last period.  
  
Q. Coach, Andre Hollins seemed to tear you guys up tonight. What was he
doing so well that was able to beat both the man and the zone.  
COACH CARMODY: He's a good player. He shot the ball extremely well and he has
all year. He shot the ball well, and he's just a tough guy to guard. Like I
said, in the first half he was making 3s, and then in the second half, he
went‑‑ he scored like 16 points, it seemed like, out of the first 20 or
something they had, something crazy like that.  
And in the second half, a couple times when we turned the ball over towards
the end of the game, he just took it to the basket and sort of‑‑ deep this
way, that way, and got to the rim. I mean, he was just‑‑ he's a good player.  
  
Q. Bill, you went away from the 1 ‑3‑1 and more man, it looked like, most of
the second half. Why was that, do you think?  
COACH CARMODY: They were making shots on us. I think we went back and forth.
It probably is fairly close in time that we played 1‑3‑1 and that, but we just
wanted to not give them 3s because they were‑‑ guys were making shots.  
  
Q. Bill, if there is a case to be made for Northwestern for to get into the
tournament after tonight. What is it?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, I told our guys before the game or sometime that if we
win tonight, it doesn't mean you're in; if you lose tonight, doesn't mean
you're out. And that's what I think. It's a body of work.  
And a few years ago, they said the last ten games used to be something that if
you were on a hot streak, that was more important than playing December games,
but now they say it's not true. So we'll put our resumé out there and see
where it goes.  
  
Q. Bill, frustration is part of this game. But when you come close again and
again and again, how frustrating has this been for you?  
COACH CARMODY: I'm still here. It's hard. It's disappointing, tough, and‑‑
but, you know, you come back.  
  
Q. What's the plan on Sunday? You all going to get together and watch the
selection show, or what do you traditionally do?  
COACH CARMODY: We haven't talked about it yet. I'm not really too sure what
we're going to do. We'll practice on Sunday. That I know.  
THE MODERATOR: One more, if there is one.  
  
Q. You mentioned what you told your guys before the game. What do you ‑‑  
COACH CARMODY: That might have been yesterday or something like that. I don't
know if it was ‑‑ I don't think it was right before the game, like the pregame
talk. I think it was our last practice or something.  
  
Q. Have you addressed them since after the game, or what do you tell them
Sunday to sort of keep their spirits up?  
COACH CARMODY: I got a long bus ride home to figure that out. But right now,
just reiterating what I just said. And there's not too much‑‑ you know, you
got about five minutes and then the press is in there, so haven't talked about
it too much.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH CARMODY: Okay. Thanks.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Kevin O'Neill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18261)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Marquette  72  
USC  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH O'NEILL: I thought we had two stretches where we just killed ourselves
into the first half. We had the score tied and had a series of mishaps that
weren't good. We had an air ball three, which was a bad shot. Two turnovers
and two defensive errors and all of a sudden it goes from two or three to ten.
Our guys fought. Did a good job.  
Marquette's a very good basketball team. Very well coached and play hard.
They've got ten deep. They've got back‑to‑back Sweet 16 experience. They're a
team that the points they got off their bench was really key for them. Except
for the first half against Illinois, I like how our team played throughout the
tournament. I like how we played throughout the year. I'm really appreciative
I got Buzz his 100th win. That's good for him.  
I like the way we played. We did some good things. We're not shooting the ball
well right now, and that's hurting us. Two of our perimeter guys are 1 for 8,
and 3 for 11 on good looks. So it's tough to win games when you do that. We're
not turning it over. We're rebounding the ball fairly well. We're doing a lot
of good things defensively, so we've just got to build on the tournament and
go from there.  
  
Q. With all the guys back from injury from last year, the transfer guys, how
does this tournament ‑‑ how has this tournament this week kind of helped you
guys get going for the season?   
COACH O'NEILL: Well, we got to play three top‑flight teams, all different
styles, all very good. Had a chance today‑‑ didn't have a chance against
Illinois. That was over about eight minutes in, and we should have called it.  
But I like how we played the last two games. I like a lot of the things we
did. Ultimately we're trying to get ready for our league. If you look at our
schedule, we're playing a lot of good teams. We're going to go back and play a
really good San Diego State team at home next Sunday. We're on the road in
Nebraska, NewMexico, Georgia, home against Minnesota, Dayton. We've got a good
schedule ahead of us. But a lot of the things that happened here were good for
us, and it will help us going forward.  
  
Q. I'm doing a project on concussions. In recent years how has dealing with
concussions changed from a coach's perspective?  
COACH O'NEILL: Oh, God, I don't even know that. I've had several, I think. At
least I act like that. It used to be 10 years ago, 12 years ago even if
somebody had a concussion and they didn't play, everybody said they were soft.
You know, get in there and do this, get in there and do that. But obviously,
over time it's been proven that it is a little more than a headache. I think
there is an overreaction to it all now. Every time a guy bumps his head, he's
out for three days, can't practice, might have a concussion.  
So I don't know anything about this concussion baseline test they do or any of
that. But I think trainers are very aware and I think doctors are. It's one of
those things where it's better to be safe than sorry, because if it saves one
guy's life, that's good. That's all I know about concussions.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, one last comment about the Maui trip?  
COACH O'NEILL: Yes, we had a fantastic time. It's hard to have a fantastic
time when you play like we did the first half of the Illinois game. Everything
for us, the tournament, and everything outside of it was as first class as you
could ever have. Both banquets were outstanding. The hospitality was
unbelievable. The tournament was extremely well run, and it's a place that
everybody should play. We played in the Diamond Head a couple years ago.  
It was my first time ever coaching in the Maui Invitational, and as soon as we
have a chance, we'll come back. That's the best thing you could ever say about
any tournament.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Roquez Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24430)

### [Rick Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24413)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Texas  69  
Mississippi State  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Ray and Roquez Johnson. Coach, opening comments?  
COACH RAY: This is the same 'ol story for us. Same old story for us. Our
assist to ratio was 7 of 18. We haven't been in the positive down here yet.
Gave up 17 offensive rebounds. They had 24 points off our turnovers, and 16
points off of second chances. We went through the past three games and added
up points off turnovers for the opposing team, and points off second chance
shots. If we just eliminate some of those things, we have a chance to win the
ballgame.  
But we continue to beat ourselves by doing those two things, and also just not
sharing the basketball. Our guys continue to fight and compete and play hard,
but we're beating ourselves right now.  
I know NorthCarolina and Marquette and Texas are quality basketball teams. But
we're basically not giving ourselves a chance to win games because we just put
ourselves out by making those mistakes.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys are down body ‑wise. You talked about it all week.
Did this tournament at 0‑3, did this tournament give you something to build on
for the rest of the season?   
COACH RAY: That remains to be seen. We'll see where we go from here.
Obviously, when you go 0‑3, I don't know if you can say you can build upon
that. You don't have much of a choice. You didn't win a game. So how we play
the rest of the season and a few games after this Maui tournament will
determine if we have something to build on or not.  
THE MODERATOR: Roquez, I know it's been a tough couple of days here, but
perhaps you'd like to make a comment about the tournament experience?  
ROQUEZ JOHNSON: Yeah, we played a lot of good teams and we didn't fight as
hard as we should have in the first half. But the second half we decided to
come out and play hard. But we've got to play both halves as hard as we can,
but we didn't do that.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Tyler Griffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20689)

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

### [Brandon Paul](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22116)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Illinois  78  
Butler  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
  
Q. You're allowed to smile. The game's over.  
COACH GROCE: That's a great perspective. He's right. I need to take a deep
breath. Obviously, we feel extremely privileged and honored to win such a
prestigious tournament. I carried the trophy with the guys up to the locker
room, and you see the names that are on that trophy, and it really puts it in
perspective.  
The quality of this tournament, as I've said the entire time, I think it's the
premier, pre‑season tournament. I remember as a little kid watching the
championship game on Wednesday night before Thanksgiving when I was younger
growing up in Danville, Indiana. So it's‑‑ what a privilege. Our guys are
humbled.  
But I thought Butler obviously was an extremely worthy opponent. Watching them
on film, not surprising. Brad is a terrific coach. They've got a great
program. I think it's a really good basketball team that we beat. The thing I
was probably the most proud of was our toughness. Whenever you play Butler,
you have to be tough. They're just so tough mentally and physically, they
never beat themselves. That says a lot about Brad and what he does with his
kids. We're excited. I told the guys upstairs, it's obviously a tremendous
start for our basketball program. But we can still get better. As long as the
guys in my locker room believe that and they continue to give great effort and
they've been very coachable. They want to be really good. They're fun to be
around every day. As long as we stay humble and don't swallow the poison of
success, I think we have a chance to play better basketball.  
  
Q. This is your first year at Illinois. Are you surprised at how well things
have worked out so far?  
COACH GROCE: Obviously do you envision sitting at 6‑0? I'm a little different.
These guys will tell you. I focus on practice every day. At least I hope
they'll tell you we come to practice ready to go every day. We try to get
better every day and let the results take care of themselves. We don't get
caught up in necessarily thinking two games ahead or a game ahead.  
Obviously, it's a great start, and I'm happy for these guys. These guys have
been through a lot, especially the seniors, Tyler and Brandon and D.J.; and
Sam has been a tremendous addition to our class of seniors as well. So I'm
happy for those guys. Really happy for Illini Nation. I had no idea we had
sold that many. It was unbelievable the turnout that we had. Tremendous
support from our fans, so we're blessed and thankful for that as well.  
  
Q. Brandon and Tyler, I want to know how your legs feel after three days in
a row? Coach put in a lot of the second string and kept rotating guys. Did you
feel fresh?  
BRANDON PAUL: Quite honestly, my legs feel great. The coaching staff made sure
we got what we need done before the game, and when it comes to practice time.
But they take care of us body‑wise. They make sure we get in cold tubs and
make sure not to go too long in practice. As long as we go hard in everything
we do, Coach Groce likes to have a pace for everything. They make sure we're
fresh, and I'm feeling pretty good right now.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: I know not a lot of people liked us coming over and playing in
Hawaii beforehand, but I think that helped us get accustomed to the time
change and getting our legs prepared. But first of all, it was a tough game,
but it really helped us fight through the fatigue of jet lag and got us ready
to play for the tournament.  
  
Q. Brandon, you won the MVP award and rose the trophy above your head. Just
talk about what that was like to salute the crowd with that trophy?  
BRANDON PAUL: It's obviously a blessing. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for
God, my family members, friends and my teammates and coaching staff. But it
means as much as the championship means to me. We came out with the mindset
that we wanted to prove ourselves, and I think we did that. We're in no shape
to just stop right here. We got the championship we wanted, and I'm proud of
my teammates. And MVP is just the icing on the cake for me.  
  
Q. For the players, you were picked ninth by the media in the Big Ten. Is
that motivation?  
COACH GROCE: I didn't know that.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: We don't look at that. Final rankings are the ones that matter.
Sorry to be blunt.  
  
Q. Last night he asked you about the style. If you could describe your style
in one word, you said attacking. Did you feel like you guy it's that
tonight?  
COACH GROCE: First half for sure. We got a lot of stops and we were out
running. I thought the start of the second half Butler made a lot of
adjustments in terms of trying to take advantage of stuff with ball screens
and stuff like that. I thought we were taking the ball out of the net too much
to start the second half. We weren't able to get out and run. But once we
started getting more stops, which we were able to string them together midway
through the second half, I thought we got back out running again.  
These guys will tell you, it's one of those deals. Running is hard. It sounds
good in theory but I've got to give a lot of credit to Mike Basgier, our
strength and conditioning coach. Our guys played four games in six days. I
thought we competed hard. We looked good out there for this early in the year,
and Mike and his staff, Jimmy Russomano, our GA deserve a lot of credit,
because they had these guys ready.  
  
Q. I'd like to know about a play in the second half. It seemed decisive from
me apart from Tyler's two daggers, Brandon you had a good angle on this. I
don't know if you could see it, coach, but Sam McLaurin had a play in the
lane, he got an elbow to the head that was pretty sharp and still managed to
get the ball in. Was that a game changer, Brandon?  
BRANDON PAUL: Yeah, Sam's a monster in there. He's one of the biggest
additions to our team. Obviously, we lost a great player in Meyers, but Sam
coming on is a blessing for us. He plays hard on both sides of the floor. If
you look at the last game, he got a rebound after I missed the three. He got
it back out and got another three after that. He has plays like that all the
time. He's a bulldog in there, and he plays hard on the floor.  
COACH GROCE: I saw the play. Brandon will tell you, we talked about it and
told him he got lucky, because actually, they came and zoned up. It was what
we call a traffic catch. It was unbelievable. I told Sam that's one of the
best catches I've seen in 19 years. Brandon and I laughed about it, and said
we probably got away with one there.  
But once again another thing that Sam does that adds value to our team. He's
one of those guys that doesn't show up on the stat sheet all the time.  
I had one guy like that when I was at Ohio. His value to our team doesn't show
up on a box score: His leadership, his toughness at both ends, his screening,
hustle plays, charges. He's a winner. Like Brandon said, he's been a real
blessing for our program and our team.  
  
Q. Coach Stevens talked about the back ‑to‑back threes as being kind of the
ballgame. Can you guys talk about how big that was?  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Well, I missed my first one, and Coach Ford, our assistant
coach came up to me and put me back in the game. He said, "Don't hesitate, if
you hesitate, you're coming out." I said, "Okay, Coach." They were doing a
good job of switching on the ball screens, and I was able to come down below
the man that I was going to set the screen on and slip the fade. I got Tracy
Abrams gave me two good looks and two good passes so I could get open looks. I
couldn't do it without Tracy or Brandon at point guards giving me the ball.  
  
Q. I've been watching you play since freshman year. You seem to have taken
your game to a completely different level this year. Talk to me about what's
different this year?  
BRANDON PAUL: I think Coach Groce's offense opened it up for us we pretty much
have the green light. The offense works with the type of players we have on
the team, and as long as we shoot good shots which I think most of our shots
are good shots. I probably took a couple bad shots today. But for the most
part, the offense gives us a chance to make baskets. Not only that, just
working in the off‑season. We put up a lot of work not only as a team, but
individually and it's starting to show now.  
COACH GROCE: Before we leave, I want to thank Coach Odom, and Briana and
KemperLesnik and EA Sports and all the sponsors. This is our first time over,
and a lot of us it was our first time to be in Hawaii, and it was fantastic.
The hospitality was second to none.  
We really appreciate all the efforts that everyone made to welcome the
Fighting Illini, and I'm proud of the way these guys represented the
University of Illinois, but we're thankful for the opportunity. Thank you.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Rotnei Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19418)

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Illinois  78  
Butler  61

  
Q. Rotnei was obviously great tonight, but other guys kind of struggled to
score the basketball.  
COACH STEVENS: Yeah, I thought we looked a step behind on both ends of the
floor. I told our guys when a team's shooting like that, number one we have to
change schemes like we did. We did a good job. They only hit three threes in
the second half. Number two, you have to get every loose ball, and we didn't.
We didn't. We got beat to some loose balls, and, again, credit to them.
They're playing with great intensity, and their skill level is so high. They
spread you out so much that sometimes you're not in position to get some of
those balls.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your feeling it, but were you conscious of trying
to get other guys going?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: We were just trying to do whatever we could to get going.
Whether that was me being aggressive or trying to get to the hole or score a
little bit or other guys scoring. We were just trying to get into a groove and
get something going.  
Like Coach said, we didn't do enough of the little things like getting to the
loose balls that we have a chance of getting to, and that's what killed us in
the end.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think of Brandon Paul?  
COACH STEVENS: Oh, he's terrific. They're a really good basketball team.
Brandon Paul was a pro. He's a big time pro. Not only because he shoots it,
the way he shoots it, he creates distance on his drives. I had to ask is he
traveling? And I don't think he was, but he had such a long stride. We had
good athletes guarding him and still couldn't keep him in front. I think he's
as good of a pro prospect as there probably was in this tournament. Really
good player, but really well complemented too with the other guys.  
I think the key to their team and the guy that's elevated them beyond what
people may have expected in the early season is Tracy Abrams. He was terrific
all tournament. He's really started off well, and I got a chance to coach
Tracy for a blink of an eye in under 18, USA basketball a couple summers ago.
He's a really neat kid who takes coaching well, and it's good to see him have
success, just not against us.  
  
Q. What was it like going up against Coach Groce tonight and what did you
say to each other afterwards?  
COACH STEVENS: John may say different, but I didn't really feel like it was
our coaching staff against their coaching staff. It was our team against their
team. They did a really good job in defending us. I thought, especially in the
first half. I thought they we made a few adjustments in the second half and
they adjusted as well. We just couldn't keep up with them on the other end of
the floor. Then to be quite candid, when you give up 39 points to Butler in a
half, something's wrong. It was we could not keep up with the ball movement.
We didn't have enough pressure on the ball. In the second half, we really
stayed home and went away from our core system quite a bit. It got us back in
the game until Griffey hit those two threes, but that's what they'll do. It
happened for us in a couple of games already this year. We'll go on 6 or 9‑0
runs, and then bang, game is different. We're right in the game and a 6‑0 run
and bang, game is over.  
  
Q. Watching Rotnei take a lot of those shots, it looks like you've given him
the ultimate green light. It kind of reminded me of Jimmer Fredette at BYU a
couple of years ago. When he's feeling it, you seem to just let him shoot
wherever he wants to shoot.  
COACH STEVENS: If he's not feeling it, he's got the same Green light. Here's
why, Chad. I think there aren't five guys that have played college basketball
in the last ten years that have put in as much time as him. So he deserves to
shoot as much as he wants. Not everybody that put in that much time would be
that good. But the time that he puts in is remarkable. It's been contagious to
our team. I thought Kellen's legs were. But he was short quite a bit. He's
another one that gets in the gym, and those guys have the green light.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, maybe make a final comment about the overall experience
here in Maui?  
COACH STEVENS: Absolutely terrific experience. So thankful to be invited, be a
part of it. I said this when we got here this was a bucket list event for
Butler. And we've lived a lot of bucket list moments in our last ten years or
so, but this is right up there. We played in the preseason NIT. We've played
in all the other exempts, and this has been a tremendous experience. I told
Dave earlier, you just tell me when you want us back.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Junior Cadougan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23553)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Jamil Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24434)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Marquette  72  
USC  64

  
Q. Jamil, what was working for you today and your familiarity with Oregon,
did that play any part with USC? Did that play any part of it?  
JAMIL WILSON: I think what was really working for us today as a team, just
penetrating and moving without the ball. Junior did a good job finding
everybody. Van did a good job of penetrating, and they had to extend for Jake,
because everyone knows he's a pretty good shooter.  
So we tried to keep the floor space. Then guys like me, Davante, Chris, Juan,
Steve, we kind of just pick our spots and you feel around, and they usually
find you.  
My freshman year, I actually didn't play that much against USC. I knew I
could, but I didn't. So I kind of had a chip on my shoulder because I wanted
to prove that I could do something out there. But other than that, it was just
a good overall win for our team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting two wins after the tough opening loss? How
important is that for your team?  
JAMIL WILSON: I felt like it was great for us to turn it around and get these
two wins. It shows some maturity of our team, the maturity of our coaching
staff, and the maturity of everybody knowing that we didn't put our heads
down. We had a heartbreaking loss.  
So at the beginning of the season, it shows a big deal that we can just turn
around and get these two big wins and be mature.  
JAMIL WILSON: Just to back up what Junior said, it shows a lot about our team,
and how we go about things every day. Not letting something like that get us
down, because the shot was pretty devastating. No one even thought it was
going in, and it happened, and it was a quick turnaround, not like two days in
between the game.  
We have to get up and go at it again. It just goes shows how we go about our
work every day and stay on the same path and don't try to veer too much.  
  
Q. Jamil, I'm working on a transfer story for later in the week. Just what
is your experience after your transfer from Oregon and with your new team?
What's it been like?  
JAMIL WILSON: I think it's been great. I think it was the best move I made at
that time, it was right for me. Leaving my senior year of high school and
going to Oregon turned out to be pretty good. I took a year off, and I got
beat up by Jimmy Butler and Jay every day. Last year I got to mix in with the
guys. And I think building as a team, we're building a foundation and moving
ahead. We're putting a foot forward each and every day. So I think the
progress has been great, and I think the choice I made was awesome.  
  
Q. Jamil, happy birthday.  
JAMIL WILSON: Thank you.  
  
Q. When they started making their run a little bit, was that because you
guys were in the zone defense, they started screening and making some shots?  
JUNIOR CADOUGAN: We tried going to the zone defense and getting a different
look, and Kevin O'Neill and the guys did a good job of changing up and
executing. We tried to give them a good look. We tried to give them a
different look and they executed and brought the score back.  
But Coach Buzz and everybody were just saying keep poised, keep poised, make
great plays. Throw good pitches and we'll be all right. And we came out with
the win.  
  
Q. Do either of you guys know how Vander's doing?  
JAMIL WILSON: He's good. He was just telling us, he dove for the ball. He was
trying to pass it, and actually when he dove, someone hit his knee. I guess
his knee pushed outward a little bit, and once he actually fell on the ground,
the guy that fell on top of him actually fell on the same knee. He's icing it
now. He said it's fine. But he should be all right.  
JUNIOR CADOUGAN: He'll be fine.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to run or walk on the beach or will you be able to
before you leave?  
JAMIL WILSON: I think right now we've got the freedom. Buzz gave us the green
light to go have fun and enjoy, definitely ready. But we did stuff on the
beach as a team the first day we got here and stuff like that. But now it's
really time to take advantage of Maui.  
THE MODERATOR: Is this the first time both of you have been to Maui?  
JUNIOR CADOUGAN: Yes.  
JAMIL WILSON: Yes.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought it was a rock fight in a lot of ways. I have the
utmost respect for KO, how hard their team's compete. I thought our guys
played really hard. It's hard to go back‑to‑back‑to‑back, no matter what your
record is. I thought our guys played really hard. So we're thankful to come
out on top.  
  
Q. Junior and Jamil said they thought Vander was okay. Did you get any
indication on his situation?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I mean until we get verification, it's hard to say. But
we'll try to figure that out over the next few hours. The one doctor here said
he didn't tear his ACL. He thought it was twisted, but that's not confirmed.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the way you guys bounced back with two
wins after the tough opening loss?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We have a short memory. We celebrate victories until midnight,
and we mourn losses till midnight, and then we've got to wake up when the sun
comes up the next day and go to work. I've said that since I've been employed
here. I think that's what you do in your job. I think that's what we should do
in our job.  
  
Q. What was working for Jamil?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's a really good player. He wasn't very good on Monday. His
effort wasn't good enough. I told our guys all the time you have to deserve to
win and you have to deserve to make a shot, but yesterday and today he was one
of the more talented guys here.  
If you look at his stat line, I guess he did everything good except getting
assists. But coming into today, I think he had 11 assists through four games
and two turnovers, so I'll talk to him about getting more assists.  
  
Q. It looks like the only time that Southern Cal made a little run was early
in the second half. It looks like you guys switched the zone a little bit, and
they started some screens and making shots?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Possession in the zone in the game they scored once. I thought
they came at us to start the second half, and we didn't respond the right way.
Then I thought we were kind of able to level it off for the next, through the
next media timeout, and I thought in that third media timeout we came back
with what we needed to come back with.  
  
Q. I'm doing a project on sports concussions. In recent years, how have
dealing with concussions changed from a coach's perspective.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Are you a student, a writer or student/writer?  
  
Q. I'm a student.  
COACH WILLIAMS: In college or in high school?  
  
Q. High school?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It scares me to death. I would say that I have spent 25 hours
studying concussions. Jimmy Butler who was drafted by the Bulls two years ago
was the first kid I signed when I got the job at Marquette. His head hit the
floor diving for a loose ball, and that was when all of this stuff in the NFL
had really kind of flourished and I spent an inordinate amount of time reading
all the documentation, reading all the new research, talking to NFL trainers,
talking to NBA trainers, because I think when something happens with your
brain, you can't detect that.  
Like all of this stuff that I studied, they said that, like boxers and some of
those retired NFL guys when the second concussion is in a short period of time
to the first one, that means the third one's going to happen even quicker. And
that's where all of it is in disarray. I'm scared of it. I'm overprotective
with our guys from a health standpoint.  
Like I hold our guys out more than our trainer and team doctors ever ask on
any injury. But particularly when it has to do with their brain.  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe you can just comment about the trip to Maui and
experiencing the whole tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're extremely thankful. I know everybody says thank you, but
we really mean it. It's been an unbelievable experience for our kids. It's
something they'll always remember. It's something for me as a coach and staff
we will always remember.

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Reggie Bullock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23627)

### [James Michael McAdoo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23585)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

North Carolina  112  
Chaminade  68

  
COACH WILLIAMS: Needless to say, it's a better feeling right now than we had
last night. But last night's game had a great effect on how we played today.
We were all extremely upset and extremely mad, however you want to describe
it. But really wanted to focus on today's game and have a different energy
level. I think we did.  
But we were more gifted than they are too. I felt badly for Eric. He really
does a nice job with his team, but we were sharing the basketball tonight. I
thought at halftime we had 17 assists out of 26 baskets, I think or 24
baskets. And four or five of those were steals and breakaway lay‑ups where you
cannot have an assist. So we had 17 assists out of 19 baskets.  
Second half I still thought we passed it very well, but didn't have as many
assists listed by them. But for us, it does make you feel better, but you also
have that hurt that you know you didn't play as well as you wanted to play all
three days. We didn't get what we wanted out of the tournament, because we
wanted to win the championship. We didn't get what we wanted because we wanted
to get better every day, and we didn't do that.  
Still I feel really happy for our guys right now, and I feel sad for Eric,
because I think he does a nice job and he's got a good club. It just happened
that they caught us on a bad night for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Reggie, James, any thoughts on the game?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: For me, I just felt like we shared the ball well and tried to
pick up the defensive intensity, even though they were getting a lot of open
looks for us not containing the ball. On the dribble drive that was kicking
out to open man on the three‑point shot, we've got to do a better job at that.
They're a great three‑point shooting team. They always get some open looks.  
Other than that, I felt like our team tried to be better on the defensive end
of the floor and try to rebound better and take our anger out from last night
how we played as a team.  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: A lot like what Reggie and Coach were saying, trying to
refocus and come back today ready to play, knowing that we still had another
opportunity as a team to go out and play better. For us to go out there and
get the victory, like Coach said, Chaminade is a great team, and they'll win a
lot of ballgames this year. Sorry to beat them that bad, but we were really
trying to go out there and get better as a team.  
  
Q. Reggie, I think four of you had at least two three ‑pointers. When each
of you is hitting like that, does that fuel everybody else? For James Michael,
how does the three‑point shooting when they're going down, how does that
benefit you in the post?   
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: For me, I came out shooting the ball well in the first
come minutes of the game. So once I get going, my teammates are knocking down
shots and it gives them confidence that I can knock down shots and pull the
trigger. Our big men expect us to shoot the ball if we're wide open. But if we
got a contested jumpshot, I definitely got it down low. But I felt like our
big man believed in us to take shots and make them and that's what we're
trying to do to build confidence in everybody.  
REGGIE BULLOCK: When our premier players are making threes, it makes it a lot
easier. I know for me and the other big guys. First off, when we don't have to
score the ball, it makes the game a lot easier when they're knocking down
threes. It just helps us when we do need to establish the inside presence. We
just have so much more time and room to operate when they're spacing out the
floor and having to draw a defender.  
  
Q. Reggie and James Michael, five games in, how would you characterize this?
This is where you are as a team, and the next game is at No. 1 Indiana. How
prepared do you think y'all are for that?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: As a team, I feel like we've been growing through the first
five games. There are still areas that we need improvement on, and that's what
we have practice for. I felt like we've been growing as a team. Everybody just
still trying to find out their role. It just starts in practice with us doing
the things that we do as a team being able to perform on game night.  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: Like Reggie said, we're right where we want to be, but
we have so much room for improvement. And that will just come with putting the
time in. A lot of that comes in situations like kind of yesterday where we
didn't really show up ready to play. But we'll have to look back and learn
from those type of experiences and look forward to our next game. But more
importantly, these practices coming up where we kind of take the time and hit
the drawing board and learn from our mistakes and get better as a team.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, this is day seven on this road trip. Has this been
beneficial in terms of team chemistry, team bonding that kind of thing?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: It's been great, besides the homework part and being away from
school. But we've been doing a lot of team bonding. Like tomorrow, we'll have
time as a team to do a lot of team bonding. We'll have Thanksgiving together.
So I feel like this trip was great for us to get away from school. Still do
school work, but we're definitely doing a lot of team bonding.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We had one guy have to take a test. So they can still work on
the academic side.  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: I think the team bonding is awesome. I just feel like
team bonding is a weird word to use. We're all brothers. We love each other
and fight all the time. But it was definitely a great opportunity. I think
Coach said it was a nine‑game road trip. Just being away has been hard on our
bodies, but it's been a great opportunity not only to get closer to each other
but to our coaching staff, really being able to learn about each other.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you what is something you learned about, one of the
freshmen or upperclassmen that you might not have known about those guys
before spending so much time on the road with them?  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: One thing was really funny about Joel was his choice of
music. Wherever we went, he would listen to‑‑ like we were in California, he
would listen to Tupac and California Rappers. Then we got here, and he was
listening to ukulele music and weird music. But that's just Joel.  
REGGIE BULLOCK: For me, I would probably say Brice. I think to me, part of
being a player and part of this team, I feel like he tried to fit in with the
upperclassmen. He was trying to be with the upperclassmen and all that. That's
what I felt like. He just tried to fit in.  
COACH WILLIAMS: They learn I can't explode. Because my first explosion here
was last night, first time out.  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: That's true. Rest in peace to that clipboard.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, we have to have a second clipboard. Does anybody else
have a question for the guys because I'd like to let them go see some family
out there. Is that all right?  
  
Q. I asked you before about your team in the West Coast Swing?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're responding pretty well in a tough situation. I think
that was good for us. I also think that they understood what we were talking
about all the negatives that we had last night and they were willing to try to
work on them.  
I think we found out that going small sometimes might be one of our better
lineups, particularly on the offensive end of the court. We played P.J. today
as a four. We played J.P as a four. Only had one post player in there. So I
think that might help us down the line as well.  
But I think each and every day trying to practice and go through the games and
teach. And at halftime, we were still teaching. At the end of the game when I
put Code Blue and Jackson in the game, I had Joel out there and I was talking
to him still trying to teach. So I do believe most coaches feel the same way.
We're teachers and still trying to teach regardless what the score is so we
have more opportunities.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what went into the decision to help Brice and how he
handled his first start?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We've done some different things. We started Desmond maybe
every game, but I'm not positive about that. We started somebody different in
the second half three of the five previous games. We thought Brice did a
better job than any of the other guys in the games. It was a tremendous
hatch‑up problem because you look at their starting lineup, and they list four
guards in the four. So it's hard to match‑up and use our big guys. When we had
John and Tyler Hansbrough, and Zeller and all those guys, we didn't mind them
going out and chasing little guys around on the court, because those little
guys couldn't guard them on the other end.  
So it might be a match‑up problem for them on one end. Like it was for us on
the other. Right now, with Joel catching the ball, making a quick decisive,
and moving the post was not like Tyler Hansbrough. So match‑up concerns was
part of the reason to go for Brice was well. You look down, 7 for 8 from the
floor, two blocked shots and everybody should be pleased with that. He is
going to get better and better.  
He's just got to increase the intensity and tempo of his own game, because
right now his intensity level is different from what I visualize.  
  
Q. Luke was 7 ‑1, is he starting to prove to you to be a valuable option
there?   
COACH WILLIAMS: He gave us a little lift last night in the game when he was in
there with that group. Luke works on it on so, so hard. I'm tough on point
guards. It wasn't just that Marcus's back was bothering him. So I went with
Marcus, and didn't play him after that. He tweaked it a little bit in last
night's game and just didn't feel good today.  
Having Luke to get extra minutes is going to be something that will help us
down the line. Not like it had to last year. Remember last year we were
starting the game to go to in the Final Four. We had our third or fourth point
guard, and back‑up power forward. So we've got to have some guys that can get
some minutes at the point guard spot.  
  
Q. It obviously doesn't get any easier next with Indiana on that road trip.
How prepared do you think you are for that? What will be the practice schedule
leading into that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: There is no way we're prepared for that. Until you're there,
you don't know what you want to face. Long Beach was a very enthusiastic
crowd, but it's nothing like we'll face in Indiana. Long Beach, they came in
from the beach to watch the game. Indiana they've been camping out for three
days, that kind of thing. The intensity level of the crowd and the emotion
will be different. It will be a game that they probably have been looking to
their schedule for quite a while. We're not going to practice tomorrow. We're
not going to practice on Friday, and I think the game is Tuesday. We'll
practice Monday night and go up there.  
  
Q. Coach, any final thoughts on your trip to Maui?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's a fantastic experience. I've been here five times now.
Every time I've left I've asked to come back four years now. I hope they'll
let us come back. We went to Kansas and had a great experience this year. Won
one, lost another one, and we've been here three times with NorthCarolina.  
When I make out my schedule and people call us about all these tournaments,
every four years I'm going to go to Maui, and I won't give that to anybody.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [DeAndre Haskins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24421)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

North Carolina  112  
Chaminade  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH BOVAIRD: I think everybody in the country knew NorthCarolina was going
to come out and play extremely hard today. We knew that, and we were going to
get their best shot. They're pretty good when they play that hard, and I'm
sure Coach Williams is going to have them playing that hard the rest of the
season. It was kind of a wake‑up call for them against Butler. Unfortunately,
we were sitting there waiting after a horrible game.  
But anyway, when any team shoots the ball that well, it makes it incredibly
hard to guard. I don't know. I think they were 8 for 11 or 9 for 13 some
times. I checked the three‑point stats and when you shoot the ball that well,
it spreads out the court, and they can dump it into the big guys. We were kind
of hoping they would come out cold and we'd be back in the zone and make it a
possession‑by‑possession game. But that wasn't quite the case.  
  
Q. Just talk about NorthCarolina's transition game?  
COACH BOVAIRD: They've been famous for it. When their big guys get out and run
and their wings run lanes and they go right into several different sets out of
transition, they're tough to guard. We had a hard time matching up. They got
some early, quick looks at wide open threes and knocked them down.  
When their big guys run the floor like that, it really puts the pressure on
the defense.  
  
Q. I was hoping if both of you could talk about their half-court defense as
well?  
DeANDRE HASKINS: They're very good at rotating and recovering. We have to do a
better job of knowing when someone else is cutting instead of cutting to the
same spot. I thought that's what kind of messed us up a little bit and our
offense and stuff like that.  
We have to get better throughout the season of reading each other and playing
together through their defense. They're extremely huge, too. So that plays a
big role in us getting our offense off.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, we had a hard time getting in their set plays, because we
rarely come across a team that can put that kind of pressure on us, and we
usually have a mismatch for a lot of teams.  
We have four guys that can handle the ball really well. So we usually just
adjust and go against one of their other big guys. McAdoo and the rest of them
were just getting in passing lanes and kind of disrupting our offense all the
way around.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what DeAndre showed in this tournament? Coming back
from his injury last year, and being back on this stage and how he did
throughout this tournament?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Oh, he did great. I'm so proud of him because he's come a long
ways, not only as a basketball player, but as a person, as a teammate. He's
come a long ways, and we're really proud of him in that aspect.  
We all knew, and I told I think Bill Cowher before the tournament started, if
I had one high major, whatever, mid‑major athlete, it was him. When he has his
mind straight, he's as good‑‑ he could play for these teams. I'm really proud
of where he's come.  
  
Q. DeAndre, to kind of expand on that thought, can you talk about playing
NorthCarolina today after your experience playing them at Valpo?  
DeANDRE HASKINS: I feel like they could be a lot better than the last team I
played. Playing at Valpo, they weren't as physical because Tyler Hansbrough is
coming off an injury or something like that. But all the guys on this team can
shoot the ball really well. Even the post player has a 17, 19‑footer jumpshot.  
So I feel like if he continues playing strong‑‑ well, not the past couple
games, but the first game that they played, I'm thinking they could be a
National Championship team. They probably will be.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any final thoughts on your experience here in Maui
again?  
COACH BOVAIRD: It was a great experience. We look forward to this week as so
many people do elaborate planning for this event. There are so many people
involved in the process. For my good buddy Dave Odom back there. EA Sports,
KemperLesnik, adidas, it's spectacular.  
I would dream in playing in something like this as a kid, and have the
opportunity to coach. It's really special for me. Now we have our name in the
history book as one of the Chaminade teams that upset somebody. So I'm really
happy about that, and hopefully there's many more to come.  
DeANDRE HASKINS: I want to say hello to my mother and my family. I haven't
seen them in a while. So if they're watching this, hello. It's a blessing to
be in Hawaii and grow and change as a man. I'm hoping to do more things and do
better things. Get a win in Maui, a National Championship would be great.  
COACH BOVAIRD: I'll take that.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2012

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24433)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Texas  69  
Mississippi State  55

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Barnes and Sheldon McClellan. Coach, would you like to
make some opening comments?  
COACH BARNES: First of all, I want to really thank the people here with this
tournament. Everybody associated with it, everywhere we go, it's unbelievable
the way we're treated here. It's just great. Everybody, I mean, from the time
you get off the bus to the people you meet going into the locker room. It's
just a great tournament. We're really proud of being a part of it. So I want
to really thank everyone for that.  
With our game today I thought early once we got things going defensively, we
really did some good things and thought our offense was able to feed off that.
But, again, we don't understand the value of taking care of the ball in the
second half. There was nothing really good that came out of it, other than I
thought that Sheldon really responded coming in. Offensively he did some good
things, but more importantly was the effort he was trying to make on the
defensive end.  
But as a team, we can't turn the ball over the way we did, especially the
guards, the guards, most all of them. But, again there were some good things.
I thought guys like Connor Lammert who hadn't played very much. We talked to
him, are you going to play? The effort came back in, we were taking guys out
if they weren't giving us the effort on the defensive end.  
So we'll continue to do that if we get to a point where we can play 40 minutes
of basketball the way we think a Texas basketball team should play.  
  
Q. You came here a young team. Did you grow up a little bit in the last
three days?  
COACH BARNES: I do think we got better, because I thought the first night we
came out, and I don't think we could have beaten any team in the country. We
walked out, and I'm not sure. Maybe it was a little bit of an entitlement‑type
attitude because of what I think our program has stood for and what guys have
done before us. We're not there yet. I thought today we got closer to it,
because this game is a tough game to get ready for. But I thought we came out
and got better, but we didn't sustain it in the second half.  
You can play all the what ifs and this and that, but that's toughness.
Toughness is doing it every time, doing your job every single time. But I do
think that we've got to continue to grow.  
I've told these guys all along, if we figure it out, we've got a chance to be
good. There is a lot of basketball left, and we've got a lot of room for
improvement. But the first thing that we've got to get is a consistent effort.
Everybody putting both feet in and playing for one thing, and that is the
University of Texas.  
  
Q. Sheldon, do you feel like you and your teammates grew up this week?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: Most definitely. After that Chaminade team, we grew up a
lot as a team. After yesterday, Coach was mad at us. We got better, even
though we lost, we were satisfied with the loss, and we shouldn't be
satisfied. We should put the focus on always getting better.  
THE MODERATOR: Sheldon, any comments about the tournament and your experience
here in Maui?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: It was a great tournament. My first experience in Hawaii,
some competition, and we got better as a team.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2012

  

### [Roquez Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24430)

### [Rick Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24413)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Marquette  89  
Mississippi State - 62

THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments, please?

COACH RAY: Obviously, we\'re short of bodies right now. We\'ve got two
problems. In the first half, we make mistakes and we just don\'t have enough
bodies to hold guys accountable. There is no substitution pattern to take guys
off when they make mistakes defensively and offensively. Then in the second
half we start competing and fighting, and we just get worn down.

I give credit to our players. They did not give up. They haven\'t given up.
They continue to work hard and play hard. We\'re just so short of bodies right
now. When you\'re playing three games in three days against quality
competition. Obviously, Marquette is a team that prides themselves on playing
hard and playing tough, and they do a good job with that.

But I looked at some of the statistics and we did some tough, hard things. The
fact that we shot 23 free throws to their 8 free throws, I believe is a
testament to our guys.

We\'ve just got to continue to work and to fight. But one of our biggest
problems right now is that we don\'t get enough ball reversals. We\'ve got
guys that attack off the dribble, but it\'s probably too early in the shot
clock to end up with an empty possession.

I\'m happy with the fact that our guys are fighting hard, and with us having
not enough bodies, we can\'t hold guys accountable and then we just get worn
down.

Q. Are you okay after that injury?

ROQUEZ JOHNSON: Yeah, it\'s nothing serious.

Q. Can you talk about just playing in this tournament? Obviously tough
competition. Is it going to make you guys better in the long run, do you
think?

ROQUEZ JOHNSON: Yeah, it\'s a great team. It\'s like getting that experience
and playing on better teams and stuff like that. So I think it\'s for the
whole team to get better as a group and stuff.

Q. Coach, are you in search of a leader out there on the floor?

COACH RAY: To a degree. Leadership has got to come from a collective group:
The only person that had experience playing college basketball is Jalen
Steele. Roquez has stepped up and provided toughness. Wendell Lewis provided a
little bit last year. We\'re just void of experience at this point in time. So
when you\'re void of experience, you\'re always looking for leadership.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2012

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Illinois  84  
Chaminade  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Groce, some opening comments?  
COACH GROCE: Obviously, we are excited to compete in such a prestigious
tournament and championship game tomorrow. Our guys have earned that right
with the way they've played and their effort and our execution I think
continues to get better, which is going to make us a more complete team.  
I thought tonight the key was two things: The defensive end, for us to affect
them and they shoot 37%. We forced 14 turnovers. Then I thought the second
factor was our bench led by Joseph who is here with me. I thought that Joseph
and Devin Langford and Myke Henry gave us great energy off the bench. What an
asset to have as our team continues to develop and get a little better every
day.  
  
Q. Can you expand on how important the bench play is in this tournament
specifically? Three games in three days?  
COACH GROCE: It's huge. It's huge all the time, but it's a great point,
especially when you're playing three games in three days. I thought a couple
of our guys certainly made some plays for us. But one is consistent with their
energy level, maybe some of our higher minute guys.  
But I will tell you, the bench was ready to go. Good teams have depth. Again,
I thought Joseph and Myke Henry and Devin Langford, in particular, and even
the way the guys finished the game at the end of the game. The guys we put in
finished it the right way. They were all ready to go, and as I said earlier,
it's a tremendous asset to have.  
  
Q. What did Devin do specifically or in general that was so much
different?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I thought he was really active. Got his hands on a lot of
balls. Got a lot of deflections. Came up with a big rebound or two. Had the
steal in transition when I thought we were going to give up a lay‑up or dunk
and jumped up in the air when we stole the pass. Just was really alert
tonight. Defensively off the ball I felt like he covered up some of the sins
we had. Defensively he was able to put us in situations where he was helping
the helper and cover some things up. So his alertness and awareness was really
good tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the team, how they've sort of melded over the last
week since the Hawaii game and coming together, all of you playing together?  
COACH GROCE: I think we're playing really well. This is kind of a different
game for us playing against kind of a smaller team, keeping the smaller guards
out of the lane. I think that was a really big difference from Hawaii.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Butler? Excited about playing them tomorrow?  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, it's a great opportunity for our guys. As I mentioned at
the outset there, this is a great tournament. We've talked about it. The last
several days I've made the comment I watched it when I was younger. Especially
the championship game the night before Thanksgiving, the whole country is
watching. For us to have an opportunity to play in such a prestigious
tournament game, our guys are looking forward to the challenge of watching
whoever it is.  
Obviously, Butler's well-coached. They're tough. They're physical. They don't
beat themselves. They execute well. They'll be challenged in a lot of areas
tomorrow, but I know our guys are looking forward to that opportunity.  
  
Q. What you didn't say about Butler is you were at Butler, and Brandon
Miller was at Butler as well. Is it just the two of you?  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, obviously, Brad and I are really close. We were on the same
staff together. We talk frequently and shoot ideas off one another. Maybe not
quite as much this year until we get to this tournament, but once we get to
the tournament, we'll do that. Our families know one another.  
Brad's got a great family. Brad's a great coach and a great person. He's done
a tremendous job. As I had a chance to be on staff with them, it didn't take
very long to figure out how bright Brad is. So I'm very proud of what he's
accomplished and looking forward to the challenge of competing against his
team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Another non ‑strategic question. It came to mind that I would describe
the style of your team as scrappy. What word would you use or couple words?   
COACH GROCE: Well, we hope when people watch us‑‑ it's funny you said that. We
had Stan Van Gundy did our clinic in the second weekend after practice had
started. Stan made the comment to me if he comes to practice within the first
30 to 45 minutes, he should be able to have an idea of what a team's identity
might be.  
I think for us I would hope that that identity is attacking. That we're very
aggressive in everything we do, whether that's defensively or offensively. We
played a pace on the offensive end. Whether that's up‑tempo, transition game
or even when we're running half-court offense, when we're hard to guard.  
Tonight I didn't feel like we had quite that pace in our half‑court offense. I
thought we stood a little bit too much. The ball stopped a little too much. We
didn't have the energy level we needed there.  
But I thought the guys on the bench gave us a huge boost in that department.
But the word I would hope would be attack.  
  
Q. What were you most concerned about in Chaminade tonight and what they
brought to bear against you guys?  
COACH GROCE: Well, Joseph hit the nail on the head. We're really concerned
about the smaller team. They create so many mismatches driving the ball. They
have several guys that are what we call do‑both guys. They can shoot the ball
and deck it. We had Nnanna Egwu tonight our 6'11" center guarding a 6'4"
190‑pound guard. That's atypical.  
So I thought it was good from that standpoint. Put us in a situation where we
had to be outside our comfort zone. That's what these tournaments do this time
of year. Gives us a chance to learn a lot about your team. So we were thankful
for that. Thankful in addition to bringing that style, we have a chance to
advance to tomorrow's championship game.

## November 20, 2012

  

### [Jio Fontan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21991)

### [Kevin O'Neill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18261)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

USC  59  
Texas  53

  
COACH O'NEILL: I'm really proud of our guys bouncing back. We had a late game
last night and a noon game today. Both of us were in desperate mode. We got
whacked last night in the first half, and they lost to Chaminade.  
So you have two teams that are pretty good team that's desperate mode. It was
that kind of game. It was a rock fight, and I thought we did a great job of
executing offensively and defensively down the stretch. We had open looks,
missed them. But I liked our shots. I like how hard we played. I like the fact
that in overtime we kind of took over the game. That's why we were able to get
the win.  
We're fortunate because Texas is a good team. When they get Kabongo back,
they'll be a really good team. We've just got to turn around and do a great
job of getting ready for Marquette tomorrow.  
  
Q. You talked a little about the bounce back, but it seemed like both teams
were really struggling to shoot the basketball in the second half. You guys
kind of survived the battle. Is that a good sign?  
COACH O'NEILL: It came down that I thought both teams played hard defensively,
and made it hard on the opponent. We made enough to win. When you're playing
in one‑possession games like that, free throws are critical. We missed some at
one stretch, but then in the overtime, we made them and gave ourselves a
chance to win the game. Really proud of our guys and their effort.  
We played four game this is year, eight halves, and we've played seven really
good halves. We just got smacked last night in the first half. But hopefully
that will be a lesson for us moving forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Jio, you had 11 points and 8 assists.  
JIO FONTAN: I think for the most part today we just did a better job of going
out there and sticking with the game plan. Our coaching staff does a great job
of coming into us with a great strategy on how to stop their offense. For us,
necessarily, where we're going to get our open shots from. Yesterday wasn't a
good start to it. If I want to take responsibility as a leader, I have to do a
better job. Today I felt like I did a little bit of a better job, and the team
did a great job of staying together and playing through adversity.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2012

  

### [Rotnei Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19418)

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Butler  82  
North Carolina  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH STEVENS: Well, obviously, it was an entertaining game to be a part of.
As a coach you know even when you're up 30 or 29, whatever we were, there is
enough talent on that other bench to make that up real quick. They cut it to
about 15 in two minutes.  
We've got to get more sure with the ball in those moments. That's one of those
lessons early in the season that you get a chance to live through. Now you
know that you've got to play attacking the rest of the game. You can't start
pulling it out and doing those types of things that early. We weren't in
attack mode enough in the second half.  
But credit them, when they turned it up a notch, it was hard for us. What won
the game was the defensive guards, I thought. And the guy that made two late
rebounds, Chase Stigall, those were fifth‑year senior plays at the end of that
game. We're proud of moving on, and we know we have a tough test, Chaminade or
Illinois tomorrow.  
  
Q. Were you a little surprised to be up 29?  
COACH STEVENS: Just a little surprised. Yeah, I mean, we've been fortunate.
We've been in that spot both ways before, and you never give up. As a coach,
you just coach till the end, and the players play till the end. When you're
playing a program like Carolina you know they're coming and their runs are
coming next. We didn't handle it great, but we handled it well enough that
they never got inside six.  
  
Q. You had a really good first half. Did you feel really confident after
what happened yesterday?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: I just wanted to come in being aggressive again and try to get
my teammates involved as well. That wasn't all about me. A bunch of guys
stepped up, and we had, like Coach said, our fifth year senior, Chase Stigall
hit some shots, and Kellen hit shots, and it was a team effort as a whole.  
  
Q. New Jersey obviously thrives in their transition game. Really limited
them in the first half. Ended up with six fast breakpoints. How were you able
to do that and stop them there?  
COACH STEVENS: Well, we had pretty good offense except for our turnovers, and
we got good looks. That helps. We were pretty diligent about one and two
getting back, and three, four, and five ran pretty hard. The two things that
scare you the most about playing a Carolina team, number one, the transition,
number two, the defensive glass, and we did a good job in both of those areas.  
On short prep, too. You don't have much time to prepare for them. You've got
to emphasize very few things, and those are the two we emphasized.  
  
Q. You have a giant killer lurking in the wings out there, Chaminade. If
they succeed and the Illini tonight, I know you haven't had much of a chance
to look at them, what do you think that will be like going against the
hometown favorite?  
COACH STEVENS: I love giant killers.  
  
Q. Come on, give me a little bit more than that?  
COACH STEVENS: That's what I've got for you. I have a lot of respect for Eric
and what he's done. That was a great win yesterday.  
  
Q. Coach, those two teams that made the title game a couple years ago, what
have you seen out of this group that maybe is similar from shot making ability
or just chemistry that maybe could get you guys on another run?  
COACH STEVENS: Four games in. It's so early. What I see is a resiliency to
respond from a very disappointing game last Tuesday, and also respond from a
game 24 hours after you played your hearts out. So that's a good thing. You
see a little bit of response.  
In this game, you have to respond to get what you want. But it's a long
season, a lot is going to happen between now and then, and we're going to stay
even keel and try to play our best in the next one.  
  
Q. Recent success like you guys getting bids into this tournament and now
you're in the final. How much does being in this final mean for you guys this
year?  
COACH STEVENS: We've been fortunate we won the Diamond Head, which was a rush.
We won the Great Alaskan Shootout, which was a rush. Won the preseason NIT,
which was a rush. Got a chance to climb a lot of those mountains. If we get a
chance to play for it tomorrow, there is no reason to leave anything in the
locker room, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Your team was 12 for 25 from three ‑point range, and it wasn't just one
player. Talk about the collection of shooters you have on this team.   
COACH STEVENS: Well, the guys that shot them were all pretty‑‑ you feel really
good about those guys making them. They're all really good shooters. I thought
Fromm had some good looks and he'll shoot better than 1 for 5 when he has
those looks. I thought Andrew was shooting better than two when he has those
looks. But if Kellen and Rotnei are open, it's got a good chance of going in.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Butler  82  
North Carolina  71

  
COACH WILLIAMS: Needless to say it was a tough night for us. We have to
congratulate Butler. Brad and his staff had them really ready to play. More
prepared than I had my team ready to play. They were more physical, more
assertive and more aggressive, 12 points offensive rebounds in the first half
to our zero.  
We turned it over, and again, they were physically, mentally into the game so
much more, and that is the biggest part of that job to coach and get your team
prepared. I think it was so easy last night that they were fat and happy a
little bit perhaps to start with.  
They really kicked us and then early in the second half we were trying to make
comebacks, and they kept making shots. Then we finally got more active. We
went small and got some steals and turnovers and we made some shots.  
We got it to six, and I'm dumb enough to think we're going to win the game.
But you have to congratulate Butler. They make 7 out of 9 from three‑point
range in the second half. It's hard to come back when somebody's making 7 out
of 9 from the three‑point line against you in the half.  
But I loved the activity of my team down the stretch. I loved the way they
fought. The crowd really helped us. Our people follow us greatly. We're down
24 and make a 3 to cut it to 21, and you would have thought we tied the game
up.  
We just dug too deep a hole against a very good team. A team that's really
well‑coached and seemed to have everything in sight mentally and physically so
much more than we did tonight.  
  
Q. Reggie and James Michael, what was Butler able to do specifically in the
first half to really frustrate you guys offensively?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: Well, for me, I felt like they came out more on the defensive
end of the floor. They were trying to get all up in there. Everybody practiced
and competed, and I think they just start with the walk‑ons, and that's what
teams like Butler do. They were pressuring us and they tried to get us out of
the things we wanted to run.  
So I think it just starts with practice, we've just got to compete.  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: They just did a good half in the first start to stop us
on our offensive break. They did a great job rebounding.  
  
Q. James Michael, after such a promising performance last night, how do you
explain the start tonight? What do you think went wrong the first 30
minutes?  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: Just didn't show up ready to play.  
  
Q. It seemed offensively in the second half you found some success. I guess
for P.J. and Reggie, you found some success driving to the basket and taking
advantage of your athleticism a little bit. Was that a focus of yours on the
sideline to do that more?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: I just felt like we weren't shooting the ball well from the
outside in the first half. So we had to do other things to be more aggressive,
because they had wings that were smaller than me and P.J., so I felt if we
could get to the basket, make smart moves when we get to the basket, and make
smart passes.  
Just in the second half I felt like my team needed me to step up, so I just
tried to do anything I can to help them - If it was getting the rebound,
making the extra pass, just being able to knock down a shot.  
But I just thought I'd turn it up a little bit on the offensive end and
defensive end for my team and try to get the W.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: I think the key to the run we made was us being aggressive on
both ends of the floor. We were doing the little things, scrambling and
turning the ball over. They were getting rattled. It was just didn't drive it
to the hole, being aggressive, and the way they were during the whole spurt.
Like Coach said, they were just hitting shots every time we scrambled. Like I
said, that's a good team and they were hitting big‑time shots.  
  
Q. Reggie and P.J., what specifically about Butler's offense gave you guys
so much trouble guarding their three ‑pointers?   
REGGIE BULLOCK: I felt like Butler did a great job at setting screens and
getting their shooters open. I'm setting legal screens, some probably weren't
good screens, but at the same time they were setting hard greens, and I just
felt like us as a team, we see other teams setting screens like that. I just
felt like we need to set screens like that to get our shooters open and our
big men open. I think they were doing a great job of setting screens and
getting their shooters open.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: Yeah, I felt like that was the difference between us and the
two teams today, us playing against Butler. Like Reggie said, they set better
screens on their offensive end. On our offensive end, we were setting screens,
but Butler was fighting right through them, showing they were more aggressive
and trying to play defense.  
In the second half, that's when they were one click and screens were being
set, and Butler was fighting their way through them, but were still getting
open shots.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you learn about your team that you can take away going
forward?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We have to do a better job as a staff getting these guys ready
to play, because I did think they were so much more aggressive than we were
early. I really did think they were so much more aggressive. The kids talked
about setting good, hard legal screens. We worked on that every day.  
Well, Butler did it tonight, and we set halfway screens. It started to be a
collision and we turned sideways. We set a screen, and they'd come and hit us
hard. We didn't hit them very hard.  
When you look at it, last year we led the nation in rebound margin, and this
year rebound margin is probably 15 or something like that. They outrebounded
us by 12 in the first half. We had one offensive rebound in the whole first
half. So, to me, that is aggressiveness, and they showed us.  
I thought that we'd respond. We talked about it in the pregame that they're
going to play really hard. Let's make sure that we match that toughness, and
we didn't match that toughness. That's my job as a coach to make sure that I
get us to that level.  
  
Q. Do you have a read on which team you guys are? More the team that started
this game tonight or the one that came back in the final ten minutes?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I've never had a team quit. One possible exception could have
been Florida State, but that's in 39 years of coaching. I knew we'd make a
run. Saying when we went small acts like you should give coaching credit, and
coach should not get any credit tonight, I guarantee you. We did go small to
try to do a little more pressuring, and yet that hurt us a couple times too
because we had bad match‑ups out there and didn't get where we were supposed
to be when we did trap a couple times.  
But little things I think hurt us. I was really impressed with what we did at
Long Beach the other night, because it wasn't going great, but we were tough
enough to make some shots and get some stops.  
Tonight we showed some toughness, but you've got to give Butler credit.
They're really good. They're really good. Brad's clubs are really intelligent.
I like their toughness and their intelligence more than their talent, and I'm
not trying to put down their talent. But I love their toughness and their
intelligence.  
I put three things up on the board, and one of those tonight was having the
best brains we've used all year. That shows that you're tough. It shows that
you're doing your assignment, regardless how little the assignment may be, you
should do that assignment to the best of your ability.  
To answer your question, I really don't know. I like our competitiveness. I
like the fact that we're not going to quit. But as I said, I've never had a
team quit. We're probably not nearly as exciting as we were last night. And I
hope to Dickens we're not as bad as we were when we were down 29 tonight.  
But we've got to learn from this. Not just ‑‑ I think Reggie was talking about
doing it in practice every day. I think we do practice well. But on game
nights, you've got to step up and be a man on game night. It can't be just how
many shots I've got and take the first shots you look at. You've got to be
doing what we practice every day.  
Biggest thing for me is give Butler credit. We stunk for 25 minutes. Give
Butler credit there. They have that kind of toughness and that kind of
intelligence, it's pretty darn good. But 7 out of 9 in the second half is hard
to beat.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2012

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [DeAndre Haskins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24421)

### [Bennie Murray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22863)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Illinois  84  
Chaminade - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bovaird, some opening comments?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Illinois is a tough team that can really shoot the basketball.
We knew that coming into it, obviously, if you watched the USTA game last
night. I watched the first half, and I thought there was no way they could
shoot the ball like that on back‑to‑back nights. But they're a really good
team.  
  
Q. Were you concerned about a possible letdown after last night's big win?  
COACH BOVAIRD: I don't think so. I think these guys were amped up to play this
game also. We just came across a really good team. They know how to play
defense, too. We had a harder time than we've ever had getting into the paint
and creating things. We had ten turnovers in the first half, and a lot of it
was from penetrating. Sometimes we'd lose our balance or just lose the ball.  
He's a good coach. That's why he is where he is. They can get after it
defensively, and on the other end, they're like instant offense.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on NorthCarolina tomorrow after they go down to
defeat tonight?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, I've always wanted to play NorthCarolina. I was hoping it
would be in the championship game, but I'm looking forward to it. It's a
program that I think we've all looked up to for a long time. To have the
opportunity to play against some of the best recruits in the country, one of
the best coaches in the country. It's going to be fun. We're hoping we can get
after it and be right there at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Probably going to have an angry NorthCarolina team tomorrow, but you guys
played down to the final second tonight. There was no letdown on your team at
all. How do you get up for tomorrow?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Whenever you see who you're playing, when you realize you're
playing NorthCarolina, you better get up and be ready. I know they will be.
I'm not worried about that at all. These kids have been practicing all their
life for the opportunity to play against NorthCarolina. We'll come out and get
after it. I'm sure they will. So I'm hoping it's a really good game.  
  
Q. Can any of you players talk about the defensive pressure that Illinois
put on you and how you guys kind of reacted to that?  
DeANDRE HASKINS: They're a good defensive team. They played together, but,
honestly, I felt like we could have‑‑ personally, I need to look for my
teammates more. Especially when I dribble drive, they were open. They were
open a lot of times because they were keying in on me because of what happened
yesterday. I've got to do a better job of driving and kicking and looking for
my teammates. That's all around. But that's for me personally. But they're a
good defensive team. You saw the outcome.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the excitement or the anticipation of playing
NorthCarolina tomorrow?  
BENNIE MURRAY: It's very exciting, but we can't just look at it like that.
We've got to look at it like another game. I say it all the time. These guys
put their shorts and their jerseys on just like us. So we're coming out not to
ask for autographs and to look up to these guys. We're coming out to beat
them. So that's what's on our minds. I know that's what's on his mind and
everybody else in the locker room. We're coming out to win.  
DeANDRE HASKINS: I played NorthCarolina before, my freshman year. So I'm
trying to get a little revenge right now, Tyler Hansbrough. Everybody knows
that.  
BENNIE MURRAY: I think that was a 56‑point loss.  
DeANDRE HASKINS: Which one? At Valpo?  
  
Q. I think Coach told me it was a 56 ‑point loss. I thought that was the one
you're trying to avenge?   
DeANDRE HASKINS: No, I played against Valpo my freshman year, and they beat us
by‑‑ I'm not even going to comment. Hopefully we'll play hard and at least
compete as hard as we can against these guys. We're all human at the end of
the day.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the excitement and the buzz surrounding the whole state?
Everyone usually identified with Chaminade being their team. But today you
were Hawaii's team as well, and you had a lot of supports in the stands as
well.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, we were really excited to get our student body over here.
They were pumped up and ready to go. The excitement throughout the state, I
never realized until I woke up this morning that I had more than three
friends. I had like 80 text messages. It was pretty wild. It was pretty good
for the whole Chaminade Ohana. Hopefully we can give them something to be
proud about too.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2012

  

### [Vander Blue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23576)

### [Davante Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24431)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Marquette  89  
Mississippi State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Vander Blue, as I mentioned earlier, he scored 18
points, and Davante Gardner had 15. Vander, I'll just open it up for you.
Since Coach isn't here, would you like to make a comment or two and we'll open
it up for questions?  
VANDER BLUE: I just want to say I think our team played really good. Played
with a lot of energy. Coming off the loss last night, we just came in here
worrying about this team and trying to get better. Just knowing that we played
as hard as we could, and there is nothing we can do about what happened last
night. That was a one in a million shot.  
So we had to move on. Everybody responded today to show what we're really
about.  
  
Q. Vander, can you talk a little bit more about bouncing back from the loss?
Were you happy to have the opportunity to get right back on the court today?  
VANDER BLUE: Yeah, I feel like once we got home that's when it was over. Games
like that, you're fighting so hard. A player makes a shot like that, it can
sit on you and affect a lot of players. But we just wanted to make sure we
were mentally strong and tough that we knew that it wasn't over. We had
another game in 24 hours to get ready for.  
I think that loss yesterday really helped us, because we came out with a fire
and an edge like we didn't want to put ourselves in that position again today.  
  
Q. You talked about how earlier in the year you wanted to be more assertive
this year and be more of an offensive force and a go ‑to guy. How would you
account for your last two games the way you got it going?   
VANDER BLUE: I'm just playing with a free mind and just playing off my
teammates. Junior is a great guy, and everybody's going to double Davante, so
that pretty much leaves me open for shots. So I feel like if I'm making those
shots, our team is a much better team. I'm not trying to do nothing that we
don't do every day in practice. So most of the points I score come off a great
pass from junior or everybody double teaming Davante.  
  
Q. Davante, was that one of your team's better first halves of the season?  
DAVANTE GARDNER: Yeah, I think so. We came out playing hard, getting on the
boards with offensive rebounds. So that's one of our best first halves,
actually.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Williams, I thought you may like to give some comments
from the coach's perspective?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought our response after what we went through yesterday
was outstanding. We'll have an opportunity to see how we handle it on the
other side of it tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. Your turnovers you forced, the baskets made was pretty good?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we had 11 turnovers in the first half, three in the
second half. Again, our margin is going to be offensive rebounding and
turnovers. In the first half, I thought our energy was outstanding
defensively. Of the 28‑‑ I think it was 39 possessions in the first half‑‑ of
the 28 that we didn't turn it over, our efficiency was outstanding. We can't
turn it over 11 times in a half. We can't do that. I know it's still early,
but you can't do that.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yes, I thought that was really good. I think when we can force
turnovers, it's typically going to turn into a transition basket for us, just
like it does for most teams. They had 27 points at the half, and nine of them
were in transition. But they were all off live ball turnovers. You turn the
ball over and it's a live ball, it's probably going to be a one‑pass or less
transition basket.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how valuable the opportunity was today to get
right back on the court after what happened yesterday?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think in a lot of ways I'm built as a weird guy. So
typically recruit weird kids. But we like to work, and we're not necessarily
always pleased with the result. Everybody was texting and calling, oh, how are
they going to respond? They're going to respond. In my tenure here, we have
lost a lot of one‑possession games. But in the games since we've been here,
we've never lost the way we lost yesterday. That's never happened where we
never got another possession, regardless how short the clock was.  
But I knew that they would respond. That doesn't mean that we were going to
win, but I knew their energy and their spirit that they'd respond. Again,
we'll have the opportunity to do that again tomorrow.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2012

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

USC  59  
Texas  53

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Barnes, some opening comments?  
COACH BARNES: I thought there were some much, much better things. At least we
competed. Came out and I thought played with more passion. Tried to execute
better. We had some opportunities. I thought where we really could have gotten
control of the game, we didn't finish it on the defensive end, and we gave up
two, three, four offensive rebounds back‑to‑back. Then we gave up. We had two
really defensive possessions where we really three. One, we didn't do a very
good job on a ball screen defense. We didn't do a very good job showing. Gave
up a slip to the basket, and gave up dribble penetration once that turned into
a three‑point play which was a big play in the game.  
  
Q. Coach O'Neill described the game as kind of a rock fight that was really
kind of back and forth. Both teams struggled to shoot the basketball in the
second half. Your impressions of those thoughts?  
COACH BARNES: Well, we thought it would be a very physical game. We felt that
going in. And again, that's where, again, they came up with some big offensive
rebounds. Again, both teams were trying to get there. Really, as physical as
it was, you look at there weren't a lot of fouls called there either way. But
we had a chance in regulation.  
We didn't do‑‑ we gave them obviously an easy basket, because we didn't get
back one time, and you can't allow that to happen there. But still, overall
there were some things that we can build on. We still haven't gotten into a
rhythm where we need to be offensively. I know we're a better shooting team
than we've shot.  
But that will come if we continue to‑‑ today we found some guys that I thought
competed, and that's what we've got to get. We've got to get more of them, but
we got a lot better than we did yesterday.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2012

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Butler  72  
Marquette  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Williams, some opening comments and then we'll take some
questions.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought it was a great game. We have the utmost respect for
Coach Stevens, for Butler, for their players. Disappointed in the loss, and
encouraged by how hard our guys played.  
  
Q. Derrick and Jamil couldn't have played any better defense, I don't
think.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think so. He shot it off one foot from behind his head
from 40 feet. It was contested. As soon as the ball left his hand, I knew it
was a basket. The trajectory and everything was perfect.  
  
Q. I think they shot something like 50 ‑something percent and didn't turn
the ball over in the second half. Is there anything you can take from this and
learn maybe in January, February?   
COACH WILLIAMS: I think any time you play in an environment like this you
learn a lot. I haven't seen the stats yet, but if they shot 57%, which I'm
sure you've seen them, they've shot 57% and they had 15 offensive rebounds,
and we had 14 turnovers and shot 54%, it's kind of the decision that you have
to make. Do you want to pay your credit card off with a higher annual
percentage rate or your house? You can't skew those numbers. You can't. I
mean, we did outstanding work on 15 and 24, and then 21 and 23 after
everything broke down just sent us straight to the basket, and shot lay‑up
after lay‑up. So they were 16 of 23 from the field with 11 points, 11
rebounds, 36 points. Those two guys shot, what is that? 68% from the field?
It's amazing that we were even in the game if you just look at these numbers.
They shot 61 shots; we shot 49. That's hard math. Hard math to overcome.  
  
Q. Coach, you had some guys in foul trouble. Trent fouls out. How much of a
factor was that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought it was a factor both halves. I think Trent had two
fouls in the first half. Derrick did, Juan did, Jamil did, Davante did. Then
in the second half, Trent had four, Juan had four, Jamil had four, Davante had
four. I think that's hard.  
  
Q. From what Vander did today, you're looking for a go ‑to guy. Do you think
he might be able to do that a little bit?   
COACH WILLIAMS: I think number one I'm pleased with how Vander‑‑ how hard he
played. I didn't think he got out of his element. I think he took one bad
shot. I think he's growing in his confidence. Is he going to be the go‑to guy?
I don't know. I think if you look at those guys that had foul issues, Davante
played 16 minutes, Jamil played 14 minutes. Juan played 22. Which is probably
about right for Juan. Those numbers are not necessarily accurate. I don't know
that 37 for Van, and 32 for Junior is necessarily that high a number. That's
why we got beat, I thought Junior and Vander were good offensively.  
  
Q. Can you talk just a little bit about how Trent ‑‑ is he totally engrossed
in this team? Has he totally made his presence felt for you guys this early in
the season?   
COACH WILLIAMS: The best I've ever seen. Absolutely the best I've ever seen.
Throughout my career I've been able to be a part of transfers and JUCO guys.
Never coached a guy that had a degree that was eligible to be on my staff. But
he's been unbelievable, unbelievable. He broke three bones in his face on
Tuesday, so we were off on Wednesday, and he couldn't practice Thursday. We
traveled here on Friday. I didn't practice him yesterday, which was Saturday,
or yesterday was Sunday. I didn't practice him Saturday. He did practice
yesterday, so he was a little out of rhythm, I think. But he has been
phenomenal in regards to having both feet in every day.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I never saw it. Somebody said a kid's shoulder hit him.
Somebody said somebody's foot hit him when he was falling down. All I remember
is when it happened in the game, I just stepped on the floor like standing
over him. Then obviously he played the rest of that game. He went home that
night and he blew his nose, and whatever this is literally just puffed up so
much like a balloon that it covered his face.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us this morning. Today is opening day for
the 29th Annual EA Sports Maui Invitational, the premier early season college
basketball tournament. We're here today to celebrate and recognize the 30th
anniversary of what many call the greatest upset in college basketball.  
Many of you are familiar with the story, but just to set the stage on a couple
of things. December 23rd, 1982, little known Chaminade defeated then number
one ranked Virginia, 77‑72\. Kind of an interesting fact. The story was
reported back to Jim O'Connell at the New York AP sports desk by a stringer
calling in via phone, and no, that was not a cell phone. It was covered in
person by an upstart Washington post reporter named Michael Wilbon, who is one
of only a few reporters to actually see the game.  
We're honored today to have several key people that were involved in that game
and played a key role. We'll talk to them about what it meant to them and how
it impacted their careers, their lives, and college basketball.  
To my left here is Dave Odom. He's the current EA Sports Maui Invitational
Chairman, and former University of Virginia assistant coach under Terry
Holland. He was the head coach at SouthCarolina and Wake Forest. To his left,
Ralph Sampson, three‑time college Player of the Year and number one draft pick
of the Houston Rockets in 1983. He was a 2012 inductee into the Naismith
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and begins this season as a player
development coach for the Phoenix Suns. To his left, Tony Randolph. At 6'7,
Tony was put in charge of guarding Ralph during that game. The two of them
grew up with each other near Virginia and played against each other in high
school in pick‑up games. Tony stayed in Honolulu since graduating from
Chaminade. He was a counselor in the state family court system for 21 years,
and is currently the Dean of Discipline and assistant basketball coach at
Saint Francis School. Welcome, Tony.  
To his left is Merv Lopes. Merv, of course coached Chaminade in that famous
game. He coached at Chaminade for 12 years. His record was 247‑130, and he
holds the highest winning percentage in Chaminade coaching history. Welcome,
Merv.  
To his left, is Mike Vasconcellos. Mike was Chaminade's athletic director in
1980, and was instrumental in hiring Merv Lopes and starting the Maui Classic
in 1984 which we now know as the EA Sports Maui Invitational.  
So with those introductions, we kind of set the stage here as to who we are
talking to. Coach Odom, if I can start with you and if you could just make
some opening comments and tell us a little bit about your memories and
thoughts from that game 30 years ago?  
DAVE ODOM: It's a real honor to be here, and I appreciate the EA Sports Maui
Invitational people, Palmer and others for putting this together today.
Sometimes when you hear the word celebration, sometimes you think everybody's
happy. We who represented Virginia that day were not particularly happy on
that occasion.  
But as I've said so often, so many times on my trips here to the island, any
time you have a chance to be part of history in a positive way, and though on
the short term, that was not a positive event for the University of Virginia.
As you look at that particular game and the outcome of that basketball game,
the results, Chaminade beating Virginia on that famous occasion has done so
much for basketball in the islands, and I think even globally. It brought
basketball to the islands sooner than it would have ever gotten here. It's
done more for it.  
It's brought a lot of notoriety to the islands. It's brought a tremendous
amount of revenue to the islands. It continues to get better each and every
year.  
As Ralph and I have talked several times, I'm just disappointed that Terry
Holland who was the head coach at the time and the one that worked with Mike
Vasconcellos and Merv Lopes to put this game together, I'm sorry he was not
able to be here.  
But I know that he sends his best and feels the same way that I do, that it
was a real honor to be part of the game and to see the brand of basketball
that was played that night grow and get better.  
Certainly Chaminade as our host school continues to be a real partner in the
growth of college basketball here on the islands. So it's a real pleasure for
us to do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ralph, you got a chance to get back to Maui. Can you tell us a
little about your thoughts of the game and coming back to Maui and back to
Hawaii?  
RALPH SAMPSON: It's always good to come to the islands. Fortunately we had the
opportunity at Virginia to come here three times in three different years and
play, and in the NBA coming to the islands four or five times in training
camps. Now recently ten years ago being here for the 20th anniversary, and
it's always good to come back, and seeing Tony being from the same hometown
area, Coach Lopes and everybody that's been friends through different
segments. It's like coming back and seeing good friends and family and always
enjoy coming here.  
THE MODERATOR: Tony, as I mentioned in the introduction, you went from high
school in Virginia and came to Honolulu and Chaminade and loved it so much you
stayed. Maybe you can talk a little about the game and what you've been doing
in Honolulu?  
TONY RANDOLPH: I think it's truly a blessing to be here today. I thank God
coming from a small town Virginia and, again, humble beginnings, knowing my
friend Ralph. We've played along with each other as well as against each other
in high school, and having the opportunity to come to Hawaii and such a
beautiful state and beautiful people and to have landed at Chaminade.  
Who would have thought 30 years ago such a tiny school with not that many
known. And today here we are on ESPN.  
I think the young men that I had to play with as teammates were awesome. Their
hearts were much bigger than their size on paper. And also we were fortunate
to have such a great coach and staff and athletic director who had vision to
create what we have today.  
I guess it has a life of its own, the memories and the game against Virginia.
But Virginia was a power house. They had Ralph, but they also had other great
players, Wilson, Ricky Stokes, Rick Carlisle, I mean, Terry Holland, I give
him much credit. He was a competitor. To give us the opportunity to play such
a powerful team.  
But over the years it's been to me and my family, and the Ohana at Chaminade
is spiritual. It's a lifetime where we're given the opportunity and we all
share in this together as brothers, to see the obstacles in all of our lives.
Yet to me it seems God reminds all of us that we're in charge, and we're just
his twos. We will let us know at any given time that he controls our destiny
as long as we believe in him, we can overcome anything.  
THE MODERATOR: Merv, the coach that really guided this group of players and
pulled them together. Talk about your thoughts and going into that game and
how you prepared your team for the game and kind of your memories here we are
30 years later talking about the game?  
MERV LOPES: Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Chaminade for the support
to have me be part of this great event. I don't see her here today, but Pam
Goodman has been a big supporter of Chaminade and me and my family. So I want
to thank all of you for keeping in touch with all of us.  
As far as the game is concerned, everybody knows what happened at the game,
and I'm not going to elaborate a little bit on it. But I think I would like to
say that we played Virginia, and we played Ralph, and we have had some success
with some big teams as far as Chaminade and they're a big school and
everything they have.  
But without Ralph Sampson being involved with this game, we will not‑‑ we
would not be here today. So I want to say thank you, Ralph. I appreciate your
humbleness and your great attitude of coming over here and supporting this
great event.  
I just want to say to everybody thank you so much for including all of us. I'm
sure we'll take some questions as we go along and I'll just let the guy who
had the great vision to put this great game together, Mike Vasconcellos.  
THE MODERATOR: Mike, why don't you make a few comments. Obviously, as Merv
said, you were the athletics director that put the game together, and you can
say a few words, that would be great.  
MIKE VASCONCELLOS: Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Mike, we can have some folks talk to him later if we've got
some questions for him. Thank you, Merv.  
COACH ODOM: Let me tell you what it was like for Virginia heading into this
basketball game. It was kind of a week that was. It began the Tuesday prior to
our time in Honolulu. As Palmer had mentioned, we were the No. 1 team in the
country coming into that season, and we were playing at Duke on a Tuesday
night. It happened to be the first three‑point shooting of the arc‑‑ the
three‑point shooting arc, the one that those of you who are old enough to
remember, was inside of the foul circle. We were just trying it out that year.
College basketball was in 1982.we played at Duke on that Tuesday night, and we
won rather handily, to be honest about it.  
We went from there to Georgetown on Friday night where Georgetown had a
freshman named Patrick Ewing. And of course we had the twin tower night, Ralph
playing for Virginia, and Patrick Ewing for Georgetown. I think that game was
nationally televised, which was unprecedented at that time in 1982. We won
that game. It was not particularly well played by either team, but we won that
game. We were supposed to leave the next day to go to Japan to play.  
But there was a huge snowstorm in the northeast, and it was delayed until
Sunday. So we leave out of Kennedy Airport on Sunday and fly to Anchorage. We
stop, refuel and seven and a half more hours we get to Tokyo. We spend one day
kind of getting ourselves adjusted to the time.  
I remember looking we were out, and Ralph, you may remember this, we were out
in some sort of plaza some place. I was standing at the top of the plaza
looking back, and there was this tall figure down at the base of it with all
these very, very short Japanese people around. I mean, I don't think Ray had
ever seen anybody that tall, and he had never seen anybody that short. It was
something I've never seen.  
I remember getting in an elevator. And Mike and I were standing in an elevator
going up. And the Japanese people were standing around and in broken English
said, he must be playing basketball, talking about me.  
I was so much taller by a head and a half than the people in the elevator were
with us. But we played two games there in Tokyo. Neither of which Ralph was
able to play. He was sick. Not sick‑sick, but somewhat dehydrated from the
trip. We were able to win both. We beat Utah in the first game, the Runnin'
Utes with Jerry Pimm, and then the second game a couple of nights later, we
beat the University of Houston. Olajuwon and Drexler, and who were some of the
others? Larry Micheaux and Michael Young.  
They had a great team, and they went on later in the year to be beaten by
NorthCarolina State out of our league. We beat both of them without Ralph.
Then we get on the plane the next day and go to Honolulu. I will honestly tell
you, we had our best practice. Ralph was feeling better. And we went out on
University of Hawaii's football field and played touch football. I think one
of our quarterbacks one of the teams Wilson quarterbacked the other. We had a
great time. Everybody was in great spirits.  
But what we should have been doing was practicing that day instead of screwing
around on the football field. I know Merv Lopes had his guys practicing. Tony
Randolph was dunking and doing all the things that good players and good teams
do. But we were out messing around. As a result, the next night, Chaminade
took it to us, earned the game, even though Frank and Jesse James were
refereeing. I hope you're laughing. I'm just kidding. Come on.  
SPEAKER: Excuse me, Coach, but Mike says you know what? They're bringing their
own referee. I said, what? So he had a little ace in his hand. So they had
their referee in there too.  
DAVE ODOM: Frank and Jesse came off of Molokai somewhere. I've told that story
so many times that whoever Chaminade plays in this tournament, they've checked
the referees first.  
Anyway, that kind of gives you an idea. But the last thing, and I'll say this
and then you can talk to some of these others. After the game, people asked me
what it was like in the locker room, and I can tell you, we had‑‑ I don't know
how many seniors. We had Ralph, we had Craig Robinson, we had Doug Newburg, I
think there were only three. Usually the reporters went right to our seniors
for after game comments. None of our seniors, including Ralph, were willing to
say a word. It was like dead quiet. We had one guy in there that spoke up, and
I think everybody was mad at him for doing it. It was Rick Carlisle, who is
now the coach of the Dallas Mavericks. He was the one talking. He was kind of
the team's spokesman. He said what he said.  
Merv, you'll appreciate this. And I'll shut up, I promise you‑‑ maybe. We go
to the airport the next day, and I think it's something like December 23rd,
just before Christmas. We're sitting in the waiting room, getting ready to get
on our flight back to the main land, and all of us are bummed out. I happened
to be sitting with Terry Holland over in the corner. In comes two or three of
the local TV stations. Our Sports Information Director, Rich Murray at the
time calls me. No, Doug Elgin at the time calls me over and says, Dave, could
you get Terry to come over? The local TV people want sort of postmortem
comment from him. So I said I don't know, I'll see. I said, Terry, they want
to talk to you about what it's like to lose to Chaminade.  
He just looked up at me and says, I'm not going to make any comment. He said,
you just tell them it's the day before Christmas, I'm on vacation, and by the
time the news gets back to the main land that we lost to Chaminade, it's so
preposterous, nobody's going to believe it so it's not worth commenting on it.
He didn't get up and he wouldn't go over there.  
So that's the way it ended. It turned out not to be preposterous. Merv Lopes
and his Silversword team earned it, and the rest is history.  
THE MODERATOR: Dave, I really appreciate that. Recanting some of those moments
and the travel and so forth. Unless Ralph or Tony have anything else to say,
if there is another story you wanted to talk about or talk about growing up
together in Virginia.  
TONY RANDOLPH: As far as a player perspective from Chaminade, I can speak
about the emotions and thoughts that we had as a team of going in before we
played the University of Virginia on that day. We got to our so‑called locker
room, which wasn't much of a locker room because we had little resources at
the time.  
But we made the most of it. When it came down to game time, Coach called
Brother Westbrook, he was a brother on the campus, and he was our bus driver.
We load up in this bus that's probably about 20 years old, and we got down to
Neal Blaisdell, and Neal Blaisdell for us was a huge arena, because we played
home games on the campus of Chaminade and we shared it with the high school,
St. Louis. So when we got to Blaisdell, that was the big stage and big dance
for us.  
So when we got to Blaisdell, we saw all the media hype. Everybody was towards
the focus of the University of Virginia and the premier center of the country,
Ralph Sampson. So going in before the game, we were fortunate we had played
LSU in the beginning in a tournament. We did really well, but we lost. And
that kind of toughened us up and helped us believe that we could be competing
against Division 1 players.  
So the players that we h we all started to believe, and Coach Lopes told us to
believe in ourselves and believe in one another, and not to believe the hype
as we got into the locker room, coach gave us his talk, and we called the
battle cry. And we believed in ourselves that we were against the world. When
the game began, we just sort of blinked every emotion out and took our egos to
another level as a team, as a family. That is eventually what led to the
courageousness of the men I played with to go against such a power house team
in Virginia. I guess we're very fortunate that luck was on our side.  
RALPH SAMPSON: Luck happened, but when you look back at 30 years of history,
and coach alluded to this earlier there are certain times when I'm with the
Phoenix Suns, I tell guys there are certain games that you play in that make
you or break you or leave a legacy or history. Coach comes over here to the
islands, and you get it, what about that loss to Chaminade. Okay, great. A lot
of stories come out of that. You can build relationships, and it's ironic to
have a guy that's still 20 miles from my hometown from their school and he was
coming up as a young guy as well as my arch rival school. You have to
understand that Robert E. Lee with Mike Madden and those guys in those days we
had six to 7000 people at a high school game and we had to play some of them
on college campuses.  
We tied one year with their crew with the University of Virginia. We were both
tied. We had to play 10,000 people there at that game. The history goes way,
way back. When you look at that and you build a relationship over a 30‑year
period of time, and you can have now a NorthCarolina, Illinois, Marquette,
these schools come 30 years later and leave that legacy, it's pretty
impressive as I look back.  
I really didn't realize this ten years ago when Coach Odom and I talk about
the history of this tournament and basketball, and his insight on some things
and things that I didn't recognize at that point in time playing because they
had a great, great coaching staff and then come over here and lose a game.
Which one thing I don't like to do is lose at anything.  
So if a loss leads to this event and it's 30 years later, that's pretty
impressive. To build a relationship with Coach Lopes, even from that game
until the Pete Newell days of my NBA career coming into the Pete Newell camp
here in Hawaii or in the L.A. area of we've been building that relationship
for years and understanding that relationship as well. So Tony says, well, it
was meant to be, it happened, and after that it was pretty impressive.  
So when you look back, and I look back at it, you think that that game in
itself and what it has done for college basketball and throughout the islands
and throughout the world, it means a lot to me to be a part of it, and I'm
always glad to come back.  
DAVE ODOM: I'm sitting here and I look at Brother Bernie, President of
Chaminade right now. I look at Eric back there, the coach at Chaminade, had a
record at Chaminade, and on behalf of the University of Virginia, you look at
the two guys that participated in that game, Tony Randolph and Ralph Sampson.
They are exemplary people. They're exemplary men. At the time, grown men,
adult men today, and you look at what they've done with their lives. And in
Tony's case, Chaminade had a tremendous effect on who he is today.  
I know Tony gives Chaminade a lot of credit for that. Brother Bernie and the
Chaminade people all must be very, very proud of him, and I know he stayed
involved with Chaminade, and I know Coach Lopes is really proud of what Tony
has become as a man today and what he's doing with his life.  
Equally so the University of Virginia is very, very proud of who Ralph Sampson
has become, the way he's lived his life and what he's done. So moments like
that help seed lives and people's futures. So it was a great moment.  
I just wanted to mention that because they're not the only two. Both teams are
full of Tony Randolphs and Ralph Sampsons. Maybe not as good of players, but
every good as people. But they've gone on to live their lives as well. That's
what college is all about. And from our standpoint, we appreciate that, right?  
THE MODERATOR: Well said, Coach. Merv, do you have any final comments?  
MERV LOPES: I agree with Dave about the players and what they've become after
they go through with their career in college. We hope that all of them can end
up like Ralph and Tony, but it hasn't happened that way. We've had a couple
guys in our program that have had some bad luck. So our prayers go with them.
But I think it's so funny. It takes just one thing in your life to kind of
make it go bad or it happens better as you go along.  
The event between Chaminade and Virginia has changed my life. I know that. I
would say the most important part of it all is what has led up to this game.
Mike, Tony, and all the guys that were involved in this game are the ones that
kind of changed everything.  
We played Ralph and them‑‑ that was our third meeting. The first two years
Ralph was a freshman and a sophomore, I think. Then we didn't play Virginia
when he was a junior, and we played them again when he was a senior.  
But at that time we had a tremendous mixture of players in our program. Our
program was not a program. We were a makeshift bunch of guys. To do what we
did that night, I must give all those guys credit to do what we did. Not
knowing that‑‑ well, to me, I don't want to win. That's not my focus on
winning. My focus is to do the best we can for every moment we're out there
and let the winning and all that other stuff handle itself as we go along.  
So just the big win and all that, it was another win for me, and I'm coming
from a little island, so I'm not into all this hype and media and all that. So
I really don't understand how big it was.  
Right now, you can see that event led up to this press conference, and
everybody is involved. It's been 30 years later, wow.  
So I must say, I've had a tremendous journey. I do not have a destination. I
just go from point A to wherever I'm going. I've been everywhere in this world
from a little town in Honolulu called Nanakuli which is a Hawaiian Homestead
land, like a reservation, but it's Hawaiians. I've been to the Middle East.
I've been to Germany. I've been to China. I've been to Japan, and not had one
thought that's what I wanted to do in my life. I just did it. That's why I
kind of like the saying just do it. I think Tony and the rest of the guys that
evening, they just did it and not worry about if they're going to win or lose.  
I know they want to win, but that's a long shot (laughing). We're playing the
best team and the best players. Come on, man, you know? So it's a different
perspective for me. I'm kind of a here‑and‑now guy, not
yesterday‑and‑tomorrow. So this time I have right now here is the most
important time of my life right now because that's all I've got. I don't know
about tomorrow. Yesterday is gone. So that's how I try to live my life.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Merv, and thank you very much to our
participants in the press conference today.  
Ralph and Tony will be around the whole day today. They'll be watching and
enjoying the games and the start of the tournament. They were very gracious
yesterday and filmed some fun and interesting bits with ESPN. So you'll get to
see those on the broadcast. Of course, Coach Odom will be here throughout the
week, and Merv and Mike as well. So thank you all very much for joining us
today. Media, if you have any additional questions throughout the day, you can
see myself or Simon over here, and we'll get you guys connected with
participants here today. Again, thank you very much.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2012

  

### [Kevin O'Neill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18261)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Illinois  94  
USC  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach O'Neill. Opening comments, Coach?  
COACH O'NEILL: I thought Illinois played a great game. Our first two games, we
played with great force defensively, rebounding the ball. Played very well
offensively. Tonight, we didn't do anything. We got setback on our heels and
once they started making shots, their confidence grew and ours went down.  
We played better in the second half, but it's easy to play when you're behind,
and it's harder to play when you've got a lead like they had. It would be easy
to say, well, they made a lot of shots. Well, it's our job to make them miss,
and we didn't make them miss. It's unfortunate. I'm disappointed in the way we
played. I certainly hope that's not indicative of our team, because I think we
have a pretty good team. But tonight we didn't do anything we needed to do
offensively or defensively.  
We shot some quick shot that's just fed into their transition and shot‑making
in the first half, and then we just didn't defend the way‑‑ I mean, I've been
at SC for four years now, and we've never gotten beaten that bad. We had a bad
team last year, and didn't get beaten that bad. So what we've got to do is
regroup tonight. We've got to play Texas tomorrow. Whoever we play the third
day, we get two more days.  
The good thing about it is we're playing right off. Hopefully we can get that
taste out of our mouth tomorrow morning or at noon tomorrow, whatever it is.  
  
Q. Any idea why you guys came out like you did?  
COACH O'NEILL: No idea. We actually went light yesterday. Had a short shoot-
around today, no clue. I've been in basketball a long time, all kinds of
different levels, and I've seen a lot of games like this at different levels.
But they're always disappointing when they happen, and they're always hard to
deal with. So what we have to do is regroup and make sure this doesn't happen
to us again.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2012

  

### [Wendell Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24418)

### [Rick Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24413)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

North Carolina  95  
Mississippi State - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, a few opening comments and then questions.  
COACH RAY: Obviously, I was really disappointed the way we started the game.
The situation there where I thought we got a couple offensive rebounds and it
gave them a lot of energy. I just think a team as good as NorthCarolina, you
can't give those guys second opportunities to score the basketball.  
Then offensively, I knew it would be a struggle a little bit, but I thought we
kind of lost our composure and turned the ball over way too much. So we've got
a lot to build on. I'm just trying to make sure our guys continue to fight and
compete and grow from this and get better.  
  
Q. How tough is NorthCarolina?  
COACH RAY: From the score, they're really tough. They've got a lot of talent.
They just wear you down with so many talented kids they can put in the game.
They've got so many bodies. Obviously we're in a disparity as far as bodies,
but they're obviously a good basketball team.  
  
Q. Wendell, maybe you can comment on about your team and where you're at
right now, and playing a tough competitor like NorthCarolina?  
WENDELL LEWIS: Like Coach said, we got off to a bad start, and then we got two
easy offensive rebounds and gave them momentum in the game. In my eyes I feel
like it got to us and we kind of just put our head down.

## November 19, 2012

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

### [Brandon Paul](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22116)

### [D.J. Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20660)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Illinois  94  
USC  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks about the game?  
COACH GROCE: Well, our whole deal has been to get a little bit better every
day. We were a little bit disappointed as a group that we didn't get off to a
better start this past Friday night. I thought tonight the start to the game
was critical. I thought we came out and got off to a great start, had a lot of
energy, and really moved the ball. It was a free‑flowing first half. I thought
the tempo was to our liking. We got the ball up and down the floor, and guys
made plays.  
I thought the first half was about as good as we defended thus far this
season. Obviously, in the second half we struggled to defend dribble
penetration a little bit, so we'll take a look at that.  
We were really unselfish in the first half. Really shared the ball. We've got
a lot of guys that can score and shoot the ball, so it's hard to key on one
guy. I thought we moved the ball really well. Obviously, did some really good
things. I thought the whole deal was key by our defense.  
At the half, we were holding them to 40%. They were 1 for 6 from three. They
only attempted 7 free throws. We were able to keep them off the line and force
12 turnovers.  
When we defend like that, it gives us an opportunity to get out in transition,
and I felt like we took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Tracy had eight assists, eight turnovers, you lost the turnover battle
and you lost the third quarter. I know you like to concentrate on the
weaknesses as well as the strengths.  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, I thought Tracy forced some things in the second half, but
he's been playing really well for us. Obviously, the eight assists I like. The
eight turns I don't.  
But one thing I know about Tracy Abrams is he dislikes them more than I do. He
cares at a high level as do these two sitting left of me here. They care at a
high level.  
We'll get it figured out. He's been making some good decisions here of late. I
think the bulk of those were in the second half. I thought he tried to make a
few too many home run plays. It wasn't just him. I thought in general we did
that a little bit, because really, we're an unselfish team. And I thought
early in the second half there, about the first eight minutes, our shot
selection we forced some things and tried to make some home run plays. But
we'll get it corrected.  
Like I said, our whole deal has been about getting better every day. I thought
that we did that tonight, and I'm sure there are some things that we'll have
an opportunity to learn from to improve even more.  
  
Q. They had ten guys play ten minutes or more. Was it ever hard to pick up
your man and know who you were guarding your defensive assignments?  
BRANDON PAUL: No, we tried to do a good job of getting it together, whether it
was a dead ball or free throw or match‑up. Whenever we can't hear our coaches,
me, Tracy, D.J., we bring everybody together to make sure everybody knows
their man so we can get back in transition.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about facing Chaminade tomorrow, pretty much the home
team here?  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, we're excited. One of the great things about playing the
Friday night game, these guys will tell you, was it was loud in there. It was
us against‑‑ it was really loud in there. It was a great environment, and I'm
really glad we got a chance to play in that road environment. I'm glad our
guys showed great resolve and toughness. Our guys love challenges, they love
it. Tomorrow is a great challenge.  
We're playing them on their home court. I think these guys have been through a
lot, D.J. and Brandon, they've seen it all over four years. They've been in
plenty of intimidating environments, I can assure you. We know tomorrow will
be one. I think we'll take the challenge on and look forward to competing
against a very good Chaminade team.  
  
Q. Can I get each player on the thoughts of playing Chaminade, giant killer
over the years, and playing them in this environment which is going to be
rocking tomorrow night?  
BRANDON PAUL: Yeah, they're a great team, obviously, we were focusing when
they were playing, and we caught a glimpse of some of the things that they can
do. They came out with a lost energy. And they're a team not to be taken
lightly. We're going to come in tomorrow ready to play. We respect every
opponent that we play against, and it's going to be a good one.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Like Brandon said, we've got to respect everybody we play.
We've got to be ready to play tomorrow, and do some scouting tomorrow and
prepare for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that slow start to Hawaii, and the fast start
tonight? Did you sense that coming over here and playing three days ago kind
of helped you tonight?  
COACH GROCE: I think it did from the standpoint of getting acclimated for
sure. I think it's great to play on the road this early for our team. I've got
an older team. We play in a league that's led the nation in attendance for
close to 30 years. These guys play in front of‑‑ I had a chance to coach in
the league. These guys have played‑‑ I'm not nearly as good a player as these
two guys‑‑ but they played in those environments.  
Once you become a senior like these guys and they've been very good players
over the course of their career. Like you said, they've seen it all. They've
played in front of thousands of people. We know tomorrow will be a tough
environment. We'll relish the challenge and look forward to it.  
But I think playing that game for our team on Friday night was certainly
helpful, especially now going into tomorrow night's game and playing our
second true road game of the season tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, what impact do you think the addition of Maryland and Rutgers will
have on Big Ten basketball?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I'll only speak on behalf of Maryland at this juncture,
because I don't think anything's official with Rutgers. But one thing I've
always appreciated about the Big Ten, and one of the reasons why I grew up in
the Midwest, I'm a Big Ten guy. One of the things I love about Illinois is
it's a do‑both place. Academically Illinois is rated 13th in the country, and
from a basketball standpoint, Forbes Magazine rated us one of the best
basketball teams of all times. You've got do both.  
I think with Maryland you get the same thing. They're the 19th ranked public
University. They also have tremendous tradition basketball‑wise. And they're a
research institution, which I think fits well philosophically with the Big
Ten, not only from an academic perspective, but from an athletic perspective.  
So we're thrilled with their addition to what we think is already a great
league. I know they're going to make us even stronger.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Joe? Both the excitement that he brings to the team
and also his development as a defensive player and a ball handler?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Joe came a long way. Red shirted his first year and waited
his turn. Actually he's been playing with a lot of energy. Coach wants us to
defend, and that's what Joe's been doing in practice and getting better every
day.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2012

  

### [Rotnei Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19418)

### [Khyle Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24417)

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Butler  72  
Marquette  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Exciting game. Khyle Marshall is with us. He had 24 points.
Rotnei Clarke, 20 points and a fantastic game winning shot. Coach Stevens,
just kind of open up and make some opening comments. Then we'll open it up for
questions.  
COACH STEVENS: My hat is off to Marquette. You go into these games and people
are going to analyze who won and who lost, and just two teams playing hard to
the wire. I told our guys, if we lose that game, it doesn't make me feel
differently about them or make me feel differently about our effort. It's just
it's tougher to swallow.  
Ive been in this long enough to know that there are very few thrills like a
buzzer beater, especially one off one foot running. But I've also been in it
long enough to know that it's hard being on the other side of it.  
We'll move on and look forward to playing the winner of the next game and see
if we can't play a little better than we did in the first five minutes of the
game.  
  
Q. That first five minutes, was that something Marquette was doing that you
weren't getting into it?  
COACH STEVENS: We played Indianapolis in an exhibition on purpose because they
really try to pressure you up and down the floor, and we wanted to simulate
that a little bit. Obviously, Marquette can do it with bigger, stronger, more
athletic guys. We tried in practice to simulate it. I think it kind of
surprised us how hard they came at us.  
But I don't think we had a turnover in the second half. I might be wrong. That
is an unbelievable compliment to the guys that were handling the ball. And our
other guys for being aware that the guys handling the ball needed some extra
help. We were getting really good looks once we handled it and got the shot
clock inside 20 seconds or so.  
  
Q. Can you just walk us through that final crazy possession there?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: It was just kind of a scramble play. I was dribbling around,
and I almost thought about flipping it to Roosevelt Jones who was going down
the lane line just to have him drive and make a play, ended up keeping it, and
got through and got around a couple of guys, and just let it up there, and
luckily it went in.  
COACH STEVENS: I've been working on that one with him, running.  
  
Q. Khyle, your thoughts on the game?  
KHYLE MARSHALL: Oh, man, well thought out game. We knew Marquette was going to
be a team that would get up in you and push the tempo and play extremely hard.
I don't know. I'm actually more out of breath now than I was in the game.  
It was a well fought out game between both teams and I'm just happy to come
out with the win.  
  
Q. Could you just tell me a little bit, since you came from Arkansas, what
it's been like for you since then and is this the kind of moment you're
looking forward to here?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: Definitely. I knew coming to Butler I was going to be around a
great group of guys and my teammates and that's what I wanted a chance to
experience. I also had the chance to experience something like this with these
guys and this coaching staff. I set out the whole year and worked extremely
hard and I'm trying to have opportunities and having a lot of fun so far.

### [P.J. Hairston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24419)

### [Leslie McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24420)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

North Carolina  95  
Mississippi State - 49

  
COACH WILLIAMS: Right now the easiest thing to say is that we had more bodies,
for sure. We wanted to try to make it a fast tempo because Mississippi State's
numbers are down, which those kids played awfully hard. I grabbed Coach after
the game was over with and told him my first year at Kansas we lost eight
games in a row, and things do turn around for you.  
But his kids played awfully hard. We just had too many players for them, and
everybody started feeling good, and the ball kept going in the basket. So you
feel for them. But he's doing a nice job with his club. Those are pretty
difficult things to overcome what he's trying to do right now.  
For us, it started out really easy early. I think that bothered us for a
while. Then we had a big spurt right before the half and including P.J.'s
65‑footer and we made shots today. Was not pleased with some of our
rebounding, and some of the things we did. We turned it over too many times in
the first half and made shots. We got everybody involved and had 16 players
play. I think the most minutes we had was James Michael played 23 minutes.  
For us, it was something good. We could get the ball up and down the court and
attack the short coming that they had with the number of able bodies. And we
shared the basketball. We had 22 assists, would like to have even more than
that. It's a much, much easier day for us just because the ball was going into
the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, how much confidence have you guys developed?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's helped us. There is no question. I've said
for a long time that we're really a good shooting team. The three guys here on
the table can shoot the basketball. Dexter got a lot better. Marcus can shoot
the basketball. So we've got a team that can shoot the basketball. We just
didn't shoot it the first couple nights out.  
I think when we're consistent getting the basketball inside and getting good
balance and inside scoring and guys shooting good three‑point shots, I think
that's when we're our best team. If we can do a little better job of running
the floor and getting some easy baskets in open court, think we'll be even
better.  
  
Q. Talk about your team's defensive effort today?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we had a good effort. A couple of times we took guys
out because they didn't run back, because you've got to do that regardless
what the score is. But we tried. They do a really nice job of penetrating,
taking the ball to the basket, and they don't try to do it in the first 3
seconds.  
So they make you guard the basketball for a little while, and all of a sudden,
bam, there is a screen on the ball and guys penetrating to the basket.  
So I liked our effort. We've got to execute on the defensive end better, but I
thought our guys really tried hard.  
  
Q. P.J., talk about how much your confidence has developed over the past
couple games after kind of a rough start to the season? Then just on to the 75
footer, when is the last time you made that kind of buzzer ‑beating shot at
the end? I think you might have had one last year, if I'm not mistaken?  
P.J. HAIRSTON: This is a shot I practice like maybe sometimes playing around
before practice maybe. I knew at some point it was going to go in, so I just
threw it up and tried to aim it. I thought it was actually going to miss, but
just stayed with it, and it banked off the backboard. Confidence‑wise, it
wasn't just confidence, it was more focusing than anything because it's up to
me to hit the shots. If I have good shots, shoot them. It's me that has to
make it. Then the confidence thing, it really was confidence.  
  
Q. Reggie and Leslie, you guys struggled at Long Beach State. Obviously
played well in the second half today. How do you see this game coming together
confidence ‑wise, chemistry‑wise, that sort of thing?   
REGGIE BULLOCK: Chemistry‑wise I believe it starts in practice on the
defensive end of the floor. When we think about defensive intensity. Getting
outdenied, easy steals. That is the flow of our game, and our coach wanted me
and Leslie to take great shots, so we try to get the shots that we want for
our team. It's just a confidence booster for the outside shooters to be able
to run the floor, get stills, just play that type of game, because that is the
Carolina way of playing basketball. I just feel like it's a confidence booster
for all of our shooters on the outside.  
LESLIE McDONALD: Like Reggie said, our first objective on defense is to get
steals and turnovers and turn them into fast‑breakpoints. But Long Beach, we
had good shots, just didn't knock them down. They just didn't fall down. We
tried to emphasize on getting into the post first and screen for each other
and make those big‑time shots.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
LESLIE McDONALD: It's been a rough start. I've got to get used to getting
accustomed with condition and setting screens and everything. But I think this
game was a really come‑out game for me just getting people open and being able
to take and knock these shots down.  
  
Q. What's given you confidence in him to keep him in the starting lineup
over the past games?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He really does a nice job defensively in helping defense and
blocking some shots and rebounding. He's really struggled with the last couple
of games just holding on to the ball and he had some opportunities. I think he
rushed himself. He was too eager being a player. I think tonight had he two
different occasions where he took that extra split second and was able to
complete the dunk, for example, and I think those things can give him
confidence.  
We don't need Desmond to score 27 points a game. We need him to make lay‑ups,
dunks and defend and rebound. I think everybody wants to get a couple points.
The last couple of games I think he's fumbled some opportunities and
mishandled the ball when he had opportunities. But today got them early, and I
think it does give him confidence. Again, he's a good defensive player, so
we've got to keep him in there too.  
  
Q. Coach, he appeared frustrated for a stretch there midway through the
first half. Anything in particular there? I know you mentioned rebounding, but
was it just sloppy play?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It was both. I think today we gave up too many second shot
opportunities in the middle of the first half and had turnovers on three of
five possessions and just silly passes. Like I said, it started out so easy,
and we felt like we made any pass in the world.  
James Michael to have four turnovers in the first half, good news he had none
in the second half. But we can't throw that basketball around. We're going to
face somebody tomorrow, for example, that's going to have the same number of
players that we do and be very effective defensively. We can't hurt ourselves.
I thought in that stretch in the middle of the first half we hurt ourselves.  
  
Q. The big news back east is Maryland's acceptance to the Big Ten. As an ACC
guy dating all the way back, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about
Maryland going to the Big Ten?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I was stunned. I was shocked by it. There is no question. I'm
an old ACC guy. Been around a long time, I've been around longer probably than
the league has, I don't know. So I was shocked by it. Didn't see it coming
whatsoever. I did remember after some meetings that we had at some point that
the fine was going to be $50 million. It will be interesting to see what
happens on that. If they've got that extra money, maybe they can pass it
around to some other people kind of thing. It's strange to me. But what's
going on in college athletics is strange to me. Give me a break, the Big East
goes all the way to Hawaii, or close anyway, that kind of thing.  
So it's strange what's going on in college athletics, but that's what it is.
We've got to understand and live by that. Try to take care and do the best job
we can for the league.  
I'm one of those guys that if somebody doesn't think my house is the right
place to be, then go ahead and leave. I've got no problem with that. So for
me, it was a shock. I hate to see them go, but they felt that's what's best
for them, then see ya.

## November 19, 2012

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Dominique Cooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22862)

### [DeAndre Haskins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24421)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Chaminade  86  
Texas - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: This was Chaminade's seventh victory here at the tournament.
Last victory was 2010 versus Oklahoma, and this is their fourth opening round
win. DeAndre had 32 points. That was the game high. Dominique had nine points
and six rebounds. Turn it over to Coach Bovaird for opening remarks.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, sure. We're ecstatic. That's an incredible win for our
program. We believed all along that we had a chance to play with these guys
over here, and we knew if we got down to a close ballgame, that there was a
good chance we were going to win.  
I have so much faith in my team. I'll put them up against anybody, anybody in
the country on a given night. These guys have worked so hard to get to where
they are right now. You have no idea. They've worked just as hard as any
Division I athlete. I'm really proud of them.  
  
Q. Talk about your team's poise at the end, especially at the free ‑throw
line?   
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, I was a little worried about that myself, because in our
previous game against Western Washington we were 15 for 31 from the free‑throw
line. It really hurt us in that game. I wanted to talk about that free throw
shooting in practice, and we needed to practice more. So it was a little bit
of a focus, but I've had faith in these guys. These guys are great players,
great shooters. I had all the confidence in the world making shots down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Are you impressed with the way you guys rebounded tonight against a
larger team out there?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, it was a huge focus for us. Obviously, when you look on
paper, their size, their strength, their weight as compared to us, everybody,
it didn't take a basketball genius to realize they're going to try to beat us
inside and try to beat us on the boards.  
So it's something we talked about for a long time, and the guys did a great
job. I think we had ten, eight offensive rebounds in the first half. It shows
that they were ready to come to battle. They crashed the boards like crazy.
They boxed out. They executed the game plan, and just did a great job.  
  
Q. This is win number 7 out of 83 games in this tournament. Chaminade's
never won twice in this tournament. Is that on your minds now?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Not exactly at this moment (laughing). I'm pretty happy about
this win right now. But we just talked about it in the locker room. You know,
Lee Bailey said this summer, Coach, we can win that. We can win that
tournament. And these guys believe that. They believe that. That is the first
step in achieving something like that. They believe it.  
So we're going to come out, get prepared for whoever wins this game, and
they're going to be in for a battle.  
  
Q. We saw you guys practice the other day. Everybody was pretty relaxed. I
noticed the first half you couldn't throw it in the ocean, nobody could. Texas
couldn't, you couldn't. But something happened. How did you all of a sudden
gel like that? You guys didn't seem nervous the other day.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, I hope that they get the confidence from me, because they
know that I have confidence in them to make shots. I tell them all the time
that you're going to make the next one. Just shoot it. If they have that in
the back of their mind knowing they have the confidence from the coach, they
can go out there without anything in their head, step up and shoot and make
open shots, and they did that tonight.  
  
Q. So you're not fooling around when the guys from Chaminade say they can
beat just about anybody if the stars align?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Don't even necessarily need the stars to align.  
  
Q. No, I mean these stars right here?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Oh, well, we definitely need these two sitting right here.
We're just extremely happy. We're excited about the win, but knowing these two
right here and the rest of our team, they've got a lot more goals to
accomplish. I told these guys some day or some time we'll celebrate this win.
I promise you, we'll celebrate. But it isn't going to be tonight. It isn't
going to be tomorrow. Eventually that day will come, but right now these are
great basketball players. We're going to be focused on our next opponent.  
  
Q. DeAndre, 32 points tonight, can you talk about going off like that
against a Texas team that's one spot out of the top 25 as of this morning?  
DEANDRE HASKINS: Well, I don't even‑‑ I just, honestly, last game I played an
off game because I was thinking too much. Honestly, I just came into this to
play hard and play with my teammates. I have a lot of great guys on my team,
mostly Darko, my roommate. Man, he always motivates me and keeps me in check a
lot of times because I kind of go off a little bit. But he helps me out.  
Just, God, and glory to God all day every day. He inspires me, and I get that
drive. I get that drive.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about what Kevin Hu gave to you guys tonight? It
seemed like he really had some swag out there and got you guys going?  
DOMINIQUE COOKS: Kevin's one of the funniest guys you'll ever meet. His energy
is contagious. Tonight, as you said, we couldn't hit a shot to start the half.
He came in and really got us going. He made some shots and I think that's when
we started to believe, okay, we can beat these guys. Kevin was big tonight,
especially in the first half. Some of the plays he made really got us going. I
think that's one of the big reasons we got a win tonight.  
  
Q. Rhys seemed to be struggling tonight. I know he was ill. How big of a
motivational factor was he just the way he was able to hang in there?  
COACH BOVAIRD: He's a balancer. We knew what we were going to get out of Rhys
tonight. He got a case of the food poisoning a couple days ago. We were hoping
it would be cleared up. The poor guy was throwing up on the whole flight over
from Oahu a couple days ago, and hardly practiced at all yesterday. He just
felt horrible. But he's a fighter. Our game plan with him was to get him in
there for a minute at a stretch and just battle. If he had to use a foul, I
think he knocked down a big three at one point. Got a couple of offensive
fouls on Texas. He's a good player. He's a battler. He executed his portion of
the game plan, and I'm proud of him also.  
THE MODERATOR: Why don't you make a quick comment on the fact that Tony
Randolph and Ralph Sampson were in there?  
COACH BOVAIRD: It was just kind of unique, because after I accepted this job,
I would say there haven't been two or three days gone by without somebody
asking me about the Virginia‑‑ the Chaminade victory over Virginia. I figured
with a big win like this tonight, that some of those questions might stop
coming. Maybe we'll be talking about the Texas victory 30 years from now. At
least I hope.  
But, no, the guys got to meet Merv Lopes, and Tony Randolph, Mike
Vasconcellos, it's a huge part of Chaminade history. It's a huge part of the
EA Sports Maui Invitational. That's kind of what got this ball rolling. The
guys got to meet all those guys, and I think they were inspired. I think they
were inspired from meeting them. So it was a huge lift for us.  
  
Q. You just had a big upset, and it was great. You had a celebration in the
locker room. Are you going to immediately go and scout out USC and Illinois?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Oh, of course, of course. That's what you do. That's what you
do if you want to have a chance to win. I'm going to watch as much of this
game as I can. I actually have to drive the guys back to the hotel. Coaches at
this level usually have to drive.  
So I'll drive the guys back to the hotel. I'll watch it. I may come back, but
I'll watch it on TV, and I'll watch it at least three or four times before
tomorrow.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2012

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Chaminade  86  
Texas - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks, please?  
COACH BARNES: The team that won the game should have won the game. They played
better. I thought they played, collectively, I thought they played harder. I
thought we played very tentative. I would probably even use the word scared.
We haven't played anything in the three games that we've played anything like
what we've practiced.  
That's probably the most disappointing thing is that we just aren't even
giving ourselves a chance to be in games because the guys that you count on
and as a group, we've got to count on everybody to do what we expect them to
do. But, again, Chaminade won the game. They should have won it. I don't even
think the score is even indicative of how much better they played than we
played.  
  
Q. There was a possession in the second half where you took a timeout, the
team went back on the floor, and you wound up with a shot clock violation. Is
that something you chalk up to youth?  
COACH BARNES: No, we're not going to buy the youth thing. It chalks up to
toughness. It chalks up to guys doing their job, chalks up to leadership or
lack of. It chalks up to understanding a sense of urgency. So it's just right
after that was another timeout, and it just goes back to, again, when you are
tentative, you're not doing the things that you practice, I think those type
things happen.  
Guys are looking around like who is going to make a play? We're not a good
enough team right now that we can rely on any one individual. We have to be a
team, a collective team. We've got to have everybody doing their job. We
didn't get that from the very tip, from the very tip we didn't get it.  
  
Q. Is there any encouragement from the way you guys kind of made a run there
to get it to eight or nine there late?  
COACH BARNES: Well, from my point of view, not really. I think sometimes there
is such a thing as phony tough guys when you're playing with house money now.
You're coming back saying what the heck, and you play.  
I'm just really disappointed in our whole team, and I'm including coaches too,
because obviously we haven't done a good enough job coaching them. But when
you come back and make a push, we had a chance to even cut a little lower and
missed a dunk, missed a couple of dunks. We turned it over got outrebounded.  
Look at the fact that we're throwing the free‑throw line 17‑30\. Those things,
you shoot 19% from the three‑point line, and with our size or whatever team we
had on the floor, we end up with 11 offensive rebounds. So, again, no, I don't
know if I'd say that was anything encouraging, because they probably got a
little tentative themselves and that's a situation where teams have to decide
we're going to continue to play through it.  
But we had a chances. We had even more chances, but we just didn't do anything
that we need to do.  
  
Q. You were the head coach of Providence back in '91 when Chaminade won a
game against your team here. Did you come in knowing how tough they were?  
COACH BARNES: No doubt. I mean, again, the two teams are very similar in the
fact that we were young. But you would think today that players would
understand that everybody can play. It's a great example of where I think hard
work wins most of the time. They outworked us in every way.  
We had guys that were scared. Standing around, you've got to take your shots,
you've got to take them. Am I surprised? No, I'm not surprised. They've got
some Division I transfers that have been around. It goes back to, I think
players sometimes that play basketball have no clue what really goes on.  
You look at the numbers. I mean, the line right here by DeAndre Haskins,
that's a great line. 7 for 11, 4 for 6, 4 for 15, 9 points. He did all that in
25 and 32 points, 25 minutes. Can you look at some of our guys that work out,
and it's everybody. I've got to do a better job coaching.  
But we can't play scared, and we played scared. When you do that, you stand
around like a deer in head lights. It's not going to get any easier. People
aren't going to feel sere for us, and I don't feel sorry for us. I don't,
because we got what we deserved. We didn't do what we were supposed to do.
They deserved to play the game. We've got to grow up.  
It's not just the younger guys. We can talk about our guys, our sophomores
have been through it. They've got to bring it every single night. Till then,
we'll continue to struggle.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: Thanks, Rick. Our next coach is Roy Williams of the University of
North Carolina. Coach Williams is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball
Hall of Fame. Doesn't take much to figure out why. He's had an extraordinary
career. First at Kansas, and now at North Carolina. He's won two national
championships in 2005 and 2009.  
I think in both those seasons he started off with a championship here at the
Maui Invitational. So this has been quite a springboard to great things for
Coach Williams and the North Carolina Tar Heels.  
He's in his tenth season as head coach‑‑ seems like you just got there, just
came back yesterday. Roy Williams, North Carolina.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you very much, Jay. We do realize that Jay is a Duke
graduate. So, Rick, the fact he doesn't say anything about your number of wins
is not a problem. He just said that Buzz had been at Marquette for five years
and gone to seven straight NCAA tournaments in five years. (Laughter).  
JAY BILAS: I'm just reading the copy.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Which Duke did the copy. Is that not right, Buzz, five years‑‑
that's a hell of a record.  
JAY BILAS: That's how good of a coach he is.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I just didn't have the equity to say it.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Anybody's got equity to say anything about Jay. We're as happy
as we possibly can be to be here, to say the least. We've played three games
already. And we haven't faced the kind of competition that we're going to face
here.  
I truly believe this is by far, year in and year out, this is no exception,
the best of these tournaments. I think it sets a standard for everyone else.
This year going to four games and letting you have the game at home first is
something, I think, was a good deal to have as well.  
But the hospitality that you receive here, the work of everybody, Jay and Dave
and Brianna, and even Dr.Nichols over here, saying something good about the
officials, it's really unsurpassed around the country. And I really believe
it's the greatest tournament. And we're here with a very young team and we're
excited to be here. Thank you.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: Next coach is Marquette's Buzz Williams, in his fifth year as head
coach of Marquette. Taken the Golden Eagles to seven straight NCAA
tournaments. This year's team from last year's Sweet 16, two straight Sweet
16s for Marquette. He's got three starters back and eight letter winners. Past
national champion, Marquette in 1977 under Al McGuire, and Buzz Williams has
carried on that tradition very capably. Buzz.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're excited to be here. It's been a long week in some
respects. We had condensation on the floor in Charleston. Coach Odom and
Brianna addressed that this morning, and I'm glad to know that we'll be able
to play here tomorrow. We'll have a good feel, I think, for where we stand
after we play Butler and the next two games.  
We lost a lot last year, but I'm excited about what we're bringing back, and
we're honored that we would be invited to be here. Our guys are thankful for
the opportunity and exposure and also just for the opportunity to experience
something at this level. Thank you.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: We want to start out talking about the different teams and have
each coach take a couple of moments to tell us about his team and what it's
like to be here at the Maui Invitational.  
We'll start off with Butler's Brad Stevens, who is in his sixth year as head
coach at Butler University. 142 career wins over those six years. Took the
Butler Bulldogs to back‑to‑back NCAA Tournament Finals in 2010 and 2011.  
He turned down a lucrative career at Eli Lilly in order to be a college head
coach, and he's done a magnificent job, one of the finest young coaches in the
industry. Brad Stevens of Butler.  
COACH STEVENS: Thank you, Jay. It's obviously an honor for us to be here. I
was walking along with Brianna as we were walking over here and said: For
Butler University, I think this is, and our basketball program, this is a
bucket list type of thing, to be included in the Maui Invitational, to be able
to compete not only against the great teams that are here, but also to be able
to take in the great tradition of this tournament.  
And so obviously our guys are thrilled to be here. And we've got a lot of work
to do. And it's always interesting, because our goal at Christmas every year,
after our nonconference schedule, is to accurately assess how we can get
better.  
And I think we'll be able to accurately assess how we can get better by the
end of these three days with the team sitting next to us. So we're excited to
be here. Our guys are really excited to play.  
Certainly has been incredible hospitality the entire time, and we thank you
for including us.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Rick Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24413)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: Buzz, thank you. Our next coach is Rick Ray of Mississippi State.
Rick is in his first year with the Bulldogs at Mississippi State. A former
assistant coach at Indiana State and also Purdue and most recently at Clemson.
He's an outstanding young coach that has proven to be a very capable
recruiter. And he brings his Bulldogs a little bit shorthanded, they've had
some injuries and suspensions, but they've got a lot of fight in them. Want to
hear from Rick Ray right now.  
COACH RAY: Thanks for bringing up the suspensions. Appreciate that. I notice
you didn't go over my career wins. I've got one. (Laughter) Obviously really
excited to be here at Maui. When I first took over the job and was trying to
secure our roster, the next thing you look at is the scheduling.  
And I noticed we were playing the Maui Invitational. It's a great experience
for our guys. Then the second thing I notice we just play a small school
called North Carolina in the first game. So that's always adventurous there as
well, too.  
But our guys are excited. The one thing I'm trying to instill in our guys is
nobody cares about your situation, about what state you're in at this point in
time, like all everybody cares about at the end of the day is the wins and the
losses.  
So we want to come out here and play hard and compete, and I expect our guys
to do so. But we really are honored to be a part of this Maui Invitational.
Thank you.

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Kevin O'Neill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18261)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: Thanks, Eric. Our next coach is Kevin O'Neill, having the
distinction of coached at every school that's represented in the Maui
Invitational this year except for Chaminade. And he's got his eye on that job
in the future. Kevin has coached at Marquette, Tennessee, Northwestern, head
coach at Arizona, and now your fourth year at Southern Cal, Kevin.  
COACH O'NEILL: Fourth.  
JAY BILAS: Yesterday‑‑ all these coaches have apparel deals and wear this
wonderful, wonderful gear. And Kevin came yesterday dressed much like he is
today except but he didn't wear anything that said USC on it. He looked like
he was going to go grab a metal detector, go out on the beach and look for
loose change after practice.  
UNIDENTIFIED COACH: He did.  
JAY BILAS: One of the great tacticians in the game and one of the great guys
in the game, Kevin O'Neill.  
COACH O'NEILL: Roy, are we sure he's a graduate?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I won't answer that one.  
COACH O'NEILL: It's a great honor to be here. We're excited about our team.
I've told numerous people that we have a team full of rejects, starting at the
top, myself. Bunch of guys that are transfers. When we took over with
sanctions put together transfers and junior college guys.  
I think we have a good team. We have a fun group. I like our team, which is
hard to do sometimes as a coach. But I really like them. And I think we're
going to be a pretty good team when it gets all said and done. This is a great
event for us. We'll find out a lot about ourselves as we move forward. Thank
you.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 18, 2012

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: Thanks, Kevin. Our last coach to hear from this morning on the dais
is John Groce of Illinois. John is in his first year as the head coach of the
Illini. He spent time at Butler as an assistant, at Xavier and Ohio State
under Thad Matta, and spent four years at Ohio U as head coach.  
And I think everybody remembers last year the incredible run they went on in
the NCAA Tournament. Winning 29 games, losing only eight, and reaching the
Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament before losing to North Carolina.  
John has some outstanding players, is trying to build a program in the image
he wants, a team that is tough and plays incredibly hard. And I've known John
for a long time and just an outstanding young coach and a really good guy.
John.  
COACH GROCE: Jay, appreciate it. First of all, a great opportunity for our
team to be here. We've enjoyed‑‑ we actually came out a little bit early and
played at Hawaii on Friday and have enjoyed the hospitality.  
It's been a terrific experience for our players, trying to balance taking
everything in while also getting ready for competition. I think they've done a
good job of that. I've got an older team that's very mature. So that's been a
good thing. But we've really enjoyed it.  
This is great for the University of Illinois to be in this event. I remember
watching it for‑‑ I thought back when I saw it was on the schedule, a lot like
Rick mentioned, you get the job and one of the first things you do, you look
at the schedule and you look to see that the Maui Invitational is on there.  
And I started reminiscing about all the great tournaments, even as a kid, that
I watched over the years that have taken place here in Maui. And certainly
from the outside looking in and looking forward to experiencing it for myself,
personally, you know, it has been the premier college basketball tournament,
exempt tournament, preseason, year in and year out. It has been the standard.  
And so we're just excited to be a part of it. I think it's a special
opportunity for Illinois. Our guys are excited to play in it. We have an older
team. As many of the coaches have said, we're going to learn a lot here about
our team the next three days. We're looking forward to that.  
As Coach Williams alluded to: We've had some good challenges up to this point,
but this takes it to another level and really gives us the opportunity to kind
of earmark our team and see where we're at here early. So we're looking
forward to the opportunity to compete in the event and we appreciate
everyone's hospitality. It's been terrific.  
JAY BILAS: John, thank you. And thank you to all the coaches for your time
this morning. Before we move on to the photo opportunity and the free throw
contest, we wanted to have special recognition for someone who has been an
extraordinary contributor to the success of the Maui Invitational over the
years, and that's the Supervisor of Officials and Coordinator of Officials for
this event, Mr.Hank Nichols.  
Hank was an extraordinary official in his time wearing the whistle and did
countless Final Fours, was a tremendous influence on the game. And after his
career on the court, he stepped off the court and became the NCAA Supervisor
of Officials where he worked tirelessly to standardize officiating across the
country, something that hadn't been really attempted before and really moved
officiating forward over the course of the years.  
And he's recently retired as the NCAA Supervisor of Officials, but he's not
retired from the game. He still is working here and coordinating the officials
for the Maui Invitational, but was just this last year inducted into the
Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for his contributions to the game to
take his rightful place with the game's greats.  
And we wanted to add our thanks and also the thanks of the EA Sports Maui
Invitational to the extraordinary contributions not only to this event but to
the game for Hank Nichols. Hank.  
(Applause)

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: Thanks, Rick. Our next coach is the head coach of Chaminade, Eric
Bovaird. Had a chance to watch Eric's team practice yesterday. An outstanding
coach. Team is very well drilled. Number of players back. They play hard and
they'll be a tremendous challenge in every game that they play here at the
Maui Invitational. Eric.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, obviously this event is huge for Chaminade University.
Our players look forward to it. When the schedule comes out and the tournament
comes out, we all get together, and it's so exciting to see the bracket and
finally meet all these coaches I've looked up to for a long time.  
We're really looking forward‑‑ I'm watching Texas on tape, trying to figure
out how can we play with them.  
UNIDENTIFIED COACH: I can tell you.  
COACH BOVAIRD: I will take your advice. I appreciate that. KemperLesnik does a
great job putting this event on, and we're just so happy to be part of it.

## November 18, 2012

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JAY BILAS: First of all, thanks for noting that I was a graduate of Duke. It
only took me 12 years to get that. And I'm really proud of it. I did major in
math.  
Next up is the head coach of Texas, Rick Barnes. He's been at Texas now for 14
seasons, and has gone to 27 straight NCAA Tournaments. (Laughter).  
Rick is a member of the Lenoir‑Rhyne College Hall of Fame, which shows you how
easy it is to get into the Lenoir‑Rhyne College Hall of Fame.  
Rick has done an extraordinary job at Texas. He was an outstanding head coach
at Providence and Clemson before he went with the Longhorns and took Texas to
the 2003 Final Four, and I'm sure is going to have something witty to say
about what I said about him. Rick Barnes.  
COACH BARNES: No, I'm just going to tell the truth. I think it was 1981, and I
was an assistant coach at George Mason University. And I think Jay was a
freshman.  
And when he arrived at Duke they were trying to play that real aggressive
man‑to‑man defense. He got a little bit too close to a player by the name of
Carlo (indiscernible). And I enjoyed watching Jay pick his two front teeth up
off the floor.  
JAY BILAS: That's actually true.  
COACH BARNES: It is true. But Jay has been great for college basketball. And I
love the trip that we went on, what, a couple of years ago to Kuwait. Had a
great time. It's great being here.  
And our team‑‑ I don't think I've ever coached a team where we just have
freshmen and sophomores, no upper classmen that were recruited. It's been a
fun group to be with. We think we're going to be good. And this next couple of
days is going to give us a chance to grow, and we're looking forward to it.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Creighton  83  
Illinois State  79

  
THE MODERATOR: The champions of the State Farm Missouri Valley Conference
tournament are about with us. We have Coach Greg McDermott, the first coach to
win this for two different schools in the tournament to open up with a
statement, then questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH McDERMOTT: First of all, congratulations to Illinois State. We started
the game exactly like we wanted to. We got the tempo where we wanted it and we
were scoring it in transition. To their credit, they really threw the last
punch of the first half, and then it was a dog fight from then on out.  
You need to bounce to the ball, you need some good things to happen, and we
certainly had that. But I couldn't be more proud of this group. As good of
basketball players as they are, they're even better people.  
We've had a target on our backs since our win at San Diego State when we first
entered the rankings. There aren't many schools like ours in a mid‑major
conference that are essentially ranked the entire season. The pressure that's
come with that, especially in Omaha, Nebraska, where there are a few
basketball fans, are really immense.  
These guys have handled it incredibly well. They haven't let it become a
distraction. When we've had adversity, they've hung together and never pointed
the finger at one another. When we've been hard on one of them, they have a
way at picking that individual up and getting him back where he needs to be.
And that's rare in college athletics today. It really is.  
To have an unselfish group that doesn't care who gets the credit, that plays
for one another. It doesn't happen everywhere, and I'm blessed to be part of
it.  
  
Q. Grant, you're team captain, did you take it upon yourself to make big
shots at the end of the game to take over the game?  
GRANT GIBBS: Yeah, I knew I was going to have some open looks. One of the last
timeouts, Coach said if they're going to leave you open, step up and knock
some down. And obviously Doug and Greg were looking for me, so I was fortunate
to step up there and knock down a couple of big shots for us.  
  
Q. Doug, a lot of fathers and sons have attended this tournament together,
and you've had a chance to watch your dad coach here for Northern Iowa. What
was it like to go through this experience with your dad at your side?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, it's a really special feeling. We've come a long ways. I
remember yesterday I was a fourth grade kid on that stage with my dad's team.
It feels good to win one as a player. Just really thankful and blessed to be
in this situation.  
  
Q. Doug, could you talk about Illinois State got up by six there in the
second half and then you just went on a little bit of a tear. Could you talk
about the team's mindset and your mindset at that point?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, Echenique had a come threes there and he was feeling it.
We just stayed the course. We didn't panic. We had done what we've done all
year. We got some good looks in the post in transition. That was something we
discussed at halftime to do a better job of. We recognized that and did a good
job of finding our post.  
  
Q. Antoine, as a senior member of this group, could you talk about what it
means to do this the last time around?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: It feels great. It's a tremendous feeling. I had tremendous fun
playing with these guys all year. It was just another experience and
opportunity to go out and have some fun with them and to get it done this last
year was tremendous. I owe it to these guys and the guys in the locker room,
our coaching staff and our fans have done a great job.  
  
Q. Doug and Antoine, for both of you guys, I think everybody that watched
this game here and on television across the country kept thinking this is a
great game. When you're in a game like this on that kind of a stage, do you
get a sense when you're out there that there's a timeout and you're standing
on the free ‑throw line that you realize you're up, you're down by a point or
two, that you're in the middle of a really classic game?   
ANTOINE YOUNG: Obviously you think about it. It's a dog fight all the way. But
I think as a player you have to stay the course. If you think outside of it
and worry about everything else that's going on, it will get to you. So you
have to stay the course and stay focused on the game and hope everything works
out.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, absolutely. This is what we all dream of to play on
national television for a championship. This is what we work for. These are
the kind of situations we work for. There are tough days, tough practices. We
don't really think about it too much as the game is playing. We just try to do
what we do and stay together.  
  
Q. Your coach talked about the pressure of being that rare mid ‑major team
that's ranked all season long. Did you guys feel that pressure? Now that
you've gotten beyond this point where you know you're going to get into the
NCAA, is there a different pressure, or is the pressure off?   
JAHENNS MANIGAT: I think that we didn't feel that much pressure. The coaching
staff did a great job of letting us do it one possession at a time and one
game at a time. That was our mindset the whole year. Even though there was a
target on our back, we understand understood what the task was, we approached
it to the best of our ability, and now we're repeating the benefits of that.  
ANTOINE YOUNG: We're in our conference. Everybody gives it their best shot. We
were ranked, like Coach said, so that gave them an extra motivation. So it was
tough times, but you know, we fought through it. Now we're going to the
tournament, and it's going to be a whole different season for us. We'll be
ready.  
  
Q. Doug, given the magnitude of this game and setting a St. Louis scoring
record, is this your best game of the year?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, it's one of my better games I should say just because of
the stage it was on. This was one of our goals was to win the Missouri Valley
Conference title and to step up. It feels really good.  
  
Q. Grant, how critical, looking back on it, how critical was your three
‑pointer to start the overtime? How key were the shots you hit earlier in
regulation to give you the confidence to take that first shot in OT?   
GRANT GIBBS: You know, I got some decent looks early and kind of got my
confidence going. Hitting that jumper kind of boost me up a little bit and
kind of kept me going through the period. I haven't shot the ball great this
year, but I'm a capable shooter and I have a lot of confidence in my jumper.
And these guys do too. Doug and Gregory were able to kick it out to me, and I
was able to knock down a couple that were big for us.  
  
Q. Grant, what was the big difference you saw from Illinois State from 33
days ago or so when you guys really throttled them in Omaha? And how do you
think the battle will be next year between the two teams?  
GRANT GIBBS: They were just kind of rolling. They had that not holding
anything back Cinderella‑type deal, and they're knocking down shots, playing
with a ton of confidence. From that standpoint, they're a different team than
we played a month ago. They've got everybody coming back and they're going to
be really good. They're one of the up and comers in our conference, no doubt
about that. You have to give them tremendous credit the way they played today.
Played with a lot of heart, but we were able to pull it off.  
  
Q. Last year you guys left here awfully disappointed. Can you talk about the
growth of this team over the course of the season?  
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: Even though we last year we were disappointed that we lost,
we got a chance to play more basketball afterwards, and coach said I think
that really helped our team in a way. I think that definitely made the team a
lot better. Coming into this year we knew that we were capable of winning this
tournament.  
Also, we remembered how we felt then and we didn't want it to happen again. So
I'm pretty excited. I'm glad we got through it and we got the championship.  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I remember last year, it wasn't a good one. Ever since we
started practicing together in the Bahamas early summer, we've been working
daily, every day, working hard talking to each other. Trying to get where we
want to be. And we stuck together through adversity, and also kind of dealt
with things successfully without going back.  
So sticking together and being a team, and getting through adversity was huge.  
  
Q. Antoine, can you talk about scoring 8 points in overtime?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I just wanted to make plays in overtime. Had an opportunity to
go to the line and just had to step up and make them. It was tough in a
championship game. But that's part of our team. We had guys stepping up to
make plays and that's what makes us who we are. But just one step up and make
plays.  
  
Q. Antoine, you were here through the coaching change. You saw not horrible
times in your program, but you guys kind of went through a down swing. Can you
talk about how rewarding it is to win this championship?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: It was very rewarding. Coach taught me, I didn't know if I was
going to stay what was going to happen. And Coach Mack and his coaching staff
have come in and done a phenomenal job with me. They feel like my family.  
It's just good to have Creighton basketball back where it needs to be, back
where it should be as a whole unit. It's really hat's off to our coaching
staff and our team?  
  
Q. You scored most of your points during two scoring runs, especially in the
second half. Are you thinking during those moments that this is a point where
I need to take over the game?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, like I said, all year our guys have been really
unselfish. I think guys like Grant Gibbs and Antoine recognize when the ball
needs to go inside or they need to get me or Gregory going. They recognize
that. You've got to give them a lot of credit. They've been doing it all year,
and hopefully that continues.  
  
Q. The last four or five years have shown us that mid ‑majors have the
ability to not only get far in the tournament but get to the Final Four and
get to the championship game. Are you guys built to be that team?   
COACH McDERMOTT: I hope so. I think what we have that not every mid‑major has
is what we have on our front line. Gregory gives us that post presence and
defensive presence that a lot of teams at our level aren't blessed to have.
Then we have another scorer in Doug who can score on the block.  
You bring in Will Artino off the bench at 6'11, and Ethan Wragge is a match‑up
when he comes in the game. So I think we have some versatility in some
positions that makes us a difficult guard. And we have that anchor inside. We
also have senior leadership at the point guard.  
That is really the recipe for success in the NCAA Tournament. But the reality
is it all comes down to match‑ups. As you look back at Butlers and VCUs that
have made the runs, they've found a way to win some close games.  
I don't think we're going to sneak up on anybody, we've won 28 game this is
year, so I don't think anybody's going to sneak past us so our preparation in
the next ten days is really going to be important.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Grant Gibbs, making him a captain before he had even
played at Creighton? His contributions tonight?  
COACH McDERMOTT: I didn't make him the captain. His teammates did. That tells
you a little about Grant Gibbs. The impact he had on his teammates in the
locker room a year ago when he wasn't eligible to play. It wasn't like the
voting was close. He was a unanimous captain. The only person that didn't vote
for him is him, because that's what he's all about.  
For him to have success on this stage, good things are supposed to happen for
good people. For Grant today, it really did. He's fought through tremendous
adversity with his knee issues and just keeps on plugging. He practices maybe
half the time, so he has to. His mental preparation is so important because he
doesn't get the reps that everybody else does.  
But his value to us, as valuable as he is on the floor, he may even be more
valuable in the locker room.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I asked a couple of the players. The growth of
this team from a year ago from your standpoint, give us an idea of what you've
seen?  
COACH McDERMOTT: Last year we lost a lot of close games. We won our first
three on the road in the Valley, and close losses at northern and Drake and
Missouri State where we led the whole way at Wichita on Senior Night by a
point in the last couple seconds. You hope that you learn from those
experiences and you make the changes necessary that when you get in that
situation you don't make the same mistakes again.  
I've said before, any coach that's had a season like we have had, a very
special season, will look back upon it and point to six or seven games that
the ball bounces here or there and it's a difference in five, six, seven games
over the course of a season.  
We've had some good fortune at times and we've made some of our own good luck
at the same time. But what I will say about this team, and it was never more
evident than in the huddle at San Diego State when we were getting drilled in
front of an unbelievable crowd. They did not rattle. There wasn't any panic on
their face. They just kept saying let's do what we do. That's kind of their
motto is keep doing what we're doing and we'll be fine.  
I've said it before. I think in some ways I think it's a weakness because they
don't show the emotion when things are going well that I'd like to see, but
it's also what makes this team good. They don't doubt each other. They don't
doubt themselves. It's not in an arrogant way. They're a close group and
they've got tremendous belief in one another.  
  
Q. With the season that you guys have had and now the tournament
championship automatic bid, does that put you ahead of schedule? Like you've
exceeded your own expectations?  
COACH McDERMOTT: You know, probably. I've never been a coach that has a
five‑year plan. I'm about what is the plan for today and how can we maximize
what we need to accomplish today? It's come together quickly.  
Obviously adding Grant Gibbs to our team was a huge get for us because of the
intangible things he brings to the team. Then the development of Gregory over
the last year, of Antoine's willingness to not take as many three‑point shot
this is year and distribute the basketball. It was a lot of improved players
in our league, but maybe none more improved than Doug. He's had such a good
year. Nobody's talked about how much he's improved from a year ago.  
So Josh Jones, you look at his assists to turnover from a year ago compared to
this year, his numbers are off the charts. So guys have really bought in and
worked hard. They really believe in one another, and I've got an unbelievable
coaching staff that's worked extremely hard to make this happen.  
You also have to go back to a year ago to Casey Harriman and Kaleb Korver,
Kenny Lawson, Wayne Runnels and Darryl Ashford, the five seniors I inherited.
If those guys don't embrace us, there is no chance of us moving this program
forward as quickly as we have.  
Even though we didn't win as much as we wanted, those guys accepted their
roles, even if they didn't like them at all times. That leadership and example
has been critical to the leaders that we have on our team today.  
Those five deserve as much credit for our success as anybody that played
today.  
  
Q. Doug seems to have a knack for getting open and being in the right place
at the right time. What is the best thing in your mind about him as a
player?  
COACH McDERMOTT: He has confidence without arrogance, and that's hard to find
in this day and age. He's got an unbelievable feel for angles. And he's got
some of the best hands of anybody I've been around. His teammates understand,
just get it close, and Doug's going to make sure it doesn't turn over. He'll
go grab it.  
If you watch him in transition in the in the post, he never stops working.
That's probably where he's made the jump from a year ago. The consistency of
his effort on the offensive end, and I'm still picking on him on his defensive
end some, but when he gets 33 I'll let it slide a little bit today.  
  
Q. You talked about the adjustments that Antoine's had to make over the
course of the year. To see him go out on top, what's that mean to you?  
COACH McDERMOTT: You're only as good as your point guard. Your ability to
coach a team is only effective if your point guard will allow you to coach
him. Last year we needed Antoine to score and we needed him take some chances
because we didn't have enough fire power.  
Doug's body wasn't developed to the point where he could do what he's doing
this year. Gregory was feeling his way through our system trying to figure out
what his role was.  
Josh Jones was trying to figure me out. I was trying to figure Josh out. I
don't think I've done that for sure yet. But Antoine did what we asked him to
do last year and he's done what we've asked him to do this year. His numbers
across the board are very similar to a year ago. Except he's said I'm not
going to shoot that three unless it's late shot clock or I'm in rhythm.  
And those, I would guess, 70 shots that he took last year are shots that Doug
or Gregory are taking. Are wide open threes by Avery or Josh or Ethan. That's
an unselfish approach.  
He deserved to cut that net down. He's earned it. I went through a coaching
change myself when I was a player. I know how difficult it is. And he's
embraced us and really allowed my coaching staff to work with him. He's turned
into an unbelievable leader.  
  
Q. Somebody in here asked the players does being part of a game like this on
a big stage, if you looked at Twitter during the game, which I'm sure you
weren't, but everybody in the nation was watching and captivated by this game.
What's it mean to play in a game like that?  
COACH McDERMOTT: When you're in the middle of it, you don't think about it.
You're thinking about the next play. The last time I sat on this stage after
winning a championship, it was a game similar to this one. When you go back
and look at it and watch it this week, I think I'll appreciate what a great
game it was and how well our guys executed at times on both ends of the floor.  
But when you're in the middle of it you're just trying to grind it out and
figuring out a way to get the best shot for your team the next possession and
get in the right combination on the floor to get a stop when we needed it.  
As I've said, we've gone to a lot of great environments. This is now our 14th
win away from home this year. Four on the neutral floor and ten on the road.
So these guys have been in almost every environment possible, and they've
stayed in the moment. Because they've stayed in the moment, we were able to
celebrate today.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Creighton  83  
Illinois State  79

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH JANKOVICH: Could not possibly be prouder of a team. Love this group. I
just hope so bad that anybody that watched us this weekend, if you couldn't
tell how badly this team wanted to win this tournament, then you're eating a
lot of popcorn because I thought they were sensational. I thought the effort
was as good as you could ever hope for. They deserved to be playing in the
NCAA Tournament in terms what have they showed here.  
I don't know what to say to them to make them feel better, because they
deserve to feel a lot better than they do.  
  
Q. Jackie, what did you learn about yourselves this weekend going forward to
next year?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: I think we learned a lot of things. I think we became more
of a close‑knit group over these past few days and know that we can play with
some of the top teams in the country. So I think we have a lot to take away
from this weekend. We've just got to get better from it.  
  
Q. Nic, could you run us through a little bit at the end of regulation there
after you guys tied it? What happened there? Did you foul there? And then
could you kind of after that talk about your lay ‑up?  
NIC MOORE: Well, everybody screening kind of got to me. And I thought they
were saying foul because I thought we were down one. It was tied, and I found
the wrong guy. Hit both of his free throws, and I hear Coach Jankovich on the
side saying push it, push it. I had the ball, and everybody spread out and I
was beating my man and had a lay‑up.  
  
Q. Tyler, you guys got ahead there by six points midway through the second
half. Then McDermott went on a little bit of a roll there. Did you guys ever
feel you were close to getting control of the game at any point?  
TYLER BROWN: Well, we were up 6 at that point, but I don't feel like we were
in control. There was a lot of time left. He's a great player and he made a
lot of big plays. Number hit some threes, playing off him, helping out on the
post. But I don't think we ever felt like we had any control where we felt
like we didn't have no worries.  
  
Q. Jackie, did the team run out of a little gas in overtime? The shots
weren't falling initially. Did the team run out of gas at the end there?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: I don't think so. I think we are an overtime team. I don't
think we ran out of gas at all. The shots weren't falling. This is basketball,
and that's the way things go sometimes.  
  
Q. What did you find out about the team this week? It seemed you guys grew
up so much in these three days here. Obviously, it looks like you might be
playing in the NIT, too, so this season isn't even over yet. What do you take
forward from this weekend?  
NIC MOORE: I feel like all of us, we believe now. We found out what it takes
to play in the NCAA Tournament. I mean, we just came closer. A lot of guys
fought. We never gave up, and that was great to see.  
I'm just proud of everybody. We left it on the court, but it didn't come
through.  
  
Q. Jackie, what makes McDermott so tough to defend?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: He's a good player. I mean, I don't really know. He hits
tough shots. I mean, he's a good player. There are a lot of things that he
does well, but I can't name one thing in particular.  
  
Q. Creighton thumped you guys pretty good in Omaha. What have you guys ‑‑
where has your team come from since that point? What has made you guys so much
better?   
TYLER BROWN: We've just grown up as a team. Everybody has stepped their game
up a notch, even two notches even. So we just know how good we can be, know
how good we are. Once we figured that out, we just put it out there every
night, and that's what got us this far.  
  
Q. Nic, what's that locker room like right now?  
NIC MOORE: Just guys are disappointed because we worked so hard this weekend
to win a championship, and we fell short. I mean upset, but now we know what
it takes for next season, so we'll grow with that.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys had a defensive plan against McDermott. He hit some
tough shots. Maybe Gibbs was the guy that you didn't expect for them to come
through?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, you know, we hit the three. That was our big shot late.
But it's no secret; Doug is a tremendous player. He's not a normal player.
He's not a good player. He's not. He's one of the great players that's been in
this league in years, so everyone else gets to look like a really good player
because you get to shoot horse shots if you play with him.  
Or you don't get to shoot horse shots, and you try to guard him one‑on‑one the
whole game and he's one of the leading scorers in the country. So what are
your choices? They shoot 40‑some percent from three. So we could zone them and
shoot horse shots all over the place. That doesn't sound like a good idea.  
So what do you is say where are we going to help from, and I thought it was
very effective, really effective. About as effective as we could hope for.  
But, of course, you know it's going to come down does the guy make a big shot
or not? We have a few that could have changed the game, and they don't go in.
They get there and make the big shot, and you know that going in. That's why
it's great to have a first‑team All American on your team. That really makes
things a lot easier for everyone else. So they were able to hit some big
shots.  
  
Q. What did you tell the guys in the locker room after the game?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Well, quite a bit. We talked quite a while. But really just
there's no way to express it, really. You kind of have to go through it. You
kind of have to feel. There's no way I can even come close to relaying to you
what it feels like to be them, to put out what they put out and sacrifices. No
one could possibly know how hard they work, or how we work, or how much
passion and blood, sweat and tears. There's no way. There is no way you can
describe it unless you live it. To watch them fall that short is just an
absolutely amazing accomplishment. It cuts so deep.  
So I tell them how proud I am. I don't know they can even hear me given how
disappointed they are, but I am. Not been the most respected team all year.
Kind of flying under the radar. We had half the guys‑‑ of our top nine, five
of them had never played college basketball before. We had a few guys
returning that did a great job and grew up.  
One of them didn't even get to play. We played Stutz against Echenique, our
biggest guy on our team. We're a big man down, and really a crucial man down
against two humongous forces. That doesn't deter them.  
We had foul trouble throughout this whole tournament. That doesn't deter them.
We're down late. Find a way to go out in overtime. That doesn't do it.  
I don't know. This team really gets to me. I'm not sure everybody really gets
it. I'm not sure they get what they've accomplished given they've never even
played before, half of them. Half of them have never played before.  
To fall that short of an NCAA bid is painful beyond words.  
  
Q. Coach, after the battle down the stretch to get it into overtime, did you
feel like the first couple of offensive possessions you guys were settled down
and did what you wanted to those possessions? Or did you wish that maybe there
was a little more patience on those first couple of possessions?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Well, hindsight is at least 20/20. When a shot goes in, we're
sitting here talking about boy, wasn't the offense looking great when those
shots went in early? When they don't go in, it's like well, we should have
done this. You know, it's basketball. Sometimes the ball goes in, sometimes it
doesn't. There might have been one shot that I probably wish would have come
back.  
But they also hit some big shots. They hit a lot of big shots along the way.
I'm not going to fault them in any way for that.  
  
Q. Coach, they picked up a couple points on the technical and the hanging on
the rim. I'm just wondering how you saw that? We've seen a couple of those
this weekend. Is it a point of emphasis on that?  
COACH JANKOVICH: If it was, I missed that meeting because I sure would have
relayed that. I like Scott a lot. I think he's an outstanding ref. But I
totally disagreed with him. I told him that. I said, Scott, it's dangerous if
you jump that high. Scott, you don't jump that high. I don't jump that high.
You don't know what it's like to be up there and worry about someone being
underneath you.  
I didn't see him do anything that was anything more than just protecting
himself. That's the rule. That's the rule. So I strongly disagreed with that,
and I told him that. He disagreed with me, but I thought he did a great job, I
just didn't agree with that one.  
  
Q. You said your chemistry finally came together for this team. How big is
it for your young players to get this experience?  
COACH JANKOVICH: I think humongous. I think short of one more basket of
regulation or two more in overtime, we couldn't hope for anything better to
happen here. We just couldn't hope for it. You know, I go back‑‑ think of
this. Even though there is the pain that they feel, but we meet an outstanding
team who is always hard to beat. Then we beat a 15th ranked team, and our
reward for that is to play another ranked team. It's never happened in the
history. There's never been two ranked teams in the tournament ever in the
history of this building or in the history of this tournament, and we draw
that. That's our task with five guys that have never played before.  
For them to realize they came a possession‑‑ one possession away from winning
two top 25 back‑to‑back games in a championship, I think and I hope when the
pain goes down, our motivation level goes way up. That was another thing we
talked about, by the way. What this can do for us once it stops hurting so
bad. What it can do for our growth as a team.  
  
Q. Despite the disappointment that you feel right now, the quality of the
game, can you have an appreciation for that and the stage, the national TV
stage?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Absolutely, absolutely, for sure. Yesterday the same.
Absolutely, I can. That helps me think about what I was thinking about. So ask
more of those questions. So, incredible. Incredible tournament, incredible
crowd, incredible teams, incredible games. Yeah, yeah.  
It's a privilege to be a part of that, and I do feel lucky and privileged to
get to do that on that stage and that highly competitive environment. That's
what you work so hard for. That's what you've sacrificed as coaches, as
players, everybody.  
By the way, I want to say we have so many great support people, especially our
trainer, John Munn, my gosh, this year what he does is miraculous. And so many
more guys I could name.  
But, yes, I do feel that. And when we leave this building or we leave this
town, there will be a lot of sadness for not being able to do it some more,
because you wish you could go do it tomorrow or the next day. It's really
special.  
  
Q. What do you take from those games going forward to next year and looking
at the seasons ahead with this group?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Just that I have said this the whole year and probably this
weekend drove home my point times a hundred more than my words, but there is a
lot of room for growth with this team. As well as we played, as hard as we
played, we still make a lot of mistakes because we're inexperienced. We just
make some mistakes that I don't think we'll make as we grow older. I know we
won't.  
Our guys that returned this year, the nucleus of four, John, Jon, Jackie and
Anthony who played a lot of significant minutes for us, they don't make as
many mistakes this year as they made. They grow. They see things before they
happen. You guys have to go through them.  
So natural maturation coupled with tremendous belief on our team given this
weekend, I think that we can really, really use this to drive us to some great
work throughout the spring and the summer and the fall.  
  
Q. I know some people viewed the NIT as a consolation prize. I know you
don't. Do you expect to get an NIT bid, and how do you expect the team to
respond to that if do you?  
COACH JANKOVICH: I think it's a great honor. I think people need to start
understanding that. I think we're inundated with NCAA, NCAA, NCAA. But gosh,
there are only 32 or 34 invitations. If you don't win the tournament, there
are only 32 or 34 and only 6 or 7 go to a non‑BCS school. Out of 270 schools,
they're going to invite 7 schools. Think about that.  
Then you go to the NIT and get an automatic NIT bid if you win your league and
don't go to the tournament. So out of the 32, all of a sudden it's like there
are 15 of those taken up. Now there are only 17 spots. Well, we're going to
take the BCS, and throw those in. Now there are 7 spots in the United States.
7 spots.  
If somebody says we'll invite you guys, so you've got the NCAA inviting 7.
You've got the NIT inviting 7. So there are 14 teams out of 270 that get
invited to a really prestigious tournament. I don't think people get it. I
don't think they get it at all. I think it's an unbelievable honor.  
Is it the one that we're shooting for? No, of course not, because the NCAA
Tournament is the most prestigious one. But when you play in a non‑BCS league
and get an NIT bid, you've had an unbelievable year, unbelievable. I really
don't think people get it. I don't think they have any understanding of the
numbers of what it takes, how high you have to put yourself.  
Does our team not deserve an NIT bid? Oh, my gosh. But we don't pick it. There
is a committee and we're just hopeful they'll respect what we've done.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2012

  

### [Colt Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21763)

### [Marty Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20513)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Creighton  99  
Evansville  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH SIMMONS: We're obviously disappointed in the result. But overall really
proud of our guys and just how they've gone about the season. Creighton was
just really, really good today. They were hard to guard in all aspects. We
struggled with guarding the ball. We struggled with guarding the post.  
We had a hard time getting out to their shooters, and they beat us up on the
boards as well. They're a very good basketball team, and they certainly
deserved to win.  
  
Q. Colt, do you feel size was a factor in this game today?  
COLT RYAN: No, I don't feel like size was a factor. We are a little
undersized, but with rebounding and stuff, I'm guessing that's what you're
getting at, I don't think that has anything to do with blocking out and going
and pursuing the ball, which is what we didn't do today.  
  
Q. I know you guys came back a little bit and played in the end, but did you
feel you could carry some momentum going forward?  
COLT RYAN: Yeah, I think there were a couple games late in the season that we
played well and executed well. Hopefully when we get a postseason tournament,
hopefully we can draw from those games and move forward.  
  
Q. Colt, what did they do differently against you this time after the last
game when you were so hot and hardly missed anything?  
COLT RYAN: Yeah, they made sure they always had a guy in my face. I don't
think they did too much different. They had guys had some open shots. I had
some open shots didn't knock down. If they were up in my face, that gave more
opportunities for the other guys on the team to score the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you learn from a game like this one today?  
COACH SIMMONS: There will be a lot to learn. Just from an execution standpoint
and how we have to play to be competitive against a team like Creighton. I
think we can learn a lot, ball screens, the way we handled ball screens, our
inability to block out. Not being able to sprint back in transition and get
them stopped. There are just tons of things that, as a staff, we can go back
and show our basketball team and they can learn from and we can still improve.  
  
Q. What made the difference in rebounding, because you guys played so well
on the board today? Was it them getting all those three pointers and them
making it a little more difficult and you had to respect it some?  
COACH SIMMONS: Just rebounding is effort, and our effort yesterday was better.
That's not to take anything away from Creighton. They've got good size.
They've got good athletes, but you still have to be fundamentally sound.
You've got to get bodies on people. You've got to pursue the basketball. We've
been able to compete pretty well throughout the course of the season. But we
just didn't do a good job of that today.  
  
Q. Obviously they were hot from the three ‑point line early on. Was that
just a case of not getting out there in time or a case of they're going to hit
everything, because you guys in Evansville, they missed 18?  
COACH SIMMONS: Yeah, they're one of the best shooting teams if not thee best
in the country. That's their deal. They've got very good shooters. They're a
very unselfish team. They do what they do with their system of play very well.  
As we did in the prior two games, we have to show a lot of help. They
recognize that. They skip the ball. We were a little slower, I think, as far
as closing out on the shooters. But I mean, they knocked them in.  
  
Q. Coach, your team was down 49 ‑30 at halftime. What did you feel had you
to come out and do in the second half to at least stay in this game?   
COACH SIMMONS: I thought the first four minutes, if we could just chip away
there and get a little momentum. They got off to such a good start. Then we
seemed to battle back, and they got away from us there. But I really thought
if we could just have some success those first four minutes that it would
carry over for the remainder of the half. But it seemed we played pretty even
there the first four, and we probably didn't get out of that what we would
have hoped.  
  
Q. Beyond the disappointment of today, can you put this late ‑season surge
that you guys had into perspective? You won 4 out of 5 coming into today. Do
you think you've done enough to get into a tournament again this year?   
COACH SIMMONS: Well, I would certainly hope finishing third in the league that
we compete in would be justification to play in a postseason tournament. I'm
not on the selection committee, but I would think that. I would think our guys
have battled all year long. We were in a position maybe to have even more
success, and we didn't quite get it done.  
But I think they certainly showed that they can compete in this league. I
think more than anything we've talked about is just their resiliency of being
able to come back. I think that's probably the thing that makes me the most
proud.  
  
Q. You guys have done a good job of keeping Gregory Echenique down. What was
the difference today?  
COACH SIMMONS: I just think from an execution standpoint they executed better.
We had to show more help. Our rotations defensively weren't what they needed
to be, and he's a really good player. He's explosive around the rim, and we
seem to be a step late at times in our rotation to not only prevent post
passes, but to take charges. Again, I thought they did a great job of getting
him the ball in positions where he could score.

### [Toure' Murry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20501)

### [Garrett Stutz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20536)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  65  
Wichita State  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Marshall, an opening statement?  
COACH MARSHALL: (No microphone).  
  
Q. Guys, for any one of you, I know it hurts right now, but is the sting a
bit lessened knowing that you will have more games in the NCAA Tournament?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Not at all. Our goal was to come here and win the tournament,
we didn't do it, so we're disappointed. We're not looking forward to the NCAA
Tournament while we have a game today. That's not how you prepare. We didn't
win the game, so that's it.  
  
Q. I think six assists for the entire game, so there was virtually no
offensive flow. What was Illinois State doing to knock you guys out of your
offensive rhythm?  
JOE RAGLAND: They did a very good job making us on the ball screen hedge them
really well. At times we got stagnant and started running our motion and that
hurt us.  
  
Q. What do you guys feel was the situation in the second half that didn't
get you to where you wanted to be?  
GARRETT STUTZ: They came out, they were making shots. We continued to stop the
runs early on in the half and we kept trying to play through the adversity we
were facing and just didn't get it done.  
TOURE' MURRY: They made shots, we didn't. They picked us apart and did
whatever they wanted to, it seemed like.  
JOE RAGLAND: We couldn't stop their ball screen offense, they really hurt us,
and they got to the free‑throw line. They did a good job of making the
three‑point shots.  
  
Q. All three games they played against you guys, they had you in the 60s.
Was it some sort of a match ‑up that was tough for you? Because most of the
games are in the 70s, 80s, even 90s at some points.   
JOE RAGLAND: I'm not sure. You know, we don't really look at what the score is
because we won both regular season games and what they held us to because we
won the game. Athlete-wise, they're similar to us. Carmichael does a real good
job deflecting on contesting shots at the rim that we normally make, and we
didn't make them today. You know, they played a hell of a game.  
  
Q. Garrett, things are really physical down in the post. Were the previous
games against them that chippy? What was going on between and you Wilkins
during the game?  
GARRETT STUTZ: I don't know how you can warn a guy 20‑plus time that's game
and not call a foul on them. I don't understand that to me. Eventually you
have to draw a line and say enough is enough. I've warned you guys four or
five times and call something.  
It's disappointing as a senior to go out like this in a game like that.  
  
Q. How do you put this behind you so there is no carryover effect?  
TOURE' MURRY: Feel the pain, and we'll get through this. This loss will
probably help us know what to do the next game. Come out with intensity, learn
from our mistakes from this game.  
JOE RAGLAND: Can't let it carry over. We want to be successful because we have
more games, but we can't let this affect us in our next game or practice or
anything else. We've just got to move forward.  
  
Q. Toure', could you kind of run us through after Brown makes the second
free throw, you get the ball. Kind of run us through what was going through
your mind as you came off the court there?  
TOURE' MURRY: I got the ball and Garrett Stutz was supposed to set a high ball
screen. And I come off and I see Jackie Carmichael kind of back, so I pulled
up for a jumper.  
  
Q. How do they change over the last ten days? It seemed they were playing a
lot better than maybe they did the last time you met them.  
GARRETT STUTZ: They made shots. They found something that was working and they
kept going to it. We changed because we stopped running or we stopped getting
out in transition. I don't know. Our effort came up short this time.  
  
Q. What are some of the things you think you need to work on as you go on to
the next level? You'll be playing in the tournament, what are some of the
things you need to improve on as you go to that next level?  
JOE RAGLAND: I feel we need to get better on ball screen defense. They picked
us apart. At times, the big man just seemed like we were hedging too long or
not hedging out enough. We've just got to get better at that.  
TOURE' MURRY: You can work on every aspect of your game defensively and
individually as a team. You've got to just work, keep working and find out.
Watch the film, find out what we did wrong and work on it.  
  
Q. Obviously it's tough to go through a loss any time. But this isn't going
to be the last game of the season for you guys. You've played well all season.
What are your thoughts as players going forward, focused on the next step, if
I can say, at the NCAA Tournament?  
JOE RAGLAND: I'm not too sure. I mean, it's hard to answer that question when
you just lost a game 5 minutes ago that determines our Missouri Valley season
as far as tournament champions. I'm not sure I can really answer that right
now.  
GARRETT STUTZ: Learn from this loss. Every other loss this year we've learned
from and recovered well. Going forward we have to learn from this and correct
your mistakes and come out ready to play?  
  
Q. Had you won the tournament, you may have entered the NCAA Tournament as a
4 or 5 seed. What do you think this will do to your NCAA seeding now?  
COACH MARSHALL: It won't be as good. Depends on what happens in the coming
weeks and days with the other tournaments.  
  
Q. Coach, in halftime you had an 8 ‑point lead and a chance to put them
away.   
COACH MARSHALL: You can't put them away in the first half. We didn't play well
enough in the second half with an 8‑point lead. We didn't play well in the
first half. We had an 8‑point lead, had four guys in foul trouble, and
survived it. Jake White gave us a big lift. Then just didn't play well enough
in the second half to hold that lead.  
  
Q. Defensively did they do anything particular that was really effective
today?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think they did a good job on our ball screen. But when
Garrett's out of the game as much as he is, our offense is obviously
different. He's been a mainstay for us. Carmichael did a good job on Carl. But
just it's uncharacteristic of Garrett to get a technical foul. I think it's
the first of his career. Didn't seem like they wanted to see him play too
much.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jake White and the boost he gave you in the first half. Was
there consideration of playing him more than he played in the second half?  
COACH MARSHALL: We tried to manage our bench as best we could. You can second
guess that. Ben didn't play a lot of minutes, but I went with the guys. Again,
we played most of the year. And Jake's a fine player. Really like Jake. Glad
he's in our program. But he hasn't been as effective all of the year, other
than today, he was very effective in his minutes.  
  
Q. Toure' mentioned guarding the ball screen. Is that where Tyler Brown got
loose for some of his shots? How did that happen?  
COACH MARSHALL: He got loose on a ball screen or two. He got loose on a down
screen. I don't recall every time he got loose. But one time we went under a
ball screen, and he rose up and shot it. I remember that three.  
  
Q. Yesterday and today there was a lull to open the second half. What do you
need to do to fix that as you move forward?  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't think we're going to do too much fixing. 27‑5\. We're
going to play in the NCAA Tournament. Looking forward to that, a neutral
floor. Feel we have just as good a shot if not better than we did today.  
  
Q. Can you just address the disappointment again here in St. Louis? Is it a
big deal? Is it overblown? Is it strange to you that this team of all teams
‑‑  
COACH MARSHALL: I saw some strange things today. That's your word, and I'll go
with that. It's pretty tough to win when you see some strange things like I
saw today.  
I'm looking forward to going and playing on a neutral court. I like my
chances.  
  
Q. Could you give your impressions of the progress that you've seen over the
year in ISU from the first time you played them until now?  
COACH MARSHALL: First time we played them they had a couple of shots to tie.
In the first minute. I've always thought they were very talented and athletic.
Tim does a very nice job. So they certainly have our respect, and you can see
why. They're a good basketball team. We went to their place about a week ago
and won by 11 to win the regular season outright, which is a nice
accomplishment. They're a good team.  
With everything that happened today, they certainly deserve that win, and good
luck to them.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had a couple of eight ‑game winning streaks and now nine
game winning streak before this loss. What has your team done? You've been all
business all season long. What have you done to be able to forget those losses
and start up again?   
COACH MARSHALL: For the most part, they're a pretty mature team. They're
committed to excellence. They weren't excellent today and there were many
factors to that. But I've got to get them up. I've got to coach them better.
We've certainly got to play better and hopefully get a break or two.  
  
Q. Considering the conference standing and kind of going back to one of the
first questions that you answered about how this affects maybe your seeding in
the big tournament, last year our conference champion made it to the
championship game in this tournament and didn't get an invite at all. Are you
worried about that happening or really taking a further fall down in the
seedings than maybe you even deserve to have because of this loss?  
COACH MARSHALL: Are you worried? I'm not worried. Are you worried? You
shouldn't be. Sleep well tonight.  
  
Q. Was the last play pretty much the play and shot you wanted?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, with six seconds, we could have gotten it up and run.
The play we ended up running with .9 seconds or .1, whatever they changed it
to, that would have been our sideline play. But I thought we got two looks.
Toure' Murry got a 17 pull‑up right there on line, and Garrett got a 10‑foot
pull‑up.  
So we got two shots in the air to win the game and we don't make it. But
that's not what cost us the game. We didn't play well enough to overcome
everything we needed to overcome today.  
  
Q. Because of so many factors and the way the ball is just not bouncing your
way and all the types of things that just didn't seem to go in your favor, how
exactly can you learn from a loss, as Garrett was saying?  
COACH MARSHALL: How can you learn from a loss? Well, you let it sit in the pit
of your stomach until it makes you violently ill. Then you expel that feeling
and then you go back to work. That's all you can do. We're not playing
tomorrow.

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Creighton  99  
Evansville  71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach McDermott, an opening statement, please.  
COACH McDERMOTT: I couldn't be more proud of our team. Evansville has given us
fits in both games this year. They really probably should have beaten us
twice. We made a few changes overnight that we basically instituted without a
walk through. We just decided to do mental preparation.  
I thought those guys executed those well. We put a little bit more pressure on
the basketball. They were a little more aggressive with our help. And we gave
up a few easy ones as a result of that. We just thought we made life more
difficult for Colt Ryan and Denver Holmes than we did the last time we played
them.  
Offensively, the basketball moved for us. When we moved the basketball and got
Gregory playing at the high level he was playing, they committed a lot of help
to Doug, and when you do that, there are other things open. Our guards,
Antoine in particular in Austin only gets 13 assists and two turnovers between
them.  
They did a good job of finding what was open and delivering the ball, and our
shooters stepped up and made good shots.  
  
Q. Antoine, watching Wichita State get on right before you guys, did that
put you guys on alert, the fact that you had the ranking coming in that you
could lose to anybody?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: No, it's been like that all year. We lost three straight in
conference play. It wasn't anything shocking. It was describing coming to play
every night, and it wasn't a shock.  
  
Q. Gregory how proud are you up of this team and the way they played today
to get to the championship tomorrow?  
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: I'm very happy. We played hard, and I know yesterday's game
was a little close. Today we dominated the game. And I think that helped us
use confidence, and tomorrow's game is huge. I mean, we didn't get a chance to
win the regular conference season, and we had some, like Antoine said, we've
lost some games before. Tomorrow we have an opportunity, and we're going with
great momentum. Today's win means a lot to us.  
  
Q. Gregory, you almost had as many rebounds as Evansville's entire team.
They had 10, had you 17. How did it feel to dominate the glass like that?  
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: It feels good. I was chasing them. Even though they're an
undersized team, they play hard and try to box you out. Serves trying to go
around them. I know sometimes since they shot pretty good, and the they took
some fouls on me. But I tried to chase the ball, play hard, and it worked out.  
I feel like when I have good rebounding games, it definitely helps me and gets
my offense going.  
  
Q. Earlier in the game yesterday Coach got you motivated and had you to sit
down for a little while. Today you didn't seem to have that issue. What was
your mental outlook coming into the game today?  
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: It's true, yeah, yesterday that happened. When I came back,
I think I played a little better. Honestly, I always try to come out with the
same mindset. I try to play hard, and I know sometimes it doesn't always work
out like that. But, I mean, today I was just focused and paying a lot of
attention to film, and it happened.  
  
Q. Antoine, this is a two ‑parter. You guys shot 60% from the floor today.
Was it one of these days where you guys were in the zone? Did it even matter
who you guys were playing?   
ANTOINE YOUNG: When we space people out like that, I mean, Austin was driving
and trying to spring it out to our shooters. Our shooters are shooters. They
got going today and knocked some shots down, and when that happens, we're a
tough team to beat.  
  
Q. When the starters are on the sideline late in the game and you got more
than 90 points, was there some excitement like, hey, let's get 10?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: A lot of excitement. It was just nice to see us get a margin
win. It's been neck to neck all the way down. Also, Coach gave us some rest,
so not being on the floor as long helped out a lot.  
  
Q. Gregory, playing against a team that's that much smaller, do you feel
that's the type of game you should be able to dominate?  
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: Well, yeah, I feel like a lot of people put pressure on me
when it's an undersized team. But obviously, Evansville, they know what's on
their side, and they work for it. They're really quick, so they make up for
it. So it's not as easy as people think.  
But like I said, I keep on playing, playing smart, trying to use my body, and
today I was able to do that. I was glad it worked out for me.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about tomorrow's championship match ‑up, and I
guess, is any part of you kind of sad that the team's going to be in red and
white instead of black and gold?   
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: Well, yeah, we play Illinois State already twice. They're
very streaky. They can be a dangerous team, and they showed that today. But I
mean, I feel like we match-up well, and we'll be ready for that. Obviously, we
all kind of wanted another shot at Wichita, but that's not going to change our
mindset.  
I mean, we came here to win this. It doesn't matter who we play in the final.
Our mindset is going to be the same. We need to be focused and ready to win
this.  
ANTOINE YOUNG: Like Greg just said, obviously, yeah, I think anyone on our
team would want Wichita in the finals. That would have been nice. But it is
what it is. It's an opportunity to go out and prove ourselves, an opportunity
to go play for a championship game, and just another opportunity to play
together.  
  
Q. Antoine, was there anything earlier in that game that you could sense
maybe this team had a little sharpness that it's been lacking over the last
four weeks?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I don't know if more sharpness, but I thought we had a good
feel on offense, and on the defensive end is where we started. I felt like we
came out pretty well. Probably the best all season. Offensively we were moving
the ball, reading things a lot better than we have been, so when that's
happening. It's a great feeling for us, and it makes our coach feel pretty
good too.  
  
Q. You guys all played well today. It was a great game. But you got some
really good performances out of Artino and a couple of other players as well.
Joe shot terrific from three. He had four threes in a row straight. Could you
talk about your teammates who played well, and what State's going to have to
do to deal with them?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I said it all year, our bench, I think is dangerous. We have a
really good bench. They're all talented. Josh is capable of making shots.
Ethan's capable of making shots. Will's capable of doing damage like he did
tonight. So I don't think it's anything new. They're capable of doing that in
any game. If we can tax them like we did today and find our shooters and
they're shooting as well, it will be a tough match‑up for them. But it's going
to be a really good game. It's going to be a tough one.  
GREGORY ECHENIQUE: I feel the good thing about our team is we do have a good
bench. A lot of the things we play, like today, I think it didn't sub much.
Will's playing well, and that helps because I can get a little more rest on
the bench. He's doing his job, and that's great. I believe in him.  
Obviously, Josh gave us a great win today, and that's the things that make our
team better. If our bench can help us, that's great. I hope we can come out
tomorrow with the same intensity.  
  
Q. Antoine, what do you feel makes Illinois State a dangerous team?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: They can spread you out. They can spread you out. They're very
athletic. They can drive the ball. They're a talented team, and you have a
great guy like Jackie Carmichael in the middle. Whenever you can spread people
out and drive in and make plays, you're a dangerous team. So we're going to
sit down and guard the dribble, I think that will be the big key of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you were able to rest your starters quite a bit today. Was your
mindset as the game progressed and the lead built that that could help for
tomorrow?  
COACH McDERMOTT: You know, you don't go into a game thinking that, but as the
game wore on and we were able to keep that 20 to 25‑point lead inside of 9:00
minutes, we started to rest them then and we just kind of played it by ear. If
we could maintain that, it didn't feel like it was going to get out of hand or
they were going to get back in it, we were going to keep those guys over
there. So it worked out great.  
We got a win, and we didn't play guys ‑‑ 27 minutes for Gibbs was the most,
and he only played 14 or 15 yesterday. So I always believe in a tournament
like this. You get to the third day, and you're running on fumes then the
adrenaline kicks in and you forget if you're tired.  
So nobody will be tired on that floor tomorrow. I promise you that. Both teams
will give it their all.  
  
Q. Greg, your guys touched on your depth a little bit. All but one of your
players scored tonight. But even at halftime you had nine guys who had already
scored at halftime. Can you just talk about the depth that you have?  
COACH McDERMOTT: Our plan was to go to the bench early and go to the bench
often because of the tournament format. We felt we had a little more depth and
we could keep fresh guys on Colt Ryan and Denver Holmes when they don't have
another Colt Ryan and Denver Holmes coming off the bench to do what those guys
can do.  
We wanted to keep fresh bodies on them as much as we could. We played Taylor
and played the point guards half and half, so we could keep a fresh body on
there. I think that obviously helped us. We wore into them as the game went
on.  
It's going to be important. Any time you're going to come down here and have
an opportunity to win four games, you have to have your people step up and
more than your main starters and guys that scored for you all year long. We
win a game by almost 30 points and Doug only takes four shots.  
We've got other guys that can score. We'll need them again tomorrow.  
  
Q. I guess from your vantage point, what did you see that was different
about today than maybe the last four weeks?  
COACH McDERMOTT: It's amazing what happens when shots go in. We started 21‑2
and had more games like this than we had when we didn't shoot it well. And we
have the ability to do that. It's who we are. We're not blessed with a bunch
of guys that are great slashers and great off the dribble. But we've got solid
post play. We've got very solid point guard play. And our wings just do their
job. They do what they do and they don't try to do too much.  
What we need some of them to do is not get shots when they're going to commit
that much help, the dribble penetration by Antoine or the post‑ups by Greg and
Doug. When Greg was as aggressive as he was tonight, we're a very difficult
team to guard.  
  
Q. Can you expand on the changes you made? I wonder, you started some games
slow the last couple weeks. I was wondering if you were trying to maybe get
that jump started a little bit?  
COACH McDERMOTT: I don't think the pressure had anything to do with jump
starting our team. It's just what we attempted to do against Evansville at our
place wasn't as effective as we thought.  
Sometimes you go into a game and put together a game plan and it works great.
Sometimes the game is over and you ask yourself, what the heck was I thinking?
Against Evansville at our place, I asked myself what the heck was I thinking?
So we made some changes and guarded them a little different either team, and
short‑cutted a few more screens and put a little more pressure on the guy with
the basketball.  
So his vision to make us pay for mistakes we made wasn't as great. Like I said
earlier, we gave up a few easy baskets, but I understood going in that that
was going to happen to take away some of the things we were trying to take
away from Holmes and Ryan.  
  
Q. Yourself and your players have talked about the strengths of Indiana
State or Illinois State, rather. Illinois State did just pull off an upset. Do
you have a message for the fans of Creighton at all to talk about the
strengths that your team has against that match ‑up and the reason why they
should breathe easy knowing that you guys are a good team? What are the
positives going into tomorrow's games?   
COACH McDERMOTT: I don't think anybody's breathing easy. I mean, our players,
our fans, and I don't want them to. Illinois State won their way to the
championship game just like we did. We had to win some good basketball teams
just like you did.  
Coach got them playing the best basketball at the right time, and we're going
to see a fired up Illinois State team tomorrow, and throw out what's happened
the last two games we played them. It makes absolutely no difference. We'll
need to play great basketball tomorrow if we expect to win this championship.  
  
Q. As has been touched on, you'll be playing a team tomorrow that's playing
for a trip to the NCAA Tournament, whereas you're playing for a seed. From
your perspective over your career, how often have you had a team in that
position, and how does that factor into a game when you can look at some kids
and tell them we're 40 minutes away from either going to the NCAA Tournament
or not?  
COACH McDERMOTT: To answer the first part of your question, how many times
have I played in a championship game where I knew I was in the NCAA
Tournament?  
  
Q. No, on the other side where you don't know?  
COACH McDERMOTT: Zero.  
  
Q. I got you.  
COACH McDERMOTT: We won one championship at Northern Iowa. Our first ever
three NCAA Tournament runs that we had there, and the first one was a
conference championship in St. Louis. So you're playing for your lives when
you're in that situation.  
As a coach and as a player, you work your whole career for an opportunity to
go to the NCAA Tournament. But at the same time as a coach and a player, you
only have so many chances to win a championship, whether it's a regular season
conference championship which we came up short on, or a tournament
championship which is in front of us now tomorrow.  
I don't think the fact that there's maybe more of a desperation mode for
Illinois State because we feel pretty comfortable that we're going to get into
the NCAA Tournament, I don't think that plays a factor in the game at all.  
  
Q. You will not throw the game to get the Missouri Valley three bids into
the tournament?  
COACH McDERMOTT: There is probably no chance of that.  
  
Q. You shared a message and a laugh with Derek before he shot those last two
free throws. What did you tell him?  
COACH McDERMOTT: I said there is no pressure. We've just got a chance to score
a hundred in a conference tournament game. I thought he'd miss the first one,
but he stepped up and made the first one.  
Those guys are great, Derek, and Taylor, Matt. Ross wasn't in uniform. Those
guys are rotating who is on the bench. They've meant so much to this
basketball team. I can't State enough the value that they've had as leaders
for our team. Their example and their mentoring of our younger players goes
beyond what you usually see with a guy that's a walk‑on.  
They're walk‑on in name only. Other than that, they're as valuable to this
team as anybody that wears that uniform.  
  
Q. You dominated on the boards today 43 ‑17\. Could you elaborate on that
and talk more about the game that Gregory had today?   
COACH McDERMOTT: I didn't like our rebounding yesterday. I didn't think we
were as aggressive going to get the basketball. Today people were ducking out
of Gregory's way when he went to get the ball.  
He was aggressive. He wanted the basketball. His teammates threw it to him.
They trusted him. He made good catches in traffic. He ran the floor.
Defensively he was outstanding. This may have been as complete of a game as
he's played in a Creighton uniform.

### [Jackie Carmichael](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23226)

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  65  
Wichita State  64

  
THE MODERATOR: The Illinois State Redbirds are with us. Coach, an opening
statement, please?  
COACH JANKOVICH: My brief statement is I could not possibly be more proud of
this basketball team. You talk about being in a bad, bad situation, things
going wrong. We lost Jordan. Obviously we need Jordan badly to play in this
game. Jackie gets a couple fouls early. So now we're out Jordan, we're out
Jackie, and Frenchy gets ejected from the game, so now we're only down three
big guys for long stretches against their front line. For that, basically,
just not to matter to our guys, I think is just incredible.  
It was one of the toughest, hardest‑fought performances of any team I've ever
been around.  
  
Q. Tyler, I know you seemed a little nervous your first game of the
tournament yesterday in the first half, but you hit your first few shots and
gave you confidence. What were you seeing that was giving you the opportunity
to do that? Was it just a confidence factor and hitting those first couple of
shots?  
TYLER BROWN: I don't feel I was nervous the first game. I just feel my jump
shots weren't falling, so I just tried to attack to the rim. You know, we came
out in the game more aggressive, more physical, ready to basically just put up
a fight that we didn't put up against them the previous two games.  
I just feel we came out this game ready to fight.  
  
Q. Jackie, you obviously came out in the first half with two fouls and came
in and got your third foul in the first minute of the second half. Did that
affect how you had to play now that had you three fouls and practically a
whole have to go?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: Not really. We were focused on going into the second half,
and we were a man down. I didn't have a choice, I had to play physical. So I
mean, this really wasn't an option not to play physical and just kind of back
off. So it worked out. We had a couple that could have gone either way, but
for the most part just tried to play physical until the final seconds.  
  
Q. Tyler, what was the feeling like when that final buzzer sounded?  
TYLER BROWN: It was crazy. I've never felt something like that before. Even
though we have another game to win, I felt like it was crazy for me. I've
never been a part of something this big, something that means so much to a lot
of people. Our fans were here. It means a lot to them, the players, the
coaches and the people watching at home. So it was a great feeling.  
  
Q. Tyler, could you kind of tell us what your mindset was when you're
sitting there at that free ‑throw line? You make the first one, then you guys
call timeout. You're kind of standing there with four Wichita State guys
around you. What is rolling through your mind at that point?   
TYLER BROWN: Just block out everything. It's just me and the rim, and do my
normal routine. In the middle of the season I felt like my free throws were a
little shaky as soon as that went down, so I've been in the gym practicing
those, and I felt like that paid off.  
  
Q. Kind of the obvious question is how do you guys after such an emotional
win today not have a big letdown in tomorrow's championship game?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: Yeah, I think we'll use this as momentum. It's not the
culture of our team to have this big of a letdown we've worked our tails off
to get to this point, and I feel like we're going to keep on working through
tomorrow?  
  
Q. Jackie, given your entire roster has not one senior on it, and obviously
this is still a work in progress, what kind of a statement did this game make
to yourselves as well as other people that follow the Valley and college
basketball in general?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: I don't know. Age doesn't matter, but just the fact that we
can really fight. We really put in a lot of hard work to get to this point.  
  
Q. Tyler, can you assess your first trip to Arch Madness? What was that
like, especially the way things went down today?  
TYLER BROWN: Like I said before, it's been fun. It's been crazy. The
atmosphere, I've never been part of something like this, this big and this
much meaning to it, this much preparation. We've been preparing for this for a
while now, so much time that we put into it to get prepared.  
We're going to go back to the hotel and prepare for the next game like we do
any other game and just get ready for the next one.  
  
Q. Jackie, good defense today. What was working well that gave WSU some
problems?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: Just kind of big men‑wise. We were just trying to push
Garrett off the lane. He's a great player, but we tried to limit his touches.
Our team did a great job. The guards did a great job of diving down there.
Really just our all‑around defensive effort.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about, obviously, maybe not a lot of people gave you
guys a chance to win this game. Could you guys talk about what you talk about
at the hotel and coming into this game? Kind of your mindset for both of the
players?  
TYLER BROWN: My mindset and the whole team's was that we could win this game.
Most people probably turned their TVs off, whatever, after we were down by ten
thinking they were going to win. But we're not that type of team. We've got a
lot of guys that fight to win. We may be young whatever people say, that
doesn't matter. We're a strong team. We came together and we got closer. We
fought for each other for this one.  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: The mindset coming in was we could win this game. We never
counted ourselves out, and like Tyler said, I think a lot of people turned
their TVs off at halftime and flipped to another game or something like that.
Like I said, this team, we're going to fight and keep scratching around. It's
not in our nature to give up at all. We'll just keep doing that and take care
of the momentum into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed you guys were having so much fun out there. Was there a
sense of a happy ‑go‑lucky, loose feeling?   
COACH JANKOVICH: Well, I hope. You're scaring me because when they become
seniors, I hope it's not that they stop having fun. They're fun guys. They're
a fun group. I've said that from back when we went to Canada. I love coaching
this team. They're fun guys. They're good guys. They really want to get
better. They want to be a team. They're not selfish. They're high energy.
That's the way they are. That's the way they compete.  
We've got a few guys with maybe a little extra personalities that just love
competition. So I think that's what you're seeing. I don't think it's the age.
I hope next year when some of them are older, they'll look the same and more
enthusiastic.  
For me, they're just a fun, fun group. Coaching is a lot of fun when you
really love your team. You look forward to going to practice every day. I can
promise you not every year for every coach is that way around the country. But
this has been one of those years for me where I look forward to seeing them
every day.  
We had a great culture from day one that we were going to be a great practice
team. Rarely ever had a poor practice. Maybe not everyone was great. But just
that mindset over the course of four or five months is very difficult. So I
think that speaks to their competitive nature. Also they like to compete. They
like to get after it.  
  
Q. How important was the tone that John Wilkins set? Obviously you don't
want a guy to get ejected, but it seemed he had a different level of intensity
and fight in him today that maybe we haven't seen before?  
COACH JANKOVICH: He sure did. I wasn't really hoping that he would get ejected
given our situation. When they told me that I was a little bit in disbelief
that now we're going to be down two.  
But I think it always comes out. I've said this so many times. But for a big
guy, the number of rebounds you get tells a big story. It tells the story of
how much grit and how much fight was in you that night. How active you were
and how important it was. If I'm reading this right, he got eight rebounds in
24 minutes. My recommendation to him was to start talking in French so that
way no one will know what he's saying. I don't think you can eject a guy for
something in French. He's just speaking the wrong language, as far as I'm
concerned.  
  
Q. What does a win like this one today mean to you as a head coach?  
COACH JANKOVICH: I don't know yet. I don't know all of that. I can tell what
you it means. What I was feeling and still am is very emotional. Not about the
ramifications of the future or whatever, but just emotional and lucky to have
a job like this.  
We work so hard. All the coaches work so hard, and the players work so hard.
There is such a mountain and so much competition. When you see your group go
to a level that maybe they didn't know they have and become just different and
become tougher men and all that, it makes you a little emotional. That is
probably one of the most gratifying things. Not just what this means in the
future, but just to sit there and watch what was going on today with an
unbelievable amount of adversity on our end of the floor, I mean, good gosh.  
You couldn't have anymore we had by the end of the game. So for them to fight
through that, that's how I feel. It makes me emotional.  
  
Q. Since you've been at Illinois State, is this the biggest win for the
program thus far?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, I guess because of the ranking, I guess because of
that. But we've had some pretty good ones. But always in the moment, it feels
like it too. I would have said that on several other games, for sure.  
But right now, sitting here with all the feelings, and all the emotion I just
felt, it's hard to say if it's not, it's darn close.  
  
Q. You weren't shy yesterday about saying how big of an upset this would
have been for you guys to win. Now that you've pulled it off and you're one
game away from a tournament, how big an upset is this?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Not that big, but of course it was. They're ranked 15th or
whatever they're ranked. But if you look at it, I think I said this, and
ironically it took us a while to become‑‑ I say a neutral floor‑‑ but a road
team. We played our best road game of the year at their place. It was a
1‑point game with a minute to go, which just shocks me. And then at our place
we didn't play very well.  
We had 3:00 to go, and it's 8 or 9 points. We got an open 3 to cut it. For
some reason we've played them well even when we didn't play well the last
game. Played poorly, and played them fairly close.  
We all thought we had a chance. But we also knew realistically we were going
to have to play tremendous. I never, ever thought we could shoot 33% and beat
this team ever. I guess that's why I'm feeling emotional. But yesterday we
held a team to 26%, and today we held a team ranked 15th to 33%.  
I don't care how you slice it, but that is nothing but grit and toughness, and
all the things that are most dear to a coach. That's why I feel like I do, not
because we hit 10 of 11 threes or something and had a hot night. Now I wish we
would do that tomorrow. I think we're due like nobody else to start shooting
the ball. But I tried to teach these guys from day one it's all about winning
games when you don't shoot well. To do it against this team is magnified to
the hundredth power.  
  
Q. You were talking with this grit and toughness. Can you pinpoint a part of
this season, a stretch in this season where your team really embraced that
especially on the defensive end? Because that's obviously why you're winning
games when you're still shooting #33%.  
COACH JANKOVICH: Not for sure. I think it's a lot of lessons learned with guys
that had no lessons. Half of our guys that played had no lessons. So even
though you tell them, like us all, we have to have it happen to us before we
say, yeah, I should have listened to him.  
So I think it was a gradual process of learning hard lessons. We got better
and we'd play some stretches. I'd turn a film on of a road game, and gosh, 20
great minutes of defense, and 10 decent, and 10 minutes of mistakes. Just lack
of concentration and all those kind of things, standing up, ball watching, you
name it.  
So I could see it coming, but it wasn't there. I just think it's been a
process. We knew that at the beginning of the year we felt like we would be
playing our best basketball here at the end. I believed in these guys. I told
them even when we were struggling at times, I said, I think this is a heck of
a team, but we're not there yet. We've got to grow. We've got to grow up and
understand what it takes a little bit better.  
  
Q. I remember Wichita State getting run outs and fast breaks. How important
was that to keep them from that today?  
COACH JANKOVICH: I told them they would not eat if they didn't get back on
defense. So the food was a great motivator for our guys. That was a big
emphasis was defensive transition, the other was rebounding. I think we got
outrebounded 6, but we were plus 6 in turnovers, so we neutralize how many
shots you get to take. I thought with them rebounding was such a strength.  
But we rebounded pretty well. I thought we fought hard on the boards, but we
did make a huge emphasis to get back and not ball watch. The shot goes up.
It's something we talk about all the time, the activity, and what are you
doing when the ball's in the air? The ball's in the air 3 seconds. Lot of
times guys stand there and watch it. It gets rebounded, and you can't. You've
got to be in motion when the ball is shot, and I thought we did a pretty good
job of that.  
  
Q. You guys went over 12 minutes in the first half without a basket. To be
only down by 8 points at that stage, had you to be feeling pretty good at
halftime?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Great, great. Jackie's out. You know, we're kind of on fumes.
We've got nothing working. We started to force. We panicked a little bit,
which was the last thing we needed to do, but only because of defense and
rebounding. I felt tremendous to be down eight at the half, and I told our
guys that.  
To play without Jackie, to play when shots aren't going and when we panicked a
little bit and forced out on our three or four shots down the stretch. I would
have taken eight any day of the week.  
I've seen Wichita enough on film to know their style of play, it ebbs and
flows. They can get really hot. But even in the Indiana State game there were
some big swings back and forth. So I knew that could happen as long as we
could dig in and as long as we could get some offense.  
We really just opened some things up. We free flowed pretty good and guys
started making plays. All of a sudden, we got them on their heels and you
could feel when it starts taking place. It's a great feeling when they're on
our side and you get the defense on their heels, and that's what took place.  
  
Q. Can you run us through your emotions and those last six seconds with
Tyler on the free ‑throw line and them getting two shots to win?   
COACH JANKOVICH: I don't know about the emotions, but it was a lot to think
about. It was a lot to think about right there. How do you want to play this
situation? You know, there are a lot of choices. Do you want to sub and 2‑2‑1
press and try to make it hard to get it pass, knowing they'll throw it to
someone and shoot it? If they drive by on a foul, do you go back and switch or
not switch and zone or whatever? It's not emotional at that point. It's just
the thoughts racing through your head and trying to pick the scenario that you
like the best. So that's what was going through my head.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Doug McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21790)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Antoine Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23229)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Creighton  68  
Drake  61

  
THE MODERATOR: The Bluejays are with us. Coach McDermott will start off with a
statement on the game.  
COACH McDERMOTT: I thought Drake really played their tails off considering
they were here until 11:30 or midnight, whenever they got out of here last
night. They really threw that first punch to start the game. Our goal going
into the game was for us to do that. To try to really be aggressive early and
see if we get them back on their heels and get them thinking about how tired
they should have been.  
To their credit, they knocked down shots early. We weren't very efficient
early. But the start of the second half was the difference in the game. We
defended better, then found some touches for Doug inside. On a night we didn't
shoot it particularly well, we still found a way to win.  
Antoine was outstanding. I thought he controlled the game with his decisions.
When to shoot, when to pass. So we really rode these two up here pretty hard.  
  
Q. How huge was it for you guys that you didn't panic when you did get down
early?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: We've gotten off to some starts like that this year. We have a
bunch of confidence in each other. We didn't get off to the best start, and
they were shooting lights out. We couldn't get anything to fall. We turned it
over a couple times, but we just had to keep our cool out there and Sticks
together, and we knew good things would happen.  
ANTOINE YOUNG: Like Doug said, we've been in situations like that all year.
We've been in tough situations, so we just stayed together and stayed the
course and got it done.  
  
Q. Doug, you guys are Creighton, so of course you're going to have a big
crowd every year. How much of a help was that that you got down early and came
back and they were really into it?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, we've got some of the best fans. We're the furthest
place from St. Louis in the conference, and they've been with us all year. We
were into it after they threw that punch on us, so it was great to have them
there.  
  
Q. Antoine, you know though the team at times did struggle with shooting
percentage. Up until the end of the game there you were shooting 6 for 6 at
one point and shooting very well. What were your thoughts as you were able to
get those shots going? Was there a particular thing that kept you focused and
on point?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I don't think it was anything in particular. I just kind of was
in the role this year, and the way I play is as if things are getting a little
stagnant and tough, I'll be a little more aggressive. So I kind of just feel
the game out and see how it goes. We were a little stagnant, so it was time to
be a little more aggressive.  
  
Q. This, again, is for both student ‑athletes. What were your thoughts when
they got the score at 63‑60 right there in the last minute or so? What did you
tell each other?   
DOUG McDERMOTT: Again, just like they did to start the game coming in on that
run, we just stuck together. We had a couple of stupid plays there. Couple of
careless‑‑ we were careless with the ball there on a couple of possessions. We
just stayed with each other. I think we knew we were going to win that game
the whole time.  
ANTOINE YOUNG: Yeah, we've always been in and out of adversity this year. I
think we just kind of calmed down. I knew they were going to make a run. I
knew it wasn't over with three minutes to go. I knew they were going to make a
run. So we just stayed together and toughed it out and got it through.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned the defense at the start of the second half. What did you
guys talk about at halftime, and what did you get executed there to start the
second half on defense?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: Obviously, we knew we had to guard a little better. We started
off the game a little bad. So we came out and flew around a little more than
we were in the first half. Our talk was a lot better on the defensive end, and
I think we got some stops done.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, that was the difference in the game. I think they scored
four of their first 18 or 19 possessions there to start the second half. That
was the difference in the game. I think we let our defense kind of carry it
over to our offense. We were getting good shots and kind of letting that take
care of itself. So it was good to get off to a start like that defensively.  
  
Q. Antoine, is there such a thing as defensive momentum? If so, is this a
good way to get things started here?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: There is a huge sense of defensive momentum. If you get a stop
one time, you feel more comfortable about the next possession down. I think
we've got to take possession one at a time on both ends of the floor. If we do
that, things will turn out well for us.  
  
Q. You guys both played well today. This question is for both of you. Going
into this next game, you're going to be playing the winner of Missouri State
or Evansville. Two questions: Do you have a message for any of the players
playing on that team? What is your message for your fans as you go in? As
you're the favorite, do you feel the pressure is more on you and more on your
opponent?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I think that first game here, we had a whole week off. We've
been waiting here for two days to play. So we got off to a slow start there,
but I think tomorrow we'll be ready to go, and I think our fans are going to
be the same as they were today, hopefully even more excited. It should be
good.  
Evansville and Missouri State are both really good teams and really guard you,
pack it in defensively. So we know it's going to be a big challenge for us,
but we've got to continue to do what we do.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: I think our message is we should play hard. Our fans are
great. I think they admire when we play hard, and if we do that, I think
things should work out.  
  
Q. It looked like the one thing you didn't want to do is let Rice and Simons
get going. Was the plan to kind of let the other guys have their shots and
concentrate on them?  
ANTOINE YOUNG: I don't know if we were just going to give other guys shots,
but we were definitely concentrating on those two. I thought we did a good job
on them chasing Simons and trying to keep Rice out of the lane. Some of the
other players stepped up to make plays, but they're pretty good players, too.
So it took a good defensive stance to stop all of them.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Both of those guys were good all year. Clarke got a bunch of
offensive rebounds, and Jeffers was hitting threes early. So we had to adjust
to that. Once he hit a couple, we had to adjust to that. I thought we did a
better job of that in the second half.  
  
Q. Doug, winning a game like this where you had to come back and be
physical, what does it do for you guys and your confidence moving forward?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: It's huge for our confidence. I think we've been in this
situation our last three games to end the regular season. So, I mean, it's
just going to keep building our confidence going into tomorrow where we play
two really good teams, so we've just got to be ready.  
  
Q. Doug, it seemed like you got going in the second half. Did you take it
upon yourself to maybe up the game a little bit and get this thing going on
your shoulders in the second half?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, absolutely. I kind of struggled there a little in the
first half, and I knew I had to get myself going and let the game come to me.
That is something I did a good job of. My teammates did a good job of finding
me on those pick and pops. So that got me going and got my confidence built
throughout the whole half.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about your defense early in the second half; but at the
end of the game, they missed six shots in the last minute. Can you talk about
getting the stops at the end of the game as they were trying to come back?  
COACH McDERMOTT: We've put a couple different lineups out there. We were
awfully small there for a while. We were really forced into that, because
should they score, we felt we needed that lineup on the floor for the press
break. And losing Grant Gibbs in that situation is really devastating to us.
He's our best inbounder and is going to make the best decisions in those
situations.  
I thought we flew around a little bit, switched some screens, and we were able
to get out on shooters and make them take contested shots. We got some big
defensive rebounds when we needed them as well.  
  
Q. It seemed early in the first half you pulled out Echenique and pulled him
aside and talked to him. Anything specific you said? Because it seemed he came
back out after that and really got back on track?  
COACH McDERMOTT: I was just trying to light his fire a little bit. I thought
he was back on his heels to start the game. To Gregory's credit, he corrected
it. Also give the guys on the bench credit. When I took him out and we went
with Ethan and Will that's when we got back in the game.  
For whatever reason, Gregory wasn't as active to start the game as he usually
is, and it was good for us that he got it fixed, because he made some great
defensive plays around the basket for us.  
  
Q. Yeah, Coach, I noticed looking at the stat line and watching the game
that you guys were able to keep Drake from only scoring one three ‑pointer the
entire game. Was there a certain thing you guys did to be able to protect the
arc so well?   
COACH McDERMOTT: Well, we weren't going to leave Simons on dribble
penetration. We did early, and the guy that did came and sat by me and had a
discussion with me about it. Ben's one of the best shooters in the league, and
if you let him get started, it's really hard to stop him. There are a couple
of guys that were willing to give up the three‑point shot, being off them a
little bit to guard the dribble a little better. Part of it is let's face it,
they had some open looks, we missed them.  
They had some open looks, we missed them. They're tired from last night. We're
playing in the first game of the tournament for us. I think anxiety and nerves
get to you a little bit. Both teams missed some open shots.  
  
Q. Coach it looked like Gregory injured himself. Did he roll his ankle?  
COACH McDERMOTT: I'm not sure. He was icing something in the locker room, and
we'll get that evaluated tonight, and hopefully he's okay by tomorrow.  
  
Q. What did you focus on at halftime as far as the defensive things you were
trying to get across?  
COACH McDERMOTT: We weren't quite as aggressive as we wanted to be with our
ball screen defense, trying to get them to go up the floor. And our recovery
out of that aggressive show on the ball screen was a little bit slow, and it
was forcing our help to go a little too long, giving up some perimeter shots
as a result of that. We got into the point guard a little bit more, and we
thought we felt Drake was getting a little fatigued, so we wanted to keep the
tempo going.  
But we sat on Rice's right‑hand. I thought we did a good job of that. The guys
that guarded him did a good job of that. But defensively, as Antoine said, I
thought we competed a little harder the second half than we did the first.  
  
Q. I wanted to wait until Doug left to ask this question. I know you have
his mind on this tournament and going forward the rest of the season. But to
ask yourself as a coaching father, have you ever conversations about this
being his last year in college, and will he be pursuing the next level of
things because he's had so much success?  
COACH McDERMOTT: No, we haven't had any conversations. And when we do, I'm
probably not telling you guys.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  72  
Indiana State - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Wichita State, please.  
COACH MARSHALL: I was very pleased with the effort today. I thought we started
out great. Just a little low on the last play of the half, and then the first
couple minutes of the second half they came out, and Indiana State played
really well aggressively and we didn't score.  
After that, we were able to get it back to 20. When you can beat a team that
good by 20 points in a setting like this, you have to be pleased. So excited
to move on.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defensive pressure particularly in the first 20
minutes of this game? It was as stifling as I've seen, and I've seen a lot of
basketball from you guys this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Joe, then Toure'.  
JOE RAGLAND: We knew they were a solid team. Offensively they could really
create and score. Especially with Jake Odum as their general. So we just tried
to put a lot of pressure and clog up everything in the paint and close out the
shooters. We did a real good job of that the first 20 minutes.  
TOURE' MURRY: The thing we learned was they got to the rim too easy last year.
We watched film a lot on this team. Today we just clogged the lane and made
Jake Odum pass the ball and not get in his sweet spot. I think we did a good
job today.  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: I was on Jake Odum most of the night. I knew he was the
head of the team, and I wanted to go out there and make it as hard as possible
and make it not easy for him to create plays and his teammates and stuff like
that.  
  
Q. Demetric, talk about Toure' referred to the sweet spots that Jake Odum
has. What sweet spots did you try to take away? How did you take away his
game?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: He likes to stretch the D in transition, and get in the
paint. He likes to jump in the air and pass. He does a very good job at that
and his shooters. We knew coming into the game that he likes to do that. We
just wanted to get our hands up and deflect the pass and make it hard for him.  
  
Q. Toure', how much was last year's game ‑‑ because you mentioned it‑‑ on
your guys' mind heading into today's game?   
TOURE' MURRY: It was definitely on our mind. It was one of the top thoughts in
our mind. You know, Indiana State, the defending champion, to get to the
championship, we've got to defeat the defending champion, and I thought we did
a good job today. Coming out with intensity and defensively, I felt like the
first one was to the floor. That was going to help us win, and I just tried to
do that.  
  
Q. Toure', do you believe this was a statement game to show the nation how
good you guys are?  
TOURE' MURRY: Not necessarily, no. Every game we step out there we're trying
to make a statement just for ourselves and for our fans. The whole Wichita
team. We play for one another. We try to play as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Joe, during the second half when you had that stretch, they went on a 9
‑0 run to open the half, what did you do to regroup?   
JOE RAGLAND: Had to make the shot. Once we made the shot everything opened up.
Got a couple stops and got a couple transition lay‑ups. That's the reason why
we were so successful from the beginning. They were just bringing it to the
chest like Demetric told us, and we had to stand up and not back down. That's
what we did toward the latter half of the second half.  
  
Q. Joe, getting snubbed last year from the NCAA Tournament, how much did
that hurt and impact you guys as motivation heading into this season?  
JOE RAGLAND: It was definitely motivation, especially for the seniors.
Especially for Toure' Murry, Garrett Stutz and David Kyles, guys that have
been in this program for four years, and myself. Last year I felt we had a
great team to get in the tournament. That was last year. We didn't get in, so
this year was our motivation, and that's why we work so hard.  
  
Q. I'm assuming with this year's tournament you're not willing to let
anything to chance by putting things in the tournament committee's hands?  
JOE RAGLAND: Not at all. But we're not thinking about the NCAA Tournament
right now. We're just thinking about the Missouri Valley tournament and trying
to do as well as we can in this. It's kind of the same atmosphere, one game do
or die. We just want to be successful in this and allow this to propel us in
that.  
  
Q. Joe, sometimes when the cameras are on they zoom in and go into your
face. You've been deploying a let's go, amped up kind of scowl that would make
Kobe jealous these days. I wondered if you have an intensity level that's
picked up for this tournament? Both at practice yesterday and today, it seemed
you may be stepping it up to a new level. Is that true?  
JOE RAGLAND: No, I think that's who I am. We have a lot of leaders on this
team. Stutz is our speaker leader. He gives great speeches and makes sure
everybody is doing their job. I feel like I'm the emotional leader. Toure'
Murry leads in a different way. We have a lot of great leaders on this team,
and that's just my way of leading this team.  
  
Q. Demetric, Toure' is getting in the lane and passing it out. How important
was that to this offense today?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: That's very important. We told Toure' that him getting in
the paint is something he's very, very good at. It helps out our team that he
gets us open shot asks does a very good job at it.  
  
Q. Joe, getting back into rhythm, it's been kind of a long week and you guys
have battled a lot of sickness internally on the team, being able to get back
out on the floor and get back on track so quickly, can you talk about how
important that was?  
JOE RAGLAND: That's definitely important. When you sit out for so long and
don't play games for almost a week that is the first thing that's on coaches'
minds. Because we don't want to start out lackadaisical. We did a good job of
bringing the energy from the tip off and just not saying, okay, we haven't
played on this court yet and they have. So let's feel it out first. No, we
just wanted to be aggressive and play hard from the tip off.  
  
Q. What is your plan for the rest of the day?  
TOURE' MURRY: We're going to watch Northern Iowa and Illinois State and just
learn what they did again. We played Illinois State not too long ago, and
we're just going to watch film a little bit later. That's about it.  
  
Q. Do you feel this was a little bit of a revenge game after you were
knocked out of last year's game?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: Yeah, coming into the game we knew last year that this was
the team that let us out and shut us out. We were just coming in the game
hungry. We just wanted to go out there and set an example from the jump, right
off the tip. Just get up and play good defense.  
JOE RAGLAND: Yeah, like I said earlier, Indiana State are defending
championship. Like I said, to get to State, we have to defeat the defending
championship. They're a very good team. Hopefully they'll be in the
postseason. We're moving on, and we're excited about that.  
TOURE' MURRY: I feel it was a revenge game because of the fact that they beat
us last year. They didn't just beat us. It wasn't like it came down to one
shot. They clogged our offense and they stifled us. So that was in our minds
all night. Watching the game against Southern Illinois, I kind of knew we were
going to play them again. So our mindset was on being strong, being tough, and
being ready to play in this big game.  
  
Q. Coaching a team like this that's playing at such a high level right now,
do you change anything when the team's so confident? Coaching confidence, can
you just talk about that a little bit?  
COACH MARSHALL: I love it when my teams play with that type of confidence. I
don't want it to be cocky. I don't want it to be demeaning or disrespectful or
unsporting like. But I love when they have a swagger about them, because any
athlete that plays at a high level talks about when they get in the zone and
they feel the next shot's going in. You don't want to play tentative or scared
or with reservation.  
So this team is playing like that right now. The key is for us to continue to
defend and play hard and smart. If we do that, the offensive end is really
flowing for us. I'm sure teams will try to do some different things. Indiana
State today tried a little 2‑2‑1 pressure, and back to man‑to‑man, back to
zone a couple times.  
But we've got veteran players playing at a high level, and they just figured
out I have nothing to do‑‑ one of the plays I was most proud of is the first
time they went to that today, it was in the first half. They went 2‑2‑1 back
to zone, and we ran the zone play. Joe just got us into something. The next
thing you know, I don't know what our break down was, but the clock was
running down and Murry drives left to right, and finds Joe Ragland cutting
back door behind the zone for the lay‑up at the end of the shot clock.  
So those guys are just doing that right now. That's because we've played a lot
of basketball. They're supremely confident, and supremely talented.  
  
Q. As good as you guys have been defensively this season, all season, was
the first 20 minutes as good as you've seen this group in a while?  
COACH MARSHALL: If we had not fouled them and not celebrated coming off the
court after scoring the last basket in the first half, we held them to three
baskets at that time. The way they were scoring was free throws. It was a very
good defensive effort. They started to get to the line on Ben fouling Mahurin
on the three at the top of the key. But I was very, very pleased with our
defensive intensity.  
Demetric Williams brings a lot to our team with his ability to guard guys like
Jake Odum. There are a lot of guys in our league that‑‑ well, there's not only
one Jake Odum, but there are a lot of guards that are head to the monster.  
You'll see Anthony James, and Nic Moore, and those type guys. You've got to
guard them. You have to shut them down. We have our own Joe Ragland.  
He does a good job. I thought he did a great job on Jake early on and didn't
let him get started.  
  
Q. In the first half there were several instances where the shockers were on
the floor diving for loose balls. Was that reassuring to see them playing with
desperation like they were the ones that had to win?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, again, we talked about if we played harder and smarter
and tougher than that team today, the way we're playing it's going to be hard
for us to come up short, and that was the tone. Don't leave it to chance. Play
harder, play smarter, be the first one on the floor for loose balls. Go for
rebounds with two hands. I thought Garrett Stutz really rebounded the ball big
today. He looked good. There were times where it was only him at the level the
ball was coming off the rim. He was going and getting it with two hands. Not
one time did they body him and try to knock it loose today. It was his ball.
He ignited some of those fast breaks with good outlets.  
  
Q. For the defense on Odum, there was also a lot of off ball confusion on
Indiana State's part. They had five turnovers in their first 11 possessions.
Can you talk about cutting off the head of the snake? Part of that is cutting
off a snake's options. Can you talk about the defense which was also good for
you today?  
COACH MARSHALL: We were trying to get in the gaps today. Murry mentioned that
last year they were able to get two deep of penetration, get to their sweet
spots. Today the guy on the ball as well as the guy defending the ball
screener were doing a very good job in our effort and our communication.  
But the other thing that was happening off the ball, in the gaps, on the weak
side, we were really flooding and making them make the extra pass and maybe
the extra and one.  
We were active. I think we had 18 deflections with like 7 or 8 minutes to go
in the first half. We keep that chart, and we were very ratty. That is a word
I like to use. Ratty. If we can be ratty defensively, that's going to help us
down the road.  
  
Q. You've talked a lot about the start so far. A lot of times in these games
we see the team that gets to play the night before. They have their feet wet,
they come out and get off to a fast start. How was it you were able to get out
there and stop all that momentum and use the experience you've had here with
the players before getting that start today?  
COACH MARSHALL: That is certainly a concern. They got their jitters out. I
thought they had their jitters early. Neither team played great early, and
they assumed command of the game midway through the first half. So they have
that advantage. But they have the disadvantage that they had to play last
night. We were watching and resting, and that is a disadvantage.  
Last year when we played the same group we started out very well also. It was
like 13‑2, we were up, and then boom. They just make a huge run and from that
point forward just beat us. I certainly reminded our team at one of the media
timeouts that we're not going back there. We're going to keep our foot on the
pedal and keep pressing and pushing, and not pressing basketballwise, but
pressing the issue, playing hard and trying to be the initiator instead of
reacting to what they do.  
  
Q. Your mom made the trip here 750 miles to come to the tournament. How
happy are you that she's here?  
COACH MARSHALL: It's great. She's a special lady. She carted me around when I
was not much bigger than a basketball. So she came to the Davidson game, she
listens to every game. They watch when they can. She loves to hear Mike
Kennedy's call of the games. Just to have her here, she used to come a lot
more when it was in the Big South. But for her to make the trip and the effort
with my step‑dad is awesome. We're trying to make the most of it. Hopefully
they can stay around through Sunday.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Evansville 72  
Missouri State 64

  
PAUL LUSK: Well, a lot of credit to Evansville. They've got kids that they've
worked on their game. I saw Kenny Harris in junior college. I saw Troy Taylor.
Those kids have worked on their game. They've gotten better. Kenny Harris
makes his free throws, he makes wide‑open jumpers. It's just improvement. We
need to improve in a lot of areas.  
Disappointed, we out rebounded them 50 to 30 last game, and last game we
started a different lineup to go with a better defensive lineup and a better
rebounding lineup, but we turned it over 24 times. So then today we go back
with our other lineup that can hopefully take care of the ball better, and we
don't guard them at all in the first half and we don't rebound. So as a coach
it's very difficult to find combinations out there that you can play and have
success with.  
Last game we guarded them to start the first half with that lineup, but then
we turned it over 24 times. Well, today we didn't turn it over but we didn't
guard them and we didn't rebound. A lot of credit to Evansville. Very pleased
with Kyle. I thought he was terrific today. He really played hard and was
good, and then I thought Caleb did some very good things, as well.  
It really affected us having Jarmar Gulley and Keith Pickens out of the game
early, and you have to have discipline in the game of basketball, and we
fouled. Keith had two fouls that were absolute fouls, and Jarmar had some
fouls, and we had some charges we shouldn't have had, and then we just fouled
too much. It seemed like once we got the game back, we made that little run in
the second half. We had it to two, then we'd turn it over two straight times,
one on an under OB and another on an second OB of a guy stepping out of
bounds. It seemed like Evansville, they're very mobile, they're a fast team,
but a lot of credit to them.  
  
Q. Kyle, the second half they go about six and a half minutes without a
point and you guys weren't able to make much headway. Talk about that being a
key to the game.  
KYLE WEEMS: Well, halftime we talked about it was a do or die, and we just
wanted to come out with more energy than we did to start the game. We got some
good stops and got some good rebounds and a couple put backs and some good
drives and got stuff rolling, and they got hot again, and that comes from us
letting them get their head up too much in the first half and they just felt
comfortable, and you've got to give them credit.  
PAUL LUSK: I thought we really guarded better the second half. Obviously
having Keith and Jarmar out there helped, but then we struggled to score at
times. You can only put so much pressure on your defense. You know, we missed
a lot of shots. We missed lay‑ups, we missed free throws, and they make their
shots, and they make their free throws. That comes with improvement in the off
season.  
I told our guys, when you don't get guarded, there's one thing to do about it,
and that's to get in the gym and to work on your game, and we absolutely have
to do that. There's no doubt that when Kyle and Caleb were out there,
everything centered on them, then they're leaving some other guys open.  
I thought our defense was pretty good the second half. We had a chance to cut
it to six, I believe, when Gulley got the steal and he goes in and tries
dunking it, and he shouldn't have done that. He's got to go make a lay‑up.  
I thought our kids battled the second half in the end, though. Colt Ryan is
very good. He makes big plays and big shots for them, and then I thought Kenny
Harris was terrific.  
And then when you have a guard getting 13 rebounds, that's more than anybody
on our team, and in two games against us, he's got 14 and 13, and that's why
we made the change last game. We didn't want Troy Taylor to kill us on the
glass. But then as I said, we had too many turnovers.  
But I thought our defense was pretty good the second half, but it's just very
taxing on you when you can't score the basketball.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you talk a little bit about losing to Evansville for the third
straight time this year and the frustration that might exist with that?  
KYLE WEEMS: Most definitely not a good feeling. I've beat them a lot of times
in my career, but you've got to give Marty Simmons credit. He's done a great
job, and I told him that when we were shaking hands because they weren't that
good, and he's got them beating the best in the league and competing in any
game. You've got to give him credit because they play hard and they're
extremely great on offense, and they make you kind of pick your poison, do you
want this guy to get open shots or do you want this guy. That's just a sign of
a good program headed in the right direction and great coaches, and you just
have to give them credit. But definitely not a good feeling losing to a team
three times.  
  
Q. Caleb, what is it about Evansville? Obviously the first two were so
different and then you guys got off to fast starts. None of that happened
today. What is it about them that makes it so tough?  
CALEB PATTERSON: It's a real scrappy team. You know, they just play
offensively and defensively a little different, and defensively they
definitely key on some guys, and it just makes it a little more difficult for
the team.  
And then offensively they have those two guys that can get shots any time they
want, and they're going to make them a lot. They're just a tough team all
around?  
  
Q. Is it a physical match ‑up for you?  
CALEB PATTERSON: Yeah, personally, just because they don't have a big guy,
really, and then the way they play the post defense is a lot different than
anybody I've played in my whole career, so it probably is definitely
self‑esteem.  
PAUL LUSK: It's a difficult match‑up for us because they're small and they're
mobile, and they put guys on the floor that can make plays. They're one of the
best teams offensively in the league in almost every category, and they're
difficult. They're difficult to guard. I thought we guarded them really well
over at their place last time, and then we did what we needed to do. Caleb is
talking about post defense. When Caleb is posting, there are particular guys
that are on that weak side that they're not guarding on our guys, and they're
just sagging and laying, and it makes it very difficult to get the ball to the
point.  
We didn't guard them like we needed to tonight. They're going to make shots.
Colt Ryan and Denver Holmes, they make shots. They're like professional
shooters. They come off screens at a very high level. The shots they were
making against Creighton a week and a half ago were unbelievable. But those
guys are good players. I thought Denver Holmes should have been a second‑team
all‑league guy, I really did. I thought he was that good, and he's made such
good plays down the stretch. You've got Ned Cox who was the sixth man of the
year who was a very good player, and then Sawvell was on the all‑freshman
thing. I think Sawvell will be terrific because he's got a great motor, he's a
role guy now, but he catches the ball in the post, he's athletic, he's got
bounce in his legs. He's going to be a very good player.  
  
Q. Would you like to play in one of the lesser tournaments?  
KYLE WEEMS: I'd like to play until I can't play anymore. It's tough because I
kind of feel like I failed to get one of my goals, and the same goal with
Isaiah and Mike and the rest of the team, and that was to hang a banner in my
four years. I felt like I've been through pretty much any possible scenario,
coaches get being fired, coaches getting hired, coaches getting a better job,
a new coach coming in, and I felt like we had the right pieces to do some
special things, and we let some big games slip. But you know, that's on my
shoulders. That's on the rest of the seniors, and there's no doubt in my mind
that Coach will get this program better than 16 and 16 because I felt like we
should have had a better record than that anyway with some tough losses. But
Coach and the rest of the staff, they do a great job of developing us and
putting us in a position to be successful.  
But just right now, it's just tough because I feel like I let Missouri State
down and the city of Springfield down because they definitely deserve it.  
  
Q. Caleb, your answer on postseason play?  
CALEB PATTERSON: Obviously I want to continue to play, and right now we don't
know what's going to happen. But if we get invited to play any more, the whole
team, we're ready to play, and we'll come out and play anywhere.  
  
Q. Kyle, you talked a little bit about some of the things you reflected on
throughout the season and you said you're excited about the future of Missouri
State. What about the future of Kyle Weems? What are you looking forward to?  
KYLE WEEMS: Well, just trying to keep getting better, keep getting better,
working on my game. I'll be part of Missouri State for the rest of my life
because I really feel like that's my second home, and everybody there is my
family. I've been blessed with a great opportunity to spend five years of my
life there, but if it's the NBA, it's the NBA. If it's overseas, it's
overseas. I still feel like God has a plan for me and just keep getting better
and basically wherever the wind blows me, I guess.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just talk about there at the end of the season, five
straight losses, kind of the down spiral that happened?  
PAUL LUSK: Sure. It's disappointing. I think Kyle said something the other day
in the press conference with so many new faces and just trying to find that
continuity and that‑‑ just having a fluid team out there and guys fighting
through certain situations, we obviously didn't finish on a strong note and we
didn't have that.  
I go back to the Indiana State game. You know, the five losses, we lost at
Wichita State, then we lost to Old Dominion, who's a very good team. But I
thought the Indiana State game on senior night, as I said, I was very
disappointed in some of our guys' effort. We had to throw a team together last
spring. That's what we did. We got two guys in Jarmar Gulley and Anthony
Downing as junior college kids that came in and had a very good year. Anthony
struggled tonight, but it's his first Missouri Valley Conference game, they
were keying in on him, but those two guys have been pretty good. I thought
they made the transition a little bit quicker than I thought they would.
Gulley has got to improve in some areas. They took some things away from him
in league play, but I think he'll get better in those areas. We got Mike
Bizoukas late who was a very good addition for us. We just struggled down the
stretch.  
As I said, Kyle did his job tonight. He was going to have to be great if we
were going to move on and win some games, and I thought he did his job. It's
just one thing or another sometimes. As I said, we've been a good defensive
team all year. We were in the top one or two in every defensive statistic
category, but we don't have anyone on the all‑defensive team, and I thought
that our guys tonight, we made the change in the lineup to take care of the
basketball and then we get burned on the defensive end.  
We struggled down the stretch. I think there's a lot of reflection as a coach,
and for our players that are still in the program, and I challenge them. We
were very positive in the locker room with them but said we've got to get
better in areas. You have to look in the mirror and look at your deficiencies,
and it's major college basketball. We have to go to work in the off season.  
  
Q. Would you be hopeful for playing more ball in one of those tournaments?  
PAUL LUSK: Sure, you always want to play. We were picked sixth in the league.
Kyle Weems, as I said, was the one returning scorer and the one returning guy
that we had that was established, and then you have to throw four new starters
out there, it's difficult. We jumped out of the gates awfully well, but I
still knew we had a lot of deficiencies. But if playing more is good for the
seniors, but they've got to want to do that, and then it's certainly very
positive for the other guys that are in the program, and Anthony Downing,
Jarmar Gulley, Keith Pickens, those are guys that are going to have to be big
time players for us in the future. Those guys came in and did a very good job.
It was great getting Pick back. He's been beat up and we've got to get him
healthy in the off season. But yeah, you certainly would like to play more
basketball.  
  
Q. Kyle expressed just a passion and faith that you were going to improve
next season, and he really believed that you would be able to do that. Could
you talk to some of the Missouri State fans and say what it is that you plan
on doing going into next season to improve upon that?  
PAUL LUSK: Well, we've got‑‑ if you look at our roster, we've got the two new
guys that we got in Jarmar Gulley and Anthony Downing. They came in and had
very good years for us. And they earned their spot. They have got to get
better, and we'll go as those guys go.  
Keith Pickens has got to continue to get healthy, and then really after that
there are a lot of things that are up for grabs.  
I was very pleased with Christian Kirk this year, didn't want to put that much
responsibility on him as a young kid, especially after he sat out his senior
year, but I thought he did some very good things. Christian will work. He will
get better. He'll get in the gym.  
And then some of our young guys are going to have to play in terms of guys
that are coming into the program because that's where we're at. I think we
have to get better defensively. I absolutely know that we have to get better
from a skill standpoint. There's just too many guys out there that they don't
guard.  
I told our guys, I said, I watched Kenny Harris in junior college, and he's
made himself a player. Well, that's from getting in the gym and doing it. So
hard work can allow that to happen. But we've got to get in the gym and get
better.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't know about a postseason at this point, but you said
the comments in the locker room were positive from yourself and the staff. Can
you expand on how you addressed the team after the loss tonight?  
PAUL LUSK: Well, I told them the truth. I told them what areas we're lacking
in and what some of them need to do to get better. But I was very positive
with the guys. Thankful for the seniors. It was a different senior group. Kyle
Weems was the one guy that was established. Caleb Patterson made the
most‑improved team. He was a guy that wasn't used a whole lot in the previous
years. Caleb can really score the basketball, and he was a threat for us down
there.  
Isaiah did some good things for us this year. There's no doubt, Isaiah is a
great kid. They all have their degrees. And then Mike Bizoukas was a kid that
was seldom used at DePaul and came in and did some great things for us, might
have ended up leading us in minutes played, and very happy for him that the
end of his career was an enjoyable experience. Sure, he didn't like losing his
last five games, but he played and he was productive and he helped us get 16
wins. We don't have 16 wins if Mike Bizoukas isn't there. I don't know if we
have five.  
I'm not going to come down on the guys right now. It's about the seniors. I
want them to reflect and be positive, and if we get a postseason chance, then
we'll see what we can do. But it's just all positive. You want those guys‑‑
you don't want them to end on a losing note, but nonetheless, it's happened,
and we're here to help them the rest of their lives, whatever they choose to
do. That was really about it in the locker room.  
  
Q. There at the end of the players talking, Kyle Weems mentioned about his
future, the possibility of an NBA appearance or overseas. What do you think
his chances are of making it to the NBA, and what type of player do you think
he would be in the professional level?  
PAUL LUSK: Well, I mean, Kyle is going to have an opportunity to play
basketball and make a living doing that. If it's in the NBA, then that would
be absolutely terrific. If it's overseas, then that would be terrific. We
worked on Portsmouth. He's going to the Portsmouth Invitational, and that will
be a very good opportunity for him.  
The one thing, Kyle said he feels like he may have failed a little bit. I'm
very proud of Kyle Weems. Kyle Weems, this was hard for Kyle Weems this year.
He was the one guy, and he was the main target, and he said it the other day:
He goes, there's just so many new guys on the team, we're trying to find the
right chemistry. And his job was as difficult as it's ever been. He said it
about two weeks ago, it's been really hard because they've just clamped down
on him. He can't get loose. And then when you have other guys out there that
they're not guarding it makes it even more difficult.  
But he'll have an opportunity to go play. He's got his degree. He'll be
successful with whatever he does. He's a very good kid. He was fun to coach.
He's been great, great for Missouri State, great for the Missouri Valley. He's
had three different coaches, and my biggest concern coming into the job was
will your best player accept you and will you be able to coach him because
coachability is so important. Kyle was very good from day one, and I think
Kyle has improved in areas.  
He wasn't much of a sprinter last year because they played more possession
basketball with that team. He wasn't much of a poster in terms of getting on
the blocks and posting, and we had to‑‑ he had to do all of those things for
us this year. He had to rebound, he had to defend, he had to posts, he had to
drive it. You know, last year he could get loose and knock those threes down
because they had so many other pieces on the team, and I thought he did a very
good job of handling all of that, because there were times when it was
difficult for him.  
We started out 4 and 0, and Kyle was a guy that had struggled a little bit
when we were 4 and 0, and he just kept working, he kept coming in the gym, and
you knew it was going to go‑‑ if you put the work in and you give 100 percent
all of the time, good things are going to happen. Good things happen to good
people, and he's going to be successful with whatever he does.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Greg Lansing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21764)

### [Jake Odum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21766)

### [Carl Richard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21812)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  72  
Indiana State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Indiana State.  
COACH LANSING: Obviously a disappointing start for us, but all that credit has
to go to Wichita State. They are outstanding, and they are ready to go from
the tip. I told the guys a little bit it reminded me of how we started against
Syracuse last year. I really felt like we were ready to go. They put us on our
heels from the start and didn't let up. Once we got down 20‑3, we started
competing harder and playing like we needed to play. But that's easy to do
when you're down that far.  
Really proud of our effort in the second half. These two guys up here in
particularly are fighting and staying with it in a difficult situation. You're
out there, getting beaten pretty good. To keep fighting and keep playing, I'm
proud of their effort. These guys have accomplished an awful lot. We just got
beaten by an outstanding, very well‑coached team. Hopefully we've still got
another tournament to play in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Carl or Jake.  
  
Q. Carl and Jake, can you give kind of an illustration of just how stifling
Wichita State's defense was from your perspective?  
CARL RICHARD: Yeah, they had us scouted very well. I felt like they were on
top of everything we wanted to do. They took away our strength, and we just
didn't come with any type of resistance and any type of counter to their
attack.  
JAKE ODUM: They played great team defense. They were on the ball. They really
frustrated me when they were denying. I didn't back the natural pressure. But
they're good. They're probably the best team we've played all year. We just
came out too flat and got behind early. It's tough to battle back against a
top team like that.  
  
Q. Jake, can you talk about next year and what needs to change? This year
you were probably a little disappointed with how it ended?  
JAKE ODUM: Well, we're losing four great guys and four great teammates. We're
going to have to replace them somehow. We've got some good young guys coming
in. We have some red shirts this year that have been working hard. So we kind
of have to regroup this off‑season and see what we can do. Put a lot of work
in and go from there.  
  
Q. Jake, you knocked them off last year. How much better, and you just said
they're probably the best team you faced all year. How much better is Wichita
this year than they were last year?  
JAKE ODUM: I mean, they were tough last year too. But they stepped it up a
little bit. That is a group of guys that hasn't been to the NCAA Tournament.
They won the NIT last year, and they're just out to get everybody. They've got
one goal in mind and that is to win this tournament. I believe they're going
to make some noise in the NCAA Tournament also.  
  
Q. Carl, you guys took Wichita State down last year. You kind of had to
figure they were going to have that on their minds coming into this game. I'm
sure you guys realized that as well. But was the fact that you guys weren't
able to get a response, is that maybe the most disappointing that you weren't
able to counter punch the punch they gave you first?  
CARL RICHARD: The only disappointing part about this game was the first ten
minutes of the game. That was the only disappointing part. I felt like we
competed in the second half. We competed after we were down 20. We shared the
ball afterwards.  
I don't know why we came out the way we did. There is no explanation for that,
and it shouldn't have been that way. I mean, they just made shots early and we
just didn't.  
  
Q. You were pretty effusive about Wichita State yesterday. I think you knew
what you were getting into potentially. How good is this basketball team
coming from someone that played into the NCAA Tournament a year ago?  
COACH LANSING: They're as good as anybody we've played. As far as I'm
concerned they're as good as anybody I've seen on TV. This is a team that is
outstanding. They galvanized after last year winning that NIT. They played
with a chip on their shoulder all year because they couldn't get into the NCAA
Tournament. They're tough. They're deep. They're athletic. They come at you in
waves.  
I've been around the league, even my seven years at Iowa and playing Drake and
UNI, this is the best team I've seen in the league. They're really, really
good. They're as good as anybody that's going to play in the NCAA Tournament
as well whether they win this thing or not, because other teams are awfully
good and Creighton is tough. So just very good. As good as I've seen.  
  
Q. Obviously defensively they were outstanding. Can you talk about not only
the defense they played on Jake to kind of cut the head off the snake a little
bit, but their off the ball defense created confusion as well as forced some
turnovers.  
COACH LANSING: Yeah, forced some turnovers. What we had at halftime, we didn't
turn it over hardly at all in the second half. Guys relaxed and played a
little tight. We played tight. Couldn't make a shot. That affects us. We're
16% in the first half. We had some decent looks. Probably settled for way too
many threes in the first half.  
When a team's pressuring you it's easy to stand outside the three‑point arc
and fire those. After that we got to the three‑point line and were attacking,
getting to the paint. Things we wanted to do. Just first half.  
They came out, and it's a credit to them. They were ready to go from the start
and put us on our heels. It took us a while to recover.  
  
Q. You have anticipated that this probably isn't the end of the season that
you'll be playing on. What do you know about that at this point?  
COACH LANSING: We've been contacted. Everybody gets contacted by these other
tournaments to try to seed you after the NCAA field and the NIT field.
Obviously, we're not going to be in either one of those. But with four leaders
and a defending champion team, and won 18 games, I think we'll be a good team
to be invited into the tournament.  
With our administration allowing us to do that, we're looking forward to
getting back in practice. Give the guys a few days off and recover from this
and kind of find out what tournament we could be in.  
  
Q. Coach, you speak of possibly going to the postseason tournament. I know
it's not the big dance, but how important is it for a program the third year
in a row to go to a postseason tournament and get experience like that?  
COACH LANSING: Any tournament you play in is great. Any postseason tournament
is great to get a chance to continue your season, continue to send the seniors
out the right way and show these young guys you know that we're all about the
postseason. Hopefully that just continues. Get back here in St. Louis in a
year with a bunch of new faces and make a little longer run in the tournament.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Ben Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19538)

### [Jake Koch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21791)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  54  
UNI  42

  
THE MODERATOR: Northern Iowa Panthers are here. Coach Jacobson, an opening
statement?  
COACH JACOBSON: Both teams had a hard time finding the basket there for a long
time. It just felt like the first team to breakthrough a little bit was going
to be the one to get a 4, 5, 6‑point lead, which the way that game was going,
it was going to be enough.  
Illinois State played very well. Really defended well. Had a good plan for
what they were doing. Carmichael had a terrific game. He made a lot of plays.
We had some guys make really good plays for us as well.  
Jake had a great first half, so we were able to have that lead at halftime.
Just couldn't find enough ways to get some offense generated. A lot of that to
do with Illinois State and the way they defended.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Carmichael's game and on defense with the five
blocks how much he was controlling the paint?  
JAKE KOCH: Yeah, he was a big athletic guy. Whenever you get in the lane, you
have to be aware of where he is. He's very athletic. He knows he's got good
timing. He know when's to jump up. He played a great game both on defense and
on offense. He's a very good player.  
  
Q. Inside the arc today, what were they doing to make it difficult for you
guys to get a look at the basket inside there?  
JAKE KOCH: Their bigs are long and athletic. Their guards are strong and
quick, so they're a very good defensive team. They really pressure you and get
out there and extend their defense. They made more plays than we did on both
ends of the court today.  
  
Q. You missed a few easy ones. Seems like they're always rimming out.
Obviously they're good enough. You made those before. Is there an explanation
for why so many were falling off the rim tonight?  
JAKE KOCH: No, it just wasn't falling for me. I had a good first half. Second
half just couldn't capitalize.  
  
Q. Jake, with a record of 19 ‑13, I'm sure you'd like a shot to get some
postseason play, maybe NIT, CBI, talk to me about what it would mean to get a
chance to get out with this team and play another game?   
COACH JACOBSON: With our one senior, Johnny Moran, this is a tough loss for
him. We all felt pretty strongly that we were going to make some noise in this
tournament. We didn't want to end up like this. So with the postseason play
coming up, we've got to wait to see where we end up and be ready for it, make
a run in that tournament.  
  
Q. Ben, you talked about how rebounding was going to be a big key for you
guys and you wound up being minus 15. What were you doing that maybe wasn't
enough there?  
COACH JACOBSON: Well, the number was‑‑ deceiving would be the wrong way to put
it. We missed a lot of shots. They do such a good job of rebounding the
basketball with their size and with their length at the defensive end that we
weren't able to get to enough offensive rebounds.  
But where it really hurt us was at our defensive end. The offensive rebounds,
had we been able to block out better and to rebound the ball better at that
end of the floor, we still may have gotten outrebounded by 8 to 10 because we
had missed enough shots. There were enough offensive rebounds for Illinois
State again.  
But the offensive rebounds they got, especially in the second half, those were
the ones that hurt us. Those were the ones that we needed to do a better job
of coming up with. In some ways, it was certainly one of the differences in
the game was the second half, them getting some offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Coach, it was 31 ‑31, and Carmichael took it from there. Can you talk
about that run and what happened?   
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, again, in a game that is that close and that close
because both teams are having such a hard time scoring, sometimes all takes is
one good play, and Carmichael was able to provide that for their team. Even
after that, they had the momentum. We still had some chances after that play
and we needed to come up with some stops. When we did get a stop, there were
two or three times where we did not get the rebound. Now you're really
frightened again, because they defended us well, and we didn't score the ball
very well.  
You've got to have all the defensive rebounds when you do get a stop, and we
weren't able to do that.  
  
Q. Tuttle picked up his third foul early in the second half and had to go to
the bench. Did you feel that impacted maybe the offensive production?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, he wasn't as involved as he's been in a couple of weeks
now. He's done a good job. Put together a great season. Didn't get quite as
much going today. A little bit to do with foul trouble, and a little bit to do
with just not getting some things done.  
But certainly that third one, he's making an effort to go rebound it, and ends
up grabbing on to a guy's jersey, which is a foul. That probably impacted the
way he played in the second half.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the overall defensive effort from Illinois State?
Tim Jankovich called it one of the best performances his team has had all
year.  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, it was really good. They did a nice job of defending our
ball. Our ball screen actions. Being able to drag out those actions and still
rotate and find the right help and take enough things away. We were, from a
game plan standpoint going to see if we could get some more done in
transition, and we didn't get a lot done in that area.  
So between the way they defended some of the ball screen actions and the way
they defended in transition that slowed us down.  
  
Q. The 42 points, it's going to be tough to win with that. You went over
what they did, but what did you guys not do, I guess, that could have kind of
overcome that defensive effort a little bit more?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, it felt like really both teams had some decent looks. I
didn't feel like we were the only team on the floor today that missed some
open shots. We had some decent looks from three. Some shots from inside the
arc, and I think both teams can say that that happened.  
I think where our offense really got slowed down was when we did get to the
rim, they blocked nine of our shots. That had a real impact on our ability to
get some points going, get some momentum going.  
Most of those blocked shots were terrific plays by their team. Some of them
were plays that we needed to make a different read. We needed to make a
different play. At times it's difficult for guards when they've beaten their
guy and they've got a straight line to the rim and all they see is the rim,
they feel they're going to be able to lay it in.  
Carmichael does such a good job of covering ground. He comes out of nowhere a
lot of times. But we also knew that coming into the game. He's done that
before. So there are a couple of those where we needed to make a different
play and a different read and know that he was going to be coming, and we
didn't do that.  
  
Q. You touched on Carmichael in the opening statement, could you talk about
how he handled both ends of the court?  
COACH JACOBSON: He's played great. He's had a terrific season. He really goes
and gets the basketball. I think what did he have, 13 defensive rebounds, and
some of those were probably closer to a teammate of his than they were to him,
and he went and got them anyway.  
So he's playing at a high level at that area of the game. Then going, and some
of those balls that he got to block those shots, there are just not that many
guys that can make that kind of play. So he put together a great game. And
obviously had a tremendous impact on the outcome.  
  
Q. Talk about Johnny Moran being here and his performance.  
COACH JACOBSON: The way he came out, I felt like he was going to have a big
game. He knocked in two of his first couple of threes. Then the way we
finished the first half, as slow and hard to watch as it was for everybody in
the building, it felt great to be up by four. He was really after his teammate
that's positive way, encouraging guys. He brings that kind of mentality, and
that kind of enthusiasm and excitement to the group.  
Unfortunately, as I told the guys, we had a great non‑conference. We played
very, very good in the last three weeks of conference play. So we've done
enough to get into a postseason tournament. So we get to play some more. There
is a pretty good list of why that is important and why that's good for our
program. At the top of the list is always your seniors. Johnny's been good for
us, and just glad we're going to get to play some more.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Kenneth Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23224)

### [Denver Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20514)

### [Colt Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21763)

### [Marty Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20513)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Evansville 72  
Missouri State 64

  
MARTY SIMMONS: Well, we knew it would be tough. Missouri State is a very good
basketball team. They make it very difficult to run offense against. They've
got very good offensive players, and it was a physical‑‑ just a grind‑it‑out
kind of game. I thought we got off to a good start, and then I guess in the
middle of the second half there, they really did a great job defensively, and
we had a hard time finding buckets. But at that time period, we were getting
stops ourselves. I thought that was a big point in the game, and we just had
guys step up at the end and make plays. Really proud of our team.  
  
Q. This question is for Denver: You and Kenny both did a good job shooting
free throws tonight. I noticed you had a little trouble shooting from the
field tonight. Coming into the next game and coming out of this game what's
your focus and what are you telling yourself to get ready for tomorrow, to
improve on that?  
DENVER HOLMES: Just relax and take my time at the line. I know I missed two
tonight, and when we get to shoot‑around tomorrow just really concentrate on
that aspect and just get as many shots up as possible during our walk‑through
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kenny, coming back here, does it ever get old playing in front of the
St.Louis people?  
KENNY HARRIS: No, you love to play in front of your family and friends, just
to come‑‑ just to let them come see you play. It feels good to come home and
play?  
  
Q. And play as well as you did tonight?  
KENNY HARRIS: Yeah (laughing).  
  
Q. I'm sure it did feel good to play here, Kenny, but tomorrow you get a
chance to play against a tough opponent. You're going to get to play a little
bit against Doug McDermott. What are your thoughts getting ready to play
against players of that caliber?  
KENNY HARRIS: I'm going to look at them just like wins, try not to let them
touch the ball, catch the ball, hit a great player, limit his touches.  
  
Q. Denver, can you talk about the rebounding tonight?  
DENVER HOLMES: Yeah, that was a huge part of our pregame, and we've been
talking about it all week. They waxed us last Saturday on the boards at our
place, and we knew that was going to be a huge factor in this game. We just
got in their and boxed out and got it done, and it's going to take the same
thing tomorrow night. It's just execution and effort and going and getting the
ball. It's a huge part of the game down here in St.Louis.  
  
Q. Colt, last time you played Creighton you had over 40 points. Are you
excited to see what they do against you tomorrow?  
COLT RYAN: I'm excited to play them again. Points to me don't really matter
except for team points. I'm looking to score as the team, score more points
than Creighton. That's the only thing I'm focused on.  
  
Q. Colt, you guys ripped their hearts out the last two times you played
them. Did you see anything different out of them today? Do you guys think you
had a little psychological advantage over them?  
COLT RYAN: I think they came out and they started the game pretty well, but we
shot it extremely well to start the game off. I mean, they competed hard, and
I mean, I thought that a big thing was on the defensive end, we were able to
get some stops at some crucial times and some key buckets at some crucial
times, also.  
  
Q. At one point tonight it seemed like it was getting real physical. I know
Taylor was bleeding at one point. Did that cause you guys to get angry or
frustrated or take you off your game or did that bond you together and
motivate you guys to push further?  
COLT RYAN: No, definitely not. I mean, we knew it was going to be a physical
game coming into it. It had been‑‑ the past two match ups had been real
physical, and we expected it. The whole thing with Troy, I think‑‑ salvo
actually got him. It wasn't them, it was an unfortunate elbow. But we knew it
was going to be physical.  
DENVER HOLMES: Just like Colt said, we prepared for a physical match up
against them the last two times. They tried to beat us to screens and write us
off screens, and all week we executed taking our man deeper than the screen
and just making our cuts really sharp and being sharp on the offensive end,
and then we wanted to be the most physical team on the defensive end,
rebounding, and got to done tonight.  
  
Q. Colt and Denver, obviously you split with Creighton during the season.
Could you talk about getting another shot at them with what's at stake
tomorrow?  
COLT RYAN: I mean, there's a lot at stake. I mean, it's win or go home. We're
playing for a bid for the NCAA Tournament, just like they are. We're going to
come out and give it our all, get fluids in us tonight, get hydrated, get some
food and get some sleep and give it our best shot tomorrow.  
DENVER HOLMES: Exactly what Colt said. Definitely hydrate tonight and getting
some rest and waking up in the morning with a clear mind and ready to get the
game plan down and go out and execute tomorrow against them.  
  
Q. Coach, if I'm correct I don't believe you trailed tonight but it seemed
like Missouri State wouldn't go away. Talk about how tough of a win it was
despite that fact.  
MARTY SIMMONS: That's exactly what it was. I've got a ton of respect for Paul
and their program, and Kyle Weems is a champion. He's a great player. He's a
great leader. They've got tons of guys, Pickens. You got Patterson, he plays
so hard, very competitive. Their team is full of guys like that. That's the
way all three games have been. We prepared that way, and that's exactly the
way it was. Like Colt said earlier, I think the way we started the game
probably really helped us as much as anything. We just seemed to be really
sharp and made some shots, and I think that gave us confidence, and then as
the game got deeper, we just grinded it out. We were able to find ways to get
stops and get rebounds, and it was a very tough, hard‑fought win, and that's
the way it is any time you play not only Missouri State but really anybody in
this league. It's a very difficult league to play.  
  
Q. Your ability to contain Gulley and do you think tonight, how big a key
was that tonight?  
MARTY SIMMONS: I don't know if we really stopped them. Those guys are great
players. I know Gulley got us in the foul trouble. Gulley did at least. That
probably helped as much as anything. But nothing special, just challenging
guys to try to keep the ball in front, play individual characteristics, and
make their looks not great looks. But I mean, they're great players. I'm sure
they missed some shots that they normally hit. I guess that's probably as good
an answer as I can give you.  
  
Q. Going into half you were leading 43 to 34. What did you tell your guys
going into halftime having that lead over Missouri State?  
MARTY SIMMONS: Well, we knew they weren't going to quit. We knew they'd come
back and they certainly did. But we challenged them to win the first four
minutes of the second half and I'm not sure we did. But really just a
sustained effort. We let Weems get two threes in transition there, which we
absolutely did not want to do. If we've got to pick him up at the half line we
didn't want to get him, he's so dangerous in transition. Patterson got a pick
and pop three, just tried to review points in our game plan that we felt like
we didn't execute so we'd execute better in the second half. But more than
anything just maintain the aggressiveness that we felt like we played with in
the first half.  
  
Q. Talking with some of the Creighton players after their game, I asked
Antoine how he felt about another close game and he said he was really tired
of close games, they were going to do their best to make sure whoever they
played next they were going to blow out. What do you think about that and do
you have anything to say in response?  
MARTY SIMMONS: I think they're a great team, and I'm going to focus on my
team, getting my team prepared. They're a very difficult team to match up
with. They've got one of the best players in the country in Doug McDermott.
Echnique is a great inside player and Young in my opinion one of the best
point guards in the country. The guy knows how to make plays, confident group
ton of games top 25 for a long, long time. I just look at it from our
standpoint as a really good opportunity for our program to play one of the
better programs in the country on a stage where you feel like you have the
opportunity to play for an NCAA bid.  
  
Q. You guys both had pretty good crowds tonight, you and Creighton. Do you
think the crowds will have a factor in tomorrow's game?  
MARTY SIMMONS: I'm not sure on that. I think probably limiting Doug's touches
and blocking him out and trying to keep Antoine in front of us and not letting
Echnique catch the ball is probably important. I don't really think‑‑ I think
that's a non‑factor.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Jordan Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23255)

### [Mark Phelps](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20507)

### [Ben Simons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23254)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Creighton  68  
Drake  61

  
COACH PHELPS: It was a real battle. I think both teams gave great effort. A
very even game throughout when you look at the numbers. Obviously, they've got
their 7‑point advantage. One more field goal. They knocked down some threes,
and I think they've got one more free throw.  
But for us, the scoring drought in the second half ended up being a tough
situation to overcome, while at the same time, I thought our guys did a great
job battling back to get back into the game. I think we ended up being down
11, maybe 12. Got back in the game, and had a nice flurry at the end there.  
A couple shots could have gone down, couple things could have gone our way, I
think we could have gotten back in the game and made a real game of it there
at the end.  
Can't say enough about our guys. They really, really laid it out there. Jordan
Clarke's a guy that we kind of look to set the tone and kind of show us how to
be a tough guy and show us how to play the right way. I thought he wore that
badge tonight better than he ever has. He had a double‑double. Just threw his
body around and did everything that he could possibly do to set the tone and
set the example for the rest of our guys who, in turn, followed suit and
really, really battled.  
So overall a difficult game to swallow. Lot of guys in there that are
disappointed. They laid it on the line. At the same time, there is a lot to be
proud of with the season, and so we move on. Certainly we'll get a chance.
We'll have an invite from some of the other tournaments to play beyond this
tournament here. So we'll process all of that and move forward.  
Really proud of our guys in a tough, tough game. Doug McDermott hit some big
threes in the second half and got a huge offensive rebound. I think we were
down three. Had them miss a shot, and got an offensive rebound. That one
really hurt, but he's a terrific player and he makes big plays. Really proud
of these guys up here and proud of the guys in the locker room.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Ben or Jordan.  
  
Q. Talk about your mindset coming in tonight? You logged some pretty heavy
minutes after playing last night.  
BEN SIMONS: Last night we had a tough game with Bradley, but it was a one‑game
season, really. So we knew we had to lay it on the line. There is no guarantee
tomorrow to make it to Saturday. So we played as hard as we could. Gave
Creighton a good battle. In the end we were a little short, but we were proud
of how we played and how we fought.  
JORDAN CLARKE: Our training staff did a great job of getting us ready. We were
in ice baths last night. They made sure we were hydrated. We thought it was
more of a mental thing. If we wanted to be tired, we were going to be tired.
If we didn't think we were going to be tired, then we weren't going to be
tired. And I thought we came out with the energy that we needed, we just
didn't have enough in the end.  
  
Q. Ben, was fatigue a factor at some point? You were 1 for 3 for three.  
BEN SIMONS: I don't know. Creighton had a good game plan defensively. Keeping
a guy right on me, so I don't know how much fatigue is a factor. Obviously, I
was tired playing all 40 minutes, but I felt a lot better tonight to be honest
with you. Last night I was tired, but tonight I felt great. Playing as hard as
I could. We just didn't have enough in the end.  
  
Q. Is it almost easier for a team to have already played a game than for
what Creighton saw out of you guys tonight? They had the slow start. Is it
almost easier after having played one game to get off to that quick start?  
JORDAN CLARKE: I think there is a little bit of an advantageous to it. We got
the jitters out early. In the first game we were able to run upanddown the
court. We were familiar with the rims on things like that. So it's a little
bit of an advantage. Obviously you're more tired going into the game.  
But I think that it helped us to get a feel for the court, the environment.
It's a different gym, so, yeah, I think it helped.  
BEN SIMONS: I agree with that. At the start of the game especially, like
Jordan said, we had a feel for the court, feel for the surroundings and
everything like that. So I think there is sort of an advantage. At the same
time, we were playing pretty good basketball too. So I think we can put both
of those things together, that's why we got a quick start.  
  
Q. Jordan, if you can just describe overall all the emotions that you're
feeling after a game like this? You take the 24th ranked team in the country
down to the wire and yet you're still heading home. If you can talk about the
emotions you're feeling?  
JORDAN CLARKE: Well, it's a lot of emotion. It's tough because we never know
what's going to happen tomorrow, but it's tough with the seniors. You know,
Kurt, Cory, Kraidon and Greg, that it could be the last time you suit up with
people that you call your brothers. But we felt that we laid it out on the
line, and we're proud about that. We felt like we can walk out proud with our
heads held high because we left it all on the floor.  
It's tough, but at the same time, we felt good about the way we played
tonight.  
COACH PHELPS: Our guys had an expectation to win the game. So when you have an
expectation to get something done and come up short, certainly that hurts.  
  
Q. Talk about the decision to play your starters pretty much the entire
game. Is that something you decided to do coming in or is that the way the
game unfolded?  
COACH PHELPS: I didn't realize that happened. We needed our best players in
the game as much as possible. We tried to give guys breaks during the media
timeouts. We subbed like we normally do, we just got our starters back in more
quickly. I don't think that fatigue was a factor.  
I thought Ben was terrific. He ran around like Ben Simons always does for 40
minutes. I think it's a testament to him to make that recovery from mono,
wasn't by design. We gave guys a shorter break tonight because it was such a
tough game. We had a harder time scoring. We wanted our starters back in as
much as possible.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just talk about what postseason play would mean for your
team getting to continue to play and whatever tournament that might be?  
COACH PHELPS: I think it's great for the team. It's great for the program to
continue to play in postseason. There are so many good basketball programs in
the country. There are 350 Division I schools, and the NCAA takes 68, and the
NIT takes 32. There are still a lot of really good basketball teams. I think a
lot of programs have parlayed some of those tournaments the CIT, the CBI, into
momentum for their program and into the next year.  
The thing for us though that means more than anything, if you do get a chance
to continue to play, we have a pretty good basketball team. We happen to play
one of the top 25 teams in the country tonight, and I thought we gave them a
great game. Couple things could have gone our way. We could have continued
playing tomorrow.  
The fact that we're playing some pretty good basketball, like Ben mentioned
makes you want to continue to play. Right now, tonight, guys are hurting. But
as they ease from this, I think they'll be excited about the opportunity to
play again and be together again.  
Jordan mentioned the other part. We have a really close‑knit group. Greg and
Cory have been here together for four years, and Kurt, and Kraidon have been
here. It will be nice to continue to play.  
  
Q. How much of a difference does the crowd that Creighton brings energy wise
to affect the game?  
COACH PHELPS: I thought they had a good crowd. We had a really good crowd. We
may not have had as many numbers. But I can hear the Bulldog fans throughout
the game: To be really, really honest, I didn't think it was that much of a
factor. I'm sure they enjoyed having their people here. But it didn't seem
like it was a detriment to us at all. It could have been a positive for them.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense on McDermott. Obviously, he hurt you guys down low
and he shut that down a little bit and goes down and hits four three pointers.
How tough is he?  
COACH PHELPS: He's a terrific player. He was 4 for 6 from three. We had a game
plan how we were guarding ball screens. He got his threes off on ball screens,
pick and pops. I thought we were there a couple times. They do a really good
job making adjustments on how we play defense.  
We switched some smaller guys on them in DeMoines. That wasn't the answer to
have guys like Kurt down there battling. But we had a good game plan. We got
hurt a couple times on the ball screens. He had some tough shots. But he's a
terrific player. Really, really good player.  
Again, that offensive rebound he had late, his only offensive rebound of the
game was really a tough one, because we had just gotten a stop, and we were
down three. We were going to come at the other end. But he's a great player.
He does lots of things to impact the game.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  54  
UNI  42

  
THE MODERATOR: Tim Jankovich of the Illinois State Red Birds is with us. We'll
have him start and give us a brief synopsis of the game and come up with
questions for the three student‑athletes.  
COACH JANKOVICH: I told Ben before the game, "Isn't it great that the prize
for winning this game is you get to play Wichita in the next round after
watching Wichita today and all year?"  
So it's going to be a tremendous challenge. But right now it's about today,
and just a tremendous, tremendous effort by our entire team. You know, we were
a man down. An important man down. Then we have Frenchy with three fouls in
the first half. We had two. I think John had two. We're just a makeshift squad
as far as substitutions at that point and somehow managed to hang in by four.  
Lo and behold, second half, we stay out of foul trouble. Just, I don't know. I
can't say enough. Every guy was tremendous. Northern is an outstanding team.
Look at their year. Look at their wins. Look at how they battle. How smart and
tough they are. We have a tremendous, tremendous amount of respect for them.
So could not be more proud of our team today.  
THE MODERATOR: Quick note on Jackie Carmichael, he had his 14th double rebound
game of the season today, that is tops in the Valley. He also leads the league
with 12 double‑doubles. With that, you can ask any questions of the three
student‑athletes.  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, but it's only 15. You only had 15 rebounds? Good Lord.
We've got to get to work, Geez. Anybody can get 15.  
  
Q. Jackie, you had the big dunk that put you up 54 ‑31\. That started the
run and won you guys the game from there. Can you talk about that play and
what that meant to your team?   
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: I don't know that it won us the game. Our fight really won
us the game. The way we played down the stretch and handled the pressure, they
were doubling on the inside. We were able to get the ball to some other
players, and Tyler was able to make some crucial plays down the stretch. That
was just huge for us.  
All of that builds into momentum, and that's what kind of pushed us ahead.  
  
Q. Jackie, it seemed like you wanted the ball in your hand there's at the
end of the game for the free throws. Before that you had the fadeaway and a
nice pass for the lay ‑up. Just talk about how you wanted the ball in your
hands early?   
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: Yeah, at the end of the game we wanted to make them foul.
It wasn't that I wanted the ball in my hands, it was just that we were getting
it to the open man and playing team basketball and trying to close out the
game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the total defense effort tonight, Bryant? Was there a
frustration level in the first half that you guys just weren't able to get any
offensive rhythm really going?  
BRYANT ALLEN: Not really. I mean, we just wanted to be patient and slow down.
The first half we just kind of were going fast, going a hundred miles per
hour. We just needed to slow down and let our defense win the game for us.  
  
Q. Bryant, I couldn't help but notice how excited you guys all seemed after
the win. But was it a relief? Everybody seemed to be smiling and upbeat. Just
because it was kind of a tough game to get through?  
BRYANT ALLEN: Yeah, it was really exciting to go get this win. Coach did a
good job of putting together a good scouting report for us. We just go out and
try to execute to our best. We just came together as a team, and we came out
on top. Northern Iowa's a great team. Big ups to them.  
We've got much respect for them. They're going to be good next year as well.
But we're going to enjoy this win right now, but right now we're just focusing
on the next game.  
  
Q. Nic, how big was Jackie? He had the five blocks as well as the rebounds.
I know it's just another game, but how big was he?  
NIC MOORE: He's always a big key to our team. I know if somebody gets beat on
the dribble, that Jackie's always there to clean it up as you can see tonight?  
  
Q. Nic, in the first half, was there a little bit of nerves? We talked
before about playing the first time. A lot of guys in the Valley tournament,
do you think that attributed to your play in the first half?  
NIC MOORE: Yeah, we were a little sped up. Coach told us before that their
defense is like a Pac 10 zone, and we needed to reverse the ball in the second
half. We did that, and got it to Jackie, kicked out and he made big plays and
so did everybody else.  
  
Q. Jackie, what do you expect tomorrow?  
JACKIE CARMICHAEL: It's going to be a hard game. We'll have to come out and
fight even harder than we did today. We have a big seven‑footer in the middle.
Their team all around doesn't make many mistakes. We'll go back tonight and
get ready to play them.  
But I don't expect anything but it to be a knock‑down, drag ‑out fight from
beginning to end.  
  
Q. Bryant, is the pressure all on Wichita State tomorrow?  
THE MODERATOR: Bryant, you first then Nic.  
BRYANT ALLEN: I would say so. Them being the No. 1 seed, they've got a lot of
pressure on them. We just want to go out and execute and continue to just play
team basketball and do whatever it takes to win this game tomorrow.  
NIC MOORE: I would say, yes, the pressure's on them. We've just got to come in
this game and execute and do what we do and just have fun and believe in each
other.  
  
Q. Jackie, could you talk about the defensive effort? In a conference game,
was this tops for the year?  
BRYANT ALLEN: I think for sure. We kind of put it all together. We've had
great defensive nights. We've got times where we've played one great defensive
half and either not finished it out, but tonight it really came together. I
felt like from the beginning everyone came out and played hard. It really was
playing great defense.  
  
Q. You held Northern Iowa to 25% shooting. Deon Mitchell and Anthony James
combined for four points.  
COACH JANKOVICH: I'm going to answer that, but first of all, I want to get
back to the pressure being on Wichita. I love these guys. I love our team, but
they're totally full of crap. The pressure is on us. Wichita is in the NCAA
Tournament already. I don't really see the pressure on them at this point.  
I would say that the team in red is the one with the pressure on them, so
we'll have to get that straightened out at our meal tonight. This is the best
kind of game. I don't know how many times I've said that. This is my fifth
year here, but I've learned this a long time ago. It took me a long time. I
was a slow learner, because as I was young and starting in this thing, I
thought the best kind when you scored 2, 92‑84, that was the best kind to win,
because it's fun and pretty and I love watching it and all that.  
But when you've coached long enough, you realize the best games to win are one
when you‑‑ I don't know if we set a record‑‑ but we shot 26%. They shot 25.
Probably was a Missouri Valley record for low field goal percentage in a half.
And for the game we shoot 34. We can't make a three. Just a tough, tough
offensive night.  
When you can do that against an outstanding team, those are the best kind of
wins. Those only happen through the right mindset, the right mentality, the
right toughness, the right chemistry, all the things have to be in line to win
a game when you shoot 34% and 15 from three and you make one more turnover
than your opponent.  
I could not be happier. I thought the effort‑‑ I don't even know who to single
out defensively. I thought everybody. It was our best effort. It was our best,
toughest, grittiest, most mature. I thought our team grew up. Maybe that's the
wrong word. Took a step tonight. I've been saying as much as I love coaching
them, we're not close to our potential yet because we're so young.  
But tonight they looked older. They looked older tonight like they got it.
They figured out that you can't take possessions off. You can't stand up on
defense. You can't watch the ball. All the things that cause you to have break
downs. We chased the ball. We pursued everything and talked. So that's why
some guys struggled, because we had some guys fighting their absolute tail
off.  
The bad news for us is as good as Northern is, Wichita is arguably the best
team in how many years in this league. Highest ranked, I would think. Four
senior guards that are all really talented, a seven‑footer that I think will
be and should be drafted.  
You talk about an amazing challenge from our defensive end, but at the same
time we'll have to play much better offensively. Let's shoot the ball better.
We were probably nervous. My biggest concern coming in here is being nervous.
Three of the four guards we play all the time, this is their first deal. They
looked like it first half.  
I thought, gosh, if they would just run a little faster, they'd put us in a
track meet. Yeah, they're all stumbling around, and Wichita's a great
defensive team. We'll have to play better than this offensively. We'll have to
play at least this well defensively.  
And they have a 7‑footer that neutralizes a lot of the middle, which it
doesn't even seem fair to me. Seems like we ought to have a handicap on that,
but I don't think that's going to happen for us.  
  
Q. UNI beat you by 15 points two weeks ago. What is the difference between
two weeks ago and tonight?  
COACH JANKOVICH: I think we just kind of got it tonight. We've been very good
most of the year at home defensively. We look like a different team at home.
Then we go on the road and we didn't look the same. We never played with the
same fight. We played hard, don't get me wrong. But not understanding how to
win hard, tough road games.  
I thought we played pretty well at Northern. But we had too many break downs,
allowed too many baskets. We fell down three times, if you can believe that,
and they scored nine points on those and just falling down.  
So we thought we can guard it. I didn't think we'd guard them this well. I
didn't‑‑ I didn't see this coming. But we've worked hard since then. We've
been working hard to be able to play that way. We've had a great week of
practice. God, just the best week of practice the whole year. I can see some
things potentially where they understand you know what, you've got to be
exact. You've got to be precise. So I think that was the difference.  
  
Q. Jackie was kind of deflecting the attention to his teammates. Can you
talk about how much he meant to your team?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Wow, he's throwing up some crazy numbers. I mean 15 rebounds.
He had a 19 and a 20, and a 15, these are crazy numbers. I mean, crazy. Then
he gets five blocks and protects when we do have a break down going down the
lane. How many times did he do that? He was tremendous. Tremendous.  
I am so proud of him, because he knows how I feel last year. He wasn't ready
for what he was thrown into last year. We couldn't score. Our guard play was
not very good. He all of a sudden was asked to be the bell cow, and he wasn't
ready for that. It was a struggle, and he got inactive. This year he's like a
totally different guy.  
The whole summer, he just dedicated himself. And he's not as good as he's
going to become. He still has room. I'm telling you, he has room to get
better, and I'm really excited about some of these new rules where we can work
with them in the summer and all those kind of things. But he's been fantastic.
He was absolutely terrific tonight.  
  
Q. First time you played Wichita there, you lose by three. Second time you
get buried early at home, you come back, and it's still double digit. How do
you beat them now as well as they're playing?  
COACH JANKOVICH: We can go play them at their place, maybe, if we can move
this. The most ironic thing of the season. In no way do I mean we have some
secret, but we weren't a great road team. Everyone knows that. Lot of people
weren't this year. It was such a hard league. Lot of people didn't win a lot
of road games, and we didn't either.  
Our best one was at Wichita. We had a chance to win that game, but it was
really because we had a couple of guys just go on fire and get in a complete
heat up. That's really why.  
At home they just kind of kept a ten‑point lead. We cut it to nine. We had
three in the air with three to go. If it goes, it's six. It's a six‑point game
with three to go. Kind of threatened them, but of course it didn't.  
Jordan Threloff was a big part of that game. As soon as we lost him this week,
my first thought was Wichita and a big gulp, because he is playing better and
better all the time. He's a big body. He did a great job defensively. He kept
us in that game, I thought. And we don't have him now. I don't mean that as an
excuse, but if I can't sleep at night, you should at least know why and that's
why.  
But to beat them‑‑ I was at the hotel, and I saw the score it was like 22‑5 or
something the way it started. I know how good Indiana State is, and it's like
holy cow. That's why I asked them. Do you win when you win this game? Is that
the prize? We get to play Wichita?  
  
Q. You mentioned your young guard. In the first half they had six turnovers.
Anything you said going into the half that gave them a boost of confidence?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Nothing in a regular voice, no. But in a loud voice several
things were said to them, yeah. No, not really. I just tried to settle them
down. I figured they would do that. I was worried they would do that. I
thought we probably wouldn't shoot great because you feel a little rust. I
thought we'd turn it over more than we even did. I thought we'd make some
hurried plays. We did. So half of the halftime was spent telling everybody to
settle down and play like we've played this week in practice.  
On both sides of the ball, we just really grew up. I could see it. I kept
telling them, you're getting it. You're getting how to be an efficient team
and not beat yourself. Of course, it didn't go that way the first half, but it
certainly did the second half. That was very, very well played by our guys.  
  
Q. Obviously no coach is ever going to say that they would like to have no
seniors. This is a stupid question, but do you ever get the sense that you
kind of have a happy go lucky group? You said there was pressure tomorrow, but
knowing this won't be their last stand, so to speak?  
COACH JANKOVICH: That is a good question. I think every coach would like to
have, if you're trying to win a tournament or big game or whatever, I think
every coach would say give me a whole bunch of seniors. Seniors are going to
fight. There's going to be a different level of fight. There is going to be a
different level of don't quit, and different level of urgency. Those things
are all the best that you can have when your team takes the floor. If they
have those ingredients, and senior laden teams do, that's great. Just like I
told our guys, Moran's going to play well. I guarantee it. Moran's going to
play well. He's a senior. He's at a different level than you guys. This is his
last deal. He's been looking around going I don't get to do this ever again,
and he did. He was their leading scorer, right? I knew that would take place.  
But maybe a little, you're right. A little happy‑go‑lucky. Maybe that's not
all bad. Maybe we're not ready for the challenge tomorrow, but maybe we are.
It would be a huge, huge, huge upset. We understand that. I don't want to get
too giddy. We won this game.  
It was big for us in a lot of ways, but, again, the big prize is you get the
15th ranked team in the country who just looked like a million bucks to me in
the game before.
