_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  65  
Miami  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will give an opening view of the game and then we'll open
it up for questions for the student‑athletes, then the coach will remain after
for additional questions.  
Coach.  
COACH MEIER: Usually when you lose a game like this and it's your last game,
you have such special seniors, you're kind of devastated as a coach.  
But for some odd reason, I turned to go in that locker room and Shenise
Johnson is already in the locker room. I'm in there to tell them about lessons
of the future, how proud I am of them. Shenise is already up there running
that locker room, telling those Miami players how proud she was, how happy she
was. She never, ever could love a team more. She was proud of our efforts.  
As a coach, you get a moment like that, it's very hard to feel devastated.
Lessons have been passed on. We are a big‑time program now.  
We did not play our best basketball game, but we played as hard as we could
possibly play. Without any question, we fought and fought and fought and
fought.  
Gonzaga did a fantastic job of not turning over the ball. It wasn't for lack
of effort on our part by any means. They were very composed. I think Kelly
Graves is one of the best coaches in the country.  
I'm happy for Gonzaga, they represent women's basketball. I'm happy for this
community and that crowd. It's an awesome environment and an awesome
experience for us.  
So tough way to go down in terms of looking at the stat sheet and realizing we
only turned them over 11 times, realizing we went 1‑12 from the three and that
type of thing. I see they made four threes only, but they were four huge ones.
They made big shots. So we lose when that happens.  
But we do not feel like losers. We are very proud of ourselves. We lost to a
fantastic team who had a great game tonight. Pepper Wilson is obviously going
to be a headliner for us. That was a great thing for me as a coach to see
someone that cares so much, dominates, gets that ferocious mentality as we had
to adjust.  
We had to reinvent our team two times this year losing two starters. But there
were moments when we were executing plays that we had to bring back that we
haven't run since January to get some iso's for Pepper and looks for Mo. I'm
very proud. My hat is completely off to Gonzaga. I told them, Just keep
winning, just keep winning, because I love that team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions from the media.  
  
Q. Shenise, obviously right now it's a tough moment. With everything this
team has accomplished over the last two years, you're feelings right now.  
SHENISE JOHNSON: Yes, very far from what we were hoping for. As coach said, we
had to reinvent ourselves so many times. I'm proud of our efforts. I'm proud
of my girls. I'm proud of my team.  
There's no pity losses. We left it all out on the floor tonight. We can go
home, lay our heads on our pillows and close our eyes with no regrets. That's
what we wanted to make sure we did tonight.  
As far as how I'm feeling inside, I don't want to take my uniform off yet. I
don't want to leave this classy young lady. She has more energy than us a lot
of the time. I'm looking forward to see what Miami is going to do next year.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the environment. You talked about
playing in other venues that were pretty large. Did that seem to have a impact
on either one of you?  
SHAWNICE WILSON: It was a great crowd, but this is a crowd that we already
experienced when we played Tennessee early on in the season. The crowd didn't
have anyone rattled. I don't think, like, the crowd was a big factor. We've
seen it before.  
Plus in the ACC we have a lot of big‑time games, big‑time crowds. I don't
think the crowd too much had anyone, like, nervous. I think we were ready for
it.  
SHENISE JOHNSON: Our shootarounds consist of a lot of noise. We made sure we
did a lot of hand signals to prepare for the Gonzaga crowd. I thought it was a
great arena. Classy, classy group of fans. I'm happy to end on Gonzaga's
court.  
COACH MEIER: We were clapping, giving them an ovation when we came off the
court. Bravo to the crowd. Every arena should be like that.  
  
Q. Shenise, this team had to basically reinvent itself, like you said. Do
you have any kind of feeling what could have been maybe had Riquna been able
to be here?  
SHENISE JOHNSON: No, we have everybody who was supposed to be here. As a
whole, we believe that everything happens for a reason. No one person
(indiscernible) a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're excused. We'll continue with questions for
coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke last season when you lost to Oklahoma in the tournament
about not having the kind of presence Pepper Wilson brings was a key in that
loss. How tough was it having her go out in foul trouble?  
COACH MEIER: We were very happy we were down three at halftime. Pepper was so
efficient. She had great minutes, not just enough of them. I was debating
whether or not I could keep her on that bench. If it stayed within five, I was
going to keep her on the bench.  
But I was thrilled. I loved the second half. We got down a little bit. But
that fight when we came back and took the lead, I thought we were in great
shape, I really did.  
We just had a series of well‑executed plays for the right reasons, for the
right shots. You got to hit 'em if you want to advance. Then we got a little
bit rattled when we had to go small there at the end. We got a little behind.
We had some freshmen playing out of position just because we hadn't been
scoring a little bit quicker.  
Other than that, I'm so proud, yeah. I'm usually miserable after a loss. You
have to understand that we lost to a great team tonight. My team responded in
doing what we needed them to do. I'm just proud. I'm just proud.  
  
Q. Obviously Stefanie had a tough game, but she was attacking the basket in
the last minutes.  
COACH MEIER: No one hit. No one hit. At halftime I just said, I'm going to
come after you. I'm not going to dance around the fact that you need to hit
shots or we're not going to win. I went right at her. She had her head up,
shoulders back. She is apologizing to the team in the locker room. And they
were saying, No way, you have heart and soul, you're gritty.  
Coached a lot of years. Coached a lot of years. But this team is just special.
They're so special. Forget what they do on the basketball court. If you had a
chance to be with them this last week, it would have been the best week of
your life. They're just unbelievable. They're unbelievably tough and full of
character.  
They're in there right now still talking about what we need to do better for
next year. So I feel great as a coach. I'm disappointed. Obviously I lost two
seniors that I love and one senior that was the most versatile player that
played. Except for Nancy Lieberman, there's only two people that done what she
did on the basketball court.  
The first thing out of her mouth was taking care of the young kids, that she
was proud of them, get your shoulders back, wear Miami with pride, I'm going
to follow you, I'm going to be on you. It's why you coach. It's why you do
what we do.  
  
Q. What did they do to take you out of your style that's usually up ‑tempo?
  
COACH MEIER: You know, the reinventing part had a little bit to do with
slowing it down, taking the ball in the air, going inside.  
Gonzaga to some extent did some stuff. To some extent that was me trying to
figure out how I was going to win the basketball game, knowing that we had to
establish Pepper, too.  
They can score. I felt honestly like they probably had an advantage if this
thing got really high. The other day they asked if it was 90. If it was 90,
we're not going to win that.  
I was really happy with our defense. I mean, we gave them some points at the
line at the end. But honestly we held them under 60, without those free throws
at the end. That's an amazing team that moves the ball, shares the ball. To
hold them under 60, we should win that game.  
That was definitely purposeful on my part, feeling like we took early shots,
they were sharing the ball like that. Pepper would be at halfcourt most of the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH MEIER: Thank you all. It's been a wonderful, pleasant experience. I
really appreciate it. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  65  
Miami  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Gonzaga head coach and student‑athletes. We'll
start with an overview of the game from coach.  
COACH GRAVES: First of all, I do want to congratulate Miami on a tremendous
season. I've gotten to know Coach Meier a little bit over the last several
weeks and now having coached against her and watched her team play, I'm very
impressed.  
She's I think now one of my very favorite coaches. Her team played really
well. Tonight for two offensive teams, I thought we both showed a lot of grit
and a lot of toughness. We were just fortunate I think to make some of the
plays and some of the stops down the stretch.  
But my hat is off to Miami. But I am really very proud of my team, especially
my senior leadership up here. You know, sometimes I get on my team for being a
little bit soft, but I thought tonight we showed a lot of grit, a lot of
toughness, and we were physical. For that I'm very proud and happy that we're
moving on.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You had to be tougher down the stretch. Can you talk about the difference
of playing that type of game right from the beginning today.  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, I mean, we knew it was going to be a tough game, just
like it was on Saturday. They're a great team, all very skilled players. They
play well together, just like us. We knew it was going to be a good matchup.  
But we had to come out fighting from the beginning because they're a much
bigger and physical team than us so with had to get a jump‑start from the
beginning and carry it through to the end.  
KATELAN REDMON: Just like she said, they're very physical on the inside, we
definitely had to make sure we were battling hard. One of our big focuses was
rebounding. We had to make some space so we could get the rebounds. Just
battling down there and all around physical play. We came out hard and fought
with them.  
  
Q. Katelan, talk about the difference between Saturday and tonight for you
personally.  
KATELAN REDMON: For me personally, I struggled a little bit from the floor. I
needed to make sure I came out relaxed and continued to shoot the ball. A lot
of times I find myself leaking out a little bit. So one of my main focuses
tonight was actually going to the boards and making sure I was crashing hard
and getting the rebound.  
  
Q. You were the underdogs going into both these games. Did you ever get the
feeling you were the better team out there in either one of these games from
the beginning?  
KATELAN REDMON: We go out there and we don't like to think of ourselves as
underdogs. We know we're a very good team. They're also a very good team. We
can compete with any team out there. We go out there thinking we can win and
we did that tonight.  
  
Q. When Shawnice Wilson went to the bench early in the first half, how did
that change the conditions for your team on the floor?  
KAYLA STANDISH: With her out of the paint, we had to take advantage of that.
She's obviously a very skilled and...  
  
Q. ...formidable challenge?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, whatever that means (laughter).  
She's obviously a lot bigger and more physical. Getting her out of the paint
was a key to our success really. With her out of the paint, we're allowed to
get it in more. We had to run a lot harder when she was out. Just numerous
things we had to take advantage of her with her out of the game.  
COACH GRAVES: I was actually disappointed in the first half. I think we needed
to separate more. I don't think we took advantage of her absence in there.  
  
Q. Ladies, yesterday coach talked about a group effort to guard Shawnice
Wilson. Can you talk about how that worked out for you today, what adjustments
you had to make, what kind of an obstacle that was.  
KATELAN REDMON: One of the things we really wanted to focus on was packing in
our defense so that it was a challenge for them to even get the ball into her.
What we did on the wings when the ball went inside, we'd cover down a little
bit, force her to throw the ball back on the outside. By doing that, we help
try to keep the ball out of her hands as much as possible.  
  
Q. At the end of the game, you're last game at the athletic center, what was
that like?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Very happy to win our last game in our hometown, our home gym.
Our fans are amazing. To go out with a win like that, have all the support
we've got, we couldn't ask for a better situation.  
Being a senior, you like to go out with a good taste in your mouth on your
home floor and we did that. Yeah, being a senior, I'm very happy with what
we've done, very sad we won't be able to play in this gym again. We've still
got more games to play, so that's a good thing.  
KATELAN REDMON: She already covered it all. It feels really good to go out
with the win here at home, it being our last game here. You always want to go
out on a win. Especially me being from Spokane, playing in front of that
hometown crowd, having my family in the stands, it feels good to have my
family watch my last game here.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're excused. We'll continue with questions for
coach.  
  
Q. I was one of the experts to predicted a high ‑scoring game. Were you
surprised at that final score or did you think it was going to be something
like that?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, no, I actually thought it was going to be more on the
defensive end. Knowing Coach Meier, we both were focusing on that. I think
everybody thought like you, they thought it was going to be a high‑scoring
game.  
Typically in the NCAA tournament like this, it does come down to who plays the
better defense. Both of us played pretty well defensively tonight.  
  
Q. You talked all season about Jazmine Redmon being the sixth starter out
there for you. How important was she tonight?  
COACH GRAVES: You know, Miami forces about 23 and a half turnovers a game on
the season. We committed 11. Seemed like there were more of them. We really
did a nice job of taking care of the basketball. It wasn't always pretty. They
did a nice job of extending our possession. I mean, sometimes we didn't have a
lot of time to score.  
But Jazmine has been terrific all year. I actually give her a lot of credit
defensively. I thought she did a really good job with Shenise Johnson. That's
one of the best players in the country. Jazmine just fought her like crazy. I
thought she did just a really good job.  
No one player can take her. We had to defend her as a team. But I thought
Jazmine did by far the best job on her tonight.  
  
Q. Do you ever get tired being considered the underdog? Do you ever feel
like you are the better team?  
COACH GRAVES: You know, we take whatever they give us. It honestly doesn't
matter. It doesn't affect how we play. This is a group now that has gone to
three straight Sweet 16s. We never consider ourselves an underdog. I think
we're a really good team.  
Where they seed us they seed us. That doesn't bother me. But we're good. We're
gritty. We have a lot of different players that can contribute and do things.  
What I'm most proud of with this group is every single night it's somebody
different. Sometimes every half it's somebody different. I'm proud of my team.
I wouldn't trade this group for anybody.  
I'm telling you, this is a good basketball team. It's not always pretty. We've
been used to pretty around here. But these guys are good. This team is
effective.  
  
Q. Obviously you talked about how winning the turnovers tonight was huge to
winning. Seemed like when you were trying to break that press, how important
was it having a big that can handle the ball against that kind of pressure?  
COACH GRAVES: That's an area Kayla has really gotten better in. As she
progresses in her pro career, it's going to be something she has to be able to
do, is handle the basketball. I'm actually really comfortable with the ball in
her hands. I prefer it not to be because that means we're doing other things
better. I'd rather have her down finishing.  
At times she has to be a pressure release for us. She's comfortable with it.
She makes good decisions. Kayla from time to time, you have to, C'mon, Kayla,
let's go, which works great in press situations. She's always under control
and confident and composed.  
Yeah, she played big all weekend. She played big.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about when Haiden...  
COACH GRAVES: I hope they didn't get that on camera. It was my attempt at a
chest bump. If you want to know the truth, that play, that loose ball
epitomized our game tonight. That's what made me so excited. There was no quit
in her.  
The one thing about Haiden, she does some things from time to time, head
scratcher, and I don't have much hair left to scratch, but then she'll come
back and do something like that. It energizes the team.  
I think she epitomizes what this group is about. We play with heart. We're
tough. I just got a little emotional there for a little bit (laughter).  
A chest bump from me is a really ugly thing. Then I grabbed her head and kind
of squeezed it a little bit. But you know what, my team actually enjoyed it.
It's something they'll talk about for a long time, I guess.  
I tell you, after that play, I just thought, you know what, this is going to
end well for us.  
  
Q. A lot of people might argue with this crowd, home crowd, it's an
advantage against these higher ‑ranked teams. Is that taking away from how
well your girls are playing?  
COACH GRAVES: It's a great question. I've tried to deflect the importance of
the crowd. Listen, we love playing here. Our crowd is terrific. This is an
atmosphere that you don't find anywhere else in women's college basketball,
nowhere. It's terrific. It's good for the game.  
I think everybody goes in knowing what the rules are. We bid on it. We get to
host.  
Ultimately, listen, good teams win on the road. That's why they're good teams.
That's why they get high seeds. I just think it comes down to the execution on
the court. So I've tried to deflect it, even though I realize that it is
important. But we have a good team and we executed on the floor.  
Tonight they gave us a lift. There were some times with the shot clock winding
down, I think Miami was a little bit confused because they couldn't hear. So
they definitely are an advantage for us.  
But I don't want that to overshadow the fact that we're a pretty good team
that executes well and plays hard.  
  
Q. One of the first things Coach Meier addressed is the fact you had big
shots. Can you talk about that against Rutgers, Miami tonight, the ability to
hit those shots?  
COACH GRAVES: I'm just blessed with those kind of players. I have gamers. It's
Kelly Bowen, Haiden Palmer, Taelor Karr. You go on and on, it's always
somebody different. I have a lot of confidence in them to shoot. We like to
get the ball up, shoot a lot.  
They've been in this situation. This was the 11th NCAA tournament game for
this senior class. That's a lot of experience. So they've been in those
moments. They expect to make 'em. I know they have confidence in taking those
shots because I have confidence in them to take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Graves.  
COACH GRAVES: Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  86  
Rutgers  73

  
COACH STRINGER: You can ask me any questions.  
  
Q. Just general impressions about your defensive play and Gonzaga's
offensive play.  
COACH STRINGER: I think we had to pick it up. We had to be much more intense,
and that's why we changed, started picking it up to the full court level,
which wasn't what we intended to do. We were hoping that we would get them‑‑
cover their transition much better, but we weren't. And they are a very good
team, and Kayla and Bowen, the whole group, Palmer, they did what they were
supposed to do. We studied them on tape, and it was nothing new; they did what
they did. Obviously I thought our defense would be more destructive, although
I think when we began to put more pressure in the backcourt, they were having
problems running the half court offense, and so that was one key, because once
they got it into the half court, they had nice size and people that had nice
skills, and they were able to get the stops today. I hoped to double the big
girl on the inside. We obviously didn't, and she did everything.  
We knew that Palmer had had 28‑point games, and it could have been any one of
them, but we played hard, extremely hard. It just wasn't our day. We seemed to
be just a half step‑‑ I'm not sure why, but maybe a half step short, a half
step slow, but we worked hard, extremely hard.  
I'm sure that they could appreciate the energy, the enthusiasm of the team and
certainly the fans. It was a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. True to your word, your freshmen saw more minutes today than they did in
the Big East Tournament. What did you see out of them today?  
COACH STRINGER: You said true to my words that the freshmen were going to play
more minutes? Yeah, because I needed to tell the upperclassmen some things
that were going on. It was loud in there as you know, so we couldn't just
yell. We had to make substitutions so that we could personally tell them and
give them a chance to see what was going on.  
One of the things in particular is that there was a big girl that was coming
down for the block, and when it happens, it forces us to not send as many
people to the offensive boards, and yet they seemed to be getting that second
and third opportunity at the beginning.  
It wasn't anything intentional. It didn't matter, it was just a matter of
putting people in that we thought could make a difference, maybe a size versus
another player that they were playing. But they shot the ball well, rebounded
the ball well, did what they do.  
  
Q. Khadijah, noticeably you looked like you twisted your ankle in the first
half and were limping after that. How big a factor was that the rest of the
game for you?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: It wasn't a factor at all. I twisted it, but I got it taped.
I was fine. My adrenaline was going, so I did my best to play through it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, just thoughts on the crowd and how they might
have played a factor, especially when you guys were trying to mount a comeback
in the second half.  
APRIL SYKES: They were supposed to play with that. They're at home. At Rutgers
our crowd probably would have played a factor. That's an advantage you have
playing at home, and they have a great crowd, great atmosphere to play in. The
team responded to their crowd, so they went on runs and we couldn't sustain
it, so they got the upper hand today, and that's how they won the game.  
  
Q. Erica, in this game and also the game against UConn, you really haven't
shied away from the big moments. How have you changed your game to be able to
put together that effort for 40 minutes?  
ERICA WHEELER: Just mainly playing for another day, just mainly playing hard
for the seniors. The seniors really deserve to play for a long time because
they work hard, and you have Khadijah that came back for a fifth year, so she
really deserves it, to play in extra games, so I was just mainly playing hard
for the seniors. That was it.  
  
Q. Erica, you and Haiden Palmer were having a pretty good one ‑on‑one battle
at times. She nailed some shots. She looked to me like she was right in your
face several times. You drained threes. What can you say about her game and
the little battle between the two of you?   
ERICA WHEELER: She's definitely a great player. She was knocking down shots,
we both were knocking down shots, but credit to her that she's just a great
player and I was just competing. That's what I do. I was just competing.  
  
Q. You referenced the full court you went into earlier maybe a little bit
earlier than you had planned, the pressure defense, but it did have a visible
effect on Gonzaga, 19 turnovers, and that keyed your comeback in the second
half, but if the players could go into what it was like during the comeback
and if there was a moment you thought you might have been able to take this
game.  
APRIL SYKES: We were supposed to press for the whole game. It's hard to get
into a press when you're not scoring the basketball. We weren't making shots,
we weren't getting to the free‑throw line. But other than that you have to
make shots to get into your press. You can't get into a press when
(indiscernible) break, so it was complicated. The game plan for us was score,
get inside, press, and it's hard to do when you're not scoring the basketball
how you should, and that's what made us struggle so much.  
  
Q. Can you girls talk about the first ten minutes when you got into a hole
and you weren't making those shots? Were you pressing or what did you feel
about the offense in the first ten minutes?  
APRIL SYKES: It was kind of confusing at first because they was just packing
it in on us. One time it looked like a man, the next time it looked like a
match‑up zone, so it was confusing. We couldn't hear each other and the crowd
was loud, and they were making shots. We can't match any team for threes.
We're not a three‑point shooting team, and when we're not getting it down low
to Monique and when we're not penetrating and finishing drives and lay‑ups,
that makes the game long for us, when they're coming down and executing and
scoring.  
The first ten minutes we were getting shots at the rim, we just weren't
finishing lay‑ups. It was frustrating for us, but we never stopped playing.  
  
Q. Khadijah, Gonzaga was having their way with their fast break offense. How
did that affect your own play as a point guard?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: That was actually one of the things that we've been working
on for the last week, just trying to make sure that we stop them in
transition. We compared their transition game to UConn, and we felt we did
fairly well when it came to that, and just tonight, I don't know, we just‑‑ we
rushed that too slowly you could say. It's difficult when you have a team
that's getting out in transition and they've got wings that are out there
hitting threes or they've got a post that's in there just grinding and being
able to finish. I mean, it was tough for us and we struggled a lot.  
  
Q. There was a moment in the second half where after a made basket you tried
to get the referee's attention and call a time ‑out but it didn't seem like
they could hear you amid the crowd noise. Can you talk about that, how big a
factor that played today?   
COACH STRINGER: Well, I mean, for them it was a great atmosphere. Great,
great, it pumps you up. But the problem was when I was trying to get the
attention of our guards, which we're experienced to know at these events, but
we weren't enough. We couldn't hear each other.  
Like there were several times, you'd have hand signals, but withinsome of the
patterns that we run, there's very specific tips that we're looking for, and
the point guard, I was trying to get her attention, and I told her what we
were trying to do, but by the time it was communicated to everybody else, 12
seconds were off the clock and we're scrambling. Then I'd have to substitutes
at times to get the message clear in terms of what we were getting at. That
was really disappointing. So it might break the rhythm of the player on the
floor, saying what did I do wrong. It's nothing you did wrong, so I said, we
need to communicate something very specifically that they need to do, because
they couldn't hear.  
It was a great atmosphere, probably looked great on television, and it was
good for them. And the rest of us who are playing just got to learn to play in
that particular atmosphere. That's what it's like playing away from home.  
But you've just got to be able to handle that, and we didn't. I wouldn't say
that would be a totally‑‑ this is a very, very good team, and they execute
extremely well. I mean, they're blue‑collar workers, if you will, blood and
guts. They go after everything.  
I think the one thing that we knew is that good defense will never fail you.
If you just play defense, defense will not fail you. We weren't doing that as
well in the first half, and as well in the first half, we were settling for
jumpers, and when you're in other people's place that's great if you can hit
some, but great frankly you need to go to the hole, and I knew that. We knew
that. But we worked ourselves into such a hole in that first half that it
became extremely difficult in the second half to get out of that.  
They were shooting threes, but these are their rims and they know them and
they could shoot them well. We haven't shot extremely well from the
three‑point line all year, so we need just to be a lot more poised, a lot more
comfortable, and take our time to see what they were doing. But they did a
great job. They're well‑coached. The players play extremely well.  
The fans should be credited because they truly are great fans. I'm sure that
they don't have all their fans because some of their fans are probably
supporting the guys. So that's a real testimony to the kind of support that
Gonzaga has. I feel like I would rather play in a loud, boisterous atmosphere
than to play in a quiet atmosphere.  
  
Q. Can you reflect a little bit on the intensity and fight shown by Erica
and a couple of the freshmen in the second half, midway through the second
half, and also, do you think the trip across the country maybe contributed to
that, being that half step late on plays?  
COACH STRINGER: You know, I'm going to just be tempted to say what I think
quite honestly, so I'm going to give you these words, okay: We enjoyed our
trip. It was very good. We got a chance to meet and we had a nice long
conversation. It was wonderful. Okay? That was good.  
And Khadijah, I credit her because I saw that she was hurt, but she didn't
look for that. I think that an athlete understands that's the arena that you
compete in. That's the arena we competed in. That's the arena that we compete
in. If you want to know what I really think, I'll tell you later but not now.  
  
Q. You've been speaking all year about how the team puts in great effort
even when they're not shooting the ball particularly well. But they still
managed 73 points today, which is from what I can remember a good total for
them. How much does their effort and will to win, how much did that play into
it?  
COACH STRINGER: That's the thing. That's what Erica was saying about the
seniors having gone through the things that they have this year. I'm sure that
they could tell you a story. It hurts because we couldn't ask more for
Khadijah. They played their hearts out, and to score as many points as they
did says a lot.  
But we got into the same thing that we did against UConn. I think that with
less than nine minutes to go in the game we were within nine at UConn, but
what killed us is what happened in the first ten minutes, and that's also what
killed us today. It was a bit much to overcome. We just need to be settled and
a little more confident. It's not to blame them because this team did
everything that it possibly could. I really admire, appreciate, respect the
kind of effort. A coach couldn't be more proud of her players than I was of
the effort and the way our team played today. I don't hang my head. I'm sad
because I wish that they could play a little bit longer because they really
deserve to.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Miami  70  
Idaho State  41

  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Well, first off, congratulations to Miami. They did a nice
job. They played some great defense and they scored enough points. I think
with them missing one of their best players, they could have very easily had a
bad game or had a bad attitude and just not performed very well, but my hats
off to them. They did a great job.  
I thought that we really struggled to shoot the ball in the second half, first
half and second half. Early on ‑‑ we counted in the locker room at halftime,
we missed six lay‑up attempts, not that they were all uncontested, but we
missed some easy shots. We missed some perimeter shots that maybe we normally
would have hit. I don't know what you attribute that to. Maybe it's just
jitters being at the national tournament. Maybe we just‑‑ bad night shooting,
I don't know.  
Second half, I felt like we still played hard. I think we rushed some shots in
the second half, a little panicky, just wanting to get back in the game,
wanting to make plays, and I understand that, but we continued to miss open
shots that we normally might have a good chance of making.  
Miami's length and athleticism really bothered us. Any time we tried to make a
long pass, they could really cover a lot of ground and intercept passes or
deflect passes. They did a nice job with that. And in a nutshell, that's it.  
I'm very proud of our team to make it to this point. I told them in the locker
room, they helped me make a dream of mine come true. You know, as a coach you
work hard your whole life, and you hope you get an opportunity to be a head
coach someday, and you hope that you have a team‑‑ you can put a team good
enough together that can make a run to make a championship, to maybe play in
the NCAA Tournament, and they've helped me, they really helped me.  
I'm sure we've made some other dreams come true along the way, but I told them
I'm very appreciative of everything they've done. I'm very proud of them,
very, very proud of them, and I told them I am indebted to them the rest of my
life. They helped me make a lifelong dream come true.  
  
Q. Kaela, question for you: This team is young. You only lose one senior in
Chelsea sitting next to you. What do you take away from the whole Big Sky
Tournament, now the NCAA Tournament, that helps you going into next year?  
KAELA OAKES: Right now I feel very blessed to have the people I do on my team,
and of course we're going to miss Chelsea. She's a major asset to what we do,
but I think like we've always done, we've always just had someone step up,
whether it's my game or Vella's game or Chelsea's game or Cydney's game. And I
think that we're going to be able to flourish next year, and we're going to
have the extra experience, and the people that were younger this year are
going to be a year older. I think we're going to really take advantage of
that. Some other teams are losing some really good players, and I think that's
even going to be a better opportunity for us, so I'm really looking forward to
next year, even though we'll miss Chels.  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: I agree with Kaela. Chelsea is a huge asset. She does so much
for us, not just stuff that you see with stats but just little things. She's a
hustle player for us and a major role player. But it's nice because we have so
many younger people coming in. On any given night any one of us can step up
and play, but I'm looking forward to next year, even though we don't have
Chelsea.  
  
Q. Chelsea, as the season winds now, now your college career is over, what
goes through your mind as you realize that's the last game that you'll play?  
CHELSEA PICKERING: It's bittersweet, of course. You never want anything to
end, especially going into the NCAA. You hope to at least win one game, be the
Cinderella team. But now I just get to sit back and relax. I mean, I'm going
to miss it, but my plans are to continue playing basketball overseas. Give it
a month, relax, and then get back to work.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what did you have to do out there to adjust your
game to the sheer size of your opponents?  
CHELSEA PICKERING: We really didn't adjust to anything. We kept going at them,
and that was something that was probably not the best thing to do because once
you drive and have two or three people collapsed on you we should have kicked
it out. That was one thing we should have adjusted and could have. But other
than that, our game was the same. We just didn't execute it as well.  
KAELA OAKES: As a point guard I felt like I had to kind of adjust my passes,
they needed to be a little bit quicker, they needed to be not so long. We were
getting a lot of our long passes picked off. And I just felt like it was more
difficult to drive and dish and get to do what is normally easier for me to
do. Their athleticism and their long arms and being able to cover the floor
like Coach said was definitely a very good‑‑ it was really tough as a point
guard especially to do that.  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: They were just really aggressive and, as Kaela said, jumping
in the passing lanes, and I think we need to have been smarter and made better
decisions. But we tried to stay aggressive and tried to stick with our game
like we usually do, it just didn't work as well as it normally does.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, you said they were aggressive. Would you say this is the most
aggressive opponent you guys have faced?  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: I think they're the most athletic group we've ever faced.
Sacramento State are fairly aggressive in how they press us. But I think their
aggression with their athleticism was definitely an asset for them.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, speaking of aggressiveness, there was a couple moments in that
game, a hard foul from you, first half you got in a couple players' faces.
Were you trying to inspire the team or what happened with the aggression back
and forth, especially the one where she got up in your face and pushed you
back?  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: It's just play of the game. I'm going to stay my ground and do
my thing, and if she wants to get in my face, that's her business. But it's
just play of the game, really. I'm just trying to stay aggressive within my
own game.  
  
Q. And Chelsea, was it shots not going, or was it Miami's defense that
caused those shots not to go?  
CHELSEA PICKERING: We had wide‑open shots, we just clearly missed. I remember
one time‑out we had seven O‑boards to their five, so we were getting in the
mix but our shots just weren't falling, and that's that.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, could you just talk about what it's like going against that big
a player? That's pretty unusual obviously.  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: Yeah, she's probably one of the biggest players that we've
gone against, but we've played against a 6'8" girl, too. It's hard, you've got
to be physical with them within the limits of the game, but we just tried to
take it at them, but it didn't pay off tonight.  
  
Q. You and your players mentioned the length and the aggressiveness of
Miami, but both that press and almost like a swarming one ‑two‑two hybrid
one‑three‑one defense, what was that like?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: It was tough. It was a one‑one‑three, especially in the
second half, then they extended full court, and it would fall back into a
one‑one‑three or two‑three half court. They did that once they had a sizable
lead. In the first half it was primarily man‑to‑man, switching. They could
switch every screen. They did a nice job of knowing who to back off of and
helping in the lane. You saw No.40 in the lane the whole night, Wilson, and
they had a good game plan. But it's tough to play against.  
Like similar to what Ashleigh said, we've played against aggressive teams
before, but we haven't played against aggressive teams of that size and
athleticism before.  
  
Q. Ashleigh had a little bit of success tonight; she scored 12 points. Do
you think Miami was surprised by her ability to shoot from the outside?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Possibly. Possibly. They watch film, too. They should have
seen the film and watched the stats, looked at the stats. I think she just was
able to get open shots.  
Ashleigh is a tough match‑up just because she can hit the perimeter shot, so
if they go bigger, it's usually someone that she's able to be quicker than,
and if they want to help off of her, she can hit open outside shots. But I
think Ashleigh just put forth the right effort to get open. She made great
cuts. She made good reads and just put herself in position to make shots.  
  
Q. Your team went up against girls twice their size. Do you think the fact
that they didn't back down is a testament to their true strength and desire
and determination?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Absolutely. That's kind of how we've been the whole year. If
we're not better than you then we're just going to try to outwork you. That's
our motto. It's written above the doorway in our locker room, "outwork them."
It doesn't matter who we're going against; we're going to scrap and we're
going to play hard, and if we're not as talented as you, we're going to try to
outwork you.  
  
Q. Is it encouraging knowing that that you're only losing Chelsea this
year?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Yeah, yeah, I think we have a very good team returning next
year, four starters returning, and then you've got some people on the bench
who are really developing nicely. Jessa Jeppesen is getting much better, a lot
of our freshmen will be in position to play more. I think our red shirt,
Justine Joudrey, is going to be a very good player. She's got size with the
ability to shoot and handle the ball and get to the basket. She's just got a
great feel for the game.  
So I think our future looks good, looks really good.  
  
Q. Forcing 20 turnovers, obviously that's something you want to do every
game, but what were you able to do as a team to force them into so many
mistakes?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Well, we didn't cause the turnovers by getting up and
pressing, obviously. You saw the game. But what we did was anticipate well and
help off the right people, double‑team where we could. We took charges when we
could. Ash Vella took two really big charges. You probably heard them before
you saw them. And I think we just helped each other out well. We played good
team defense. We got deflections; we knew where to help; we knew what people
could do and what they couldn't do. We backed off the non‑shooters and stayed
tighter on the people who could shoot.  
I thought we did a really good job on No.3 in the first half. She's one of
their top three scorers, and we held her to, I think, two in the first half,
getting all the way out on her.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Miami  70  
Idaho State  41

  
COACH MEIER: I guess you've got to start talking about our defense. Idaho
State has some great players, especially that starting lineup of theirs. They
can really score and they take really nice shots. When you look at those
numbers, you've got some of those really great players that they're 10, 10, 10
and 11, and they were 3 for 10, 1 for 10‑‑ that's our defense, because really,
really for them, they're really a nice flow team. They run good sets. They
made us work very, very hard and cover the court.  
You know, north‑souths we're good at. East‑west is something we've been
working on in terms of court coverage, and they're a great sideline to
sideline team. They move the ball so well. We exhausted ourselves, but it
worked out well for us because I think that the tempo and our defense was the
story of the game.  
  
Q. Talk about how you had absolute confidence in this team and you come up
with your most lopsided win ever in the tournament. Just talk about the team's
mental state. I would think coming into this game it seemed like everything
was ‑‑  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. I told you yesterday that I knew we would play our tails
off. I knew we would. Nobody held back. We have a saying that you have to
support the pressure. If I'm going to go out on a limb and exhaust myself on
ball pressure, then the other four behind me better support that effort. And
we supported the pressure today, and whatever defense we were in, somebody was
working, working, working that point guard. I think we really grinded out
their point guards. They started the game and they had their head up, and by
the end of the game ‑‑ by the very end of the game I think we had worn them
down.  
But that was probably seven different people that had that job for us, and we
just kept rotating, rotating, rotating, but it was all for the support behind
them.  
You'll be a little riskier if you know your team has got your back behind you,
and that's what tonight ended up being.  
  
Q. Just talk about the size advantage inside, getting the ball to Pepper,
getting the ball to Sylvia early and the way you just dominated inside.  
SHAWNICE "PEPPER" WILSON: Well, I knew coming into this game that I would have
an advantage. Obviously I'm 6'6", and their tallest player is about 6'1",
6'2". So before the game we discussed how it's important for us to use our
size and our strength as an advantage, so we talked about it, and our main
thing was just execute, and we came out on top.  
  
Q. Shenise, can you talk about the team's play in the first half and how you
guys were able to jump out and sort of take control of the team, your work
especially in that half?  
SHENISE JOHNSON: Yes, we also talked about that yesterday, as well, in the
press conference. We didn't want to come down on our heels, we wanted to
dictate everything that happened out there, and we showed that tonight. We
were very excited. We wanted to show who we were and just take an opportunity
to basically show who Miami is, and we were on our toes tonight.  
  
Q. Shenise, question about Idaho State and what you saw from them out
there.  
SHENISE JOHNSON: They moved the ball very well. They had a lot of screens and
a lot of action going on. We had to stay alert the entire game. They cut in
front of our face a lot of times. Coach kept yelling at us, saying, Don't let
them cut in front of your face, but we couldn't help it. But we had people
behind us supporting it. But I thought Idaho State did a great job of moving
the ball, as I said previously. They were very scrappy, physical, and they
played their hearts out, as well.  
  
Q. Coach Meyer, it seemed like Idaho State really wanted to get physical
with you guys. There was a couple times where players were back and forth, a
hard foul. What did you see from them?  
COACH MEIER: Well, we expect that. We expect it and respect it. Go ahead and
come at us. We want to be great and we want to be challenged, and we want
somebody to find something that they think we're not great at and try to
expose us for it because this whole season we've just been on a journey, and I
think they thought one of their advantages was to push us off some of our cuts
and try to slow us down, and I think that was really smart. He's a great
coach. I loved it, I loved seeing it, and I loved how we responded to it.  
  
Q. You held them to 16 points in the first half. I know that was a season
low for Idaho State. How good was your defense compared to the rest of your
games this year?  
COACH MEIER: I think that we had a complete and 100 percent commitment to each
other on the defensive end. I think there was no question that we understood
our schemes.  
I told you yesterday, too, we're a very conceptual team. If we get our
concepts and we see it developing, then we can play to our instincts, and I
thought the staff did a nice job of prepping that, and we saw some
opportunities that we could get and then you could see them unfolding that
made us even faster than we are, that made us quicker than we are, because we
had done a great job mentally of preparing and visualizing what we thought our
opportunities would be. That's why it was so fun for me to see some of those
freshmen making some high‑level reads and steals like Suriya McGuire, Michelle
Woods, just broke on the ball.  
My favorite play of the game, however, was Pepper's steal from the backcourt,
and she broke on the ball. That's not something that we practice a lot, that
we want Pepper to be breaking on the ball for what we call the pick six, and I
thought she did a fantastic job. Pepper was really into it today, and I was
really happy for her.  
  
Q. Would you talk a little bit about obviously a different lineup and how
that affected your pattern rotations and things like that and how they
responded to it?  
COACH MEIER: Right. I think we probably had less possessions as we sort of
kicked through more of our offensive sets a little bit, and not as much of our
early offense showed up and then not as much of our late offense showed up for
the first ten seconds of the shot clock and the last ten. We're just a
different team now.  
So we talked about that in our preparation, and we talked about it just now in
the locker room, how we can't just sort of jog through our basic sets and then
think that there's a ten, nine, eight, seven, six thing waiting for us. It's
not. So we just have to grow up a little bit more.  
But I actually think‑‑ I haven't seen my stats, but we talk about one point
per possession. We try to be a one‑point‑per‑possession team. I actually
thought, except for our turnovers, which I think is a function of just being
disjointed and having some lineups that are different, but offensively in
terms of execution we probably were right about at a point per possession, it
was just less possessions for us.  
  
Q. I guess obviously this is a close ‑knit group. Facing adversity the way
you are coming into this tournament, do you see it even more so off the court?
Did you notice it just in the body language today?   
COACH MEIER: I'll tell you what: Adversity is something that that's not‑‑ we
don't have any real adversity. We have opportunity right now, we really do.
You know, I grew up in a family where my mother was pregnant with me and had
three kids and she was 27 years old and my father was killed in a plane crash.
That's adversity. We're talking about a sport here. We're talking about
basketball. We're talking about opportunity. And that's just how I see life.
So something happened and we turned it into an opportunity, and I'm happy for
everyone that did.  
  
Q. I talked with Idaho State a little bit about your pressure defense, more
so the one ‑one‑three, the two‑three. Can you go into that, what you try to
look for? Obviously you have a lot of length on the defensive end, but what
are you trying to disrupt most in other teams on the defensive end?   
COACH MEIER: Yeah, I think that it starts with the ball pressure, and it's
very hard to ask somebody to absolutely exhaust themselves every possession,
but that's their job, okay, so if you're on the point guard and we're just
asking you just grind your legs, burn your legs, you'll see the language we
just keep talking, it doesn't work unless point A is pressure and that person
is one of the most unselfish players on our team. Whoever it is at that time
is just totally giving to the team. They're not going to get to see it.
They're not going to get any stats for it. They're going to be exhausted, and
they just have to basically suck it up and do it.  
And to see everybody willing to do that today started the whole attitude of,
okay, well, if you're going to kill yourself on that ball there, I'm not going
to let you down behind you. I was very proud. I hope it was fun to watch
because I saw it unveil, I thought, I'm really proud of this team, this is
really awesome. This was like a symphony of response, and it was beautiful for
me. But that's how I love to coach. That's why I coach. I love people to be
there for each other.  
  
Q. Krystal moves into the starting lineup, got a couple quick fouls. How
much did that bother you, because you probably wanted her to get a lot of
minutes with that group?  
COACH MEIER: Well, Krystal and Stef were both in foul trouble, and you would
think, wow, we're exposed now, and it just‑‑ the next person slid in and did
their job and we slid in with freshmen and they slid in and did their job and
then we had to take care of the ball a little bit and execute and go into the
post, and the points in the paint ‑‑ and for us to get 32 points in the paint
and for our bench to outscore any other team's bench 23 to 8 is a very big
deal for the University of Miami, and that's nice. I just think we've
adjusted, we'll move forward, and we responded in a way I really needed them
to.  
  
Q. Having seen Gonzaga, can you talk about your impressions of them?  
COACH MEIER: I'm not going to get a lot of sleep from now until that game.
They are awesome. They are awesome. They are awesome. Everything that I'm just
bragging about my team, you can just turn around and say right about Gonzaga
in terms of how they share the ball. They're in sync. I came just for the
second half, but when they need a big three, it's not just one person who can
hit it. Their end‑of‑the‑shot‑clock threes tonight were unbelievable, and I
just wish it was the same kid, but it wasn't. We've got a lot of work to do.
We've got a lot of court that we have to cover.  
They have our respect. They're an incredibly talented team and just so, so, so
well coached. I almost have jealousy about how well coached they are. They're
unbelievable. They get it in terms of concept, in terms of vision, in terms of
finding the open player. They're unbelievable. They've got a heck of a cast.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 17, 2012

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Haiden Palmer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23610)

### [Kayla Standish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23611)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  86  
Rutgers  73

  
COACH GRAVES: Well, first of all, I do want to congratulate Rutgers on a great
season. Coach Stringer obviously is an idol of a lot of people, a lot of young
coaches, and just a really classy woman, spent some time with our team
yesterday, and I know it meant a lot to them.  
You know, they're a terrific team, but tonight I was just really proud of how
hard we played. That was the main thing. I thought right from the get‑go, we
came out, had a great defensive game plan that they executed perfectly, and we
played hard and got a lot of the hustle balls, the loose balls, the rebounds,
and when you play a team like Rutgers, you'd better play physical and you'd
better play hard, or it's going to be a long night. I'm just really proud of
our team.  
  
Q. Haiden, everyone was talking about how you did have to match this team
physically, and Kelly mentioned there wasn't a team that you had seen that was
this physical, and I know it was a factor but you made it look like it wasn't
much of a factor. Can you talk about just playing with that kind of
physicality and matching this team today?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, that was one of our focuses because we knew they were so
physical, so we just tried to pack it in a little more so it didn't matter as
much when they tried to push us off screens and stuff like that. But when they
did we boxed out hard and did the little things like you said and just tried
to be tougher than them, play physical.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about the first ten minutes of the game and what the
team was able to accomplish in getting a big lead?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, the first ten minutes we came out and got off to a good
start, pushing the ball, making our shots.  
Our defensive end I think was‑‑ should be noted because we followed the game
plan like Coach and Haiden both had said. We weren't allowing them to get in
the paint as much as they would like to, so just our defensive end I think
really helped us go forward with our offense.  
  
Q. Talking with the Rutgers players, it was brought up that Haiden, you
caught a one ‑on‑one battle in the second half with Erica Wheeler. What was it
like going against her?   
HAIDEN PALMER: She just hit some tough shots towards the end. Great player,
but we won the game today. I won.  
  
Q. Kayla, just talk about the team's ability down the stretch to answer them
when they looked like they were going to make a push.  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, we made some big buckets. We also made some big free
throws. We got to the free‑throw line numerous times in the last couple
minutes. So yeah, we made‑‑ I guess our offensive plan was to get to the
bucket, and I think we did that, and in different ways, our wings were making
big shots and we were getting it inside a few times, so I think our offensive
plan worked today.  
  
Q. If you could both kind of talk a little bit about you were just so
scrappy on defense, and I think that ‑‑ to me that seemed like it was the
game. Can you talk about how maybe the crowd energized you? You never seemed
to let up. Talk about how the crowd maybe fed that a little bit.   
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, first of all, we knew they were going to come out and
play really well. They're a defensive oriented team, so we tried to come out
battling before they could. And then obviously our fans, it was very loud in
there. They were on our side the whole time, so it only helps with our
momentum.  
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, same thing. That was our game plan. We knew we were they
were physical, so we couldn't be back on our heels, and the crowd just kept
the momentum going. It's tiring playing like that, and every time I would get
tired they would just stand up and start cheering.  
  
Q. Haiden, obviously a really physical game, but there were gaps that you
seemed to ‑‑ and also you, Kayla, seemed to exploit in the midrange. Can you
talk about what you were trying to find on offense, what you were going for,
especially just seeing match‑ups and finding your shots?   
HAIDEN PALMER: Well, since they were playing so physical and quick, they would
get out of position sometimes. If anyone would drive they would all kind of
crash and that would leave people on the three‑point line open, and just like
you said, try to find open spots and get open shots.  
  
Q. Haiden, can you just talk about finally being on the floor for your first
NCAA Tournament game and what that was like for you?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Oh, it was amazing. I had to stop myself from crying after the
game actually. Biggest game of my life. It was a lot of fun, especially at
home with the crowd, and I love these guys, so it was great getting that win.  
  
Q. On the same lines, how much of a relief is it to get this one based on
what you guys did last year, the pressure of playing in front of your home
crowd, and obviously you being a senior not wanting to go out this early?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Well, it's nice we won our first game. It's another game
closer to our goal. We'll go out and watch this next game, see who we've got
to prepare for. I know the coaches will put together a great game plan just
like they did for this previous game. If we follow the game plan like we did
today and hit open shots like we have been, I think it'll help carry us over.  
Being a senior, it's really nice to not go out on your first game, so yeah,
just carrying our momentum forward till Monday and get some good night rest
and some good food in us.  
  
Q. After the regular season finale against BYU you spoke to the crowd just
about how this team for the last four years is one of the five winningest
programs in the country along with teams like UConn, and today Coach Stringer
was saying that this team was the closest she'd seen to what they'd seen
against UConn. Can you talk about what this program has gone through where
you're being compared to a powerhouse?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I'll tell you, Coach Stringer is a classy woman, there's
no question about it, and a great coach. Connecticut has won a lot more
national championships than we have, so we'll end the comparison there.  
I think what she was saying when we talked yesterday is we move the basketball
around. You know, we're not a traditional team as far as we don't really look
to break people down on the dribble. Seems like a lot of teams try to do that.
We still do it the old‑fashioned way. We set screens and we hit open jump
shots and we move the ball to different people. But that's quite a compliment
coming from a coach like Coach Stringer. That's pretty cool. But we've got a
ways to go before that comparison is more apt.  
  
Q. When I asked Haiden about her first game, can you talk about her going
off in her first NCAA game?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, she's terrific. She's an amazing player, and when she's
on, she can be one of those players that is difficult to stop. I call it every
once in a while she goes Dwyane Wade on us. There's a reason she wears No.3.
She likes him. She likes to play like him. And from time to time he gets into
those stretches where he can't miss, and sometimes that's good and sometimes
that's bad because I thought from time to time there were some bad shots
taken. But the reality is she's fearless. She is a fearless basketball player,
and even when maybe something doesn't go well for her, she'll make it up with
a key steal or a loose ball that she runs down or a big rebound.  
Tonight she took a charge. She had five steals, she had four assists, she had
20 some odd points. That's quite a night against a really good team. So I'm
just really proud of her, and in her first big game like this in the NCAA
Tournament to come up like that says a lot about her, about her character.  
  
Q. You said yesterday they're the toughest team you've seen, I think, ever.
Do you feel like you ‑‑ or the hardest playing team that you've seen ever. Do
you feel like you out‑toughed them for the majority of the game and how big of
a key was that for you guys?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I don't know if we out‑toughed them, but I thought we
stood up to them, no question about it. That's their game; they're physical,
they're tough. We've talked about that 100 times already. But we knew that we
had to play that way, and it's in us. You know, it's in us. It doesn't always
come out, but it did tonight, and I thought it did right from the start, and I
think that was really important.  
I thought we set the tone defensively, and sometimes that has not been the
case for us. We've tried to outscore people early and then get tough late. And
I thought tonight they really focused on being tough early, and then that
toughness showed throughout the game. I mean, we built a lead and then they
would come back, and then we would answer the call and build it back up, and
they would come back like great teams do. But every time they made a run, it
seems like we had the answer, and you do that when you're tough, and tonight
we played tough. That +8 on the rebounds is always a telltale sign of a team
playing physical and being tough.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  72  
Purdue  61

  
COACH VERSYP: South Carolina played a great basketball game tonight. Their
guards collectively had 60 points, which obviously really hurt us. So hats off
to them. We wish them the best of luck. Our kids played exceptionally hard. We
did a lot of good things, but they were just a little better.  
  
Q. KK, how much did their defense disrupt what you guys were trying to do
offensively?  
KK HOUSER: They had good defense, but I think for the most part, at times we
took ourselves out of the game.  
  
Q. Brittany, did you feel like you guys ever got comfortable offensively?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: No, I don't think so. Like KK said, the amount of turnovers
we had, we took ourselves out of the game, and on each possession it was us
grounding ourselves for the most part, but they were aggressive on defense,
and they got it done.  
  
Q. Was this game as physical as you expected? Was this one of the more
physical games you've played this year?  
KK HOUSER: Yes, I definitely think it was one of the most physical games we
played this year, from post players and the guards.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yes, I have to agree, it was a very physical game, but it
was something that we expected going into it.  
  
Q. Brittany, when you got good shots, it seemed like ‑‑ not just you
personally but the team had some inside and missed. Just those opportunities
in a game like this, you can't let those go, right?   
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, definitely. I think those are the shots that are
emotion turning. I think that really got them going on the offensive end, and
we missed a shot and they got a rebound and started running. But those are
times where you've got to convert.  
  
Q. KK, where do you think they hurt you with their offense?  
KK HOUSER: I think their guards had a lot of open threes, uncontested shots,
and just taking us off the dribble, and they were pinning our post players and
getting wide‑open shots.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I agree really. I feel like they were getting a lot of
uncontested shots that got their momentum going and they started knocking down
a lot of shots.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the second half the ball just wasn't going in for you
guys. Were they doing anything different to stifle your shooting?  
KK HOUSER: I just think our shots just weren't falling the first half.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I agree. I don't think they changed up anything. I
think it was just ourselves, shooting ourselves in the foot.  
  
Q. I know it was the same temperature out there for both teams, but how hot
was it out on the court?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Same as it was all week. We've practiced in a it for a while
and we were pretty used to it, but it was definitely pretty warm.  
  
Q. When they get that combination going on offense with their defense, very
dangerous to stop, and you just couldn't come up with that one or two stops
that you needed in the second half?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, when we got close they kept running the play where they
pinned the player and we always got called on a foul, and we did it all year
and they did it about seven times and they only called it one time. They were
able to score a lay‑up, driving pinning our post, just moving them totally
across the lane. So obviously we tried to adjust, but that's when they would
come down and score.  
  
Q. Was this as physical a game as you were expecting, and also, do you think
this was one of the more physical games you've had all year?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, we played Duke which was extremely physical, Texas
A&M was very physical. Our Big Ten is physical, and you just have to adjust as
you're playing with a physical game. But I think we were just as physical as
they were.  
  
Q. Did you think that it was their defense? You had 20 turnovers, 13 of
those in the first half. A lot of them you were throwing the ball away and
trying to get into the post.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, our guards weren't settled down. Our guards were making
passes that we don't normally make, just playing kind of a little bit more
spastic. We needed to run the plays through, and we didn't run those through,
so that's where we struggled. We didn't execute in the half court.  
  
Q. Can you take a minute and reflect on the careers of the seniors and what
they've meant to the Purdue program?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, we just discussed it. We're losing nine people, two
managers as well as a trainer and then our six seniors. You know, they left
their legacy in so many different ways. They're probably the best group of
young women I've ever been around in my coaching career because of what we
have gone through, how they handled almost the death of a teammate, how they
persevered, how their personality and leadership helped our younger players,
how much they taught each and every one of us every day. On and off the court
they're one of the most amazing academic students we've had as a senior class,
as well. They won a Big Ten championship. So we said that we have to keep
getting better every time our seniors graduate, we try to promise that class
that we'll keep winning championships and keep moving on to get a little bit
better.  
  
Q. When you did get some looks you missed them. I think you missed 17 shots
in the paint, some of those pretty routine. Do you feel like you had some
looks when you weren't turning it over and that could have been a little bit
different in the outcome?  
COACH VERSYP: Oh, yeah, when you make shots your defense gets better, you have
more energy. You're not always trying to play catch‑up or behind, and we have
made those shots before. First half we were shooting 55 percent but we had 13
turnovers. Second half we had obviously only seven turnovers but we weren't
making the shots that we normally make.  
  
Q. What kind of impact when Poston got the technical on Sutton and also got
the flagrant, what that did for the game and also what that did for your
team?  
COACH VERSYP: It didn't do anything to the flow, it just got our kids fired
up. There was a lot of things going on out there, and when those things are
called and then you just feel it's an us against the world mentality, our kids
usually respond pretty well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the season and the ups and downs until this point?  
COACH VERSYP: The only down we had was Drey Mingo blowing her ACL out. That's
the only down we've had. This season was an exceptional season. No one
expected us to finish second in the Big Ten or be Big Ten champs or be rated
in the top 20, so my hat goes off to this group. If you're talking about some
of the losses in February, grandfathers lost, it affects the entire team and
you have injuries and you have the flu. I think the last couple weeks has been
amazing for our group.  
  
Q. What advice would you give to Stanford about how best to challenge South
Carolina?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't really have any advice.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  72  
Purdue  61

  
COACH STALEY: Just very happy for our team. You know, it was a very
hard‑fought battle. Purdue gave us everything that they had, and I thought our
players took their hits and kept on moving‑‑ not literally hits, just making
baskets, making runs. They were an incredible opponent. The atmosphere was
incredible. So I appreciate all they've done to put object a great first and
second round. Fortunately for us we played well enough to steal a win on their
home court.  
  
Q. Just seemed like the game plan was just to keep attacking, keep shooting.
Was that pretty much the mentality going in against a defense that was tall he
than you?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: The game plan was to get it inside, if not attack the basket.
We're good at getting to the basket and we can use our speed and quickness.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: And also to get them in foul open up the game for us, so just
to be able to drive the ball in the paint and if their post players came up to
dump it off on to get post touches and just really play our game, and when you
have a good inside game, that opens up the outside game, and that's what it
did for us tonight.  
  
Q. Do you think they were ready for the kind of physical game you presented
to them tonight?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think they're a really physical team, so I'm pretty sure
they were ready. They're known to be physical in their conference, and we're
physical in our conference, so I think it was a well‑fought game on both
sides.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Just like she said, they threw hits at us, we threw hits at
them. We fought, and we knew that we had to come out here and be physical and
play our game because they are a physical team, no doubt about it. They come
out, they play hard. They wanted this game just as bad as we did, so we knew
we were going to have to out play them because we were on their home court and
they did have that advantage.  
  
Q. Markeshia, can you just talk about what it means, Sweet 16, you guys are
going? What does that mean to you?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: It means so much to me, especially because I'm a senior, and
I've worked so hard just to get to this point, and growing up you always see
the Tennessees, the Stanfords, the UConns playing at this level, and just to
see what we did was just incredible, and then this is the first time Coach
Staley has ever been to a Sweet 16, so it's even more special.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, the same thing. Me being a freshman, it's just
everything I saw throughout the recruiting process coming true. I saw a lot in
this team that I loved, and I knew that we could be a great team, and we're
just going on and we're proving it practice by practice, game by game. We've
done a lot of successful things this year, but the run is not over.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the poise which you played with? They tried to apply
pressure, you guys just didn't seem to panic. Obviously you had a big bucket
inside and then the emotion just erupted. Can you talk about the panic ‑free
basketball you played with?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: It started in practice. I think we were well prepared. Our
coaches prepared us very well, so we're used to this environment, and we play
in the SEC and we fight day in and day out. We're used to it.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think all the coaches do a good job of just calming us down
when it is the heat of the moment or they have the crowd on their side. They
do a good job of telling us to calm down and play our game. At the end of the
day if we play our game we know we can compete with any team. Just being able
to handle it because like they said, game in and game out, it's nothing we
haven't seen before.  
  
Q. It was rather warm in the arena this week and tonight. Was it warmer than
it was on Saturday, and also, how did you guys deal with that?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: It was quite warm, but we stayed hydrated. I took some
electrolytes before the game and stayed hydrated in timeouts when I came out.
I was warm.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: And they made sure we were drinking fluids at all times having
wet towels, just making sure we stay hydrated because this wasn't the type of
game we could afford to have somebody come out with cramps and being
dehydrated. Everybody, the managers, the coaches, the bench, did a good job
making sure we stayed hydrated and stayed on track.  
  
Q. At this point in the year making it to the Sweet 16 knowing you had to
turn up the defensive intensity against these guys, would you say this was
your best game as a team so far this season?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I would it was one of our best. I would say our best was
against Tennessee just because it was the first time in history we had ever
beaten them at Thompson Boling. This match was one of the greatest games we
ever played.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I agree with her. We played great team basketball, and that's
the thing that we go out and strive to do every night. I wouldn't say it's our
best team effort this year, but it's definitely up there in the top three, top
five, but being that the stage was so much higher, I think it's one of the
best we've had of late.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about the team's elevated play? I know you sorted
hinted on it, but offensively ‑‑ we know what you can do defensively, but
offensively we've seen such an outburst from you in the last two tournament
games that we really haven't seen down the stretch of the season from you
girls.   
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we're just being confident and executing a game plan.
As I said, we talked about going inside to the post, and if they weren't
getting it, we would drive. I think we're just getting confident with what
we're doing.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: And defense has been our staple for the whole season, so we
know that we can bring defense night in and night out, but when we bring both
to the table, defense and offense, I think we're a really hard team to beat
because when we're making buckets but also getting stops that's the best of
both worlds. I think we're starting to click more. We are starting to click
more now, and we are getting up shots, we are getting up good looks, and we
are hitting shots. When we have the defense that we bring every night and then
also bring out a consistent offense, we're really hard to beat.  
  
Q. I know coach has a 24 ‑hour rule. Do you think she'll let you celebrate
this a little longer?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think she will but we've got to get back to class tomorrow,
so classes first.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think we might get like 26 maybe. We've got to go ahead and
look forward to the next game. Right now it's just win or go home, so we can't
really dwell too much on this win. We'll celebrate it for tonight, go into
tomorrow, but once it's back to practice we've got to prepare for the next
team we've got coming up.  
  
Q. Markeshia alluded to it, but can you talk about what it means as a coach
to make it to the Sweet 16 and also what it means to the program, first time
in ten years?  
COACH STALEY: Well, obviously this was a game in which in my coaching career I
could never get over the hump. Part of the reason was at Temple I thought we
were a player or two away from being able to get over this hump and get into
the Sweet 16, and I think that the coaching, coming to this University of
South Carolina, being in a position to play against some of the best talent,
the best coaches, I think it prepares you a lot better when you play in a
bigger conference and you're able to recruit a different type of player.  
So I'm very happy what it does to our program. Does it legitimize our program?
To a certain degree. I think our program has been through so much in the past
four years that I'm very happy because it goes to show that we've done it the
right way. I don't think we've cut corners. I think we stood by our
principles, and our kids really bought into the process of doing things the
right way, so I'm very happy, and they as student athletes, especially our
seniors, will be able to go on when they leave the University of South
Carolina and know if you do things the right way, success will come your way.  
  
Q. I have to ask, what was going through your mind as you saw the clock
winding down and the zeros finally?  
COACH STALEY: Well, the clock could not wind down any quicker. I was looking
at it wanting the time‑‑ Coach McCray and I always give each other a little
look to speed the clock up, and it wouldn't go down any quicker.  
But just very happy. You know, just very, very happy for our players, very
happy for our coaches who have worked extremely hard to put our players in a
position to be successful. It's a happy time. It's a great day to be a
Gamecock.  
  
Q. Those two games in Indiana you've really shot well, put up a lot of
points. How do you take that on the road with you to Fresno?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we're going to keep doing what we're doing. I think our
preparation has been good, our focus has been good, and I think the fact that
we're not playing inside our conference. When you go outside your conference
you're seeing a little different competition. They don't know you as well as
some of our conference teams, and I think we find some mismatches on the
offensive end and we're able to capitalize on them.  
  
Q. Coach Versyp talked about what was different in this game for them was
when your forwards pinned their forwards back on rebounds, usually they were
getting the calls in the Big Ten and they weren't getting them tonight. Did
you get a sense at all that that was a little different and is that different
in the SEC, how that usually works?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, we have to play a certain way. We're smaller. I
think our post players, my hat goes off to them because they give up inches
and pounds every single night, so we try to do things to offset some of the
deficiencies that we have. You know, I mean, we've done it all year long. I
thought they did get a couple of calls in the second half when it came to
sealing. But for us we can't change who we are and what we've done to get us
here.  
  
Q. Sort of a two ‑part question. Can you talk about the poise with which
your team seemed to play in that second half? You got the lead and Purdue kept
trying to punch back. Also talk about how you have so many different players
who seem to step up in key moments when you need the most?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think part of the reason we were so poised, we've been
working with Ieasia Walker for the past three years and running our basketball
team, and I think she played probably her best basketball game as a point
guard, just controlling the tempo. She took shots and took advantage of taking
shots. She was aggressive offensively. She D'd up defensively, so I think she
had a lot to do with how poised we were down the stretch.  
What was the second part of your question?  
  
Q. Just the depth of your team. A lot of different players seemed to step up
at different moments when the team really needed someone to take control.  
COACH STALEY: Well, all season long I think we've been that kind of team, it's
just this particular weekend I thought all of our players rose to the
challenge, and I think we were just hitting on all chords, Markeshia,
La'Keisha in the first half, Ieasia in the second half, taking advantage of
what was given to us and just knocking down shots. We haven't really been that
efficient, but we were efficient tonight and we rose to the challenge of
beating a very good Purdue team on their home court.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to speak to your team?  
COACH STALEY: I spoke to the team.  
  
Q. What did you tell them?  
COACH STALEY: I told them I thought they were special. They executed the game
plan incredibly. I've said that a lot this particular year, but to do it on
this stage, a stage which they've never been, was incredible, because we
fought with them, they fought with us, and I think they finally get to see
when they stick to a game plan at this stage of the game, they find some
success. I know they're going to listen a little bit more, okay, they're going
to listen a little bit more because when you find success in something, it's
tangible, and they're tangible kids.  
  
Q. I asked the players about that 24 ‑hour rule we always talk about. Is it
going to get an extension?  
COACH STALEY: We're going to enjoy it. We are going to enjoy it from a
coaching standpoint. But we do have to turn a page. We have to prepare. I
think Stanford won. Stanford will be our opponent. We're already halfway
through the scouting report with that. We are going to enjoy it. We've enjoyed
the journey thus far, so we will continue to do that, but rules are rules.  
  
Q. Halfway through already?  
COACH STALEY: Meaning halfway through enjoying this moment.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The No.5 seed will play Purdue tomorrow evening. We are joined
on the dais by Head Coach Dawn Staley, also Charenee Stephens La'Keisha
Sutton.  
  
Q. After watching the game yesterday, looks like you have interchangeable
parts on defense, what's your approach, do you feel like you have a clear ‑cut
No.1 individual defender?   
COACH STALEY: I think collectively, we play defense as a team. We do have some
parts in which we feel comfortable on certain match‑ups, and we feel like
Keisha Sutton is the one that really is the player that we use to stop our
opponent's leading scorer. She's done it time and time again. She's done it
ever since she got to South Carolina four years ago and we are comfortable
with her having that duty.  
  
Q. How do you think going through the SEC season has prepared you for a game
against Purdue, a team that obviously will draw a lot of fans today and has
had a pretty good history in the NCAA?  
COACH STALEY: I think any time you're in an unfamiliar place, the NCAA
Tournament against this particular team and being in the second round, you
have to draw on some experience to keep it very familiar to you as much as
possible.  
We have talked to our players about playing Vanderbilt at Vanderbilt when they
were undefeated at home; knowing that they were going to draw a large crowd;
playing Tennessee in Knoxville, something that had not been done in a lot of
years, a lot of decades for us.  
And also playing in the semifinals in the SEC Tournament where we felt like
Tennessee had a home crowd and we fared fairly well in all of those games and
we'll draw on all of those experiences to help us with this situation.  
  
Q. For both players, you're taking on your 11th ‑ranked opponent this
season. Describe the mind‑set you have going into games of this magnitude and
against high‑level competition like a Purdue basketball team.   
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Well, I think we have been in this situation before. Coach
has said it best and we have said it; that we are going to prepare like we
prepared for everyone this season. We are going to go out starting today‑‑ we
watched them a little bit. We are going to go out today and I think our
coaches have really put something together where we can prepare and put
something out on the court that we'll get a win.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I pretty much agree with Charenee. We have been in these
situations before against other basketball teams and we are going to prepare
the same way. Just different personnel. We have to get familiar with their
players, and we have done that a little bit last night and this morning, so we
are pretty confident.  
  
Q. A couple days ago, you talked about your offense's inconsistency. Can
there be any carryover from yesterday with how well you played offensively, or
is Purdue a different opponent and different defense?  
COACH STALEY: You know, obviously we scored the most points we scored all
season long. Hopefully we'll have some carryover from having scored the most
points we have scored in that basketball game and the least amount of point
the scored.  
We know Purdue. We are familiar with them a little bit. We watched their
championship. For us, we just take each opponent, we know they play man‑to‑man
primarily, so you know, we are prepared for the elbow; it's something we have
not seen in quite some time. So whatever defenses they throw out there,
hopefully our offense can knock down some shots.  
  
Q. What does man ‑to‑man present to you differently in how you guys might
operate?   
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Well, honestly, I like when teams play us in man‑to‑man,
because it gives us a chance to go out and show what we can do against one
person; it's like an iso‑type of situation.  
I feel like our guards, they really take on the challenge of man‑to‑man. And I
think I do a good job, and my fellow post players, we do a good job of sealing
the paint and stuff like that. So it takes a move and being confident and
getting into the paint and getting a score.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I agree with Charenee. I like when teams play us man‑to‑man,
as well, because it gives us opportunity to spread the floor out and use the
one‑on‑one moves that we worked on in practice and that we've been taught to
try to create from offense and get some points in the paint whether it's from
our guards or our post players; so it's a good thing.  
  
Q. Last night Sharon Versyp said that they have got a lot of players that
can score 20 points, and you don't really know where it's going to come from.
What kind of challenges does that present to a defense when you don't have ‑‑
when you are facing that kind of a challenge?   
COACH STALEY: Well, you know, obviously Purdue has some very skilled players
and they are pretty much‑‑ they are a machine when it comes to offensively.
They do have some skills. They do have some players that they stretch you out
a little bit.  
I think that what has been our MO all season long is try to disrupt what they
are trying to do. So I'm very comfortable with the amount of ball pressure
that we exert on basketball teams and I don't think we are going to approach
it any differently. We are who we are at this point. I don't think we are
going to abandon how we play; how we play the game, according to, you know,
who they have as far as offensive power.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Like I said before, we have been in situations playing SEC
against the best athletes or the best guards in the country, so like coach
said, we are pretty comfortable in our defense and we are just going to guard
them the same way. So nothing that we are going to do different defensively.
We just wanted to bring it the same way we have been bringing it all season.  
  
Q. I know we talked about it briefly yesterday. But knowing game time is
approaching, it's practice today; knowing you never have been past the second
round, is there anything in particular you're trying to do differently this
time around. Maybe that you learned from your mistakes at Temple going into
those type of games in a second round game?  
COACH STALEY: Nothing different. I think we have to seize the moment. I think,
you know, the law of averages, we are going to try (chuckling).  
For us, it's all about being familiar with and keeping the same mind‑set. I
don't think we would do anything differently at Temple as far as our approach
and how we prepare. You know, knocking down some shots really helps when it
comes to getting your team to the next round and playing in the second weekend
of the tournament.  
  
Q. Your impressions of what Courtney Moses did yesterday for Purdue.  
COACH STALEY: (Laughter) Well, I mean, you know, any time a player is that
hot, I think she was in the zone. I think any time you break NCAA records of
any sort, you know, it's an eye‑opener for you.  
I will have to revert back to looking at what we do against three‑point
shooters. I like what we have done the entire year. We don't allow you to get
up as many three‑point shooters. At some point‑‑ at some point you just have
to stick with it. You have to stay attached to it and you have to not let her
take those outside threes. And even when she's got it going on, maybe even
double her at times at the rate that she was shooting the basketball.  
  
Q. From a player's standpoint, is there a different kind of confidence
offensively today, knowing what you guys did yesterday on that end of the
floor?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: It's a huge confidence boost because we hit shots and were
able to score easy in transition. Just knowing that we were able to hit shots,
we are going to go and do the same thing on Monday and penetrate and kick it
out or go inside to our post players. So we are confident that we'll make the
same kind of shots.  
  
Q. You had referenced the three ‑point defense; you lead the country in
three‑point percentage defense. Purdue sets a lot of screens to free up those
shooters. Do you have a certain defensive philosophy you always use to defend
the three? Will you go under screens, over screens, or do you mix it up
depending on the opponent?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I'm not going to tell you (laughter).  
You know, for us, we like players that like to shoot three‑point shots and put
the ball on the floor. And I don't think there's any secret to that. It's just
not allowing them to take attempts. That's our motto. We like our chances and
you two‑ing us to win basketball games than three‑ing us.  
  
Q. Is that a philosophy that teams try to use against you when you were a
player, try to make you uncomfortable out on the three ‑point line?   
COACH STALEY: Yeah, I think teams do. You know, as far as my position, I
wasn't really a three‑point shooter. You know, they try to disrupt the point
guard and that's how you can disrupt most teams is you cut their head off and
the rest will follow.  
But for us, you know, we know that they have a couple players that they play
at the point, but you know, primarily, they usually play Houser at the point
guard position. We are going to try to get under her skin as we have done time
and time again throughout the season, and hopefully that will have some
lingering effect on those shooters.  
  
Q. South Carolina and Purdue have three common opponents, Illinois, Penn
State and Auburn. Do you draw anything out of those similarities, or is it too
far back in the season to go back?  
COACH STALEY: It's too far back. I think you do have to look at Penn State,
because Penn State did have some success against them. I think they split‑‑ or
was Purdue 2‑1? So they split. We did watch a little bit of that. But we know
Purdue is playing their best basketball at this time.  
So, you know, we have to be ready for them to play their best basketball
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Besides the man ‑to‑man defense, what else did you notice about Purdue,
some of the traits that they have looking at them, and are they similar to any
teams you faced in the SEC?  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Most definitely. They have big post players who are
effective with two feet in the paint. And we have seen that; I know time and
time again we have gone up against some really big post players who are really
effective down low. I think we are just going to try to push them out of paint
and keep them off of the boards. That's really the key thing by any means
necessary. No extra possessions.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Well, as far as their guards, they have really good shooting
guards, so we need to make them uncomfortable and really pressure the ball.  
  
Q. Just talk about the mind ‑set defensively you guys like to play. You guys
like to maybe push teams around and be more physical, or do you see yourselves
as more of a full‑pressure, like‑to‑run‑teams‑out‑of‑the‑gym type of
mentality?   
CHARENEE STEPHENS: We like to mix it up. Of course we like to hit first and we
like to be the enforcers and we like to set the tone. And also, we do have a
lot of athleticism on the team, so we like to run and gun and we like to get
the ball up the floor; post players running rim‑to‑rim, sealing; just showing
that we are good athletes, but we are strong, as well.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Well, I definitely think that we take pride in our defense,
and we are committed to being defenders. You have the best three‑point
shooter, and we are going to commit to try to limit her production, or lock
her down completely. And I'm just thinking about Vandy and Foggie, their best
three‑point shooter, and we did a pretty good job against her.  
I'm just thinking about my first couple of years with Angie Bjorklund from
Tennessee; so we are definitely used to it. So it's going to be 40 minutes of
battle tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Three out of past four games, 70 ‑plus from the free throw line, 11 for
14. Anything going differently, or have I just jinxed it?   
COACH STALEY: I did notice it. I think one of our coaches, Coach Boyer,
doesn't like for us to mention when we shoot well from the free throw line.  
I like to balance it because when we shoot a whopping 30percent from the free
throw line, I say, wow, this is how we lost the basketball game.  
But when we are shooting in the 70s, we increase our chances of winning. And
we definitely have to get to the cherry stripe tomorrow night in order for us
to win this basketball game, and shoot 70 percent or above.  
  
Q. How important of a win would it be for this program to get become to the
Sweet16 for the first time since 2002?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think would be‑‑ you know, it's a tribute to our players
being committed to something. I think they really believe in one another, and
it will go to show that once you have an incredible belief in something, that
you know, it's tangible and it can take place.  
So I say to our team, it's been a tremendous ride, and why not the University
of South Carolina playing in the Sweet16.  
THE MODERATOR: South Carolina, ladies, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow
evening.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Boilermakers. Coach Sharon Versyp, Antoinette
Howard and Brittany Rayburn.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about South Carolina's defense and what you've seen
from them? Obviously they are pretty good on that side of the ball.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, they have a lot of quickness. They have long arms. I think
down low, they are a very physical basketball team. They are a little
under‑sized, so they use their athleticism and their physicality exceptionally
well.  
They try to disrupt you, so when they take chances, you have to make sure that
you take care of the basketball and find the openings. And you cannot allow
them, obviously, to rally you and get turnovers to get in transition. They
love the transition baskets.  
  
Q. Just their three ‑point defense in particular is very good, I think just
No.1 in the country, and allowing just 21 percent. Why is it good and what do
you do, obviously you guys have hit some three‑pointers before. What do you do
to counteract that?  
COACH VERSYP: I think how we set screens. We are changing that a little bit
for this game, how they are setting greens. I think if they are switching on
on‑ball screens, obviously you don't have to take the 3s. You can have a lot
of slip‑cuts and look for other opportunities. They trap on ball screens, so
that's why they take away the 3s quite a bit. But if you can get a good
rotation, and allow that double‑team to be dragged out a little bit, you might
be able to have a wide open look.  
But, you know, they are very quick. They close out well. But again, we have
played against some pretty tough defenses.  
  
Q. The way your team screens, how does that all come together? Are players
coming out of high school like the best screeners in the world, or is it a
situation you take some time once they are in the college game to master that
art?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I appreciate that you do think that we screen well
(laughing) because I don't think we screen. No, what we do, young kids,
fundamentals, they are not working on screening. They are working on handles
in their one‑on‑one game. They are working on their offense.  
It's just understanding and trusting the offenses and seeing where the good
shots are coming and where the rotation is for offensive rebounding and those
type of things. But you know, we have some very good screeners and we have
some that are just in an area (laughter).  
No, we have done a good job. We really spend a lot of time on it, and we
always try to get better at what we feel might be a strength.  
  
Q. I think Brittany would defend that some of your post players do screen
pretty well; you're getting some openings. How has that process evolved for a
shooter, working off those screens?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: It's amazing, you come off a screen or a double screen and
you're wide open and you're like, oh, okay, somebody nailed somebody because
you can't see it when you're trailing behind it.  
But obviously we work on it a lot in practice. A lot of our plays have a lot
of screens in it, and the people that are setting screens are doing a great
job to get everybody open that's coming off of them.  
  
Q. Just wonder if you can talk about how far Brittany has come in her four
years here, because I remember seeing her start down at Indiana as a freshman,
I don't know if you remember that game or not.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I think any player that comes in as a freshman, having an
opportunity to play as many minutes, they are just going to continue to grow
and develop. They are very hungry as a freshman to try to learn and try to do
whatever they can for their team.  
You know, everybody knew that Brittany was a scorer, but as she's grown
through her career, it's understanding the offenses, playing one through four,
being a better defender, taking charges, anticipating defensively and a
rotation or help side.  
Her growth of the game, but her leadership skills have obviously developed
this senior year all the way through.  
  
Q. What's the advantage of having the game here at Mackey?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Playing at Mackey, like I said in many interviews before in
my three years here, it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. Just
having that sixth man is incredible. Our band is the top band in the country I
think.  
So being able to play in front of them I think motivates us a little bit more.
When we get a little tired, we look up at all of our fans and the band, and we
just get that extra push that we need. For me, playing in my last game of my
senior year, I couldn't ask for any better than that.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think our band is amazing and our fans are amazing. We can
come out of the tunnel and you can hear them, the uproar that they bring. It's
a great feeling; it really gets you going and gets your team going entering
the game. As seniors, I think we both are excited to be able to play again in
the NCAA Tournament and to finish out the year playing at home and hopefully
push us farther in the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your guys's transition defense and how important that
might be tomorrow night against a team that's pretty athletic and would like
to get up ‑and‑down the court a little bit?   
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Well, we have been working on transition a lot lately. We
just have to get back, find shooters in transition. I think that was really
important, especially the last game. But especially being able to stop the
post players in the paint because their post players do run the floor well.  
You just have to find somebody. You won't always find your own man, but as
long as you find somebody, I think we can slow them down a bit.  
  
Q. Your team has nine players who have been in the NCAAs and this is a first
for all of the players of South Carolina. What advantage does that give you
that most of your roster has been through this before?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, any time you have experience, just have a little bit more
confidence. Sometimes when it's your first time, you don't think about
anything, and sometimes that's a good result. But you know, when you have
experience, you have confidence. And again, playing at home, obviously that is
a big advantage for us. You know, so it's different every year because you
have a different team.  
  
Q. Where do you fall on the screening pyramid here?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: I might be in between. I mean, sometimes I nail them pretty
good and others, just slide right by me. I try my best but playing with
Brittany and C‑Mo and KK, you want to set good screens where you can get them
open, because you know they will knock down the open shot. So, it's a process.
It's a process. But I'm definitely working at it and‑‑  
COACH VERSYP: She does a good job.  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Well, there it is. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Brittany, before Senior Day, with those activities, you kind of knew
maybe it wouldn't be your last game at Mackey Arena, but this will be your
last game at Mackey Arena. Your thoughts and how important it is just to come
out and play well? Obviously you want to advance, but your long four years
playing here at Mackey.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think it's exciting. You always want to play at home, and
to be the last game, we are blessed to be able to play two more games here.
Senior Night was awesome, and we did have that in the back of our mind I'm
sure that hopefully we would be able to play here a couple more games.  
For it to be realistically coming to an end, I think it just gives us that
much more incentive to want to play hard and get that win.  
  
Q. Have you had any interaction with any of the players since South Carolina
back in AAU ball? Do you have any experience against any of these players that
you'll be facing tomorrow?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: I've played with a few of them actually. Being in Georgia,
you play with a lot of different players. And so a few of them play for the
Metros and teams all around Georgia, and, so yes, I have played with them.  
They are very physical, competitive. I remember in AAU days where we stayed
after and played five‑on‑five. So I know where going to be really competitive.
Everybody wants to win. Everybody is going to get on the floor and get after
the ball, so it will be a good matchup for us.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I personally have not met any of them previous to this.  
  
Q. With 13 days between games, were you surprised how crisp your offense was
early yesterday?  
COACH VERSYP: I thought it started out crisp, but I also felt like we were a
little sluggish, as in just getting up‑and‑down and playing a game. When you
don't play for two weeks, you can't really simulate that in practice. So even
the players felt when we came in at halftime, just had to catch that second
breath.  
And then after the first four minutes of the second half, then I felt like we
were totally back to ourselves. But I thought that they totally understood the
game plan and executed it to a T; being able to score 16 points that quickly,
we did a fantastic job that way. But I think it was more getting their breath
back and their legs actually playing the game.  
  
Q. When you had a chance to watch South Carolina play and also watch a
little bit of some of them, what stood out about them?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Like I said, they are very physical. They get up‑and‑down.
I think their on‑ball defense is really good and they are really scrappy. It's
postseason, so really anything can happen, but they played like a team that
wants to be in the tournament and they want to go far.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think the biggest thing that I saw is they are mixing up
their defense, really throwing out a lot of different things, and that's
confusing to play against foremost team and I think that's the biggest thing
we are looking at, trying to get adjusted to how they play defense. And like
'Nette said, they are a very aggressive team and just something that we have
to look forward to.  
  
Q. Which of the Gamecocks did you play against when you were in AAU ball?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Charenee and Markeshia, I played against those two. But
like I said, many of the other players, I played with them actually in
practice. Some of the other players I played against on the AAU circuit.  
  
Q. Are these two teams similar in a way where it's a defense ‑first
approach, and how do you feel about your defense going against their offense
tomorrow?   
COACH VERSYP: We feel pretty confident. I mean, both teams are defensive
teams. Both offenses have said they have been inconsistent throughout the
year, but I think ours has really picked up the last‑‑ over the last two,
three weeks. You know, so I think it's going to be a battle of defense, a
battle of the boards in transition defense. I think those are going to be the
big key, and if a couple people can knock down the 3s.  
  
Q. Three common opponents, Auburn, Penn State, Illinois; gain anything out
of watching those games, or too far back in the season to really gain
anything?  
COACH VERSYP: We looked at those games as a coaching staff. We showed them a
couple clips of things that we feel that we could be successful with. But you
know, they are a different style team. They have improved tremendously. We
have improved tremendously, changing little things defensively that they have
done. So at least we have seen what our other conference teams, especially
Illinois and Penn State, has been able to do.  
But right now, it's just playing the game.  
  
Q. When you're playing a team that plays defense from the 3 ‑point line as
well as they do, is it just a matter of taking advantage of the opportunities
that you might have a little bit of space when they present themselves?   
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think the key for us will be being patient, working
within our offense, letting things play out and really going to the shot clock
a little bit and really be patient enough to let the holes open up for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck to the Boilermakers tomorrow evening.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  80  
South Dakota State  68

  
COACH JOHNSTON: Congratulations to Purdue. It was a good day. The final score
got away from us there in the last five, six minutes. But I thought overall we
played well in a lot of areas. We didn't execute very well defensively,
especially in the second half. It's a lot of mental breakdowns I thought which
led to some really good looks on Purdue's side of things. And just didn't
break away a couple of times offensively when we had chances.  
I kind of felt going into the game this was going to be a half court
possession, possession, possession game, and in that style they're probably a
little bit better than we are and I think some of that showed. When they
needed some big shots they got the right people the ball and made a lot of big
ones. Moses was really good. We lost her a lot on a lot of screens along the
baseline, and that cost us.  
But overall very proud of our team, too. We did a lot of good things, just not
enough to keep moving forward in the tournament.  
  
Q. Jill, can you talk about trying to slow down their guards? Probably
needed to pay attention to a couple of them. Was that what happened tonight
perhaps?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, they just have really good guards, and they're all good
shooters, quick, athletic, and we just lost them on screens. Sometimes we
miscommunicated, and they're just really good at passing and screening and
just giving the person the ball when they're open.  
  
Q. She had those two back to back there after you got it within striking
distance in the second half. Did it just seem like every time you guys sort of
got close, she in particular came up with a shot?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, she shot really well for them and hit a lot of big shots
when they needed them, or when we kind of hit a few baskets, then she'd come
down and the crowd would react to that. So I guess that was tough.  
  
Q. Jennie, this was the closest in the second half you guys have been since
that win. How were you feeling at that point when you got within two in the
second half?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: Yeah, definitely. We had good momentum going into the
second half, and it was just hard when the other team, they're hitting big
shots and we're not scoring ourselves. It just kind of got away from us, and
we couldn't respond to it.  
  
Q. Jill, you've done what Moses did to a lot of teams before. Was it weird
being on the other side of that, watching a shooter kind of go crazy?  
JILL YOUNG: Well, it wasn't as fun, I guess. Yeah, you know, she's a really
good shooter, and like you said, we just lost her on screens.  
  
Q. Jennie, last go for you and Jill. You guys looked aggressive, though, and
not timid and like you were going down swinging. Did you feel that way
throughout?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: Yeah, I think Jill and I going into this game, we're
seniors, we're going to fight as much as we can and do everything we possibly
can to get a win, and that just didn't happen for us today, which is a
disappointment, but we hope Purdue goes further in the tournament.  
  
Q. Jill, how much did Houser's ball pressure and some of her being very
active on defense maybe take you guys out of a little bit of offensive rhythm
early on?  
JILL YOUNG: I guess we came into the game expecting them to pick up and
pressure the guards. I guess maybe that slowed us down at times, taking time
off the shot clock and trying to bring it up with a defender on us.  
  
Q. Jill, just talk about this run, getting back here for a fourth year in a
row and having the men do it, too, and what kind of benefits you think the
school and the two programs and everybody associated with it might have.  
JILL YOUNG: It was just really special to be a part of. We both had great
seasons, and to win the tournament in Sioux Falls, I know the state really got
behind us and supported us, so yeah, it was just really neat to be a part of,
and I think it drew more attention to South Dakota State.  
  
Q. Katie, was it hot on the floor? It was really hot in the press box.  
KATIE LINGLE: Yeah, it was pretty hot down on the floor.  
  
Q. Did that affect you?  
KATIE LINGLE: I don't think it affected things. We were aware that it was
going to be hot. We practiced in the heat yesterday, so I don't think it
affected anything.  
  
Q. What adjustments were you trying to make defensively on Moses?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, we went into it with a game plan to really ‑‑ not quite
base guard any of their perimeter players but not really help, either. I
thought the first three she hit in the first half, we helped on some
penetration and just let her kind of get going, but then from that point on,
she didn't need a lot of space to get shots off.  
Tried showing on some of their down screens from our post players, and I
thought that was effective at times. Other times our post just didn't get up.
I thought our guards were late coming around on screens. Just as a whole
between the screener and our person chasing, we just didn't get to her at
times.  
You know, she's a good player and just so efficient. There's no stat for it,
but they screen as well as any team that we play, and those post players are
excellent at doing that. They know how to get guards open, and it's hard to
get through. That's why they all make so many of those plays off of those
screens.  
  
Q. I saw you shaking your head as I was asking the question about the two
three ‑pointers Moses hit back to back there after you got it down to four.
Was that sort of the critical time?   
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, and it's even more critical because it's a home game for
them. Those are big momentum plays. It wasn't just six points, it was a big
momentum change in the game, and really, I think, kind of got us into a point
where we were trying to scramble to get back into it rather than feeling like
we were right there. So the points were obviously‑‑ that's what wins and
loses, but the momentum was the big part of that.  
  
Q. You said yesterday you thought your team had to be tenacious today. Your
thoughts on how they graded out there?  
COACH JOHNSTON: I thought we were pretty good. I didn't think we were great.
We did have a lot of mental lapses in the second half. I won't go into detail
on all of those. But we didn't have a great second half defensively, and when
they started to make some plays and the crowd got going a little bit, then I
think we got a little bit away from what we needed to do.  
But I think our effort level was really good. I thought we were aggressive. I
thought a lot of the things we talked about offensively that we needed to get,
we did get some of those things. So overall I feel like it was a very good
game for us, it's just Purdue played a little better game than we did. But I
was proud of our team.  
  
Q. How much do you think Houser maybe set the tone for them defensively?
This was your second game without stops, how you guys handled the perimeter
there.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, seems like you think she set the tone. Yeah, I think a
little bit. I don't feel like she just took us out of complete rhythm. There
was a couple times where I thought she had Gaby in trouble in the second half
there, and that's easy to look at that and say, boy, KK is really changing the
game. She's a very good player. I don't know that she completely took us away
from what we wanted to do. I don't know that I would say that. But she's a
good player. She had five steals in the game, so she obviously was a big part
of what they do. By I thought we were able to get into what we want enough to
be successful.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on how your two seniors played? It seemed like both of them
were very aggressive tonight.  
COACH JOHNSTON: I thought their effort level was really good, energy level was
really good, good leaders kind of going throughout the game. I just talked to
them when they came out there with a minute or two or whatever left and said
this game didn't go the way they wanted, but I said overall the reason we're
here playing today on that stage has a lot with those two seniors, not only
this year but throughout their career. They've continued to move us forward.
It wasn't quite enough to move forward in the NCAA Tournament, but we're
better today than we were four years ago because of Jennie and Jill.  
  
Q. Talk about your bench production. Rachel and Katie had very good games
off the bench. What does that make you think about your chances for next
year?  
COACH JOHNSTON: You know, it's interesting, we only graduated two seniors, so
you look at our roster today and think, boy, all those good players are back,
but it's still not really a complete roster because Steph is not on the floor
and then also Megan Waytashek wasn't on the floor. Then we add two really good
players, another point guard, which we've played really without for a while
here. I thought Gaby really progressed this year at the point, as well.  
So next year, even though there will be a lot of the same faces, I think we'll
very different team really because of that point guard position. We'll have a
lot more depth and be I think a lot more consistent. We were playing Jill out
of position a lot, we were playing Steph out of position a lot this year, so
just having more true point guards is going to change our team dramatically, I
think. We'll get back to being a little bit more up tempo and get back to
getting the pace we want out of our offense.  
But we also lose two 1,000‑point scorers in Jill and Jennie, two proven
players that can make big shots and have been in these kind of big moments.
It'll be fun to see how the team evolves over the spring, but we do have a
couple big losses here with Jill and Jennie.  
  
Q. Two ‑part question. Same thing I asked Jill. Talk about what you think
the impact of not only you guys getting a fourth year in a row and the men
doing it, too, and all the publicity brings to your school, and secondly your
thoughts on what, if anything, you need to add to take that next step in the
tournament aside from maybe getting a regional and somewhat closer.   
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, the jackrabbit logo has got to be the hottest logo out
there on the market. It's the best‑looking one that I've seen by far, and it
edges out the boilermaker logo, so hopefully on a national stage that'll
continue to get some play.  
You know, it's a little unmeasurable right now because it just happened, but
you want dividends to pay off in these kind of events. Basketball, especially
men's basketball has such a national presence with that NCAA Tournament. I
know more about Lehigh today than I did two days ago, and that's because of
that tournament and that event.  
So for both of our teams, the ultimate is to try and move forward. To answer
your second part, for us anyway, we just have to be a little bit better in
kind of all areas. In the NCAA Tournament we're going to have to figure out
ways to execute a little bit better against these kind of teams. We're able to
kind of get free flowing a little bit in our league and with our style and
also get in the tournament. They're different types of games, so we're going
to have to evaluate how we want to build our team offensively and defensively
for this time.  
For us, like I said earlier, I think it'll change dramatically when we add
point guards and add more experience to our team. That'll help us get to what
we want offensively, as well. We're just going to have to learn how to play
tougher in these environments.  
We're in a situation where the majority of our games on the women's side very
well could be at Purdue or at Xavier or at Oklahoma, and that's a whole
different animal than what the men face at neutral sites. So we're going to
have to get better at these kind of environments and learn how to get done
what we need to.  
We were better today I thought than we were the last two trips, Oklahoma and
Xavier, to be honest with you. We had some shots that could have made the game
a little bit closer. Still might have lost, but we had some chances in the
second half to keep moving forward, keep grinding it out. We had some really
good stops defensively. I think we gave up three offensive rebounds in a
ten‑minute stretch that they scored on, so there were some chances there but
we just didn't make all those plays, and that's hard, but that's what it takes
here to do it on the road.  
  
Q. Pretty broad question here, but looking at this year and the last four,
are you fairly happy with what's happened here?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, overall, I mean, it's 64 teams played in this event.
We're one of the 64. To do it four years in a row, I don't know how many teams
have played in it four years in a row. We're not the only one, but there's
certainly a much smaller number than 64 that have gone here four times in a
row. So I am really pleased with the progress of our program. I am a little
frustrated just in the sense that we haven't taken another step in the
tournament but not frustrated in our players or anything, just frustrated we
haven't quite gotten over that hump yet, but I think that's kind of where
we're at.  
We want more shelf life in this event. You need more people to talk about you.
People are talking about Lehigh because they won, not because they lost by
two. And for us, if we're going to take that next step, I know I've said this
the last couple years, we're going to have to figure out ways to win at this
event.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  83  
South Dakota State  68

  
COACH VERSYP: Just knew it was going to be a very exciting match‑up. Not
having played for two weeks, it was difficult for us to really contain some
energy early. But I really feel that we had a very good game plan. South
Dakota State did a great job of knocking down shots and making us pay if we
obviously made a mistake. But I thought our defense and KK really set the tone
defensively and with her steals, and then obviously I thought we moved the
ball around and did some good things inside and outside.  
  
Q. Were you trying to one ‑up Brittany at some point tonight? Joking aside,
just your game and the shot. Did everything just come in rhythm for you today?
  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, definitely. My teammates just were setting great
screens. Our team had so many assists today. We were just talking about it,
and it all just comes from your teammates, and you just have to knock down the
shot.  
  
Q. Courtney, at times this has been a frustrating year from a shooting
perspective for you. Was this a nice way to sort of remedy some of those
struggles throughout the year?  
COURTNEY MOSES: My team has always had confidence in me, I've always had
confidence in myself, so to go out and continue and be confident is definitely
a good feeling.  
  
Q. KK, to be able to get the ball as quickly as you did, once you hit one
and two, was it just a matter of finding her on the wing?  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, I knew Courtney was going to come in and have a good shooting
game today. She shot great all week long in practice, so getting her open and
just little things, and Courtney has a quick release, so she doesn't need much
time to get it down.  
  
Q. What do y'all know about South Carolina?  
KK HOUSER: Just from watching a little bit of their game, quick, defensive
guards, pressure to the perimeter, small.  
COURTNEY MOSES: They get after it, very high energy, very well‑coached team,
and they're definitely‑‑ it's tournament time, so they're getting after it.  
  
Q. Courtney, it looked like you guys were trying to go inside early and you
had some success there. Do you feel like that helped open things up for you a
little bit later because they had to pay so much attention to your interior
players?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Definitely. We were just running plays, going high‑low. I
remember Chelsea was‑‑ they kind of stopped Chelsea there at the beginning of
the game, and definitely scoring down low, they're going to start collapsing
in and it's going to get the perimeter open.  
  
Q. KK, the first four minutes of the game, how much did those steals get you
into the rhythm of the game, and then for this being your first NCAA
Tournament game, did that maybe settle you down a little bit?  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, I think it might have got me going a little more. My defense
is what gets me going and I just get confidence off my defense, so getting
steals early in the game was huge for me.  
  
Q. KK, did you feel like you couldn't quite put them away there until I
think early in the second half or whenever it was you had a little bit of a
run, including Courtney's two three ‑pointers there back to back? Was that a
pretty critical stretch in giving you guys some push?   
KK HOUSER: Yeah, they're a great team, and they just kept fighting. It was
hard, we'd go on runs and then they'd cut the lead. I was pretty confident the
whole way.  
  
Q. Courtney, just your thoughts on having the tournament record and hitting
those nine three ‑pointers?   
COURTNEY MOSES: I would sum it up in two ways: I would say that with Purdue
all things are possible and with God all things are possible.  
  
Q. Is there any team that you played this year that is similar to South
Carolina?  
KK HOUSER: Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Sharon, just that stretch there in the second half, they got within two
and then Courtney scored eight there in those back ‑to‑back threes. Was that
kind of the cushion you needed to maybe take control of the game a little
bit?  
COACH VERSYP: Definitely. They did a nice job coming back. We needed to settle
down, make a couple shots, try to attack the basket and try to set Courtney up
because she was knocking down shots. But again, I just think, just like when
Brittany knocked down those 12 threes, just the team really realized what was
happening, and we needed to make sure we did some key things, especially when
they came back.  
  
Q. It did look like you were trying to go inside early. How much do you
think that sort of opened things up for her and others later?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it was big. But then Chelsea and Alex got in foul
trouble. We had a big lead, and then those two got in foul trouble, and we
didn't go inside as much. Liza came in and gave us some great minutes again,
scored baskets, did some great things. But it always helps. There's no
question that that helps. But I think Courtney knocked down some shots over‑‑
some really contested shots, too, contested baskets.  
  
Q. Your scoring numbers were way up over the average, theirs were way down
over the average. Is that the case of you being hot or is some of that the Big
Ten difference? Does that skew the numbers a bit?  
COACH VERSYP: It could. I think not playing for two weeks makes a difference
for us, but it's something that we've been used to the last six years. But we
did shoot the ball well. I thought we distributed the ball well, took care of
the basketball. You know, defensively they just did a great job of‑‑ when we
made a mistake defensively, they knocked down shots, and they had open looks,
and they're a very dangerous team.  
  
Q. Just thoughts on the way KK played in her first NCAA Tournament game.  
COACH VERSYP: I thought she did a great job, obviously had a little scare and
made sure the two doctors looked at it, her knee.  
But she sets the tone. Her defense will just drive anybody crazy, and that
sets the tone for everyone, and when she can attack the basket as well as she
does, and then she just really has been running the offense exceptionally
well. I mean, her stat line, six assists, two turnovers, five steals and 12
points, I think that's an exceptionally good job by her.  
  
Q. This might be a pretty obvious answer, but it might be as simple as you
have two players who are capable of getting hot, but is there any common theme
between what Rayburn did earlier in the season and what Moses did tonight?  
COACH VERSYP: This team has really done a great job all year of someone is not
doing‑‑ maybe scoring as well or getting in foul trouble. That's why it's been
an ultimate team, and that's the thing, everybody is so high on Brittany,
everybody has been so high on Courtney because they're the ones that can
actually shoot that three and be that successful. But it's a total team
effort, and I'm just glad for our team and for Courtney that she's playing so
well the last three weeks.  
  
Q. What do you know about South Carolina, and again, what kind of team do
you think they're like that you've played this season?  
COACH VERSYP: Probably similar to Texas A&M because they have good defensive
pressure. They've got long arms. They're athletic, great rebounding team. They
have some players that can shoot the three. And then obviously down low they
can do some things, whether it's off the dribble. So we've got to be able to
take some pressure off our guards a little bit, and we've got to be able to
isolate a little bit down low.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, how important is it for the success of Purdue to have
those multiple players that can go off any given night throughout the
tournament?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's huge. I mean, it's tournament time, and when you
have players that can step up and score in the 20s, then you have a good
chance of progressing on into the tournament. And I think that's very good,
and maybe tomorrow we have two different scorers. And that's what's good about
our team is you're not sure who's going to score the 20 points or the 10
points and rebound, and I think that's a huge advantage.  
  
Q. What kind of advantage is it to have these games here at Mackey Arena?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it really helps you with the crowd. It helps you with
obviously being familiar with just the whole timing and the whole atmosphere.
But it's tournament time, and South Carolina has done a great job. They've won
a lot of games on the road. Right now their focus is an us‑against‑the‑world
mentality, which we always try to have.  
  
Q. It seems like you might get lost in the shuffle with the great offensive
effort, but talk about how important your defense was in the second half
there. It seemed like you were forcing a lot more turnovers.  
COACH VERSYP: We talked about it. We're a defensive team, and if we're going
to allow people to shoot the ball as well as they did, then it's going to be
tight and they can lose the game, so I said it's a choice. So it was all about
setting the tone, playing defense, getting in the passing lanes, hedging hard
around screens, so we changed our defense in the second half, made
adjustments, and we did really well.  
  
Q. On Liza, is it getting to the point where you're pretty confident getting
her in here? There's been a couple games that she's been pretty productive
with limited minutes for you.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, Liza has stepped up in her role. She's done a great job of
going in, and she just has a feel for the game, and she knows how to lock out,
she posts up exceptionally well, she's got great hands, and what you saw
tonight, three for four, is normally what she does. She had a key block, she
had key rebounds. She's just exactly developing how we need her to develop
right now.  
  
Q. What was your thoughts as Courtney kept hitting shot after shot?
Obviously you knew she was on fire, but did you realize that she was hitting
as many as she was, or were you kind of more focused on other things?  
COACH VERSYP: I never realize. I'm just happy that they're making shots and
they're going in. I don't realize. I don't keep count. I'm never a stat person
as the game goes on until I look at it. We're just worried about winning a
basketball game and sharing the basketball and having her knock down shots,
and she had an opportunity to do something special today.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  80

COACH STALEY: Well, I thought we came out ready to play. I thought we
represented our University extremely well. I thought our conference put us in
a position to play in an environment like this, which it's a big environment.
It's a big stage for our basketball team, and I thought we executed from the
very tip of the ball.  
  
Q. Charenee, this game you tied for most points in the paint scored this
season. What was the difference in that? It didn't seem to get going, but
after the first five minutes it seemed like it was clicking.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Well, I think we kind of recognized that our post kind of
had an advantage, and we just took it. We took it to head, and went out there
and just started to dominate. I think our guards did a great job of putting us
in the right position to give us the ball and give us opportunities to score.  
  
Q. Markeshia, just talk about the pressure you guys were able to put on the
Eagles after the first five minutes or so. It just seemed like you were
wearing them down, and it progressed as the game went on.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: Before the beginning of the game, I just talked in the huddle
about how Ieasia should start off the defense from an intensity standpoint and
it'll be a trickle‑down effect. And I think we carried that over into the
game, and it worked for us.  
  
Q. Charenee, the EMU coach was just saying how physical the game was, much
more physical than the style of play they're used to. They're the physical
team in their conference. Do you think the fact they weren't used to that, do
you think they were looking for calls that they would have gotten in their MAC
games that they weren't getting today?  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: I think they did play hard. I think the first few minutes
of the game it was something they kind of‑‑ they had a run. I thought their
post player, Reddick, I thought she did well. She was battling going up
against me and our other post players. But at the same time, like Coach Staley
said, I think our conference prepared us. We have played those big physical
post players, and I think the conference really got us ready for this type of
environment.  
  
Q. You guys forced 17 turnovers, 11 blocked shots. As a player, do you feel
more comfortable in the half court offense or do you feel more comfortable
scoring via transition offense from that pressure defense?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we like to run and gun more. But we slow it down when
we need to and execute in half court sets if we need to. So I think either one
is fine.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: I like us in transition a lot because we have some athletic
post players, myself included, and we do like to get out, and our guards look
for us. But at the same time I think we're really good in the half court set.
We get out and we do battle and we sit on people down low, and it's effective.  
  
Q. It's a big stage. What did you think of the big stage, and how did you
calm down your jitters a little bit?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: Well, we just came in here focused and ready to play. I don't
know if it was jitters, but I mean, we just came in here with a mindset that
we're going to play hard and we're going to play our type of basketball, which
is disciplined. We just went out there and played.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Same thing. We've seen a big stage before. We just left the
SEC tournament, and it was a nice crowd. It was a nice stadium. I think it
prepared us for this year. We haven't seen the NCAA Tournament before, but I
think we were ready. We had the mindset that we were going to go out and play
our game because just like we had to prepare for them, they had to prepare for
us, so we just executed.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the depth of your team? Within the first ten minutes I
think ten players rotated into the game. You have a lot of people you can turn
to at any time. Does that help you guys for a full 40 minutes?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: It just shows you how versatile we are. We can sub for
defense purposes for any player, and I think it works for us best.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: I like our bench, and the girls coming off the bench there,
they work just as hard as we do. I think we really do emphasize continuing the
intensity. If the starters aren't or are really doing what we need to do, we
expect the same thing from the next rotation, and so on and so forth. I think
we practiced that way, subs in, subs out. We go at each other hard, and this
is what we put out on the floor.  
  
Q. You guys have already been to Thompson Boling and got the win on the road
at Tennessee. Now, you will more than likely play Purdue Monday night. How do
you combat being here in Mackey Arena with pretty much a Purdue ‑dominant
crowd?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: I mean, we're going to prepare like we do for any other team.
We're going to be disciplined. We're going to be defensive minded. I think
playing at Thompson Boling, it helped us prepare for this stage, so we're just
going to practice tomorrow and be prepared.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: That win at Tennessee was unbelievable for me, and I know
my team, and we worked really hard for it. Just like Charenee said, we're
going to go out and we're going to prepare. We're going to do the same thing
that we do for every single team. We prepare for everyone the same, whether
we're playing on their home court or they're coming to see us or a neutral
site. So we're going to prepare. We're going to take this day, and tomorrow
we're going to practice and we're just going to come out and play our game.  
  
Q. The first five minutes of the game where they were dominating, what
happened with that a little bit, and how did you get them to turn it on for
the rest of the game?  
COACH STALEY: We all know that a marathon is not won in the first mile, and we
just had to transfer that information to our players. We knew over the course
of 40 minutes, I don't think they had the depth to deal with what we had,
starting the game with what we had coming off the bench. We knew the first
four minutes were going to be hard minutes because they're known as a team
that plays really hard in the first four minutes of the basketball game. So we
let our players know, and I thought they did a tremendous job of just holding
serve. They didn't get out to a really big lead. But we just relied on knowing
that we had a bench to come in and relieve our starters and not miss a beat
from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Q. What did you know about Tavelyn James coming into this game, and was she
a focal point for you guys? Was she the one that concerned you guys the
most?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, anytime a player scores, averages 24 points a game, no
matter what league they're in, that's an eye‑opening average, so she was a
highlight of our scouting report, but we also highlighted the point guard. We
felt like the point guard is key to engineering their offense and defense. So
what we wanted to do wascut the head off ‑‑ we call it cutting the head off
and the rest will go. If we can get to Thomas and wear her out a little bit
and make James work for every single touch, I think it worked in our favor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the ability of you guys as the game progressed, you
went from settling for jumpers outside to being able to attack the paint with
relative ease. Could you talk about the progression of that throughout the
game?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think sometimes we get a little focused on just taking
outside shots because the zone was pretty active, and it allows you to shoot a
lot of outside shots. But again, once the game settled down for us after the
first time‑out, I thought we made a conscious effort to get the ball inside. I
thought we did a tremendous job at turning them over and getting some easy
buckets in transition. For us we balanced the amount of outside shots we took
with going inside, and we executed.  
  
Q. The first five minutes it was kind of back and forth between you guys and
Eastern Michigan. What did you say to the team to get that defensive intensity
increased, and as we saw the result, 17 turnovers?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think any time you play on this stage, no matter what it
is, it's the first time we've played in the NCAA Tournament, you're going to
have some nervousness. The adrenaline is flowing. You just have to kind of
calm down and get back to normal, playing basketball the way we're used to
playing. Basically I just told them that over the course of 40 minutes, you're
going to see them get really tired, and throughout the first half I thought we
kind of made them a little weary. The shots that James usually makes, she
wasn't making. I thought that was due to our pressure, due to us making her
work extremely hard, and due to giving her different looks on the floor.  
  
Q. Was this the kind of opening game that you wanted, a game that you
controlled? You were able to obviously bring in the bench and get yourself
ready for Monday.  
COACH STALEY: You know, we really aren't a team that lets the game get away,
either way. Either we're losing by a large amount or‑‑ we're not a team that
blows a team out. So I was really concerned coming into the game because I
wanted our players to play their best basketball. Win, lose or draw, we wanted
to play our best basketball, and I thought us getting out gave us some
confidence, and then we widened the lead throughout the beginning of the
second half, and I thought we just gained some confidence from that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the depth of your basketball team? Today there didn't
seem like there was any dropoff from any substitution. Whoever stepped into
that spot seemed to play with the same level of intensity. Can you talk about
that?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think all season long, our bench has been very
productive. Sometimes we shorten it, sometimes we play a full bench. But I can
honestly say they've always been ready. They've always been ready to give us a
boost, whether it's from an offensive standpoint, but mainly from a defensive
standpoint. They knew they were going to play, and I think when they know
they're going to play, they practice a little bit better, have a little bit of
pep in their step and have a little bit more focus. I thought we just executed
from Tuesday on, honestly.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  80  
Eastern Michigan  48

  
COACH GILBERT: Well, the first thing I'd like to say is that I'm really
thrilled that our players were able to fight hard enough throughout the
regular season to win our conference tournament and to be here. We certainly
wanted to do more than just make a showing here in this tournament, and we tip
our hat to the defense of the No.4 ranked defense in the country, South
Carolina Gamecocks. They played a tremendous defensive game, had us on our
heels most of the game.  
I thought we started out fairly well offensively. They scored, we answered
quickly. But I just think their defense proved to be more than we could
handle, and we certainly respect meeting a defense that was better than our
own. I'd like to say kudos to the job they did defensively.  
I'm very proud of my team, just the way that they tried to fight back a little
bit in the second half. We want man to man, got a few stops, not nearly
enough, but they didn't give up. They faced a team that was a little bit
bigger, a little bit more aggressive on the boards. We haven't played a team
that's been like South Carolina. So this was a true test for us, and I'm just
really proud that our kids hung in there until the end.  
My center, Paige Reddick, was able to get her 1,000th point in this game. She
was just very resilient, and our players could get her the ball down the
stretch knowing what was at stake for her as she ended her career. I'm really
proud of their overall effort.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, what was different about their defense that maybe you had not
seen from another team this year?  
TAVELYN JAMES: Their defense was a lot more aggressive than any defense we've
probably felt. But I still feel like as a team we don't get stymied by
pressure defense. We're a team that's about offense and transition, so
somebody playing hard defense on us shouldn't make us not make baskets. We
should still be able to play our game and make baskets.  
  
Q. Natachia, it seemed like you guys had the first five minutes of the game.
What were you guys doing that was succeeding against South Carolina and then
what did they do to adjust?  
NATACHIA WATKINS: We had a lot of transition baskets at the beginning of the
game when we was running with them, and we was actually stopping them on
defense and being physical.  
  
Q. Natachia, how difficult was it to keep them out of the paint? They seemed
to get a lot of easy baskets, a lot of penetration in there.  
NATACHIA WATKINS: I mean, we all knew that they were a driving team, so we all
had our game plans on which way to force them or to play under, but they just
kept finding a way to get into the paint.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, you talked about their defense. What adjustments did you try to
make so that maybe you could have gotten into a groove?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I noticed that they was forcing me less, which I tried to drive
less, and shots wasn't falling today for Eastern. It wasn't like we didn't get
any shots up, we just couldn't hit them.  
  
Q. Did they do anything different than what you saw from them on film this
week?  
TAVELYN JAMES: The film we watched, no, they basically did the same thing,
besides key on like the key players on our team and do what they were supposed
to do to try to shut us down. I mean, that's really it.  
NATACHIA WATKINS: From what we watched, they was the exact same, except I felt
like their post got a lot more touches and looks this game than they have
previous to what we watched.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, just kind of what's your hope for this program moving forward?
What do you want to see out of this program over the next couple years?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I mean, I want to see the program do the same exact thing that
we've done this year. I mean, no one can take this year away from us,
regardless of this game or not. But we wanted to make a statement in the NCAA
that there are MAC teams that can play. We didn't want to go out this way; I'm
sure no team wants to go out this way. But as long as this team plays hard and
plays as Eastern, they'll make it.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, if you had another game against South Carolina, what do you
think you would do differently, or if you were talking to the team that plays
them on Monday, what would you suggest to try to stop them?  
TAVELYN JAMES: Just play our game. It's about heart, I feel, around this time.
Everybody needs to dig in and play. I don't believe that even if a team was
prepared for us for seven weeks before we played this game, it's about heart
and will.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, how does this team take the next step?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I would say they would need a leader because the two leaders
are leaving, so somebody else on the team would have to step up to make sure
the things that me and Paige tried to get done get done.  
  
Q. Just the challenge of keeping them out of the paint, how difficult was
that, and how big of a concern was that going in, in your mind?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, we thought that our zone play would keep them out of
the paint a bit more than it did. They were able to hit a few outside shots
that really changed the game, made us expand a little bit, which opened the
paint up a little bit more.  
I was excited that you could see Page Reddick is someone no matter what the
level of team is, she's able to take charges against anyone. She may have four
or five charges that she took in this game, and she's sort of our inside
stopper. She's a kid that really has a lot of miles on her, and with the big
bodies she faced today they were able to lean on her.  
At the next level, it's hard to create for our players in our league the kind
of physicality that you face in teams in different conferences, bigger power
conferences, SEC. This wasn't the biggest SEC team but they were a physical
team, and they went as far as the referees would allow. In our league we get a
little bit more of those bumps and contact fouls. We didn't get them today.
And it's hard to create on the spot what they were going to face.  
And this was a first time for many of our players, or for all of our players,
in the NCAA Tournament. You can't create this experience for them to let them
know how physical the game will be. We've played a lot of tough opponents, but
they did a great job of getting that ball, forcing the ball inside and forcing
our bigs to guard.  
  
Q. What would be your suggestion to the team that plays South Carolina on
Monday to challenge them, again, sort of looking as if you had maybe a do
‑over to challenge them?   
COACH GILBERT: As I mentioned in my last interview regarding South Carolina,
they do a great job. They have just enough interior to keep you honest, and
their kids on the outside can shoot the ball. They're not pure shooters, but
they can stroke it. They move the ball well. They force you‑‑ they make extra
passes and force your defense to shift. They use skip passes. You're going to
have to contain their exterior and stay connected to their interior pieces.
They did a nice job on the offensive glass to get second chance points. Their
post didn't do anything magical. They played extremely hard, and that is‑‑
they're coached that way, and it reflected on the floor.  
But you're going to have to keep their guards from shooting threes and stay
close to their post players to keep them off the glass.  
  
Q. Was that what was working for you in those first five minutes when you
had a six ‑point lead?  
COACH GILBERT: That was our thought. Our thought was that we could possibly
jump out on them early. Even our pressure, I just felt like the toll of a long
season, we needed a lot more in the paint to be able to press this South
Carolina team the way we press. One thing I want to say, my heart goes out to
my kids because my kids are so much better than what they reflected today.
They just found a team that could push back. We usually push people around,
but we found a team today that can push back, and when they pushed back, they
pushed really hard. So they were looking over at me, and I'm saying, hey, I'm
not an official.  
But I feel bad for them. My heart hurts for them because they lost to a very
good team. We shouldn't have lost this way, but we lost to a very good team.  
  
Q. I guess now that a majority of teams got a taste of this, what's your
hope moving forward for your players coming back and all the new kids coming
in?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, the one thing that I like, that I read in the
transcript regarding South Carolina, they were committed to defense. I want to
see an investment in the things that win games, rebounding and defense, and
we've been committed. But this was a team that was committed at a higher level
than we were. Our defense has been good enough to beat the teams that we've
played and to really challenge some teams in some other conferences. We beat
Michigan, lost to Michigan State by one point in overtime. We've played some
strong teams. But this team was really ‑‑ this South Carolina team was
committed to defensive rebounding. Those are the two keys that I thought we
had to do better than South Carolina, and I'd just like to see our players
continue to grow, get better.  
In terms of their skill, I thought this team hit some great pull‑up jump shots
on the baseline, in the paint. I'd like to see our players just through our
recruiting get a little bit bigger so when we face bigger teams we've got
bigger bodies. But I'd just like to see more of a commitment, a true
commitment, that even when your offense isn't clicking, your defense never has
an off‑night.  
  
Q. If Tavelyn puts up the points that she typically does, what's different
in this game today?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, I think it would have opened things up a lot more
from some of our other players. We missed a lot of easy baskets inside, even
when our post got some baskets inside. They've got to make those baskets in
order to free Tavelyn up a little bit. We didn't make those and Tavelyn didn't
make hers on the outside, which made for a terrible combination. Natachia
Watkins was a little bit off balance. She's a kid that had 25 in the
championship game of our conference tournament. She's so much better than what
she reflected, but the players we faced today, they could jump to her level.
They could rebound to her level. Tavelyn James met players that could body up
on her, not let her run off staggers without being bumped with a strong
forearm.  
So I think if Tavelyn had been able to get her game off a little bit earlier,
it would have made for a much better ballgame, a closer ballgame.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the Jackrabbits of South Dakota State. We'd
like to welcome South Dakota State obviously head Coach Aaron Johnston. We are
joined by Jennie Sunnarborg and Jill Young.  
I know you played Purdue at the start of last season in the preseason NIT, if
you would talk about how your team has evolved since that point.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Let's hope a lot. I think our team would agree that that was
not a very productive game for us. It's really hard to talk about that game
and then think about where we are at right now. We just played really poorly
in that game, and that has to do with Purdue being a very good team and us
just not having a very good day.  
This year I think we have played really good basketball. Jennie and Jill have
been very good seniors for us. We have had ups and downs this year, too, but
Jennie and Jill have done a great job of leading the team and being consistent
every day and when we have had a couple of bumps in the road, I think to their
credit, they have done a great job of getting back right away in the next
practice or next game and keep us going in the direction we need ti.  
This is our fourth trip to the NCAA Tournament. Jennie and Jill have been a
part of all four of those, which is quite a feat, considering it's the first
four chances we've had as a program. But it's exciting to see what these two
have done throughout their career, and it's exciting to see where they have
helped get our program.  
  
Q. How have you adjusted without Steph? Are you much different or what do
you anticipate tomorrow?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Good question, I think losing Steph Paluch in the semifinals
of the conference tournament was a big blow. I don't know that we are
different offensively or defensively in what we do or what we are trying to
get accomplished on court but we are different in our rotation.  
Steph was really playing well in the month of February at that off‑guard spot.
Earlier in the year, she started the point, would have played the point for us
here, was well in the preseason WNIT. But she really is more of a true
two‑guard. And as the season evolved, she got to be really, really good in
that position.  
So we lose her numbers. She hit a lot of big shots for us down the stretch at
particular times, very good defensive player. So really we lose that extra
person in the rotation. Really does not change our offense or defense that
much.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned this your fourth NCAA Tournament; what are your motions
knowing that this is your last NCAA Tournament?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: The most important thing that we have to think about is
that you have to keep going no matter what, and everything will‑‑ the game is
either win or loss, and you either keep playing or you're done. I know that's
been in the back of my mind, and we don't want our season to be over and we
are going to fight as much as we can to keep going.  
JILL YOUNG: I agree with Jennie. Like she said, it's either you win or you're
done. So we are definitely going to leave it all on the floor. This is our
last chance to help move our program forward. So we are going to be ready to
go.  
  
Q. Coach had mentioned the game last year, but did you take extra
motivation? It's the NCAA Tournament obviously so that would seem to be
plenty, but is there n extra motivation going into the game because of what
happened last year?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: I definitely think‑‑ I mean, you never want a loss on your
record and that one was not a great one, especially. And you know, I think we
are a better team than what we have been against Big Ten teams, and you know,
we just want to be a good team whether we are playing in the Summitt League or
we are playing nationally.  
Just something that we have, I guess not been focused on, but we want it back
and, you know, we are a better team than what we have been; that we have shown
so far.  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, it definitely wasn't our prettiest game of the year last
year. I think we are a way different team than we were at that point. But
that's, I guess, not really our driving, motivating factor.  
  
Q. As you look at Purdue now, what do you see? Obviously they don't have
Drey who you saw last year and they could have KK Houser back. How much does
that change them, and how different are they this season than last?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, I think if you look at Purdue traditionally, excellent
team in the halfcourt. They really get the ball to who they want to take shots
and where they want them to take shots and when they want them to take shots.
It's a little more guard orientated now.  
All three of those perimeter players make a ton of plays for them offensively.
They use their posts in a really smart way. They are not necessarily primary
options offensively, but they still get them the ball when they need shots.  
But I think the thing that stands out in my mind, last year and this year, is
just how well they execute in the halfcourt. We really struggled with
defending them last year. We just didn't get through screens very well. We
didn't take away certain things we wanted to try and take away, and the game
kind of got away from us offensively.  
Defensively, I think they are really the same; they do a great job of
executing a half‑court plan. They try to take certain players or option as way
from what we will want to do. We really noticed that in watching last year's
film.  
So we have to be better in how we execute on our end of the ball especially in
the halfcourt especially.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of Sam Ostarello from what you've seen
previously?  
COACH JOHNSTON: That's what I talk about when they use their post players in a
smart way. Sam is an example of someone that fits very well with what Purdue
does. She doesn't necessarily start their offensive possessions. But she is a
great screener, great passer and can score when she needs to and score when
she has chances to and she rebounds really well within their offense and just
fits really well with those there perimeter players that are very aggressive
and can take a lot of shots.  
Sam is not the kind of player that has to have the ball in her hands all the
time to be effective in the game; because she passes it so well and rebounds
so well, she really complements what the perimeter players do.  
So it's really no surprise. We saw Sam play in high school more than any other
college program in the country by far. So we really thought this would be
something that she could do and accomplish. She's having a great year.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on just the matchup, you're getting a team that is willing
and likes to log it out in the halfcourt, which you have done this year, a
little different style than you've had in the past. Can that work to your
advantage? Is that almost better than playing a team that's going to run all
over and try to force 40 turnovers and that kind of thing?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, you know, I think so. Like you say, they are really good on
the halfcourt offensively, and we are going to have to play tough defense and
keep them off the o‑boards.  
And then offensively, we are still going to try and push it when we can and
run when we can. But you know, off the block, give them a half‑court offense
and just be aggressive at taking it to the basket and finishing.  
  
Q. Looking back for the summer League Championships, obviously we had it
right in Sioux Falls, calling the fans the sixth player, not having that
auditorium full of yellow and blue tomorrow; is that going to add any level of
difficulty to the game?  
COACH JOHNSTON: It definitely changes things. We had I think averaged 5,000
people for our conference tournament games in Sioux Falls, and that's quite an
advantage for us and that's pretty clear. Now you flip it around and you can
have that and then some here tomorrow rooting against us.  
But that's the model that works in the NCAA Tournament. We know that going
into it. There are a number of host sites and host seeds and they are going to
have that same advantage and that's what works right now in women's basketball
in the NCAA Tournament.  
It does make it a little bit more challenging, but it also makes it a good
atmosphere. It makes it what you want to feel like in the NCAA Tournament.
There's no value for any of our teams that are here going to an empty arena
just to have a neutral site so to speak. It does make it more difficult
without a doubt and does make Purdue a better team here at home, but it does
also add to the overall event, as well.  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: It's going to be a challenge for us but our fans have been
great all year and we will have a good crowd all year. Just kind of create our
energy from our players and our players.  
JILL YOUNG: I guess I agree with everything they said. It's already a fun
atmosphere. We have been in these environments before, and even though it's
not our home floor and all of our fans, it's still a good atmosphere out on
the floor.  
Like Jennie said, we will be ready to bring our own energy on the bench and
out on the floor.  
  
Q. Fourth year in a row, how much does that give you guys to be able to
prepare for this? You know what you're getting yourself into; this isn't
anything new for you.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, I think it's helped us prepare for things like this. We
had all of these questions you've asked so far were well scripted and prepared
in advance; so our fourth year has paid off for us already.  
I just think all of the different, I would say logistics, that go into this
event. It is very different. You have to get here earlier. There's a bit more
security. There's more media. It's how the practices.  
So it's not like a road game, and you don't want it to be like a road game. If
that's the case, there's no reason to have an NCAA Tournament. So the fact
that it's different is good but having been in it enough we are just not
really surprised that, boy, I didn't expect this kind of thing.  
It really becomes more about the game, and I hope that it translates to having
some success out on the court. We can really focus on Purdue and make that be
the most important part of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Jennie or Jill, do you have a scripted reply for that question?
Players will pass. Go ahead, next question.  
  
Q. Jennie, the Purdue men play tonight in the tournament. Your guys played
last night. New experience. Did you guys watch the game? What were your
thoughts on just having that, probably a little fun distraction along your own
trip?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: It was. The fact that we got here yesterday was good. We
kind of got relaxed in the hotel and everything. Going out to watch the men
play, it was fun, and got to hang out with the team. You know, we would have
been doing that whether we were here or not.  
It was fun to watch and it was good for our program, and the emotions that
went through. And the fact that our men didn't win the game, you know, I guess
we want us to pull it off I guess. But it's good for our program either way.  
  
Q. Jill, if you can go back to the conference championship, at the free
throw line with seven seconds left, did you have any time to think about the
enormity of what you're doing, shooting free throws for what could be your
last NCAA Tournament berth, and since then, have you thought about if you had
missed the free throws?  
JILL YOUNG: I guess just try to keep it simple. Really I had no doubt, or I
guess no negative thinking; just knew that they were going to go in. I don't
know, like I said before, I shot a lot of free throws in my life, so I guess
it was just kind of in the flow (ph), I don't know.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when you saw her at the free throw line
with seven seconds?  
COACH JOHNSTON: I actually thought about using your same line: Jill, if you
miss these, you realize you will not go back to the NCAA Tournament. But then
I think probably better judgment overcame.  
I really, honestly for not one second doubted that she would make them. Jill
is a very, very good shooter. I can't remember her record, 160‑some‑‑ I
probably shorted you a couple, is that right. There was really no doubt in
anybody's mind that she was going to make both of those. If you saw her body
language and been around Jill a lot, she looked very calm and very
comfortable. As a coach, you can always tell if someone is out of their
routine and she wasn't. I think we all knew she was going to make it.  
  
Q. Your free throw shooting, how many have you hit in a row at one point in
your life?  
JILL YOUNG: 21.  
  
Q. All these in games?  
JILL YOUNG: No, just in the gym.  
  
Q. When did the free throw shooting become the thing for you; at what age?  
JILL YOUNG: I guess I went to a lot of like free throw contests, like Elks
free throw contests and stuff, back when I was seven, eight years old. And so
was doing I guess pressure situations back then, state contests and regional
contests and stuff, way back when, probably when the form wasn't the best and
used two hands.  
  
Q. The fact that most of your team played in this arena last year, is there
a comfortable feeling with the surroundings? Does that help ease any nerves
that you might have to start the game?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: I think so. We know the atmosphere and we know who is going
to draw a pretty good crowd. Yeah, I think it's comfortable to say that we
have played on this court and are ready to go.  
  
Q. How difficult has it been to get DivisionI opponents to try to come up to
South Dakota and play a game? I think your program has risen to the national
level with some of the things you've done over the years?  
COACH JOHNSTON: It could be a challenge. I tell our staff the two most
important things we do as a staff are recruit and also schedule. I don't know
if all coaches put that in that order but we need to because of where we are
at. You really just have to find the right programs, and there are a group of
women's programs out there who are I think committed to challenging their
teams and also helping women's basketball grow at the same time.  
So for instance next year, we'll have Nebraska at our place and Marquette at
our place. This year we had Washington at our place and Kansas State at our
place. You know, we have had teams that have done that.  
But there are certainly a handful of teams in our Midwestern area that just
won't consider playing us at their place, or certainly coming back. So we just
have to be really proactive in trying to identify the teams that are willing
to do it. We do run into some walls that are difficult.  
  
Q. When Purdue was up earlier, they talked a lot about how much momentum
they felt they had for winning their conference tournament. For you guys, the
only way you get into the tournament to do that. That said, do you guys feel
like that, momentum from doing that or is it a different thing in a non ‑BCS
conference?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, I think so. Just I guess our last, I don't know how many
games, I think we have just been playing well together and definitely had to
overcome some things in the conference tournament that I think pulled us
together; just coming down from 17 and just fighting through that, I think it
added on and gave us good experience and also momentum coming into the
tournament.  
  
Q. On paper, you guys and Purdue, especially in things like bench scoring
and offensive output and defensive scoring average, very similar, and yet the
teams are not very similar. What do you see there in terms of differences or
why the teams get sort of the same results maybe in different manners?  
COACH JOHNSTON: You're asking me to compare our team to our past teams?  
  
Q. No. You guys and Purdue in terms of scoring defense and scoring offense,
pretty similar numbers and yet different styles.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, I just think, like I said at the beginning, the offense
is so efficient. So they can score 65 and 70 points in a game, and for us that
might mean a lot of possessions and for them that might mean very few
possessions. Just because they make so many shots, they don't turn it over.
They just get so much out of each possession I think.  
And then defensively, I think they are just really good at taking things away
from you. They really do go into a game plan and figure out, one, two, three,
four, they are not going to do. They have to do to five, six and seven.  
For us, we are very different than them. We don't go into a game and just say,
we need to take player a out. We have an overall scheme that we use, and then
we'll vary it based on the teams that we play a little bit. Same thing
offensively. We have got kind of a universal philosophy and we'll throw some
things in here or there that we think will be effective against our next
opponent, in this case Purdue.  
But I think they are very different styles. Not better, worse; just very
different styles. But they are just so efficient. They get so much out of each
possession on both ends, and I think they are deceiving. So they are not a
team that runs up‑and‑down but they score a lot of points, considering they
are very good on the halfcourts.  
  
Q. Of the national prominence that SDSU has garnered over the last couple of
years, and it ties into with Sam on the other side, it sounded like by all
inclusive accounts, she was about to sign with SDSU and spurned you for a Big
Ten team. Do you feel like you don't have to worry about that as much with the
area opponents because of how much success you've had in the last couple
years?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Area opponents or area recruits?  
  
Q. Area recruits. Just deciding to go with a bigger squad or stay with
you.  
COACH JOHNSTON: I think recruiting is always going to be a challenge for us.
You walk around the new facility here at Purdue you, and see what they have to
offer and if you put yourselves in the shoes of somebody who is 17 or 18, you
can kind of see how they are going to migrate towards some of these bells and
whistles.  
But we also have a lot of players that have come to South Dakota State because
of what we offer over some bells and whistles. Kind of like in scheduling, you
have to find the people that are really looking for what we offer and the kind
of game they are going to get.  
We have to be selective about the young people we recruit and that they have
to want something that South Dakota State offers over some of these other
schools.  
We don't change the type of player we want to recruit. We don't say, well, we
can't recruit her because she's too good. We have never taken that approach.
We have a lot of people on our team that were recruited by I think BCS‑level
schools and chose to come to South Dakota State for our reasons. It's about
being very selective and making sure we identify who is going to be excited
about us at an early time.  
  
Q. This time of year, there's a lot of focus on X's and O's, people say, if
you need motivation right now, you're in the wrong business. That said, is
this the motivation, or have you talked to teams about, time to get out of the
first round; has that idea come up?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, we have been out of the first round before. So it's not
as if we can't accomplish that.  
But we did talk about it this week; the importance of not being content. I
don't think anybody ever goes into an NCAA Tournament and says, oh, that's
great, let's see how it goes and go back about our lives.  
Really trying to hammer that point home; that if we want to go forward, it's
going to be based on something that we have to do in the game and not just
show up for the game and kid of hope things go well.  
That doesn't mean we came up with a Purdue package that's going to put us over
the hump because of the great X's and O's, but it's going to be hopefully
because of our approach and our last few practices and practice day approach
to the game. We just have to be far more tenacious than we have been the last
couple years. I think our team the last few years wanted to win, too. It's
tough to beat Oklahoma. They went to the Final Four, so I think they proved to
be‑‑ tough to beat Xavier and they were a top five team. Our opponents had
something to do with that.  
But we have to be really tenacious and approach this as if we are going to
figure out a way to win no matter what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach and Ladies, thank you very much and good luck in your
game tomorrow afternoon.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the arrival of the Big Ten Champions, the
Purdue Boilermakers. First we'll open with a quick question for Coach Versyp.
If you would, talk about your opponent in tomorrow's game, what concerns might
you have most about their play.  
COACH VERSYP: South Dakota state is very well balanced team, very well
coached, very disciplined. They shoot the 3 exceptionally well. They do really
well on the offensive boards, so we need to make sure that we obviously box
out exceptionally well and be able to get up‑and‑down the floor.  
  
Q. Sam, just your e ‑mails and texts, have they blown up this week because
of the connection with South Dakota.   
SAM OSTARELLO: You know, not a whole lot which is kind of nice. It's just
another game for us. It's one step that we have got to get through. Try to
keep it at that.  
  
Q. KK nowadays, we learn everything on Twitter and you guys got some
popsicles the other day. Was that kind of a back ‑to‑summer‑camp‑type of mode?
  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, it was a little hot yesterday in Mackey. We were getting
water breaks like every five minutes, and all of a sudden coach says, goes,
okay, we are going to have a popsicle break real quick. So we got to take a
popsicle break and then back to work.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the approach that you guys have to this NCAA
Tournament compared to last year where you really sort of had to fight your
way in; you're a higher seed, playing on your home court, and sort of your
last go ‑around this year?   
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think especially coming off a great victory, I think we
are going into this tournament a lot more confident than we were last year, a
lot more experienced. We are obviously not losing any from last year's team is
great for us, especially to come into the tournament this year and being on
your home floor playing with a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. Do you sense that your senior class has a lot of urgency knowing that
you're down to the last few games here, if not sooner than that?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think definitely our senior class as well as the
other players on this team, I think the whole team is feeling that sense of
urgency and every step of the way you have to feel that sense of urgency to be
able to play at your best, play your best basketball.  
  
Q. One for KK, third year here, first NCAA Tournament game, what are your
emotions going into tomorrow?  
KK HOUSER: The hype is so much different than other tournaments and games that
we've played. But I'm excited. I'm just going to continue to do what I've been
doing in the past.  
  
Q. For all three, how long did it take to get over the high of the Big Ten
tournament and get refocused for this?  
KK HOUSER: I honestly don't think we are over it yet. It's what's carrying us
over into this game and to have confidence and everything like that. We can't
dwell on it but I don't think I'm over it yet.  
SAM OSTARELLO: Going along with KK, I think we are using, you know, all of the
emotions and energy that we had from the Big Ten tournament and taking it into
this NCAA first‑round game. But we were refocused a couple days after. It
didn't take long for us to realize, hey, we have to get back at it and get our
other goals that we set down.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think we are still energized from it. I think it's
something that we need to have the energy from; getting a big win like that
for the program and the University is great for us and I think it's something
that will catapult us into this tournament.  
  
Q. Sam, coming from South Dakota, did you ever think you would be playing a
team from your home state in a game of this magnitude?  
SAM OSTARELLO: It was a possibility. Anything can happen in March.  
  
Q. Sam, have you talked with maybe Katie or Stephanie or those you might
know from Fort Peter?  
SAM OSTARELLO: Only time I talked to Steph, I sent her a get‑well text after I
heard about her ACL injury. That was about a week or so ago. We have not
really talked. We know it's business but we know we are still friends. But
it's game time. It's about business right now.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about your season, it's kind of a breakout for you, you
obviously contributed a lot your first two years but your stats are doubled
and you've started every game. What's your key to your expanded role?  
SAM OSTARELLO: The team. The team having confidence in everything I do. I
would not be able to get rebounds if the whole team didn't box out.  
It goes back to everything we do in practice. We are not just focused on one
player or anything like that. It just kind of blossomed from that and I feed
off all of their confidence in me.  
  
Q. KK, both teams have lost multiple players now; talk about coming back
from that, trying to contribute when you can't be on the floor and how it
affects things, how you guys have seen it play out?  
KK HOUSER: You know, it's kind of a struggle coming back a little bit. Just
the turnovers and the pace of the game and being out a whole year, it takes a
while once you adjust. But I've had Coach V. have my back the whole year which
is awesome.  
Right now I would say I'm good where I'm at. My knees are feeling good. It
takes a while and about halfway through the season is when I started feeling
better.  
  
Q. KK, can you just talk about the group of seniors and how excited you guys
are to go out and play well sort of for them here in their last go around?  
KK HOUSER: I love playing for our seniors. Great group of girls. They want to
win and they just have this look in their eyes; it's all about business and
I'm excited to play my last games with them.  
  
Q. South Dakota has had about a game and a half to adjust to losing the
point guard; what have you seen out of the replacement and kind of evaluate
their team post knee injury with Steph.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I think Erin does a great job, so when a player goes down,
it's a sister falling down. So the team usually rally ease around. I think how
Erin handled it, like how KK and Drey handled it, that actually helps your
team. If you stay positive, I think that's the biggest thing.  
You know, other players are stepping up and that's what they have done.
Players came in and knocking down the 3s and have a different role. So their
role has now changed. You know, they use a lot of depth, and obviously with
her having the most steals on the team and assists, that obviously is an
adjustment, but they have done a good job in the last game and a half without
here.  
  
Q. For Brittany, is there any added pressure to make sure and protect your
home court, being able to host those two games?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I don't think I would call it pressure. I think it's an
advantage for us to be able to be home and have our home crowd and we are
really excited to be able to host hopefully these first two rounds for us to
play in and it's a great opportunity for us to be able to play in front of our
home crowd and I don't think that it would be any added pressure. I think it
just adds on to the fun for us.  
  
Q. This is your last tournament game; what are your emotions going in?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I'm excited. Like I said, just coming off the big win in the
Big Ten tournament is huge. Being able to push it into the NCAA is great and
to be able to play hopefully two games at home is huge for us. I'm just really
excited.  
  
Q. If you are looking at the keys to tomorrow, but to have success in the
next couple of weeks, what's at the top of your black board right now?  
COACH VERSYP: It's always team defense and then the second thing is
rebounding. You have to do a great job on the boards. You have to dominate in
both areas. And when we have done that, then good things have happened for us.  
  
Q. Coach, statistically, you're pretty similar in terms of points scored and
allowed. You both get a lot from your bench. Are the teams somewhat similar or
is that just a numbers thing and not really true to the naked eye?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's that they are similar and we are just playing two
different conferences. You know, our non‑conference and our Big Ten is
obviously a different style than theirs, and they have four out, one in more,
where we have three guards and two post players. So the styles are totally
different and I just think it's the numbers.  
  
Q. Sharon, do you get a different sense from this team than a year ago? Last
year you had to play your way in; I would imagine there's a little different
feel coming into this year.  
COACH VERSYP: Oh, the whole year it's been different. It has not just started
now at the NCAA. It started when we went to Europe. What went through last
year just brought us closer.  
So the bottom line is, we set high goals, and our team has responded and you
know, so the NCAA Tournament and any games that we are in, we always have a
sense of urgency and know that we want to do the best that we can. This year
should have been different and it definitely is.  
  
Q. Having gone up the team in the NIT preseason a while back, and then
having seen them play in Cancún earlier this year, how big of an advantage is
that just knowing your opponent a little bit more rather than going up against
some random team from Timbuktu?  
COACH VERSYP: It works both ways. But they pretty much had everybody returning
this year from last year and we do, too. Our teams are a little different. We
have KK back and we don't have Drey and they have had some injuries.  
You are used to maybe the style. You know what is going to be coming at you.
But it comes down to execution and it comes down to fundamentals. It comes
down to executing your offense and your defense. It's nice to know your
opponent, but sometimes when you don't, there's a different keenness to your
student athletes when they have to pay attention to even more detail.  
THE MODERATOR: Purdue, good luck tomorrow afternoon.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us from the University of South Carolina, Dawn
Staley, and our three players whose names are posted in front of them. We
would like you to ask any questions specific to any of the athletes and with
that first of all, we would like to open for questions.  
  
Q. Dawn, just reading up on your team, Sylvia Hatfield called your team
"street fighters." Is that a definition that you like associated with your
team or is that not a good definition for your team?   
COACH STALEY: Well, street fighters is a team that's a very physical
basketball team; a team that can come out and play the game the way it's
supposed to be played. I deem it as a pretty good name.  
  
Q. Coach, all season you've been known as a lock it down type of defense,
holding teams 31 times below their scoring average. What do you need to do
tomorrow to contain their leading scorer, James, who I'm sure you've been able
to watch some video of, and what does she do so well that allows her to get to
that bucket with ease?  
COACH STALEY: James, she's a scorer. She has a scorer's mentality. She likes
to put the ball up. She shoots a lot of baskets. But what we need to do is we
need to take discipline to the game plan. We need to make it very difficult
for her to get touches. We need to contest every shot she takes.  
Certainly we have to do some things that we have done in our conference. I
don't foresee us doing anything as far as out of the box, jump defenses or
anything. I think our players are really disciplined when it comes to sticking
to the game plan.  
  
Q. La'Keisha, talk about the trip over here yesterday, flying in, and
getting settled in. What's this experience been like for you so far and is it
hitting you that you are getting ready to partake in an NCAA Tournament
game?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: We had our Gamescocks' fans meet us as practice and a lot of
people from Columbia came out to see us off; a lot of cheering, hugs and
smiles and a lot of pictures were taken. It was an exciting trip for myself
personally, and my teammates and the whole coaching staff.  
  
Q. I feel like you all are extensions of each other a little bit. Just talk
a little bit about the rapport all three of you guys have and how well you've
worked all season offensively being able to find each other in transition
really well.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we all bring something different to the table. I
think Ieasia is our leader of this group of guards. She's our point guard. And
I think Keisha is very dynamic in what she does. She can do everything. She
can shoot; she can drive; she can defend. And I bring our three‑point
shooting. So I think we just bring a lot of different things to the table, and
it's hard to guard us.  
  
Q. Curious of the players, has Coach Staley or Coach McCray shared any
stories with you about their experiences?  
COACH STALEY: No, we haven't. It's been over 20 years, so I think our players
are more tangible in the here and the now. And for them, I want them to
experience it for themselves, because they have been part of this program
since year one for La'Keisha and Ieasia has been here for three years, and
Markeshia, this is her second year. For them, they have seen the program go
through some growth and we know with growth, it doesn't always feel good. But
you know, it's their experience, so you know, we rarely share some of the
things we have done in our lives from a coaching standpoint because we are a
little out of touch.  
  
Q. I haven't seen your team a whole lot this year, could you describe
through your defensive style what you hang your hat on, some of your
fundamentals that have allowed you to play so well defensively?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we are committed; we are a committed defensive basketball
team, where as we know, what butters our broad. From an offensive standpoint
we are not very consistent and if you look at us on paper, it's not very
pretty. So we can't bank on something that we do probably a third of the time
well, which is shoot the basketball.  
From a defensive standpoint, you know, we don't allow teams to get up as many
shots as they would like to get up. We don't take the air out of them, but we
certainly shrink the game as far as possessions are concerned and our players
are committed to it.  
You can't really coach a team that's not committed to something, but they
really see ‑‑ they are tangible. What they have been able to do to opponents
as far as how many points they score, how many ‑‑ stopping from teams from
doing what they like to do.  
  
Q. Aleighsa Welch, how is she doing? Is she going to play tomorrow with the
knee?  
COACH STALEY: Aleighsa is back. She played a little in the SEC Tournament.
She's a resilient player. We are looking to get her a little bit more minutes
than we did in the SEC Tournament. She's practiced well for the past week and
a half, and hopefully we'll have her at full strength tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. You talk about the depth of your team; you have a bunchof people you can
rotate off the bench, and if you look at the numbers your bench contributes
heavily to the scoring and rebounds. Talk about the depth of your team this
year.  
COACH STALEY: I think coming into the season, we knew we were bringing in a
lot of players who could contribute in one area or another.  
I think probably the backbone of what we have been able to do is because we
have had a lot of players who can come off the bench and do a lot of different
things. Aleighsa Welch, she leads us in rebounding. We got Ebony Wilson, as
well, and Sancheon White and Tina Roy, they all come off the bench to give us
a little bit something different, whether it's defense or offense.  
We feel real good about having these guys maybe get a blow during the course
of the game and not miss a beat.  
  
Q. Who is the floor general of this team for you?  
COACH STALEY: The floor general is Ieasia Walker. She's done a tremendous job
at running our basketball team. She's probably sacrificed some of her offense,
just so some of our other players can get shots that they normally get. But
hopefully she'll pick up her offensive prowess as we take the floor tomorrow
morning.  
  
Q. Seems that your focus is here and now; I know your players have gone on
YouTube and see you play; have you guys done that yet ‑‑ look at the laughs
(players laughing). You guys haven't seen your coach play on YouTube or
anything like that? So you don't share your experience with them in this
special situation.  
COACH STALEY: You have to know your personnel. You have to know what they are
listening to. Usually if you are telling them something that's going to help
them, they are listening pretty deeply. But when we talk about something like
myself or Coach McCray, they have this running, like, joke, where they will
bang on the table, wall, anything that they can hit; that means be quiet.
(Laughter) we have heard that a number of times.  
  
Q. Ieasia, Coach talked about you guys being committed to defense, but when
you first came into the program, did you come in committed to defense, or did
Dawn have to make you guys committed to defense?  
IEASIA WALKER: I think I was more committed to defense because my offense was
not there immediately and so I had my mind set on being an energy player and a
defensive stop my freshman year. As I progressed along, I started playing both
sides and that's what she always emphasized; to play defense, so I just stayed
with it.  
  
Q. When you first got in the program, did you realize that defense would
come first in this program?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: To be honest, no, I didn't. I thought it was all about
offense and stuff like that but coach emphasized defense and being able to be
discipline a lot, and just taking part with your teammates and competing
night‑in and night‑out, I kind of locked in on defense with my teammates.  
  
Q. At what point were you really committed to defense?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I think my freshman year because I was thrown into the game
to stop the other team's best player. I guess I was good at it, so every time
I'm always guarding best player.  
  
Q. Dawn, some battles when you first got the to battle as far as the style
you wanted to play and the commitment to defense that you wanted out of your
program?  
COACH STALEY: Well, you know, I mean, we have just‑‑ the very beginning, you
know, of coaching, when I was at Temple, something that we can always bank on
was being a very good defensive team and that stuck with me throughout my
career, because offense, you know, it's great to have skills from an offensive
standpoint, but you know, you can't keep trading back.  
We knew the strength of our team would be defense. We knew we had the type of
athletes that could, you know, pretty much play 94 feet, and we also knew it
was an asset, from an offensive standpoint. We shoot‑‑ most of our players
shoot 30 to 40 percent, which isn't a great percentage, but a percentage of us
getting stops is a lot greater than the percentage of us hitting baskets
night‑in and night‑out.  
  
Q. How have you seen Coach's personality, or how has she handled the team
change ‑‑ you're already starting to smile‑‑ over the last four years and why
do you think it's been so successful the last four years?   
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I think her personality‑‑ well not just her personality but
her coaching style because she let's us hold each other accountable and kind
of correct each other before she steps in to stay something. Pretty much she's
always been easy to talk to and like a silly person. So it's not hard.  
You know, if you make a mistake you don't just dwell on that mistake because
she finds a way to bring us out of it. She's always been intense and really
competitive, and just, you know, if you make a mistake, she won't tell you
about it; but at the same time, if you are doing good, she won't tell, you,
too. So she's not that hard to play for.  
  
Q. Have you had to take a step back occasionally?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Freshman year, we were knew to her, she was knew to us and
it was an adjustment, getting used to each other. I think we bought into her
system and trust in the process, and helped us win a lot of games this career.  
  
Q. How much have you learned in terms of being the floor general?  
IEASIA WALKER: A whole lot. You just have to be a leader on and off the court.
It really never stops. You just always have to set an example and be very
vocal, which is something that I had to get used to when I came in, because I
was not very vocal. I was more of a lead‑by‑example; so I learned to add the
vocal ability and also the leading by example to my game.  
  
Q. How will you manage the nerves? You've played in big games, so it's not
like it's your first big game but certainly a different stage in the NCAA
Tournament.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we are all excited and we have seen games of this
calibre, so I think we are just going to be focused and ready and we are going
to stick to what we do best, and that's be disciplined on defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you addressed the team after the selection show on Monday, that
you'll know what type of cereal Eastern Michigan will be eating in the
morning; have you figured that out or do you think you'll be comfortable?  
COACH STALEY: I haven't gotten to that one yet, but we do know. I think we
have got a pretty good handle on the type of thing that Eastern Michigan is,
and we have got a battle ahead of us.  
But certainly we feel like we like who we are bringing into the game. We like
the style of play that we are taking into the game, and I like the approach
and the focus of our players.  
So you know, it's going to be a battle, and it's one that, you know, we accept
the challenge because we are here at the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the relationship that you've got with
Coach McCray and how you convinced her to come here and what she's done for
this program?  
COACH STALEY: Well, with Coach McCray we battle. We battled together. We have
been in the foxhole together. She's one that she's a tireless worker. She
recruits. She does an excellent job preparing our team. It's got to be taught
just like the rest of our staff. But she's pretty easy to convince. You've
just got to stroke her ego a little bit (laughing) and she's easy to, you
know‑‑ I think she understands what the task at hand and coming to South
Carolina, she knew that we wanted to turn the program around. She wanted to be
a part of, you know, that process.  
It's been a long, hard‑fought battle. I think for us to do it once again,
being able to overcome some challenges as coaches now instead of being
players, it's a beautiful thing.  
  
Q. Why do you struggle so much at the free throw line?  
COACH STALEY: Why do we struggle so much at the free throw line? It's a good
question. It really is a good question.  
We have tried to change up the way we practice shooting free throws. We
actually consulted with a specialist when it comes to free throw shooting. And
quite honestly, I think it's a little bit better than it was at the beginning
and midway through the season. And in particular, it's probably actually
Boomer. She's shooting it a little bit better. She's probably the one that's
bringing that thing way down, the average way down.  
But over the past couple of weeks, she's been shooting it a lot better in the
SEC tournament. She shot a lot better. But if I knew, we probably would have
more wins or probably less losses than we do at this stage of the game.  
  
Q. Through your WNBA career, you're like an 85 percent free throw shooter;
how frustrating is it to watch your team, knowing the level of free throw
shooting that you achieved?  
COACH STALEY: It is frustrating at times, but you know, it is what it is. I
think it probably just puts pressure on our defense to get stops. You know,
for us, we are going to knock‑on‑wood and hopefully we can get them to fall,
because when we do get them to fall, we end up victorious in closely‑matched
basketball games.  
  
Q. Obviously you had success getting Temple to the NCAA Tournament. What do
you take away from those experiences and what may you do differently this time
trying to get this team prepared going into Game1 against Eastern Michigan?  
COACH STALEY: For us, it's pretty much the same thing. We are not going to
change the approach. We are going to try to stay as normal as possible in how
we prepare. I think the more familiar you are with your approach to the game,
the better off you're going to play.  
Of course, I do think our players are going to have some jitters at the
beginning of the game. That's only right for them to feel that way. But you
know, once the game settles down, I think we'll get into doing the things that
we have done all season long, which is defend and hopefully knock down some
shots within our offense and maybe create some easy opportunities from our
defense.  
  
Q. To any of the players, specifically Grant and Sutton, knowing this is
your final run, that this is it, what's it like knowing this is do ‑or‑die
mode and this is where your career at USC comes to an end?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: It just shows how much, like, our hard work has paid off and
what our sacrifice to be at this point; and it just shows like how much my
teammates and my coaching staff has believed in me.  
I'm just thankful though come to the NCAA Tournament and be able to play with
these great people. So it's just a blessing.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I pretty much agree with Markeshia, just being thankful and
just it's a blessing really, because to see where we started out at my
freshman year in particular, the belief that the coaches had in us and the
belief my teammates had in me and the amount of belief that we had in each
other, we finally got to where we wanted to be since day one.  
I'm not too much focused on it being my last time, my last time in a Gamecock
uniform. Just trying to focus on getting a win and trying to do as much as I
can to help my team.

### [AnnMarie Gilbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23572)

### [Tavelyn James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23573)

### [Paige Redditt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23574)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Mid‑American Conference champions
Eastern Michigan University. We'd like to welcome AnnMarie Gilbert, the head
coach from Eastern Michigan, as well as players Tavelyn James and Paige
Redditt.  
Questions for Coach or players.  
  
Q. Coach, a couple of years ago you were here in the NIT. Does this bring
back some memories, other than I guess the final outcome, familiar place for
you guys?  
COACH GILBERT: It's a very familiar place for us. I'm really excited to be
back. It's a great place to play. We fared pretty well in that game with the
exception of the final outcome. We led for most of that game. And then there
was a Brittany Rayburn who hit a couple of shots on us late. Can't forget
Brittany Rayburn.  
But it certainly brings back great memories. I used to coach in the Big Ten as
well. And I'm certainly happy to showcase these fine student‑athletes, because
they are really a big part of the reason why we're here.  
  
Q. Tavelyn and Paige, if each of you could talk about being in the NCAA
Tournament at this stage of your career and just how much have you guys
enjoyed the attention and the moments that have come with something like
this?  
TAVELYN JAMES: We never experienced anything like this ever since we've been
at Eastern. So to have the chance to make it to the NCAA, it shows that we
worked so hard our four years to make it here, and we've done it.  
So the experience right now is a little overwhelming, just to see I've never‑‑
I probably could never picture myself sitting right here thinking before our
first game in the NCAA tournament.  
PAIGE REDDITT: Just like she said. It is overwhelming. It's something we've
worked for for our careers, especially to make it our senior year it's the
biggest accomplishment for us, and it's the best way we can go out.  
  
Q. The more you guys were able to win those really close games in the MAC
Tournament to get here, what does that do for your confidence going forward?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I think for me it keeps my confidence the same. I don't try to
overthink the situation or say like I'm any better than anybody else because
everybody has to put their shoes on the same way I do. We just come off and
play hard.  
And I mean the experience in those two games, which I relive every day in my
head, is Paige hitting that layup. I think about it every time, everybody come
to me, say you're a tremendous player. And I say Paige is an All‑American. She
hit the shot. It's wonderful.  
PAIGE REDDITT: I don't know what to say. I mean, it is something that you
relive over and over. And I think that through our careers here we have had a
lot to pull from. We've been through a lot of adversity in our careers. So we
have a lot to pull from.  
We have a lot of heart in our team. So pulling out close games is what we have
been built to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had a chance now to look at South Carolina on film. Talk
about South Carolina, what stands out?  
COACH GILBERT: South Carolina is a well‑coached team. They play very much like
their fierce and fearless leader Dawn Staley, but they have very good guard
play, Sutton and Grant and Roy off the bench. Those kids are solid guards.
They play up‑tempo.  
They have no reservation about shooting the 3. You know, they're not stellar
3‑point shooters, but they're gamers. They knock shots down when their team
needs them to.  
And they've got a nice inside presence. And I think that they've got enough on
the interior with Stephens and Bruner and Welch to really keep people honest.
So their guards can get gaps and openings. So we're used to playing up‑tempo
style teams. But this is a very good team.  
It presents some interesting matchups for us. But we feel we match up well
with this basketball team. And we're excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Is there anybody that you played this year either in the MAC or in the
nonconference that are similar to this South Carolina team?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, there's nobody that directly reflects this team, but
there are some pieces of guards. You know, Michigan State has some nice guards
that resemble some of the kids that we'll face. Central Michigan has some
athletic players that jump up to the net, to the level of the rim, to get
rebounds.  
This is a team that has some nice athletes, just some nice pieces. I like what
Sutton is doing at the point for them. She plays multiple positions, but she's
a pretty savvy kid, and we've got our work cut out for us.  
But we feel like we have some nice guards, and we can match their interior
play with Paige Redditt and Olivia Fouty, India Hairston. So we hope that we
can keep this South Carolina team off balance a little bit. Change things up a
little bit, not let them get comfortable in any rhythm or groove and try to
win every four‑minute period.  
  
Q. If Tavelyn and Paige could comment on Coach Gilbert and talk about her
coaching style and what it's been like to play for her for four years?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I think she coaches everyone different. Everybody can handle
different situations a different way. I can say for me she's been a coach that
has driven me to be the person that I am, mainly off the court, because when I
came to Eastern, I could play. So her objective was to help me become a better
person off the court. And she has.  
So it's like she was a coach that never let up. She always rolled me every
single year. And I always wondered why. And now I can see why.  
PAIGE REDDITT: The same thing for me. Coach Gilbert is a tough coach. You
can't be a soft player to play for her. And she coaches us to play in the NCAA
tournament. So she coaches us at the same level every day. And either we play
up to it or we don't. But she always coaches the same way.  
She's always pushed me to be a better person, a better player. I mean, when I
came to Eastern I wasn't the scorer, and she has formed me to get better each
year. And I've gotten better every year, up until now.  
So I think I can see to get better this year, too.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, when you saw in the brackets that you were coming back to Mackey
Arena, the game you had a couple of years ago, just kind of relive that a
little bit and what comes to mind when you think about that?  
TAVELYN JAMES: The first thing that comes to mind is I had the flu that day. I
can remember running to the sideline as we were playing getting medicine from
our trainers to continue playing.  
But I feel like my first game here was good. And usually when I have good
games at certain arenas, I always have good games if we go back.  
So I feel like I should be able to play my game and feel like I'm at home.  
  
Q. Why Eastern Michigan for you, what about that school was a good
destination for you?  
TAVELYN JAMES: It really was Coach Gilbert's go get'em attitude. Because I
remember I was coming back from a trip to Chicago, and there was like so: Are
you coming to Eastern or not?  
And I was like: Yeah. So I came‑‑ my family lives in Detroit, so that helped
me a lot. And plus my niece had just been born. So I didn't have to leave. It
ended up working very well for me.  
  
Q. Coach, was it that easy?  
COACH GILBERT: We had to put in a little work for Tavelyn. She wasn't‑‑ the
thing I appreciate about Tavelyn is people don't know how underrecruited she
was. There were other teams in our conference that skipped on Tavelyn. There
were some Big East teams and bigger teams that looked at her, thought she was
too small.  
And the moment I saw her I wanted her at Eastern, and as I found her, other
people started to get interested. And I knew I had to try to expedite the
process.  
But I can't say enough about both of these young ladies, because they were so
raw coming in. People don't realize, Tavelyn James didn't start for us as a
freshman until the conference season. She had to learn how to be a part of
something bigger than herself. She had to learn that the world revolved around
more than Tavelyn James.  
And what you see and hear up here is an unselfish well‑rounded mature young
lady very different than what I inherited. But we've been able to build a lot
of what we do around here, and the unselfishness of Paige Redditt, a kid that
came in able to get 15, 16 rebounds in a game with very little scoring, now
has the confidence to hit the game winner.  
And one thing I said about being in Cleveland, Paige Redditt came over with
35seconds left in that game. We were down a point. And Paige said: Coach, it
doesn't matter what the score reflects. We got this.  
I'm thinking there's 35seconds left, do you know something I don't know,
because I have no more tricks. She had the savvy and poise and confidence.
She's a center that hits all her free throws down the stretch with just so
much poise, and I'm so blessed and thankful to coach both of them.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, at what point in your career did you move past Tavelyn and move
into that next mature phase of your life?  
COACH GILBERT: I would say my junior year I did, because I believed I already
knew my freshman year I didn't. And my sophomore year was the year that she
was getting me to change.  
And then my junior year I think I realized it a lot more when we had six
seniors that I knew were leaving. So I knew that everything would be put on me
and Paige. So as that time started to come around, I realized that I was the
leader and people would follow, and I started to lead.  
  
Q. What's it meant to win the Frances Pomeroy Award and have that
distinction?  
TAVELYN JAMES: Everything is a surprise to me. I didn't know anything about
it. And she called me and she said: You know you're a recipient for the
Francis Pomeroy Naismith Award. And I said what is that?  
Even though I know James Mason, because I took Basketball 101. But when she
called me and I was like, you know‑‑ and I remember I was in the office
because I was trying to do some stuff for class and stuff like that. And I
left.  
As soon as I walked into my house, Kalli called me and said come back. I said
why. Just come back. Coach needs you.  
I guess she hadn't told the coaches and everyone was looking at me. And I said
what did I do. The whole time I was thinking‑‑ she was like come to my office.
So I couldn't think about nothing. Else but what did I do, I didn't know what
I did wrong.  
So we sat down, and it was a heart‑to‑heart moment, because I know that the
reason I made it this far is because of her. So I know‑‑ I remember she told
me when I was a freshman that I would be on the U.S.A. Basketball Team. Same
question, what is that. I didn't know what that was.  
So it just shows me that all the hard work and the change that I've made to
myself have paid off from the help of Coach Gilbert.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, No. 2 scorer in the country, and you and Paige will go up
against the No. 4 defense in the country, talk about the challenge and how
exciting it is to play against a team like South Carolina?  
TAVELYN JAMES: It's exciting, because all teams have their strategies to stop
us, to stop me, to stop Paige. And sometimes it is tough. Some teams have made
it tough. But I feel like because a lot of teams have played us with tough
defense, we're more accustomed to it.  
So you plan up on us, I feel like it helps us.  
PAIGE REDDITT: I feel the same way. And they are a good defensive team. But I
think our defense is pretty underrated, too. They have to play against our
defense just like we have to play against theirs.  
  
Q. Coach, your players obviously are happy to be here, and they want to
enjoy the moment. How do you get them past happy to be here and now a chance
to compete in this tournament and maybe advance?  
COACH GILBERT: Well, as you heard from these two young ladies, I'm pretty
direct. But I feel like I have a good just a sense of balance about what this
means.  
As coaches, my entire coaching staff has been here. And the way we walk, the
way we talk and execute and carry things out, we're preparing them for this
day since day one. Tavelyn James I thought as a small player would be one of
the most exciting guards to play DivisionI basketball as she learned the game
and grew. She's been a sponge.  
And as a result she's played for U.S.A. Basketball. She's the Francis Pomeroy
Naismith Award winner, and she's not by accident in the NCAA Tournament.  
But I do believe that we're going to have to get through the first few minutes
because this tournament is very different than the MAC Tournament. In the MAC
knows you; you've played them two or three times. This is an opportunity for
us to play a team that doesn't know us.  
I think that plays to our strength. We have watched and played against‑‑ we
played against the players Dawn Staley left at Temple. We beat Temple at
Eastern Michigan. So we know her style. We know the kind of player she likes
to recruit.  
And as they mentioned, we're a defensive rebounding‑oriented team. Anytime you
do that, no matter what stage you play on, I thin you have a chance to be
successful. And we're excited. And I don't think they'll be overly nervous. I
think they'll be ready to come out and make a statement, play our best
basketball and leave it on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, you played UNC Wilmington in the WNIT against Cynthia Cooper,
former U.S. Olympian, you beat her 1 ‑0\. Now you're playing against Dawn
Staley. Talk about the excitement of doing that.   
COACH GILBERT: The great thing for us is ignorance is bliss to young people
who aren't old enough to know any of us who were.  
They don't know who Cynthia Cooper was. It was only after the game when I
shared her history‑‑ I didn't overplay her before the game. But they all got
her autograph and picture after the game. I think they'll be doing that with
Dawn. And I hope the outcome is the same.  
But we're excited because Cynthia Cooper, Dawn Staley, they're good coaches.
And I think I'm a good young, emerging coach. Young is relative, depends on
what the cut‑off is.  
However, I'm just thrilled because our players don't know the magnitude of who
Cynthia Cooper was. She's one of the best ever, ever to wear a women's
basketball uniform. Dawn Staley is not too far behind.  
Because they don't know that, they believe they're supposed to be here.
They've earned the right to be here. And those coaches and Cynthia Cooper
realize she had a lead at half and we won in a hostile environment. Several
thousand fans.  
But we went down there and stole a game that we weren't picked to win. We're
not picked to win this game. But I'm not a betting person, but I like our
chances. And hopefully we'll make it as exciting as you hear the confidence of
us sitting before you today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

THE MODERATOR: Joining us now are student‑athletes Odyssey Sims, Brittney
Griner and Destiny Williams and Head Coach Kim Mulkey.  
We'll start right off with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, this is what you guys have been pushing for, striving for all
season long. Now that you've accomplished it, what's the feeling?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Feeling's great. Only thing would have made it better was if
my mom was here. But I know she's home with my little nephew watching.  
  
Q. Odyssey, there was a play when you were up 3 where you got knocked down
flat, you're mid ‑court and you got up and nailed a 3‑pointer. How big a deal
was that, do you think, for the team and what motivated you‑‑ did that
motivate you, that foul?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I've been getting hit by trains all year. And when I get hit, I
just pop back up. I didn't know I was going to hit a 3. But I tried to get
back into the play as quick as possible and not give up on my team.  
  
Q. Brittney, there was a moment ‑‑ I think about nine minutes left‑‑ where
you put in a hook shot. And then it kind of sparked‑‑ I think it was a 15‑to‑2
run, but you pumped your fist and you get the whistle. You looked pretty
emphatic. Could you talk about what you were feeling at that moment?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: When I hit that little hook, it just got me energized. I was
kind of shocked it went in, but it definitely got me going.  
Then I got that and‑one‑on‑one and I just kind of lost it for a minute and
just celebrating.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about getting ‑‑ people said you had to get a
championship to validate your career as one of the greatest players ever. You
got it and you fulfilled your pledge to win a title.   
BRITTNEY GRINER: National championship, I wanted it because this is what we've
been‑‑ this is what our team wanted, and this is what we promised Coach when
we got here. It had nothing to validate what type of player I am.  
That was the last thing in the back of my mind. It's the team and just getting
the national championship for Coach and for Baylor.  
  
Q. Odyssey, Brittney talks about getting the championship for Coach. You
guys go 40 ‑0 this year. You dominated pretty much the entire season. What can
you say about the job that Coach did with you guys this season, the degree to
which she motivated you and kept you guys focused?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: She did a great job. She did a great job all year keeping us
motivated, big game. She would talk trash to us to keep us motivated, make us
play harder.  
This entire year she's been great. She's one of the best coaches I've ever
had. And toward the end of the season just going through what she's going
through now, she did an even better job. Made her coach harder than what she
did and made us play harder and made us want it more.  
To win this national championship, we're probably more happier for her than we
are for ourselves right now.  
  
Q. Brittney, could you take us into your mind when the clock finally hit all
the 0s? What was the first thing that you were thinking about? What were you
thinking about?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I was just hugging my teammates. I had tears in my eyes. We
finally did it. Unfinished business was over. And I was just ready to be with
my team and hug them all.  
  
Q. Brittney, Coach McGraw was just now talking about you, she said you're
one of a kind. She said you're like a guy playing with women. Do you take that
as a compliment or how do you take that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely, I take it as a compliment. Take it as a
compliment.  
  
Q. The pump fist notwithstanding, it appeared most of the game you were very
calm, cool, collected on the outside at least. Are you that way inside as
well?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm fired up on the inside. I tried to stay cool and mellow
and never really let the defender see if I'm rattled or just try to stay calm.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you talk about just how important it was to win the
rebounding battle and maybe even getting Devereaux in foul trouble?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I thought we did a great job getting her in foul trouble
because she helped Notre Dame out with rebounds and blocking shots. We had to
rebound. We couldn't allow them to get second‑chance points. If so, it would
have kept them in the game, and we had to limit them to one shot. A couple
times they did and they'd score off it. And it's something that we had to do
in order to win.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys played Notre Dame earlier in the year, played Tennessee
twice, Stanford, St. John's, all these teams. How much did that experience of
playing tough teams and sort of taking their best shot maybe come into play
again tonight?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: It helps us out tremendously. There are times when we are
down and we have to learn how to build back up and take the lead over again
and finish out strong. I thought that a lot of those games prepared us for
this playoff time when‑‑ a couple games that we were down, and we didn't get
frustrated and not thinking correctly.  
We've been in situations like that before that allow us to come out smart and
take better shots and do a better job and finish strong.  
  
Q. Brittney, Notre Dame was pretty happy with their defense on you in the
first half. They said it was pretty effective. What did you do and your
teammates do to get you the ball to get you more success in the second half?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We just really kept working. We started posting up harder and
stronger and calling for the ball. And Coach made a couple of adjustments on
the offense and just got the ball, was able to get the ball in.  
  
Q. Destiny, could you just talk about the defense tonight and just how
important it's been to y'all all year?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Our defense led us throughout the whole year. We frustrated
our opponents, made every shot that they took‑‑ made it a hard one, and we had
to play team ball. I thought we really as a team just denied the ball, getting
blocks and just rotated correctly. And that helped us out a lot.  
Our offense, they didn't flow the last game, and our defense picked it up and
helped us get the win. And I think our defense is one of a kind.  
  
Q. Brittney, I know it's a little early right now, but what do you guys do
for an encore next year? Went undefeated this year, won your title. What do
you do for an encore next year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Right now we're just going to celebrate this, and when the
season comes next year, we'll start thinking about that. Right now it's just
celebrating.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your relationship with Coach Mulkey. Up there she said
you played hard for her because you know she has your back. Could you
elaborate on that a little bit?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Like she said, we know Coach fights for us on and off the
court. She's there for us.  
And just the long relationship between me and her and just‑‑ I know she's
there and I got her back and she's got mine.  
  
Q. Destiny, could you talk a little bit about just what the championship
means for you and what it will mean for you going back home, the fact that it
was over Notre Dame?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Dedication that we put in. We put in a lot throughout the
summer and for these games we played, it prepared us for this championship
game. And we're excited to finally‑‑ all the workouts, to finally get that
championship. And we're just ready to celebrate it and enjoy it with our
families and with our teammates and just ready to go home.  
  
Q. Destiny, Brittney is real humble when she speaks about herself. Can you
put into words how much she means to not just your team but the whole school,
and especially with all the pressure that she has to go through?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: A lot of people look up to her. They respect her. And off
the court the kid is‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: She calls her a kid.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Like she's 30 or something. You're my age. I told myself‑‑ it
slipped.  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: They enjoy being around her. She's funny. She's well‑liked
off the court. She's like a regular student. She's not one of those who "I
don't want to be messed with" or anything like that.  
So on the court, she's just Brittney. She's here to play ball and she can care
less about other things. And it's something that you need in players like
that, because they will always help you out with a win.  
  
Q. Destiny, I think you said you dreamed of this. Is the reality better than
the dream?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: What? Are you serious? You're really going to ask me that?
Oh, of course it is. The trophy is kind of heavy. It's heavier than my dream,
but I like it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, I know you do not like to compare teams. But because of the
historical nature of this, a lot of people are going to be looking at this 40
‑0 with your history of the game. How do you want this team remembered?   
COACH MULKEY: I thought the'05 team, we just came in the back door. We didn't
have expectations placed on us. I think we were a 3 seed that year and we beat
three No.1 seeds to win the national championship. So we were the underdog.  
The difference in that team and this team is that we didn't come in the back
door. From day one the expectations were placed on us, we embraced it, and we
lived up to it.  
Sports is an interesting profession. You can embrace being thought about as
being a dominant team, or you can shy away from it. Most of the time I'll try
to protect them from you guys and from the public.  
But we couldn't do that this year. You can't hide the talent in that locker
room that I get to coach. So we embraced it. And that's a little bold on my
part and it's a little uncomfortable for me because that's not my personality.  
But I think they sense Coach is always brutally honest with us. I couldn't
walk in the locker room and hoodwink them and tell them we don't have those
expectations; you're not that good, you're one of many, because, truthfully,
we're pretty special.  
And that's the difference in the two teams.  
  
Q. Is any part of this ‑‑ do you feel any relief tonight at all?  
COACH MULKEY: My relief is for those players. I want to make sure you
understand when I say this: I've done this since I was 18years old. I've
played for national championships. Won Olympic gold medals. I know what it
feels like.  
My joy now with coaching is I want my players to feel what I have been blessed
to feel for years. The joy for me is to watch all those Baylor people out
there on the big stage and feel good and feel important, and that makes me
happy.  
My joy is to watch a Brittney Griner and an Odyssey Sims and a Jordan Madden,
who never even won a state championship, win a national championship.  
It's not about me. I've been around some of the best in the business. But my
joy in coaching is for the people who have never had the opportunity to
experience what I have.  
  
Q. Kim, how satisfying is it when the game's most talked about player has a
game where she lives up to all the billing?  
COACH MULKEY: If Brittney didn't score a point, she would have lived up to the
billing, because she's so dominant on the defensive end of the floor.  
You just held‑‑ correct me if I'm wrong, is Notre Dame not the highest scoring
team in the country, points scored? Second? They're up there. You just held
them to 61points.  
Brittney Griner's presence on the defensive end of the floor, you have to make
adjustments. Shots that they were making they were having to release it
quicker before she could get over there. They got a lot of layups because they
brought Brittney away from the basket.  
I'll go back to the original question to Brittney. It's sad in athletics when
people feel you have to validate your talent by winning a championship. But,
you know what, that's society and that's the world we live in.  
Brittney Griner, whether she won today or not, will go down in the history of
the women's game if not the greatest post player, one of the greatest.  
I'm so glad that she has that ring now.  
  
Q. With about a minute to go, you brought everyone out and put the subs in,
and you had these big hugs at your bench with Brittney and some of the other
players. You're so good at describing things, could you tell us at that moment
what you were thinking and saying and how great that must have felt?  
COACH MULKEY: Just hugged them and told them I'm so happy for you guys. I'm so
happy for you. Thank you for letting me coach you. Thank you for letting me
challenge you. And I think I said it to all of them, not just Brittney and
Jordan, but just every one of them.  
There were many tears on that bench, but they're tears of joy. And I think
that's what I said. Bell's palsy kicks in, I don't know if there was more than
that, there could have been.  
  
Q. What is the significance you attach to being the only team to go 40 ‑0?  
COACH MULKEY: No significance, honestly, right now, today, because the only
words that are coming out of our mouth are national champions. 40‑0 will mean
something to me and to all of them when they're through with their collegiate
year and we'll think back on what we accomplished, who we played to go 40‑0\.
That may be the story, is who you played to be 40‑0\. You didn't play a bunch
of patsies.  
But that was never a goal of ours. It had to be when the NCAA brackets were
announced. But it was never a goal of ours.  
  
Q. You had a 14 ‑point lead in that first half, got down to 6, what was the
message at halftime and did you make any adjustments to get the ball more
inside to Brittney?  
COACH MULKEY: We made adjustments, but, again, I didn't think the whole night
we took a bad shot. Maybe when the shot clock was winding down we forced up on
some things.  
But I thought a key to their run to cut it to 6 was they put their kids back
in that had the two fouls, and I just thought just keep your composure. We've
been here before. We've done this before. You've been in the locker room
behind. You've been in the locker room with big leads, small leads, you've
been in the locker room when you've had great momentum. You've been in the
locker room when you lost momentum.  
I didn't sense anything in that locker room except that we were still in
control of the game.  
We made some adjustments on ball reversal, screening the zone. I just felt
that we were very composed. We took very few bad shots. I thought we took care
of the ball. You want to have an assist‑to‑turnover ratio 2 to 1; we almost
did that. You had 20 and 11.  
And I just felt Odyssey Sims's ability to know when to shoot, know when to run
and know who needs to touch the ball, give up the ball quicker to the I
formation 2‑3, I just felt she ran the show out there. I thought she was the
point guard I envisioned her to continue to be.  
  
Q. 40 and 0, all these players coming back, there's going to be high
expectations next year. How do you top perfection?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, see you're already starting. You're making me embrace it
now instead of letting me enjoy this. Yes, we have everybody back that plays a
majority of the minutes except for Terran Condrey. We think we have one of the
best recruiting classes in the country. One of our players was MVP of the
McDonald's All‑American game.  
We're going to embrace it. I don't think you guys are going to let me hide it.
You all keep trying as best you can to encourage Brittney to leave. That's not
happening either. Where is Jerry with the New York Times? His article, I loved
it, but that's not happening. She's not going anywhere. She'll be worth the
same millions next year as she's worth this year.  
We have to embrace it. If we lose two, three, four, five, and we go 30 and 10,
I don't care. I want to be in New Orleans. That's my home state. And I won't
have enough tickets for family, but I'll do something to get them in the
arena.  
But that's what we want, another national championship.  
I saw Calipari wants to go undefeated. Good luck to him.  
  
Q. I don't know if there's a turning point, but you were up 3 and Odyssey
takes a hard foul right in front of you, and she gets up and hits a 3 and it
just looked like that's when things started to roll. Did you sense that as a
big deal at the time?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I didn't sense it as a big deal. I'm so engaged in what are
they doing defensively, computing with my coaches, do I need to run this.  
At the moment you don't realize where the turning point may be. I just know
the kid, she harasses the ball so hard that she gets hit and popped all the
time because you have to relieve pressure by having somebody out there to
screen for it, to help the point guard.  
And she's aware of it. And she just bounces right back up.  
  
Q. Kim, great Baylor contingent here in attendance to celebrate it.
Obviously there was a big watch party at the Ferrell Center. What do you think
the party back in Waco is going to be like?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you know, at Baylor, they used to not let the Baptists
dance. I bet they're dancing now. It's fun. Look, it's been a great year for
Baylor. Robert Griffin being here. I don't know what other coaches from Baylor
were here.  
It's just a fun time. And I look forward to going back. I know they're
planning a celebration at the Ferrell Center when we arrive back tomorrow.
Let's enjoy. This is a memory. This is a memory and that's all we have in our
life. We have our family and we have memories.  
And this is for Baylor. This is for everything that you can do for a
university, is play at the highest level. And Baylor is doing that, not just
in women's basketball but in all sports.  
  
Q. I know that you've said that until you got to the Final Four and had to
win the 40 and out, that that wasn't a goal in itself. But last year when we
were preparing the schedule for this year and you put 40 games on the
schedule, was there any awareness at that point that was setting you up for a
possible place in history?  
COACH MULKEY: Not at all. I think our media relations person, Julie Bennett,
maybe somewhere in February, somewhere in there, just casually mentioned it.
Maybe coming home from a trip. She said: You know, if we win it all, we could
go 40 and 0 and undefeated.  
Nobody felt that. We didn't plan that. Didn't know anything about it really
until she brought it to our attention.  
  
Q. I think you've just made a lot of people in Los Angeles very unhappy. But
is that like take it to the bank, Brittney's not coming out next year ‑‑ this
year?  
COACH MULKEY: No, she's not going anywhere. I don't know what part of that
y'all don't understand. She's not going anywhere. She is not even going to be
able to go do a lot of things because she wants to graduate in four years. She
wants to get her degree. And Brittney Griner is not going anywhere. She said
it; I've said it. I don't know what else we can say. She's not going anywhere.  
This kid is‑‑ she's a jewel. She enjoys Baylor. Come see her. Watch her long
board across campus, paint her body at a football game. Watch her do
cartwheels and roll down the halls. She's a kid. She enjoys her college life.  
She knows she's going to make money some day. She's not in a hurry to go into
that crude, rude, crazy real world. She likes her little comfort there in
Waco, Texas.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Baylor  80  
Notre Dame  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us at the podium are Head Coach Muffet McGraw and
student‑athletes Skylar Diggins and Natalie Achonwa.  
We'll start with the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about, seemed like you had to come back and come
back and come back, and just what happened that second half that it got away
from you.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yeah, in the first half we had foul troubles and things like
that. We had to go deep into our bench early, and we had to make adjustments
and things like that.  
And they made a couple of baskets and got up 7, 9, and then we just kept
digging ourselves in the hole by not taking our shots. I don't think that we
were taking the shots that we had. And when we were, we weren't shooting it
confidently. And so that dug us in a hole a little bit. So we were chasing,
chasing. I think we spent a lot of energy chasing.  
And I think in the second half we‑‑ we hit some shots in the first half to
kind of cushion the blow. In the second half those shots just weren't falling.
And they were hitting a lot of theirs.  
  
Q. Skylar, is there any point in the game that you would say was the turning
point for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They went on the run there, and I just remember we had cut it
down to 5 or 3, and then they went on a run. And I saw 10, 12, 14, 16, 19.
They just went on a run. We couldn't get stops.  
We couldn't get rebounds when we did make them miss shots.  
  
Q. Natalie, seemed at times tonight you and your teammates were in perfect
defensive position, arms up, and you just couldn't stop Brittney. How
frustrating was that?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Very frustrating. I think Brittney Griner had a great game,
and she was hitting those shots.  
And I think personally I could have done a better job on executing our game
plan. I think I gave her the baseline a couple times.  
But as far as that, she had a great game. She was making her shots.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk a little bit about the legacy the four seniors
leave?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: This is a great senior class. And I know me watching their
whole careers, even on the sidelines, just amazing what they've been able to
do and bring this program back to an elite program, and being able to lead
this team to back‑to‑back national championship games is amazing.  
And I hate that it ends on a game like this, because you fail to see
everything they did to get to this point.  
But it's amazing and the best team I've been a part of ever. Never been a part
of anything like this. And we'll all keep in touch. They're like my sisters.
And it's amazing and we're going to miss them.  
But very proud of them, and I know the Irish fans are proud as well.  
  
Q. Natalie, of all the things that Brittney does well, what's the hardest to
stop?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: She keeps the ball high. She's 6'8". She keeps it up there. A
lot of posts bring it down, and that would give us the advantage, but she
keeps the ball up and she fights for position.  
  
Q. Are you convinced that Baylor is the best team this year in the
country?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Obviously.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They're a great team. They're a hardworking team. They've got
players that can‑‑ multiple players that can score 20. Every player knows
their role and they play it to a T. And they showed they're the best team in
the country.  
  
Q. Skylar, now that you are a senior leader, can you talk about how this
game fuels hunger and what you take from it going into the offseason building
for next year?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Gotta do a better job being a leader. I thought I didn't have
good leadership out there tonight as far as keeping our fire. But I'll do
better. I promise.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What was your game plan against Brittney and how did you adjust during
the game?  
COACH McGRAW: Our plan was to double. We were going to play mostly zone and
bring the double team. And I thought it was fairly effective in the first
half. I thought the zone looked pretty good. And the second half, when we got
into the foul trouble that destroyed our game plan, we really needed
Devereaux. She was a big part of the plan. And we didn't have her.  
We came in with Markisha Wright, who I thought played well as a freshman. But
in the second half we were afraid to foul. Every time Brittney got the ball,
even when we brought the double team, we didn't really lean on her. And I
thought she got really close to the basket almost all of her shots, and she
shot it over us.  
There really wasn't anything we could do. We brought the double team. And she
just‑‑ she made great shots. She's a great player. She was unstoppable, I
thought, for the size and the players that we had in. It would have been great
to see Devereaux play for 39minutes.  
But I'm not sure it would have changed a lot. She just‑‑ she's so big. She's
hard to stop.  
  
Q. Muffet, have you ever seen anyone who has ever been able to impact the
game at least down low as Brittney did and obviously as she did tonight?  
COACH McGRAW: No. I think she's one of a kind. I think she's like a guy
playing with women. It's just there's so many things that she can do that I've
not seen a lot of women‑‑ well, really, you know, there's been some guards
that had some skill like that. But as a post player she's the best I've ever
seen.  
  
Q. Even though you had foul trouble and some other things going wrong, you
cut it to 6 at halftime and cut it to 3 and had the ball. Could you talk about
the way your team was able to fight back?  
COACH McGRAW: I was proud of that. And I think Markisha was in there for some.
I think when we brought Dev back in‑‑ it was really disappointing that she got
the third foul in the first half. That really was disappointing. Because she
was why we made that run, having her back in.  
And Skylar getting two fouls, that didn't affect it quite as much because she
was able to stay out of foul trouble the rest of the game. And the second half
Dev got a fairly quick one.  
And we just weren't big enough. We just needed a little more size, and we
just, we missed so many shots that they‑‑ their defense is really good, but we
missed a lot of just a lot of open shots, too.  
  
Q. When Dev got in foul trouble, Markisha Wright and Natalie Achonwa played
a lot of solid minutes. Could you talk about their play a little bit more and
what that means for the future of your program?  
COACH McGRAW: Ace is really talented, and I think she's got a great future. I
think the way she played against Maryland I thought was a great start for her
to move into next year.  
And Markisha Wright, I like her. I wish I would have played her more
throughout the year. Because she's strong and she's a really good low block
player, which we don't really have. So I think the two of them will be really
good next year.  
  
Q. Obviously a championship game loss is going to be rough no matter what.
But I wonder if you're more emotional tonight because of this senior class
that you've grown so fond of?  
COACH McGRAW: I was hoping nobody would ask that question. The waterworks will
begin now.  
It's such a tough way for their career to end.  
  
Q. In a situation like this, one wonders, if you had anything to change
about your game plan or the execution, if you could have a do ‑over on it,
what would you change and why?   
COACH McGRAW: I would‑‑ I'd have Dev play more. I think that was‑‑ that's
really‑‑ we didn't have any control over that.  
I thought our game plan was sound. We didn't‑‑ we didn't score. I think we got
really frustrated with our inability to score, and they were scoring so
easily, 40points in the paint. And we were struggling to make a basket.  
  
Q. Did you think Skylar was a little tough on herself tonight? And then what
do you see from her in terms of being your senior leader for next year?  
COACH McGRAW: I mean, she played a great game. She didn't have any turnovers.
We only had seven turnovers as a team. We did do a few things well.  
She's just such a big‑time player and she just didn't get a lot of help today.
But she did everything I thought she could possibly do.  
  
Q. I'm wondering how you help players who have had such a great year all
year but there's such a hunger for this national championship, especially
after last year. How do you help them process this in a way that they can
actually learn from the loss and still not be overwhelmed by it and be able to
come back and move on next year?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it will be toughest for the seniors not having that
opportunity to come back. They're the ones that carried it so hard last time
also.  
We've got a lot of new faces now with Kayla and Skylar and Ace, really kind of
the three main players returning. So I think for them it will be good
motivation.  
And for the freshmen, we've got to improve a lot to get ready for next year,
and I think them seeing what it's like even from the bench I think will help
them.  
But I think we'll be able to process that. I think it will take some time, but
eventually we'll remember what a great season this was.  
  
Q. Is the feeling in the locker room any different than last year? Is there
more of a feeling that Baylor really just kind of outplayed you the whole game
or maybe more so than Texas A &M?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it hurts no matter how much you lose by. But I think the
feeling last year was a little different, I think more of we kind of let it
slip away a little bit, but this game got out of hand. So I think there was
some frustration that everybody didn't play as well as they wanted to. But
it's still pretty much the same. Everybody's pretty emotional.  
  
Q. Baylor has everybody back next year. What is the future of this program
going to be like? Can anybody stop them next year?  
COACH McGRAW: I think‑‑ no, I think they'll be preseason No.1. And we're still
going to work at getting Brittney to leave early.  
  
Q. You talked about double teaming out of the zone. To my observation, it
looked more like the primary defender was frumping Brittney and the help was
coming over from the other side. Was that part of the game plan, or is that
when she got moving on you?  
COACH McGRAW: We did three different things. The most‑‑ most of the time we
played behind and brought the help. We also fronted for a spell. That was
fairly successful, actually.  
And then we played a box and one on Sims for a while. Tried to put the box on
Brittney. So we were trying to play behind her then also.  
  
Q. At this Final Four, one thing that was successful against Baylor was the
backdoors, sort of the UC Davis patent backdoor. Did you pick up on what
Stanford was doing, and next season do you think there's something that could
be expanded on that?  
COACH McGRAW: We run the Princeton offense which involves a lot of backdoors,
and I think when we started the game you saw at the beginning of the game we
were game planned to a T: Use the screen, engage Griner, and hit the roll.  
And I think Dev got two quick baskets before she got her two quick fouls.
That's what we were trying to do really most of the game, was to engage her in
the ball screen and get the roll.  
And then we had some backdoor opportunities that‑‑ I think they learned
something, too. I think they got off a little bit. We got a couple. But I
think they started playing a little softer.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Baylor we have student‑athletes Odyssey
Sims, Kimetria Hayden, Jordan Madden, Destiny Williams and Brittney Griner and
head coach Kim Mulkey.  
We will take questions for anyone on the dais.  
  
Q. Coach, I wondered what stands out in your mind most about the game with
Notre Dame early in the season, and then how different is your team now than
it was then.  
COACH MULKEY: I can't remember a whole lot other than what Sims brings back to
my memory. I remember an outstanding basketball team. I remember senior
basketball team. I remember a talented basketball team.  
Specifics of the game? We had too many games between then and now, and as we
watched film, we just to break down again the scouting report that we had on
them then and how they've changed. I would just say they're a different team,
we're a different team, but the system is not different.  
I remember they pressed as they did last night against Connecticut some. I
remember that their depth is about like our depth. They play about the same
number of people. And great back court.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you've played with Skylar Diggins on the U.S.A. team. Played
against her. What makes her such a tough player, and do you welcome that kind
of challenge of going up against a player like that?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: She's great all around, she has great vision she can take it off
the dribble and pull up 2, and that's what makes her so great. And she makes
everyone around her better.  
And we play U.S.A. team ball together. Played on one team. She's a great
teammate‑‑ was a great teammate, and I look for a challenge on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Kim, you've talked about Brittney a lot I know and I'm sure it's a joy
and pleasure to discuss all the things she does. I'm curious about if you can
put in perspective with all that you know about women's basketball her place
in this game? I know it's been talked about as the first female ‑‑ female Wilt
Chamberlain or Bill Russell or Kareem‑‑ Lew Alcindor. How would you place her
in the history and the importance of the women's game? Thanks.   
COACH MULKEY: I've challenged her as her coach to motivate her into‑‑ I'm
going to answer your question to lead in with this response first. I've
challenged both Brittney and Odyssey to win a national championship. At the
same time I don't think they need it to validate being the greatest in the
game.  
With or without a game it starts what she does on the defensive end of the
floor. I've said it many times: There have been players before her that dunk,
there have been players before her that block shots, but there's never been a
player before her that intimidates you on the defensive end of the floor.  
She has a presence in the paint on the defensive end of the floor like none
other. I've played with 6'9". I've watched 6'9" dunk the ball. I've dunked the
ball. I've been on an Olympic team. I've played in a National. I've been
against the Ulyana Semenovas. Brittney Griner's presence on the defensive end
of the floor separates her from any player that has ever played the game.  
She doesn't need a national championship to validate her place in this sport.
Would it be nice? Absolutely. Does it motivate her? Absolutely.  
  
Q. Kim, I noticed you're shielding your eyes a little bit.  
COACH MULKEY: Turn those lights off.  
  
Q. How are you feeling right now? And is the complications from the Bell's
palsy more than you expected, or what's your situation right now?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know what I expected other than facial paralysis. The
eyes and the ears irritate and frustrate me, but I'm not in any pain. It's
just I see you over there, but it's the bright light that kind of irritates
you. The voice, when I raise my voice or you talk real loud, my ear feels like
a blown speaker.  
But pain, I'm not in any pain. I don't care what I look like. I'd love to wear
this tomorrow night with no makeup on and then go win a championship. But I
feel frustrated because I want to say things as quickly as I normally say them
without spitting and all that stuff.  
But it's more frustration. But as Odyssey told me, Coach, we hear you loud and
clear. And that's what I don't realize because I can only hear my ears
ringing. It feels like they can't hear my message. And they told me: We hear
ya, we hear ya.  
It's the frustration of my eyes. They're red and irritable. But I see the
scoreboard.  
  
Q. Brittney, all year you've been trying to get to this point, and now
you're here one day before, what are your thoughts tomorrow night the
excitement, the last game to win a national championship and go undefeated all
the stuff that comes along with it?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Excited, definitely excited. This is the game we've been
waiting for all year. And we're finally here and just got one more game. Gotta
lay it all on the line. So afterwards we can celebrate.  
  
Q. Jordan, you had some open shots early in that game yesterday. Was there
any sense of frustration on your part? And, if so, how did you overcome that
as the game progressed?  
JORDAN MADDEN: Yeah, it was a lot of frustration because I see a lot and I
just gotta go in and practice and knock down shots. And like I shot a little
bit and I missed. And I stopped shooting and I just started driving
(indiscernible) and find somebody open and throw it to them.  
  
Q. Brittney and Odyssey, can you talk about if it's an advantage to ‑‑ it
probably is an advantage to have already played Notre Dame. What do you guys
remember about that first game, and, of course, they've already played you.
Does one team have an advantage here? You're coming off a game where you
hadn't played your opponent last night before, and I don't know how different
is it when you've already had a good look at them in just a couple of months
ago.   
BRITTNEY GRINER: I wouldn't say it's an advantage. We played them and they
know us and we know them. Just gotta go back, look at the game, look at where
we messed up and just correct it.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Like she said, it's really no advantage. They play four guards
and they have one post inside. So we're going to have to do a better job of
defending and have good help side.  
As far as us, we're just going to play better basketball and try to come out
with a win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Destiny, they don't have the size that Stanford did. What do you see from
their inside game, particularly Devereaux Peters?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: We have a size advantage like Stanford had on us, and we can
try and kill them on the boards. That's one thing. Allow our post players to
get touches early to get our game rolling. But they have a small guard. So
they'll be able to push the ball in transition and try and get some layups or
some quick shots in transition.  
So there's just two different styles right there that's going to separate the
game.  
  
Q. How often do you guys think about the last time you lost the game against
Texas A &M and have any of you watched that game this year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't remember it. I remember that ride back to Waco. I
remember how I felt after that loss. I feel we all remember it. That was our
motivation this year, that loss, to get us back here and to get us through.  
  
Q. Kim, how does Odyssey match up against Skylar offensively and
defensively?  
COACH MULKEY: I think very well. They played together with U.S.A. Basketball
this summer. Odyssey was the youngest on the team. She had an opportunity to
make the younger team and they didn't want her on that team. They moved her up
to play with Skylar Diggins and that age group.  
So that probably tells you what they think of Odyssey Sims. I think you'll see
two of the finest point guards in the country. And I anticipate that it won't
be any different than when Odyssey guarded her and played against her at our
place.  
I thought Odyssey was outstanding in that game. I thought she held her own,
and I'm sure glad she's on my team.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you take that question as well? Because you played with
Skylar on a U.S.A. team and you played with Odyssey. Can you describe how
they're alike and how they're different as point guards?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Playing with Skylar, she had more experience over Odyssey. I
know she played U.S.A. ball longer than Odyssey did. Skylar had people to help
her become a better player and playing with Odyssey she's growing and maturing
into a fine basketball player. I think Odyssey's defense is amazing, and when
she picks it up I think the whole team picks it up.  
Their IQs are about the same. Just two point guards that are great players
going at it. I enjoy playing with both of them. But I'd rather have Odyssey,
too.  
  
Q. Brittney, growing up so tall, I'm curious if you could tell us a story or
two of how tough that was or when you realized that sports would be a home for
you, that you might not get teased or whatever in sports the way maybe some
kids might when you were a kid. And if I could ask also along with that: Size
17 shoes, how hard is it to find shoes?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, growing up, I was always active. Sports really didn't
come in until later on. But I love being tall. There really wasn't any
teasing. I guess they were smart enough not to tease the big kid (laughter).
But I loved it. I like being different. I like being tall. The only thing that
sucks: Can't get that little sports car (laughter).  
And the size 17 shoe, just go online, really. Can't really go in the store:
Hey, I need a 17. But I can go online. More options, more colors, different
styles. It's not bad.  
  
Q. Odyssey, is it easier for a left ‑handed guard to go against another
left‑hander, as far as Skylar, or is it a little more challenging because you
don't go against that many left‑handers?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I wouldn't say it's easier. I guess it's the same because I
pressure the ball the same whether you're right‑handed or left‑handed. So
there's really no difference.  
I just go out there and try to do what I can and try to create turnovers, and
that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, how would you say your personality is similar to Coach Mulkey
and how would you say it's different?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Similar on the court. Different off the court. Because she
played point guard position, so she kind of knows when I get frustrated, she
knows me very well. I feed off of what she does and she kind of feeds off what
I do on the court.  
I try to call the plays as much as possible, try to be the floor general on
the court and lead my team so she doesn't have to talk as much.  
Off the court, I'm a lot different. I talk a lot. I'm goofy. I just love being
with my teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first game, 175 points scored, your most offensive game of
the year, the most points you gave up all year. Was there a reason for that
and do you expect a similar game tomorrow night?  
COACH MULKEY: I'd say neither team played very good defense, did we? I don't
know that I anticipate it to be a high‑scoring game. I think you'll see two
teams that will buckle down and guard each other. If it is high scoring, I
just hope we're the one that has the most points.  
But that was a lot of points being scored. Early in the year, I'm not sure we
were committed defensively to some things in that game as we are today. And
that's understandable.  
I mean, when you're in November and December, we're still in football season
in Texas. We're probably thinking about where the next football game is on
Friday and Saturday night.  
But we're better, they're better. And if there are that many points scored, it
will be entertaining, I guess you'd say, for the fans. I don't know about the
coaches.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, is it my understanding that Trace Adkins will be here tomorrow
night? And, also, any other special guests that will be here?  
COACH MULKEY: It's my understanding that Trace will be here. It's my
understanding Art Briles, our Football Coach of the Year, will be here. Scott
Drew, our men's basketball coach will be here. And Judge Starr is here with
his wife, Alice. And I don't know who else. Probably 19,000 more, I hope.  
My family, which is most important. My son Kramer, missing his baseball game
tomorrow, will be here. He was here last night. And my mother. Not that any of
you care, but those are more important to me than anybody else. So my
immediate family is here and lots of people from Louisiana Tech, where I came
from, those people near and dear to me. There's probably 25 of them here.  
  
Q. Kim, I just wanted to clarify something. When you felt something strange
on your tongue prior to the diagnosis, what was that feeling? And what was
that?  
COACH MULKEY: We were in Des Moines, and I forgot my toothpaste. So in my
night bag I had a little box of Colgate. Props to Colgate. Probably been in my
bag five years. I open the box, brush my teeth. And I go down to breakfast. I
thought it was a change in toothpaste. My tongue felt weird. I don't know what
weird meant. Just weird.  
I asked the trainer can you be allergic to toothpaste, can it become outdated.
He looked at me like: She's stressed again.  
And I guess we won, got back home, Tuesday. I was doing the NCAA
teleconference at my desk eating a sandwich. As I was eating, it felt like it
does when you leave the dentist office and you're numb. But I couldn't see
myself. So after the teleconference I brushed my teeth, headed out to
practice. When I was walking out the door of my bathroom, I looked in the
mirror and I thought, Gol, and I looked again and my smile was crooked and my
eyebrows were weird.  
So I wouldn't normally think anything of it. But you pretty much can diagnose
yourself if you know your body well. I diagnosed the kidney stones when those
happened three years ago.  
I went to our trainer and I thought, you know, look at this. And I said: What
do you think? He said: I think you need to leave now. You need to go rule out
a stroke, tumor, and we think it's probably something like Bell's palsy.  
And that's what I did. And fortunate to live in a community that physicians
got me in and out quickly.  
I went in and told the team first when I wasn't going to be at practice.
Because our practices are open, and I didn't want people coming in there
wondering where I was.  
So I told the team, and then told them what I thought it was, and came back
and the next day. And that's the extent of it.  
  
Q. You mentioned LA Tech. So the question is this: Your'82 LA Tech national
champions versus your 2012 Baylor Bears, you lose by 5, 30?  
COACH MULKEY: We kick their butt. I'm on that team. I'll take Odyssey Sims on
any day.  
No. Listen, I don't compare teams. I don't compare generations. I know this:
Back in the early'80s we were the dominant women's basketball team. And our
First and Second team could have been ranked in the top five. And you don't
compare teams. You don't compare generations. Because things change. I know
this: That there was‑‑ the Cheryl Miller was the face of women's basketball
during the'80s, just as Brittney Griner is.  
But Cheryl Miller did not have the defensive presence that Brittney Griner
does. Cheryl Miller was great and one of the great ones of all time. Cheryl
Miller has a ring, too, and Brittney doesn't. So you can compare and say all
those things, but, look, I wouldn't want to bring the ball up against Odyssey
Sims. She just is a gnat out there. She worries you to death.  
  
Q. And the game?  
COACH MULKEY: I'm extremely proud in a lot of sense. I think the exposure and
television coverage is great. With that comes things I don't like. I don't
like to be interviewed during the game. But we're required to do that. I don't
like having the cameras in the locker room. That's a sacred place. And I
struggle with that.  
But I understand to grow the game and make the game better that's what we do.
That's the generation we live in. But, truthfully, I'm from the old school.
What is said in the locker room should stay in the locker room and don't put
coaches in a position during the game in the heat of the moment for them to
say something bad.  
Because I coach with passion. I don't like to pretend and set up a‑‑ you don't
see me in the locker room giving my pregame speech. To me that's sacred.
That's for show.  
But yet I understand the TV coverage is so much greater today than it was
then, and that is good. And I just wish we could balance it a little bit more.  
  
Q. I know you're obviously a historian of the game. You guys are one win
away from achieving the seventh perfect season and such. Just 24 hours before
what your sense is and where you think you guys are right now as far as a
place in history, and if you do win tomorrow night, where things go as far as
this team and the run you've had this season.  
COACH MULKEY: Win or lose tomorrow, we're going to head back to Waco and we're
going to have a disappointing feeling. Unfortunately, we're 39‑0 and you don't
want to lose that last game. But if we were 30 and 10 we wouldn't want to lose
the last game.  
We know this: That whoever beats us‑‑ and we've said this all year long,
whoever beats us just make sure that you didn't beat yourself. You make sure
that team was better than you that night. And if you do that, you can't fault
your effort. And Notre Dame was here last year. They played for the national
championship and lost. They have as bitter a taste in their mouth as we do
losing to A&M when we played them the fourth time in the Regional Finals.  
It's going to be players making plays. It's not going to be anything that
Muffet does or I do. It's going to be those guys on the floor making plays,
and whoever makes the most plays will win the basketball game.  
  
Q. From what areas would you like to see Brittney improve next year?  
COACH MULKEY: I always want Brittney to be a little bit more aggressive with
her being vocal. She's such just a tender little giant out there. She demands
the ball with just her presence. But sometimes it's okay to get on a teammate
in a constructive way. I don't know that I'll ever get her to do that, because
she just‑‑ that's not Brittney.  
But I would love to see her lead more vocally than she does. I think offensive
rebounding because she gets blocked out, so many people are in front of her,
man, if she could get in there and really crash the offensive boards more than
she does, I think that's an area of her game that really could be scary.  
Every other area of her game that she's been challenged by me or anybody
that's helping coach her, she's improved from free‑throw shooting her freshman
year to being more physical, to getting in the weight room, challenged her to
shoot 62percent from the field. She's done that through the course of the
year.  
I still think there's a lot of growth left to her game and not just one more
year in college. I think beyond college you'll continue to see her grow.  
  
Q. What about her becoming more sort of comfortable as a public speaker?
Maybe that's not your role, but is there anything you could do? Because
obviously you're comfortable doing that, too.  
COACH MULKEY: She's comfortable doing it, but what the problem is is every one
of you want her. She's worn out. They want her to be here at 3:00, 3:30, there
at 4:00, 4:30. She understands she's the face of women's basketball. And she
understands that's required of her. But at some point she has to step back and
go: That's not why I'm here; I'm here to win a national championship. That
stuff can happen afterwards.  
She is very comfortable publicly speaking. She doesn't elaborate. She doesn't
try to say too much to make you think she's a summa cum laude. She answers the
question and moves on to the next question. She's very comfortable in who she
is and in her own skin at being a tall kid. She runs around campus on her long
board and her body painted at football games, doing back flips on the sideline
before football games.  
She can do all that. Brittney, she stays until the last kid gets an autograph
at camp.  
I think what happens to us, and I have to protect her a little bit, you want
her everywhere and you want her to please everybody, because she's a
people‑pleaser, but at some point she's got to reluctantly say no. Because she
can't do it all. And she's tired. But it's part of it.  
She's comfortable. She's fine interviewing.  
  
Q. Either you or Coach McGraw are going to win her second national
championship as a coach, and that is ‑‑ especially in this era, the last 10,
15 years of UConn winning so many. Your program and Notre Dame's program,
they've become more consistent competitors, at the very top level. Can you
talk about that and maybe the different ways you guys have done that?   
COACH MULKEY: Well, I can't speak for Muffet. I can speak just for my program.
This is my 12th year at Baylor. We were bottom of the Big 12 when I was hired.  
We've gradually just grown the program. And the hardest part is not growing
the program but the hardest part is maintaining it.  
We'll continue to try to recruit good players that will keep Baylor up there
in the spotlight. I guess if you want to call us an elite program I
reluctantly for years have fought that. We just want to win a national
championship because it means so much to these players and to our fans and our
school and our community.  
And Tennessee and Connecticut have pretty much dominated like Louisiana Tech
did in the early'80s. I've been a part of those dominant teams and programs,
and if Baylor can maintain it and keep it rolling, we'll be just as proud as
any other school in the country.  
  
Q. Last night at halftime your game Pat Summitt made an appearance on the
court and everybody went crazy. Have you had her on your mind the whole year,
and what did that appearance last night mean to everybody here and the game?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I heard about it after the game. And she's our John
Wooden. She's the John Wooden of basketball.  
I've said it many times, I don't care who wins more championships than her,
there will never be another Pat Summitt.  
Now, on a personal note, I have spoken to her. She called me when I was
diagnosed with Bell's palsy. The same ovation she received last night she
received it when she came to our gym and walked on the Ferrell Center floor
and everybody gave her a standing ovation prior to our game.  
So people get it. They understand Pat Summitt has done so much for our game,
and she did it graciously.  
I'll never forgot in the early'80s we played them all the time at Louisiana
Tech, and she told Leon Barmore after a game, she said: I'm going to keep
playing you until I beat ya.  
And, boy, did she keep playing us. And then she developed, and look at the
product she's put together at Tennessee. And now everybody wants to emulate
her program.  
  
Q. You touched on this a little bit earlier, the two programs here have kind
of shared a mantra this season of unfinished business because of last year's
disappointment. Could you talk about that? It's one thing to have that, but
then to actually be able to work and get to this stage to try and finish that
business?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it's a testament to the players. Coaches can come up
with mottos and we can come up with motivational tactics, but it boils down to
those players, those players have to have a hunger about them and a sense
about that feeling I had last year. I don't want to have it again. And put
yourself in a position to have a shot at it. And I think both programs and
both teams have done that. And you're absolutely right. They have more seniors
than we do.  
They did make it to the national championship game last year. Our team has not
done that. Not even the freshman team with Griner her freshman year. We didn't
make it to the championship. So I guess you'd say they have a little bit more
experience getting to the championship game and playing in it than we do.  
But, on the other hand, we played them this year. So there's a lot of things
that I'm sure Muffet will use and we'll use in our film sessions to motivate
our players, but it's going to come down to those kids on the floor.  
  
Q. If you wouldn't mind, could you talk about what it's like to see the
recruiting process as a parent now regarding your son's baseball recruiting,
and could you have an anecdote you could share about him going to one of your
rivals, LSU or somebody?  
COACH MULKEY: It was very interesting to me as a parent. Kramer is a junior,
and he wanted to get his decision out of the way, which I encourage all
parents to do. But we took trips, unofficial visits at the end of the season
last year, and he chose the four, five schools he wanted to visit, and he
chose LSU.  
Now, I don't look at LSU as a rival. That's our home. If you remember, that's
where he was born. That's where my mother still lives. Our family is
Louisiana. And I've always told people many times, I don't care where my
career takes me; I'm still just a country girl from Louisiana.  
And so when he went to visit there, eight hours from Waco‑‑ and we have an
outstanding baseball program at Baylor. What mother wouldn't want their kid to
stay at Baylor just as Mackenzie has stayed there and allowed me to be a part
of her life in playing in our program?  
But I've also taught my kids that you go where you're comfortable and where
you think you can win a championship. And he told me: Mom, to me LSU baseball
is the equivalent of the New York Yankees. I said: Why do you say that,
Kramer? He said: They expect to be in the World Series. They've been in the
World Series more than any program. They've won those national championships.
I want that pressure. And he goes: I want to do what you and Mackenzie are
doing. And I said: What are we doing, buddy? He said: You're playing at the
highest level. And he said: I want to play at the highest level.  
I hugged his neck and told him I'd be there as much as I can, and I will be.
We talked about the benefits and the stresses of being my child and knowing
people will be disappointed that he didn't stay and play at Baylor, and I
thought that Steve Smith, our baseball coach at Baylor, as well as myself
handled that as graciously with Kramer as I thought we could.  
I thought Steve was a gentleman. I thought he was a fine, fine coach in
understanding Kramer wants to get away from his mom and his sister and, as
Kramer said, go develop his own legacy. And I laughed, and I said: Boy, you
don't know what a legacy is. But that's kind of his approach. And he wants to
go and do his thing at the highest level.  
But there's not a rivalry there. That's our home. It will be a good fit for
Kramer, and he's excited. And what's really interesting about Kramer is every
time somebody calls Mom about leaving Baylor for a new job, Kramer is the
first one in my bed at night going: Momma, you can't leave Baylor. These
people love you and these people are good to you. They're good to our family.
Don't you ever leave Baylor.  
So that tells you about his sense of logic and doing what he thinks is
necessary for his career and his mom as well. And he loves Baylor. He loves
it. His sister is playing for a national championship. But he realized that he
needed to do what he felt was right.  
  
Q. You've been in the women's game for so long. I know you've seen it grow
and you talked about that growth a little earlier. Along with that growth has
come a lot of new fans, and I think fans are a lot different than they used to
be in terms of the way they treat players and even attack them, and I know
Brittney got a lot of it in high school and a lot of it earlier. How has that
changed and how has she dealt with the ugliness that she still gets?  
COACH MULKEY: I appreciate you asking that. Social media is the worst thing
that's happened to you guys as well, because everybody thinks you're part of
social media, and that takes the respect away from your job and what you do as
journalists.  
And I don't‑‑ I made a commitment about my fourth year at Baylor. I'll never
read a message board. I don't want to see any of that garbage. I don't want to
hear about it, because it's just not right. It's not healthy.  
And this is someone's child. This is a human being, people. She didn't wake up
and say: God, make me look like this; make me be 6'8"; make me have the
ability to dunk. This child is as precious as they come when it comes to being
a good person, a sweet kid, a coachable‑‑ one of the greatest players I've
ever coached, probably the greatest, and the easiest to coach. I love going to
work and seeing Brittney Griner's face. She just makes me happy.  
But yet the stuff she's had to read about, the stuff she's had to hear, the
stuff people say about her, the stuff people write about her, it's gotta stop.
That stuff's gotta stop.  
And 20 years ago, to go back to your question, you didn't have the access to
all that mess that's out there now. Sure, people probably said it, but it went
as far as the next conversation or the next beauty gossip thing. And it's
constant, and for her to handle it as well as she does, I just love the kid. I
love the kid.  
I sit and I think: Why? Why do people do that this day and time? My son, he
gets two perspectives here. He's got the male ego, so I live in a household
with a female and male, and I get the male ego from that end that kid says it
best. He said: Mom, they do it to Brittney because they're jealous. They do it
in a harmful way because they really want to be what she is.  
And he's just her biggest fan. And that's coming from an egotistical boy who
is probably going to play in the Major Leagues some day. He gets it.  
And I just‑‑ I can't tell you‑‑ I'm going to say this because I appreciate you
asking the question. There are players you coach that bring drama and are high
maintenance to your program. When they graduate, you go: God, thank God
they're gone. They brought so much attention for whatever, negative good.  
This kid has had so much thrown at her that I wonder sometimes if she goes: Is
it really worth it to keep putting up with all this? But she never does. She
never does. Because what she has, she has a home that is lovable.  
And I want you to write this. We had this conversation today. She said: Coach,
they keep pointing to my daddy in the stands during the game. I want everybody
to know that my mom's back at home and they need to talk about my mother who
couldn't be here. I said: I'll make that point clear.  
You get her mom's name and you write about her mother. Because, see, that's
the sensitivity of this child. While she loves her dad and he's done much for
her, her mom's done just as much, and she needs to be talked about.  
Now, how many kids in this big stage would think about their mother at that
moment? That's what's changed, is the social media junk. It's ridiculous. I
tell my kid don't read about that stuff. Half the stuff you read about is
about your mom and it's not that good. Of course, they have a sense of humor
and they're tough and they laugh about it.  
But it's not right about what people say about her. And the nerve, they say it
to her face, to her face.  
And that's the part that's just disgusting to me.  
  
Q. You joked around on Saturday with Brittney about how she's emphatically
staying with Baylor next year and you made her say it loud and clear so
everyone heard it and such. On the men's side tonight, probably five of the
players are going to go pro after the freshman or sophomore year. But on the
women's side, I don't know how long the conversation was with you and her to
say that she's staying for this year, but it seems that in the women's game
it's good for the game having players stay, you get to know them, it's another
story versus being a one ‑and‑done or two‑and‑done. If you could talk about
that and how the whole ‑‑ it's good for the women's game to have these players
stick around and obviously for you to have Brittney be here for another
season?  
COACH MULKEY: Brittney Griner wants to get her college degree. We all know,
once you leave college it's so hard to go back. It's so hard to go back
because you start making money. Your priorities change. If you stay the course
and get that degree‑‑ I've never known anybody that got a college degree and
said I regret it. But I've known lots of athletes who say, gosh, I wish I
would have stayed because now I don't know if I'll go back and get it.  
Brittney and I have not had an in‑depth conversation about her staying. You've
all asked her, and she's answered it. And so I take what she told me when she
signed to come to Baylor, she said coach: I'm there until I get my degree.
It's not something we have to sit down like the men's side does and go, okay,
you're going to go in the first round and make X amount of dollars. We don't
have to go there with that.  
But for the most part women just don't do that. They don't leave early. I can
think of maybe one recently that has done that. And sometimes you don't know
the reasons why they do it. Brittney doesn't have to do it for financial
reasons.  
Her family, her dad, they're well off. She doesn't have to‑‑ she's not running
to leave anything that's bad in her life. She's enjoying her college life. And
that's what's so good about Robert Griffin. That's what's so good about
Brittney Griner. That's what's so good about athletes that actually enjoy the
college experience, because it's a rarity. It's a rarity in today's time.  
  
Q. Opposite of what Jerome asked you, Brittney Griner, you talked about how
she's changed the game, how she's changed the face of the game. You also
talked about how college basketball, women's basketball has changed over time.
How do you think Brittney Griner makes the game even more appealing to fans
who aren't die ‑hard women's basketball fans, just your outside fan who is
like I want to see the dunk, I want to see this or that?  
COACH MULKEY: That's it. That's what it is. The average fan‑‑ and I'll even go
so far as to say the male fans, all they want to see is the dunk. And they
can't believe a girl can do what she can do. So they may turn the TV on and
watch the highlights and go "wow," where before they never had any interest in
the game because it was played below the rim.  
Brittney has been able to pull in those stragglers that don't want to give the
women credit that it's a pretty good game below the rim. And when they see her
dunk, then she gets those fans that normally wouldn't watch the game. We're
attracting those types of fans. And it's the dunk.  
The shot block‑‑ the shot blocking would be another one. They'll watch just an
unbelievable throw‑it‑in‑the‑stands blocking of the shot, and that will grab
your attention if you don't watch the women's game.  
Our game is just‑‑ it's an interesting game because, if you go to most
universities, you have the families that bring their children. You have the
older people that are fans. Where the women's game lacks the support that the
men get is the students. That's the same way at Connecticut. The same way at
Tennessee, Notre Dame, and Baylor.  
Betcha if you took a poll, the students are the ones that fill the stands up
in the men's games in college, and that's where we're still not pulling them
in on the women's side.  
  
Q. Do you think it's good for the game or do you think it gives a false
perception of what the game is?  
COACH MULKEY: No, dunking is good for the game. It's a game of entertainment
somewhat. The dunk is good for the game. The moves are good for the game, all
that's entertainment.  
I still say the women's game and the men's game is somewhat different other
than playing below the rim, but we have made it different somewhat. The 360
move is not a walk on the men's side; you make the 360 move, the same move,
and they come over and play under our rules, it's a traveling violation.  
I struggle with that. I don't think you should have the difference in that.
But the game is the same. My son asked me. He goes: Mom, would you ever coach
a men's team? I said: I could. Wouldn't bother me.  
So that tells you the game is the same. The difference is the guys can play
above the rim.  
  
Q. Obviously you're one of the last schools that still uses "Lady" in the
nickname. Pat does it. Vivian Stringer, when she went to Rutgers, immediately
got rid of Lady Knights, whatever. Big Ten, none except I guess Penn State.
And pretty much there's 15 or 20. You're also such a proponent of Title IX and
an advocate, and I applaud you and thank you for what you've done for girls
and women as a role model. To some, to me, and I know the Women's Sports
Foundation has said this, too, the term "Lady," as if it's‑‑ from another era,
as if it's not the whole. You know, you don't see the Gentlemen Bears, of
course. And I'm curious how and why you stick with Lady when it is seen as a‑‑
it can be‑‑ as Nancy Hogshead of the Women's Sports Foundation said last week,
it's demeaning. If you go to Baylor, you're a Bear, end of conversation. Your
response? Thanks.   
COACH MULKEY: And I appreciate that viewpoint as well. And I have read your
articles and I wish you'd give Baylor a big pub because I love reading your
articles.  
I think without knowing‑‑ let me answer this. We're from the South. We still
say yes, ma'am and no, ma'am. And I have to honestly tell you I've been told
by people don't do that to me; that offends me.  
I played with kids from the West Coast when I was a player and kids from the
East Coast. And I would say yes, ma'am. And they would go: Stop that. That's‑‑
where we come from, it's respect.  
And Lady is not offensive to anybody who lives in our area of the country. I'm
not going to speak for Pat, but I think it's a tradition of respect, believe
it or not, than it is disrespect viewed from people on the outside.  
We don't make an issue of things that are really not disrespectful in our
eyes. We have shirts that say Bears. In fact, I may have one on somewhere.
It's more of a thing that things started a long time ago, like yes, ma'am and
no, ma'am.  
And I still have a hard time with people who don't say yes, ma'am and no,
ma'am, but I understand in some parts of the country that's viewed as
demeaning. And I don't view it that way.  
I think too much is made of it. But just look at the tradition of the program
and the coaches that run those programs. There's nobody that fights for Title
IX more than Pat Summitt and more than me. And I can tell you this: I'm a
product of Title IX more than I am a fighter of Title IX. I reaped the
benefits from those who came before me.  
But in no way, shape, or form do I not understand the viewpoint from those
that you mentioned. But I want them to also understand our viewpoint. And I
don't think there's a right and a wrong. I just think it's kind of tradition,
maybe, in where we live.  
  
Q. You just mentioned your son asking could you coach the men; it would be
no big deal to you. Could the men handle you (laughter)?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think that Coach Grant Teaff, who's the president of the
Football Coaches Association, former Baylor coach, he probably paid me one of
the highest compliments. And, again, I won't ever forget it. He said: You
could coach our sport.  
I take it as a compliment in that, one, he respected my knowledge of sports,
he respected that I get the most out of athletes, and I think guys would
respect you if you know what the hell you're talking about.  
  
Q. (Question of microphone).  
COACH MULKEY: Really, I'm not tough. That's what's so funny. You see me on the
sideline, and that's what I do. When you guys go to work at your computer, you
don't have your kids running in your ears or you're not going to write a good
story.  
When I go on that floor, my focus is on that basketball team and my assistants
giving me feedback and me getting on them. And when we leave that floor, I'm
not like that. I'm not like that. You couldn't get players to come play for
you if you didn't have an all‑around personality to where you knew when to
laugh, cry, hug, to be serious.  
The advantage I do have, seriously, is that I'm a mother. And I do think
that's an advantage. Now, does that mean you can't be a good coach if you
don't have children? No. But I get a little bit of advantage because I have to
deal with my own children and their problems and what motivates them, and they
give me some insight and some feedback because they're the same age as the
athletes I get to coach. But, yeah, I could coach them.  
In fact, I could make some of them a little bit tougher than they are.  
  
Q. Just the thought on what you said earlier, about people coming to pursue
you for other coaching jobs. That's been the last few years. You have one of
the most desirable jobs in the country at Baylor. I think it would take a lot
of ‑‑ a lot of things for you to even consider leaving there.   
COACH MULKEY: Baylor takes good care of me. It's flattering when people come.
The thing that you'll always know about me, I don't take my private issues
into the public unless it's something I can't hide. Couldn't hide the Bell's
palsy. Might as well tell it up front.  
When schools come after me, I'm not a coach that uses you guys to get a pay
raise. If a school goes after me, I go straight to the administration, we
talk, we make sure I feel comfortable, they feel comfortable. Take care of me
and I'll take care of you.  
But, yes, I have a great job. I have a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Notre Dame, head coach Muffet McGraw,
student‑athletes Skylar Diggins, Devereaux Peters, Natalie Novosel and
Brittany Mallory and Kayla McBride.  
Questions for anyone on the dais.  
  
Q. Coach, what sticks out in your memory most about the game with Baylor
early in the season, and how has your team changed, if at all, since then?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I just watched that game. So I think we've gotten a
lot better. I think we're a lot smarter. I think our shot selection is much
improved, and I think defensively we're a lot better.  
  
Q. Natalie, could you just revisit last night just for one second in terms
of the intensity of that game and how do you reassemble your thoughts so
quickly for the next battle? Last year, I assume, was quite similar going into
the Texas A &M game. But how difficult is that?   
NATALIE NOVOSEL: You know, yesterday being on the biggest stage, it's like a
mix of emotions going from high to low and everything. So coming down from
last night's win, it's an amazing win, but we're still not done.  
We're right here where we were last year; we didn't get it done. So there's
definitely a new attitude going into today's practice and just knowing what we
have to do to get things done for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Skylar, in the first game with Baylor, Odyssey Sims had 25points. I think
12 of them were from the free ‑throw line. Could you talk about what you guys
have to do differently tomorrow night in regards to Odyssey?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think she's a key to the game. We'll throw different things
at Brittney and stuff like that. But Odyssey is what makes them go. She's a
great point guard. She does a great job getting to the line. She's 40percent
from the 3‑point line, so you have to honor that, and she's also good at
getting to the basket.  
So she's a terrific defender. She gets out. She gets steals. She's going to be
aggressive. I think we need to make sure we pay attention to her. We have to
shade her side. We definitely have to be up and try to pressure her, too, and
not give her as easy looks to pass and things like that, and just approach
her.  
  
Q. You're going to get to all the way of the last game of your last season.
I'm wondering, A, how are you feeling and, B, can you talk about what your
defense is going to be charged with tomorrow?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's a great feeling. We, us seniors and the whole team,
really, just wanted to get back here. We had this chance last year, and we
didn't come up‑‑ we came up short. And we're just excited to be here and we're
looking forward to the chance to get that back.  
And tomorrow defensively we just really have to play team defense, get out on
the shooters, find Griner, shade to her. Just the things we have been doing
all year long that's been helping us get to this point.  
  
Q. Devereaux and Skylar and Coach, can you talk about Natalie's clutch play
and kind of her mental toughness, not just last night, but I guess she had
that buzzer beater against Duke earlier in the year and what you've come to
expect from her late in the game like that?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I felt it was really huge for us. Me and Sky were joking
about it last night, how easy it looked for her; she was just so calm and
collected shooting that shot like it was the first play of the game or
something like that.  
It's just great that we could expect that from our seniors. Natalie's done a
great job stepping up when we needed her to. You knew she was going to go to
the basket and box out, and she really applied herself at that point in the
game and came up big for us.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Natalie has been clutch all year for us. She's a player that
we can go to if we need a bucket. That's who we go to, Natalie.  
She's great at finding her shot, she's great at coming off of screens, she can
create her own shot, she can shoot the 3 and she can attack the basket and she
can pull up.  
So Natalie is like‑‑ like Dev was saying, shot the most nonchalantly I've
ever‑‑ last night. But she's been clutch all year for us. So that's kind of
what we expect out of Nat. It was no surprise there.  
COACH McGRAW: I agree with that. Since the Duke game‑‑ that was a huge win for
us and I think really propelled us forward. We didn't lose again for a while
after that game. I think it gave us a great confidence and for her to make
that last shot gave her even more confidence.  
She's somebody who would like the ball in her hands. At different times in the
game when we feel like we really needed to score, and she is ‑‑ it's in her
veins. She's not bothered at all by the pressure or the moment.  
  
Q. Brittany and Skylar, you just talked up here and you've talked throughout
the year about getting back to this game. So that's obviously a strong
motivation, but that also can be very stressful. I mean, at what point did it
become fun again and how did it become fun again?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I think after that first practice that we had after the
championship game last year, that was a tough practice. We were going real
hard. And after that it became our motivation. We weren't stressed about it
and it pushed us to work hard and kind of give our all every time we stepped
on the court and just to really take every game game by game and not to look
forward.  
We knew we couldn't win last year's game by winning a game this year, and we
knew if we played hard and played together and ran our stuff we would get back
here.  
  
Q. Brittany, this group of seniors has been together for so long, been
through so much, redshirt years, everything, if things don't work out the way
you hope tomorrow, is that going to color your experience at Notre Dame? Is it
going to leave you feeling somewhat empty? Are you going to be able to carry
away all the good things?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I don't think any one of us are going to feel that we were a
failure here. We have‑‑ I personally have had a great five years. I wouldn't
trade any of it for the world. A great five years. And I wouldn't trade any of
it.  
I've been through a lot, my ups and downs. My teammates, these are my best
friends. They're like my sisters. And whatever the outcome tomorrow, I think,
looking back on my career, it's been everything I could ask for.  
  
Q. How do you game plan for a 6'8 " athletic long post player?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, it's gotta be different than the last game because we
didn't do so well that time. She's an extraordinary player. I think she
changes the game. She changes a lot of things.  
For us, we're kind of perimeter oriented, we like our guards to score a lot. I
don't think it changes a lot for us. We don't jam the ball inside as much as
some other teams do.  
So I think we'll be able to run the stuff we have and really maybe have to
make that extra pass, which we've been pretty good at all year long.  
So I think that's going to be the theme for us, is just getting her engaged
and then trying to make a few extra passes.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the way the perimeter defense has improved
since that Baylor game? And also offensively are you guys going to have to
shoot a lot of long 3s in order to beat Baylor?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Our defense on the perimeter has definitely improved since
that game. We've been really aware of 3‑point shooters, how to approach, who
to run out, who not to, who's drivers. And I think we matured a lot this year.
I don't think we need to shoot a lot of 3s.  
Like Coach said, we just have to engage. If we just play our‑‑ engage Griner.
If we just play our game and drive, and hopefully get her up on her feet and
dish over, we've been well ‑‑ we've been working well together and doing a
pretty good job of getting easy baskets and just making that extra pass.  
  
Q. Coach, how does Skylar match up with Sims both offensively and
defensively?  
COACH McGRAW: I think Skylar's a great player. I think she's the best guard in
the country. I think it's an interesting matchup both being left‑handed. I
think Skylar is a great defender, great passer. She can score. She does
everything well. And I think Sims is a great player also. I think she's a huge
key to their team. She has really, really done a lot of great things this
year.  
It's not just because she can throw the ball to Griner; I think she can do a
lot on her own as well.  
  
Q. Skylar, Destiny Williams from Benton Harbor, what do you remember about
her from the high school days way back when and how have you seen her develop
now over the years?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: She was great in high school. Great offensive rebounder,
that's what carried over to college. She's still a great offensive rebounder.
Destiny led her high school and she scored a lot of points. She can score in
bunches. They gave her the ball a lot. And she scored. And I think that she
still scores.  
And what translated from high school to college is her aggressiveness to
attack the boards offensively. She could block shots to get in there and get
rebounds. And she's kind of‑‑ she's not the tallest, but she can get in there
and she can still rebound it and score well.  
And I think she does a great job working off Griner when the double team
comes. She finds her open spots and she finishes around the rim.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH McGRAW: She had already graduated, had some opportunities to pursue. And
really, for us, I thought she was essential to this team because of all the
intangible things she gives as well as being a best lock‑down defender and
3‑point specialist. I think just her attitude and personality really affects
the whole team. I think she's been a great leader for us.  
So I do. I think getting her to come back for this year‑‑ I don't know that
we'd be here without her.  
  
Q. Devereaux, you guys have talked about the motivation of last year and the
way that ended. Is there motivation also in playing Baylor again and having
another shot at them after that game earlier this year?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, it's always nice to play a team that you lost to early
on, especially at this point in the season, whenever your team is at their
peak and playing their best game. So it would be nice to get that game back.
And we were a completely different team back then. It's just going to show how
much we've grown since then.  
  
Q. Devereaux and Natalie, if you could answer this. Griner is a pretty
incredible shot blocker, but sometimes what happens in games she blocks so
many shots early people shy away. You guys aren't known for shying away from
the basket. But how do you not let that shot ‑blocking intimidation kind of
get into your head after she might have swatted a few?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think we have to use our judgment. Going in there, you
know, we can't shy away at the beginning of the game. But we're going to
attack. We're fighters. We're going to attack the basket. I think being
relentless.  
She's a game changer on the defensive end, so we just have to be smarter and
engaging her and dishing off and just to not go in there and go right up into
her. It's easy block for her, just easy turnover. We've just got to be a
little smarter on the offensive‑‑  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, I think‑‑ excuse me. I'm sorry. I think this is a team
that's never been fearful of any team in that sense. And, I mean, she's 6'8"
with a 7'4" wing span. She's going to block shots. I don't think anybody takes
that person on. She's huge. If she didn't block a shot, there would probably
be something wrong. You just gotta keep going at her.  
I think we're pretty smart with our shot selection, where we should be able to
get them off as well.  
  
Q. Kayla, are you glad that you guys have the experience of playing against
Baylor this season and how or why not would that be helpful?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think it's good that we played them. But, like they said,
we're a completely different team. That's about the fourth game of the season.
I think we've grown a lot defensively and offensively since then.  
  
Q. Muffet, last game was played in high 80s, 90s. I wonder if you expect
this came we'll see that much scoring, or because it's the title game maybe
points go down a little bit?  
COACH McGRAW: I think you're going to see a lot of scoring. When we met
earlier this year, it was a pretty high‑scoring game also. I think both teams
are pretty comfortable right now with being in the spotlight. So I expect it's
going to be a pretty high‑scoring game.  
  
Q. Muffet, I don't know if coaches think in these terms, but your team is
going to change obviously next year when the seniors go, and you haven't won a
championship since 2001. Do you see this as a window that you personally need
to take advantage of before the team moves on next season?  
COACH McGRAW: I would love for them to go out national champions. It's really
special. There's such a huge difference between losing the last game and
winning it. But for this group, as Brittany said, this has been a special
group for as long as they've been here.  
And I've treasured every moment of this year, and I'm going to be sad to see
them go, whether we win or lose.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, are you glad that your team has been on the court with Baylor this
season, and how can that be helpful?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think until you see her close up in a game, you really
can't even appreciate how big she is. I think for us having had that
experience and knowing what to expect, I think it does definitely make going
into the game a little less of a surprise factor. We know what she's going to
do, and we can look at that film and see the few things that did work. There
weren't that many. But we can try to look‑‑ we're running some different stuff
now, it will be interesting to see how that works.  
  
Q. Everyone up on the dais seems to think this is a very different team now.
When you looked at the tapes, how different is Baylor and in what ways?  
COACH McGRAW: I think Baylor's gotten a lot better. I think that their other
players have really improved. I think in the beginning of the season Griner
was having to get 35 or 40. And Sims would chip in with 15 or so. And the rest
of their players really weren't looked at. They were the ones everybody left
open. And now I think they've figured out ways to win and I think you saw that
last night when Griner only had three field goals, Sims I think one field
goal, and they still won the game with their other players. So I think they've
improved a lot, too.  
  
Q. All season long you guys used the unfinished business mantra. It's rare
that teams have a thought and actually get to live it out and get back to
where they want to be. Can you talk about the season and what it takes to
getting to that point and to this point, how one of you will not be able to
finish off the goals of the year?  
COACH McGRAW: It's been inspirational and motivational for us all year long to
look at that. It was written on the board by one of the players at some point
in the summer. Every time they come in the locker room they look at that. And
I think it has‑‑ they really embraced the pressure. We didn't talk about it a
lot. But I think they knew it. And I think they handled it so well to get back
to this point.  
It's really difficult. I think last year was a little bit of an upset to get
here, and now we feel like we were the higher seed. So we should have gotten
here.  
I think just the way they played all year long, focusing one game at a time,
was great. And if we come into this game somebody's going to win, somebody's
going to lose, we're going to do everything we can to win.  
  
Q. If I can just ask you a question about something off topic. Draft is
coming up. You've got the three seniors. Have you had any conversations with
the personnel people, especially about Natalie Novosel, and how do you see her
as equipped for a professional career?  
COACH McGRAW: Haven't had a lot of conversations with too many people except
the ones who came to Notre Dame to watch them play. We've seen the scouts at a
lot of the games on the road too.  
But I think they're both getting a lot of interest. And I think with Natalie,
I think she's a great scorer, and I think she can really, really play in the
WNBA. I think she's probably got a little work to do. They may want her to
handle the ball a little more, but overall I think she's going to be a great
WNBA player.  
  
Q. If I read my history correctly, and I might not, but in 1982, the same
calendar, Mulkey wins the NCAA title as a player and you take the job at
Lehigh. What do you remember as a player and how would that translate into
today's game 30years later?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's exactly the same now as she was then. I admired
her as a player. Louisiana Tech was the team to the beat at the time. She was
the point guard. Loved the way she played. She was the floor general and bossy
and she's probably doing the same thing now. I think really nothing has
changed much. She's doing a phenomenal job there.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't know. A lot of people from the past always look at that
and say what would our team be like now. And the game has changed, but for
her, yeah, I think she could. I think she's got all those intangibles that
make a great player.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, well, we only played six people. So we try to rest all the
guards and give them a little break with Natalie coming in, and Dev's capable
of guarding on the perimeter. So we have enough of team to play the full
guards. We could still guard them. I like that lineup with the two bigs. I
think we can do a lot more things and generally we rebound a little bit better
with them.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the mindset of having to play an undefeated
team in the national championship game? You faced UConn before when they went
through undefeated seasons. Can you use that as a bit to your advantage? Or
just the fact that they have that momentum that they haven't lost all season,
how tough is that to go against?  
COACH McGRAW: I think when you're undefeated you have a lot of confidence that
you're playing with, but at the same time it's just a little bit of pressure
of knowing that you've never lost. And when it gets down to the end of the
game, you hope they feel that pressure.  
I think they have had a great season. They have one thing they want to do,
same goal we have. And we're back to being the underdog. Finally. It's taken
us a long time to get our green jerseys on. And we can now even be more loose
and the pressure is all on them.  
  
Q. Last night Pat Summitt made an appearance at halftime of the Baylor game.
And it's been quite a year regarding that. Looking back on your career, have
you changed things as a coach because of her impact on the game, anything this
year that you thought about when you were coaching, anything like that?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's impacted the game. I think she's impacted every
coach that coaches. I think she's a role model that whether you're just
starting out or been in it for a while look up to and would love to emulate.  
I think she's done so many things with class and integrity. She's so well
respected by everybody in the profession that I think you just look and you
go, boy, I would love to be like her. I read some things and they said how she
treated people. No matter who came up to her she would just give them the time
to speak with them. And things like that are so important. And that'swhen I
read things like that and I think to myself: Hmm, I wonder if people would say
that about me. Maybe I need to work on that a little bit more.  
  
Q. I know you talked a little bit about the other day, could you reiterate
on the women's team no one goes early. No one leaves. Brittany and Skylar both
said they're staying. Potentially you could have had four players go to the
WNBA. The men's side could have gone as well. Just talk about the women's
game, how everyone sticks around and the fans actually learn about players
instead of one and done?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it's great they stay. It helps your team development. I
don't know how men do it because you're constantly playing freshmen because
your upperclassmen are leaving.  
So I think in the women's game that's probably why we have all the No. 1 seeds
advancing and maybe why we have a little less parity, because the teams who
get the good players keep them for four years.  
I think it's great that they don't leave early. And the education. You have to
look at the graduation rates between men's and women's basketball. I think
probably women's are higher. I think that's a really important stat, too. But,
like I said, if somebody's giving them a million dollars, somebody would
probably have a lawsuit and try to change that.  
  
Q. In 2001 you lost to Connecticut in the Big East finals, then you beat
them in the national semifinals on route to the title. Is that something
you've dropped out there with the players? Are they aware of that?  
COACH McGRAW: We talk about that a lot with Niele on the bench and in
practice. She gets to talk about her championship quite a bit. So I think we
did draw a lot of parallels with this. We actually went through Denver to get
to St. Louis for the finals.  
So I think there's a lot of things that we look at and say, boy, there's a lot
of similarities. I'm not that superstitious, but my team is, so I think it's a
good thing.  
  
Q. You're going against another Southerner, like last year. I wonder if you
could just talk about personality ‑wise you and Kim. Over the years you guys
have crossed paths a lot. Just maybe a little bit of contrast in personality.
And then also just she sort of has this fiery temper on the sidelines, maybe
sometimes you're more subdued. Could you talk about the contrast a little
bit?  
COACH McGRAW: I think there's a contrast starting with the outfits and going
through the game. I think she really has a lot of emotion on the sideline, a
lot of fire on the sideline, and I think that's how she coaches because that's
the kind of person that she is. I think over the years I've gotten less‑‑ I've
gotten more patient with every single play that happens and try not to react
to that. But it works for us. That's just her personality. And it's an
interesting contrast.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about it a little bit earlier, but with Baylor do you
have to kind of pick your poison? Because that's kind of what happened last
night.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, you know, you really do. I think you can't let Griner just
get 50. And you can't just let her go and try to guard her one on one. So you
have to do something. You have to hope they shoot poorly. That's what it comes
down.  
The team that makes the most shots is going to win the game. Sounds so
simplistic, but you get open looks, but they're not going to be around the
basket. They're going to get open looks, they're going to be around the
basket.  
I think if we can force other people to shoot the ball and hope they shoot it
poorly and we shoot it well, that's got to be the big key to the game. And you
have absolutely no control over how you shoot the ball, so it's a little
scary.  
  
Q. In this whole last 10, 15years of UConn ‑Tennessee, Notre Dame and Baylor
are two teams that are‑‑ one of you two is going to win two titles during
that. Can you just talk about those two programs being able to be as
consistently good at the top level with the two titans, the way they've
been?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it's a refreshing change, I think, to see two different
teams in the finals. I think that both of us have built our programs in
different ways.  
I think we're just happy to be in that conversation now of being an elite
program that can get to the Final Four, and certainly we're there a lot
because of Skylar and the chemistry we have on our team. And Griner has
certainly done that for Baylor as well.  
So I think we've both kind of built around some pretty good players. We look a
little bit more at team chemistry and how we're going to fill the other roles
maybe than they do.  
  
Q. A lot of focus on Griner, obviously, but can you talk about what Destiny
Williams gives them at the other post?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's been the X factor for them. In a lot of games
you'll see she's really doing great things to offset the defense on Griner,
and then a lot of games they're bringing Griner high and giving it to her on
the block.  
So I think she really is the unsung hero of their team. She's played well all
year, rebounded well, scores, can shoot the jumper, can score on the block.
Rebounds. And that's what makes them dangerous, when that other‑‑ that other
player.  
  
Q. Ruth and Griner are different types of personalities, but I remember
Ruth's freshman year she got frustrated a lot, was in foul trouble, kind of
adjusting to the physicality. Certainly by the time she was a senior, no
matter what you did to her, you couldn't get her rattled. Brittney as a junior
now has gotten that calmness. How do post players do that when they take as
much physical abuse as they do?  
A.I admire that, because I think when you're tall you don't get a lot of
calls. We watch high school kids play, you feel like you're watching the game
wondering when the ref is going to make the call. But most of the refs are
pretty short. And I think there's a little bit of a bias there, like, well,
you're 6'5", you ought to be able to make that shot with somebody hanging on
your arm.  
I think they do put up with a lot. If they have that kind of personality and
that poise that Ruth had, I think it does make it a lot easier for them to
handle it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Baylor  59  
Stanford  47

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now, head coach Tara VanDerveer from Stanford and
student‑athletes Neka Ogwumike and Toni Kokenis.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'd like to congratulate Baylor. They have an excellent
team. We worked very hard. We prepared really hard. But at the end of the day
they outplayed us, and they have some great players and really outstanding
coach in Kim Mulkey.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Neka, can you talk about how you're feeling right at this moment and was
it a matter of you guys not knocking down shots? Do you feel you'll walk away
and say we didn't hit enough shots?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Obviously no one feels good after a loss, especially if
it's in the Final Four. But I just kind of look back and reflect on what it
took for us to get here, and I would have rather gone down with my team than
up with any other team.  
But when it comes down to the game, if you look at it, yeah, we were 20 for
60, that's a lot. And I know I didn't make one 3, and I shot five of them.  
And I think in the first half‑‑ Tara made a really good point at halftime. She
said I was settling for my shot. Because during the week we worked on kicking
it out, kicking it out, kicking it out. But when I started attacking in the
second half, I was able to go one‑on‑one against.  
But ultimately I think also it was kind of difficult for us to really figure
out what we wanted to do on offense. I think we were too worried about her.  
But in reality attacking her wasn't as hard as we thought it would be. And
hitting shots is always what it comes down to. We were 2 for 17 from the 3.
Granted, five of those were mine.  
But I think it's a good thing for our youngsters to look back and reflect on
what it really takes to get over this hump.  
  
Q. Toni and Neka, did you guys feel that you came close to executing the
game plan that you wanted to do, but when you missed that many 3 ‑pointers
it's tough?  
TONI KOKENIS: I think we were really well prepared for this game. We had a
great game plan, and we were executing it. We just struggled a little bit
offensively and missed some shots that would have definitely helped us, like a
few 3s that we stepped out of bounds a few times.  
And I think also their offensive boards kind of hurt us, and we needed to box
out better and get more rebounds because they got too many second‑chance
points.  
  
Q. Did you feel that the strategy of bringing each possession down to the
end of the shot clock? I mean, although it worked, in terms of shortening the
game, it forced you into some difficult shots, more than you probably would
have wanted. Is that accurate?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yeah, we weren't trying to run the clock down.  
  
Q. (Off microphone) the end of the shot clock repeatedly.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: If we could score earlier, we would. But their defense
was‑‑ it's tough. Having in the paint, it completely changes everyone's game.
Not just the inside players' game. Attacking the basket is a little more
difficult, as you saw. Toni and Amber were trying to get in there, and you
kind of have to think about making an extra pass. Your first instinct is to
shoot.  
But, besides that, Odyssey's pressure, obviously she got some steals. Destiny
Williams got a steal. And it's not‑‑ it's not like we were trying to run the
clock down. It just kind of happened, and obviously those aren't the shots you
want, but I think we tried our best to really compose ourselves on offense,
even though it was really difficult.  
  
Q. Neka, you kind of talked about settling for your shot in the first half.
I don't know if it was the plan or if what you saw was open, but looked like
you were attacking more in the second half.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Definitely. I think I‑‑ when Tara mentioned, I realized
yeah, I am settling, because this whole week we talked about driving the
baseline, kicking across the baseline or kicking behind you. And so the
pick‑and‑roll, we didn't think, would work as well. Because 's in there. I
thought if I start hitting some outside shots, they will come out on me.  
But they were flying out on me regardless. My coaches helped me realize that.
In the second half I started attacking. When I realized it wasn't that hard to
score against her, I was like: Give me the ball, give me the ball.  
But also we needed to try and get offensive rebounds so we could kick it out
to our shooters.  
  
Q. Neka, can you expand on what you said about attacking her wasn't as hard
as you thought it would be? How much of playing is a psychological thing where
it's really scary to think about doing it and talk about what the reality of
it was like; that it wasn't as difficult?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think it actually was kind of‑‑ I was definitely psyching
myself out. I think I was kind of too into myself in the first half, feeling I
needed to fire, fire, fire, but Tara's always told me if I'm shooting, who is
rebounding.  
When they told me at halftime just attack‑‑ because first play of the game I
think I got the ball and I attacked I missed the layup, but I was able to get
a shot off. And in the second half I just started attacking. I was like, okay,
this isn't that bad.  
And I think it is mostly psychological. Granted, Griner, she has over 200
blocked shots, more than our whole team combined, on her career. That's
amazing.  
But I think if you put your mind to it, and I think I did a really good job of
not being scared of going in there. And my teammates had my back. I think
Chiney did a good job of rebounding, even Amber, you saw Amber get a tip back,
that's awesome.  
It's the Final Four. Even if it wasn't the Final Four, when you go out there
you want to leave it all on the court. And I tried my best to play as hard as
I could in whatever situation I was.  
  
Q. Toni there was a sequence, Bonnie hit the 3 but she stepped out of bounds
and Chiney with the offensive foul and Neka fouled on the other end. It was an
11 ‑1 swing. Did that feel like a pretty tough sequence for you?  
TONI KOKENIS: Yeah, that hurt us because those were plays if it had gone the
other way it would have been at least a little more momentum or kept the game
closer, especially like a 3 or a fastbreak layup. Those are both momentum
plays and to be right there and obviously not be able to finish or have them
taken away was difficult, and we just weren't able to overcome the hump of
that stretch of plays later in the game.  
  
Q. Notre Dame doesn't have nearly the size that you have. Is there any way
that they can stay with Baylor on Tuesday?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, they may not have the size, but I think Devereux is
one of the best post players I've played‑‑ I can only say "with" because I
played with her in U.S.A. And Kayla McBride, she's a brute. When we were
watching tape‑‑ was it on West Virginia? ‑‑ she was guarding Bussie and
Dunning, and I don't doubt it will be a good game on Tuesday.  
And just regarding the fact it's and then they don't really have as strong of
an outside, you have Skylar Diggins, you have Natalie Novosel, you have
Brittany Mallory, and obviously Natalie Anchonwa and everyone that comes off
the bench.  
I look forward to watching it. I'm going to watch it. I think it's going to be
a great matchup on Tuesday. I think it's going to be interesting to see‑‑ it's
a rematch as well. I think it will be interesting to see‑‑ Baylor's a great
team; Notre Dame's a great team‑‑ to see them match up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the end, why do you think you guys didn't win this game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, in just looking at the stats, as an example, we shot
one more field goal, made one more field goal than them. We sent them to
free‑throw line.  
If you look at everything else, I mean, our assists are the same, turnovers
the same. We had more blocks than they did.  
I think there were some momentum plays. The big momentum play was the foul on
Chiney driving in there.  
Honestly, you never know what's going to happen in games, but the game before
ours seemed to be extremely physical. And this game was just the opposite to
me.  
But I think the main thing was we sent them to the free‑throw line. And I
don't think we should have with the game plan we had. We're totally off of
either No.3 or 20. And 20 hit some big shots. She hit one 3. She's made ten
all year. She had a couple of shots for them that she stepped up nicely. I
think she gave them some momentum. But the free throws, that was a big thing.  
  
Q. Neka just said it wasn't part of the game plan to run the clock. But the
other day you said that you wanted to slow the tempo of the game.  
COACH VANDERVEER: No, I didn't ever say that. The question was put to me like
did you learn from what other people did, and I said yes.  
We wanted to run on them, but we really didn't get out and go as well as we
wanted to. They make things hard in terms of running your offense, so they
take you out of doing your normal thing. So to try to get into alignment, to
try to get to do things, it took us that long to get the floor organized and
to be able to run our offense.  
And I thought we got some‑‑ the first half we had some turnovers I didn't
like. We had some fouls I didn't like. But we really‑‑ we had some nice open
looks and didn't knock down shots.  
  
Q. You talked about No.3 and 20, Condrey and Madden, knocking down shots.
With Baylor do you almost have to pick your poison, try to stop inside and
maybe let them take some outside shots?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That was‑‑ if I were to do it again, I would probably do it
the same way. I think there was‑‑ like the first play of the game Madden just
drives in for a right‑hand layup. That was not part of the game plan.  
That was we're guarding her going to the rim. There were other possessions
where some of the turnovers that led to baskets. You have to keep them in
front.  
And I think our team‑‑ it took a lot of focus, and I think our team did a good
job, but we had to do a better job. I think Neka‑‑ just I was happy with our
defense. They shot, what, 30 something percent. But except for our fouling.  
And I just‑‑ honestly I just didn't see it. We're not that a physical a team.
We've never had anyone foul out all year. And I was just like‑‑ it's just
different.  
  
Q. I want to make sure I understand this correctly. You were not trying to
take the full 30seconds?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Correct.  
  
Q. But your team just couldn't find the shots; it seemed very deliberate, a
lot more deliberate than normal.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think they force you that way. We tried to get out and go.
We tried to push the tempo a little bit. Honestly I think Amber got a little
tired. And we just‑‑ we weren't able to run our offense the same way. You just
can't make passes that you usually make. You can't attack in the same way
you're used to attacking.  
Although, I think finally I just said to Neka: You've got to get the ball and
take it at. She did and drew some fouls and scored. But we didn't really get
much‑‑ Neka didn't get much help. Usually it's been Neka and Chiney. We needed
more help for Neka.  
People needed to pick up offensively. Amber going 1 for 9; Jos, 1 for 6. We
had some good looks. We needed to knock them down. But we're not trying to
hold the ball on them.  
  
Q. It's easy to see you were double ‑teaming , but can you describe in some
detail exactly what the strategy was with her? Was it just as simple as
muscling her and fronting her sticking two people on her?  
A.It was always the person that was guarding either 3 or 20 was leaving them
and just sagging in front or doubling in on her. We knew we didn't want to
leave‑‑ other teams had left‑‑ most teams always put two people on her. And
other people had left Odyssey Sims and she would light them up. They'd leave
Hayden and she would light them up.  
We said we're going to leave those two and gamble off Madden. Besides her
first layup, basically she was like 3 for 10. So that was‑‑ I thought that was
a good gamble, 0 for 2 from 3. But Condrey came in and hit a couple of shots.
And Griner doubling her was a focus and staying on other people.  
We did not do a good enough job on Destiny Williams. I thought she got a
couple of O boards on us. But defensively to me it wasn't the problem except
for our fouling. And I just‑‑ I don't know. I mean, it was different.  
  
Q. Neka mentioned that she was getting psyched out over the Griner mystique.
Was that something you were concerned with at the beginning when you were game
planning for this game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that in some ways‑‑ I think that we had
really‑‑ we watched block and block and block and block, but she didn't‑‑ Neka
could get by her, Neka's quickness. And probably waited a little too long but
Neka probably needed to attack her more earlier.  
But I thought she did a good job in the second half of attacking, going at her
a little bit better. But we needed‑‑ I just felt like we needed other people
besides Neka. If 's going to guard Neka, then other people have to take
advantage of playing against either Williams or Pope, or come off a screen and
knock down a shot, either Amber or Toni or Jos open for a 3.  
I'm not faulting Neka at all. I mean, if anything, maybe we should have said:
You go at Griner and other people be ready to spot up and knock down some
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
Connecticut  75

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us head coach Muffet McGraw, and student‑athletes
Skylar Diggins, Brittany Mallory, and Devereaux Peters.  
COACH McGRAW: I am just so proud of our team right now, because at the end of
regulation we had the game won with about 1:13 to go, and we simply gave it
back to them. Then we had to make some spectacular plays to claw our way out,
Brittany hitting the 3 and Natalie hitting the shot at the end of the
regulation. Sky had some game‑saving defensive plays and made the 3 down the
stretch. We really earned that one.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about the play you made on Hartley on the breakaway
where you blocked the shot and then found you Brittany for the 3, just the
impact that had on the game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We were set up to play, and Brit looked away as soon as I‑‑
and I let go. It was a two on one, and I had to dodge and fake. She passed it,
and I was standing right there.  
So just had to keep the ball in play, trying to tip it or just keep her from
scoring without fouling. And then with them being back there, we had an
advantage. I sprinted. Nobody found Brittany. Everybody ran the lane and she
had a lot of time to set up for that shot. And I told Brit at the end of
regulation: Brit, I'm going to keep throwing it to you, so keep spotting up.
She knocked it down.  
  
Q. Brittany, looked like a really eerie calm in the overtime. Go through
both the 3s and what you were feeling. And obviously seems like after you let
the release you knew they were good.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Yeah, it was‑‑ I was thinking about it a little bit in
regulation, not hitting the 3, and it's been a while. But like Sky said, she
told me to keep shooting. My whole team was telling me keep shooting, they're
going to fall, they're going to fall.  
And Sky hit me for the pass and I lined up, I just had‑‑ took a deep breath
and let it go and was thinking to myself this one's going in. And finally they
both went in and I was so happy. I couldn't believe it. I was so happy.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: She almost cried.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I was so excited.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the defense on Hartley in the second half,
just what you guys changed after she had that first half?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: We tried to focus in on not letting her get touches‑‑ we
didn't really talk about it as much. Our defense just came alive and we were
talking about team defense. It's been one of our like mottos all year, just
play together, play hard, and we just tried to make her uncomfortable a little
bit. We were always there on the catch.  
I think we did that with almost all their players tonight.  
  
Q. Skylar, could you talk about the defense that they played against you in
the first half and why it was so successful and the adjustments you made in
the second half to get yourself going?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They were the aggressors in the first half. They were up,
aggressive. We were passive. We were back on our heels. And we were settling
for jump shots. Credit their defense. They were up on us tight.  
In the second half‑‑ we came in at halftime. We made adjustments in the second
half. We came out, made sure we were the aggressors and we understood they
were in some foul trouble. Attacked the basket. Got them in more foul trouble.
And just continued to play our game and at our pace.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: At my pace, I tried to move as the team goes‑‑ just trying
to push, I think. I wasn't doing a good job of really pushing and getting out.
I was kind of passive.  
Like I said, Coach just told me keep attacking. She told us to keep attacking.
I got good teammates around me that move off me and we play off each other.  
At the end I think our defense kind of led to our offense. We got a couple
steals, got out in transition, got some points. And it was good for us to get
our momentum going.  
  
Q. Skylar, with about 22seconds to go and you guys were up eight, looked
like you had sealed the win. You ran over to your coach, and looked like you
said something to her and you both kind of smiled. Could you share what that
was?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It's a secret. I just said: We got you, Coach. I hugged her.
It means a lot. We play this game for her. And this team, we want to get it.
We're hungry.  
We told her at the beginning of the game: We didn't have you in the last game
in the Big East Tournament; we're going to have you this time.  
I thought the team bought in and did a good job backing Coach up.  
  
Q. Devereux, how tough was it inside, especially in that first half where it
seemed like there weren't many whistles and it seemed like a pretty physical
game?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think in the first half they were getting a lot of easy
layups. We were staying too long on screens and giving them wide open cuts to
the basket.  
And so in the second half we really tried to get over the screens and the
guards so they could guard the guards and we can get back in the post and they
weren't getting easy shots.  
  
Q. Devereux, can you talk about the rebounding, the battle there? And, also,
could you just talk about in general the fight this team has with what you did
tonight?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: The rebounding was really important. I think the guards came
in and crashed, tipped some balls and got real key rebounds towards the end of
the game. We weren't rebounding, really let them do what they wanted in the
first half.  
We tried to focus on them in the second half. And I think the guards did a
great job getting in there, getting rebounds as well.  
This is a team that never quits. We've never been like that as long as I can
remember. We're going to keep fighting no matter how much we're down, if the
game is over, whatever it is, we're going to keep fighting.  
And that's one thing I love about this team, is that no matter what point in
the game it is, we're going to fight it out until the end. And it showed
today.  
  
Q. I was hoping you could take us back through those final really crazy last
90seconds. Obviously they had a couple of steals, couple of big baskets and
free throws, but then to Natalie's last final shot?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Oh, man. You want me to start? We're in the same predicament
as we were at the end of regulation. And this time I think we went in the
huddle up 4 with 1:20. We've got to finish. Leave it all on the court.  
And I think this team did that. And, man, turned it over, and I was like, oh,
my gosh, I gotta get back in. Brit knocks a 3 down, and we were talking about
our stops in the huddle, how we just needed to get three more stops, three
more stops. We were on a clock. We knew they were going to be pressuring us.  
We did a good job at the end and let out a sigh of relief when we got up three
possessions, and we knew we were going to switch everything and not foul. If
it was a 2, just try to stay in front.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think one of the best things about our team right now is
we can hold our composure in situations like that. We've been in a lot of
tough situations. Like Sky said, when she turned it over and they went on the
2‑on‑1 fastbreak, she could have easily fouled and not been in the right spot
and given up. But she ran back and got a huge play and got a huge block and
got the ball back.  
Shows how composed we can be even in those situations where it seems like
things aren't going our way.  
  
Q. Brittany, I think it was the first three you had ‑‑  
BRITTANY MALLORY: First game.  
  
Q. You've had really good passing all year, a lot of high assist percentage.
I think it fed through both of your post players. If it was a like hockey
assist, they both would have gotten assists. When you guys have been
performing well this season, that's been the case. Could you discuss that and
how important that was to you guys playing your brand of ball at that point?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Yeah, our team loves to share the ball. We have confidence
in each other, and even though I wasn't hitting 3s most of the tournament,
they kept feeding me the ball. They kept telling me to shoot. And Sky. She
gave me the most confidence today when she said they're going to go in. And it
was just a big sigh of relief when that first one finally went in.  
Our team loves to share the ball and we're going to help each other out. When
someone's open, we're not going to be selfish and move the ball and that's
when we're at our best.  
  
Q. Is it sweeter because it was UConn here?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Yeah.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yes.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yes.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's great getting to the championship game and it's the
exact thing that happened last year. But we've had a battle with them all
year. We played them three times before this game.  
And they won the last game that we had, that we faced each other. And it
couldn't be a better way to go to the championship.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think it's great for the Big East, though, two straight
years, two Final Four teams. What a game like this for fans to watch. I know
basketball fans all around the country were foaming at the mouth seeing this
and when it went into overtime, you could see‑‑ even the Stanford‑Baylor crowd
got into it.  
But this is great. Yes, it's that much sweeter because it's UConn.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your team's character, the way they came back
from that let ‑down at the end of regulation?  
COACH McGRAW: It was a huge let‑down. It was important that we went into the
huddle with a positive attitude. And I thought my staff did a really good job
of stopping me before I got there, to make sure we did go in on a positive
note.  
And the players, they were great. They were pumping each other up. And we had
seen them in overtime in South Bend. So we had kind of a little bit the same
idea going into the overtime. But, yeah, it was huge for them to not put their
heads down and say: God, we just kind of blew it. They were just ready to go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means to you when the players say they've got
your back?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it's very emotional for me with this group. I don't think
I've ever had a group like this. They take such ownership. We play for each
other.  
I feel the same way about them. I want them to experience a national
championship. Every time I look at them, all I can think is how much I love
them. It's like a little bit like being a mom and watching your daughters do
some great things. And it's always a proud moment for me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Skylar's play, the block, and then the feed for
Mallory to get that 3, just the impact it had on the game?  
COACH McGRAW: That was game‑saving. That was huge. You can't even‑‑ that would
have turned the game around had they made that layup. So it was just so
important.  
And as Dev said, a lot of times you turn the ball over, you tend to put your
head down and kind of jog back and hope somebody gets there. But she sprinted
the floor, made that huge play.  
I think when she came out of there, I don't think anybody saw where she was,
all of a sudden she came dribbling out of the pack. And I think it just gave
us such a big momentum lift, and then Brittany hitting the 3 just topped it
off.  
  
Q. You said the players were going to approach it as a business trip. Now
that it's been a couple of days, what's their psyche been like and how would
you evaluate them, how they've been here in Denver?  
COACH McGRAW: They've really been great. I think in fact they probably haven't
had enough fun. We went out to the Broncos stadium, had dinner out there and a
tour of the stadium. That was nice. But I think they really want to have some
time off to themselves to kind of experience the city.  
So I think they've been great in terms of their attitude and their approach,
and we kind of kept telling them if we win you're going to get more free time.
We'll have a lot fun if we go win this one.  
  
Q. Earlier in the first half it seemed like Connecticut was beating you
backdoor and they were getting a lot of easy buckets with Dolson inside. Was
it simply the fact that Dolson was in foul trouble early on in the second
half, or what did you adjust to eliminate that?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, she really played well. And we were really happy when
she got that third foul and had to go out of the game, because we were having
trouble guarding. We were supposed to be fronting her. We never quite got
there. She was setting a lot of ball screens. We hedged a little bit too long.
We didn't get back in time. Our next plan was to double team her.  
She had a couple of times where she dribbled and we forgot to go down and
double. She played well. That's one of the best games she's had against us,
and certainly having her out of the game for seven, eight minutes was
important for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means to you and what it means to the program,
you're now 3 ‑0 against Connecticut, national semifinal games?   
COACH McGRAW: I don't really look at it that way because it's over such a long
span of time and they're a program that's here so often. It's nice to be able
to be a team that can actually beat them here.  
  
Q. I realize we're right after this game, but have you had any chance to
look at tape of the Baylor or Stanford? I know you've played Baylor this year.
We don't know who the outcome is going to be. But you're going to be playing a
good team regardless.  
COACH McGRAW: We're going to be playing a good rebounding team with good post
players. So we probably will have a similar game plan.  
But I've seen a little more of Baylor. Feel like they've been on TV a lot
more. Don't get to really see the West Coast games, can't stay up that late
during the tournament to watch them. So I'll be cramming, I'll be cramming
tonight for Stanford if they win.  
And just know that both of them, with Neka, Chiney and then Griner and Destiny
Williams, so many bigs inside. Our posts are going to have to be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, you know UConn so well at this point in the season. And you know
each other so well. Maybe there was an edge there with Skylar possibly
compared to UConn this year. Kind of abnormal for them not having that Maya
Moore or that player that you know when it's crunch time it's going in their
hands. It wasn't kind of that obvious person this year for UConn, but for you
guys, you have Skylar who was creating even when she wasn't scoring. Do you
think maybe that was kind of the edge in this game?  
COACH McGRAW: Oh, absolutely. I definitely think Skylar's the difference‑maker
for us. I think she does that. When you look at their team late in the game,
you wonder who they're going to go to.  
There was no question today it was going to be Dolson. I thought that was
pretty obvious from the way they were looking inside to her. And she really
stepped up.  
But I think when you have a team and you're not sure who is going to be the
one, it is a little bit difficult at the end of the game. So I think that was
an edge for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fighting character in your team, because you've
come back before from halftime deficits?  
COACH McGRAW: We have. We were down a few games this year, probably at
Hartford, came back in the last game of regulation.  
But they just don't quit. I think they just keep on going. They know they have
the confidence, they have the maturity, the poise, and that calm, that calm
that Brittany brings.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

Baylor  59  
Stanford  47

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Baylor, head coach Kim Mulkey, student‑athletes
Brittney Griner, Odyssey Sims, and Terran Condrey.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about the contributions from Terran and how
important that was for someone to step up and hit some outside jumpers?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: She's been hitting big shots all year. She's been key to us
winning big games, and she stepped up like a senior should and she hit big
shots for us.  
  
Q. Terran, Coach yesterday said something like if you guys win the national
championship, it's not going to be because of Brittney Griner, it's going to
be because of the team effort. Do you think under ‑‑ this was like exhibit A,
because you got so many contributions from so many different players today?  
TERRAN CONDREY: Yeah, I think so, because most teams double‑team Griner, so
they'll leave most people open, and we had to be ready to knock down the shots
in the game.  
  
Q. Brittney, to see Terran do that in that kind of moment, and also Jordan
Madden had some big shots in that second half, were you proud of them to see
them delivered like that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely. I was very proud to see Terran and all of them
step up and knock down shots. It's not the first time she had done this. She's
silent, but you hear her on the court.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about what Stanford did against you and they kept
you to your lowest field ‑goal output or‑‑ or tied with for the season, and
just was it a difficult night for you?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: I give credit to Stanford. They're a good team. They always
had two people on me or second offender come in try to double me. They stuck
with their plan the whole game. Frustrating. You get frustrated when your shot
doesn't go in.  
But I had all the confidence in my team. Like Coach said, it's not the
Brittney Griner show at all. My team stepped up and knocked down shots.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about just the overall frustration that whole first
half? Seemed like nothing was going right either team, both having trouble on
the offensive end and how you guys broke out of it about five minutes into the
second half?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just like we came out not as strong as usual. I felt like some
of us were a little nervous trying to get all the jitters out. But we didn't
come out strong. But going into halftime we knew we had to pick it up.  
  
Q. Odyssey, at the end of the game you threw the ball to the rafters. This
is where you guys have been pointed towards all year long to finally get to
this national championship game. What's the feeling?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It feels great that we're going to play on Tuesday. But, then
again, we haven't done that yet.  
  
Q. Can the athletes talk about whether you felt any effects from the
altitude up here? Does it make it harder for you or are you already so well
conditioned it doesn't really matter that much?  
TERRAN CONDREY: In my opinion, I think the altitude is terrible (laughter).
But I think that we are in good shape, though, as a team.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Altitude is very different from what we're used to. But I feel
like we're adjusting very well and we're not trying to show them that we're
tired on the court.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm with Terran on the altitude. But, I mean, we're in shape.
You just gotta push through it.  
  
Q. Brittney, there late in the game I saw you look over at the ref and it
was like kind of shaking your head, like: When are you going to call a foul?
Was this any more physical, though, than some of the games you've seen all
year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, not really. Just the ref was laughing, I was laughing.
Found it funny at the time.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you just talk a little bit about the matchup with Neka? And
you guys haven't played against each other in college at least. It's been a
long time. Can you talk about what that was like for you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I enjoyed it. It was a good matchup. She's a great player.
And it's been a while. We've both improved. And had to work on‑‑ first time
I've really had to work the whole night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said all year long that you can't win a national title with just
Brittney and Odyssey. This kind of proved it tonight?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, it did. We've seen multiple defenses throughout the year.
And I just thought Terran Condrey, she's a great shooter, a senior, and I
didn't hesitate to quickly insert her in the lineup. She can nail that shot
down. Jordan Madden can, too.  
But what we did better in the second half was we turned down the first look.
We were rushing the shot. We'd make one pass and we'd play right into
Stanford's hands and shoot the first shot that was open. And all you gotta do
is reverse the ball, be patient, let Griner still get touches, and you're
going to get the same shot next time across the floor.  
I thought we did a better job. But Griner does what she does. She draws a lot
of attention, and we're not a one‑dimensional team. Brittney Griner is the
face of women's basketball right now. And we embrace that. She deserves that
and it's great recognition for Baylor. But our team is not just Brittney
Griner.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jordan's ability to hit that shot, too. In the first half,
though, it wasn't really going down for her, but you did insert her back in
the game. What did you tell her?  
COACH MULKEY: Just keep shooting. Just keep shooting. If you're a shooter, you
gotta keep shooting. She made some and ones there late and didn't lose her
confidence. She got frustrated a little bit coming in and out of the game, and
competitors want to play and just keep playing. It's going to fall for you.  
And at the end I decided to go offense/defense with her and with Terran and I
just felt that they were challenged and they stepped up. Maybe not early in
the game. But it's going to fall for you. Just keep shooting it.  
  
Q. How is Destiny? Is she okay and will she be able to play on Tuesday?  
COACH MULKEY: Destiny?  
  
Q. Odyssey.  
COACH MULKEY: Odyssey, you're talking about the layup there when the trainer
went out on the floor? No one's hurt to my knowledge.  
  
Q. I had heard ‑‑ someone told me that Destiny had been injured too.   
COACH MULKEY: No. If she is, they haven't told me. Odyssey had a little cramp
there. I called a timeout so I didn't have to take her out of the game because
the trainer was on the floor. Had I not called the timeout, I would have had
to insert somebody to shoot the free throws for her.  
  
Q. Neka mentioned that Griner ‑‑ maybe psychologically playing Griner kind
of psyched her out a little bit. Do you think that's part of what Brittney's
built up over time, the fact that she's so good that it's almost a mental game
as well as a physical game?  
COACH MULKEY: I do. I do. Because the women's game we haven't seen the likes
of a Brittney Griner before. We've seen 6'8" and 6'9" players. We've seen
players that dunk it. But her presence on the defensive end‑‑ I've been around
the game since I was 18years old at this level. And I've never seen anybody
dominate on the defensive end, just her wing span and her presence.  
  
Q. I think the score was tied 31 ‑31, and then you went on a 15‑3 run. Was
there anything in particular that you were doing different during that one
span that kind of gave you the big lead?  
COACH MULKEY: No, we didn't change‑‑ well, we changed our defense a little
bit. We played a 2‑2‑1 zone back to a man, and one possession or two, I don't
know the time period, we went back to a 2‑3 zone. But we probably got some
easier baskets in transition through that period and just had some defensive
stops, got to the foul line.  
But it wasn't a magical thing that I did or called on either end of the floor.
I think just our patience paid off. I thought‑‑ one of the things that we
really stressed against Stanford that we did well is we kept them off the
offensive boards.  
When you have a Neka and Chiney, they're such athletes, if they don't score on
their first shot, they're usually getting putbacks, getting their team an
opportunity to score again. And I thought we battled with them and made sure
we eliminated their second chance points.  
Thought our defense was good. We held them late in the shot clock many times.
And I thought we got to the foul line.  
  
Q. Kim, on a night when Destiny was not shooting her best, just battled on
the boards, ten rebounds for her, can you talk about what she gave you?  
COACH MULKEY: I thought Destiny had one of her better defensive games.
Honestly, you tried to keep Griner inside. You may assign‑‑ you have Neka, you
have Chiney, but the truth is keep Griner in the paint as much as you can. And
I thought Destiny was active on who she was guarding, whether it was Neka or
Chiney.  
I thought she didn't let her offense or her inability to get many shots affect
what she was trying to do to help her team win. If that was blocking out and
getting the defensive rebound, she missed some free throws. And she never let
that affect her.  
So she makes her free throws, Destiny does what she's been doing, and that's a
double‑double.  
  
Q. I asked Odyssey about reaching the national championship game. Of course
she said it's great, we haven't accomplished anything yet. Did you love
hearing her say that?  
COACH MULKEY: Sure. You do. We're 39 and 0 and you're going to play for the
national championship. And they deserved to play for the national
championship. They've taken everybody's best shot. They've got a gimpy coach
up here that can hardly hear, see, or talk, yet they pull me through and pull
me along. And we'll be out there come Tuesday and we'll give it our best shot
again.  
  
Q. You said before that there's nobody that's come up with a new defense for
Brittney Griner. But it looked to me double teaming is certainly not novel.
But they were doing it a little bit differently tonight for the first half at
least, in that they had one player playing behind her and one in front to deny
her the entry pass, where Tennessee was playing to help the defender between
her and the post. Was that different and was that part of what held her
down?  
COACH MULKEY: No, it's not different. We have seen that. Jordan and Terran and
NaeNae have been challenged and they have seen that before. St. John's was
outstanding doing that to us. So it's not anything we haven't seen. And when
you think about it, if you knock those shots down early you take a big lead
quickly. And they've got to make some adjustments. But when you don't knock
those shots down early, you need to be more patient and make sure we continue
to get Griner touches.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2012

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Bria Hartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21837)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
Connecticut  75

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Geno Auriemma and student‑athletes
Bria Hartley and Stefanie Dolson.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Really not much that I can say. We put ourselves in the
position to win the game. That last two minutes, minute and a half of
regulation was pretty amazing.  
And as most games do, it turned on the one great play by a great player. And
then when we got into overtime, we just didn't have enough. They just made
some huge shots. We took a chance on making it difficult. But Brittany Mallory
made two huge shots, and that's who we wanted to shoot the ball. And, God
bless her, she stepped up and made shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Stefanie, you played the last (indiscernible) of overtime with four
fouls. Can you talk about your mindset of how you had to play that stretch?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I just know I had to stay as aggressive as I could without
fouling and just be smart, because I knew the team needed me in there to get
rebounds and make shots.  
And they did a pretty good job just staying aggressive but not fouling.  
  
Q. Bria, you guys are 0 ‑3 this year when you've given up 70 plus and Notre
Dame has done that twice. What do they do so well on offense?  
BRIA HARTLEY: They stay moving on offense. I think, even though we're familiar
with them, they stay active and they set a lot of screens. It's just us having
to talk to each other. They hit some tough shots.  
They were able to score. And they played a really good game tonight.  
  
Q. I was hoping you could just take us through the emotions of those final
two minutes. Coach Auriemma was kind of telling us about it already, but from
your guys' perspective as Kelly got those two steals and hit all those free
throws, what was it like from your guys' perspective?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I thought it was great. I thought we definitely had a lot of
momentum going for us. God bless Kelly, she was able to get that steal after I
turned the ball over. And I think it was just a lot of excitement, and we felt
really good going into that first overtime or whatever, but it didn't turn out
the way we wanted it to in the end.  
  
Q. Stefanie, could you talk about your offensive mindset, especially the
first half, you did a large part in carrying the team?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Well, I think Notre Dame did such a good job of being overly
aggressive with our guards that they had a lot of tough shots that they had to
make and knock down. So I just had to do a good job screening for them.  
That left me open to roll to the basket and got me easy layups. And towards
the end I knew I had to be as aggressive as I could to get our team points,
because we gotta give Notre Dame their defense a lot of credit; they did a
great job taking away a lot of things. And we didn't move around enough.  
  
Q. Bria, you guys have had great defense all year, team defense. You guys
held Skylar with only two points till late in the first half. And your
teammates were backing you up well, it seemed like. If she tried to drive,
they were there to stop her. Can you talk about how important it was in that
first half to not only how you were playing against her but the team in
general?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think a lot of it is our help when someone gets beat or
whatever, someone steps up and someone's able to stop them, and a lot of it is
just us talking and communicating on defense. Everyone did a really good job
of that in the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I think 19 turnovers in regulation time tonight, Notre Dame's
defense or just sloppy ball handling today?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's always a combination of both. Anytime you have that many
turnovers, the defense has a lot to do with it and you have a lot to do with
it yourself.  
We just were not very good offensively. And I can't tell you why, because
maybe the emotions of the game or maybe for some of our younger guys the game
was just too big for them, I don't know, but there was a lot of standing
around, and that's not like us. That's not how we play.  
  
Q. It seemed like the upperclassmen who all wanted to play well struggled
but the younger kids, like Stefanie, Bria, and Kiah, all played great. Could
you talk about what the younger kids brought to the table tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's awfully difficult. And a lot of the teams that have been
here before find that out that you're not going to come here and your freshmen
and sophomores are going to necessarily win national championships for you.
It's very difficult.  
And Kelly and Caroline and Tiffany struggled a lot. And it wasn't until the
last minute, minute and a half, that Kelly started making the plays that Kelly
normally makes.  
At the end of regulation, I think it was 67, right? Something like that? So,
again, you're not going to hold Notre Dame to much less than that, generally
speaking. So our defense was fine for the regulation for the first 40minutes.  
We just passed up too many opportunities. You can't do that against Notre
Dame. You can't come away empty handed. They're just too good. You can't give
them that many chances.  
  
Q. Your teams are so familiar with each other after playing so much this
year, last year. How do you think that affected this game and maybe ultimately
affected the outcome?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, what can I say? It was tough for them to get open shots.
It was tough for us to get open shots. There were stretches where our defense
dominated them. There were stretches where our defense let us down, or our
offense was clicking and then theirs was. It's basically the way all the games
have gone that we played them.  
We said going into this game somebody's going to make a couple of plays and
that's going to be the difference in the game. And if we had won in
regulation, the play that Kelly Faris made would have won the game. Instead
the play Natalie Novosel made maybe won the game for them.  
  
Q. Coach, you were down 4 in overtime. You called a timeout; come out of
that, you get a 30 ‑second violation, looked a little tentative. What were you
trying to do there? Did you think your team looked tentative at that point?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's another issue that popped up. That was a struggle
for most of the season. When we called that timeout, we knew we were going to
get a good shot, because we knew Kaleena or Bria was going to get a good shot.
The only problem is once we inbounded the ball and started dribbling,
dribbling and dribbling, then it just kind of deteriorated from there.  
And why? I don't know. We did things tonight that we haven't done in a long,
long time. And I don't have an explanation for it.  
  
Q. Geno, the rivalry will go on. But is there one thing right now, one play,
one moment, something that's really like kicking your butt right now that's
really eating at you about any one thing tonight that you're taking home with
you right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I would say probably the last play of regulation because
the game sometimes hangs on one play. Kelly steals the ball, misses the layup,
and then gets two free throws. If Kelly missed the layup and makes the one
free throw, we're up three instead of two. And that changes everything.  
I made a huge mistake of taking Kiah Stokes out of the game at that point. We
went with five guards so that we could switch all their screens. And in the
end a defensive rebound would have won it for us. That's the part I'm going
home with.  
  
Q. Can you take us through your mindset in the second half with Stefanie and
the foul troubles, when to take her out, when to put her back in, what you
were thinking there?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought Stefanie played great. And there was a lot of
talk on the bench among the coaching staff about when to bring her in, how
long to keep her out. But I felt as long as the game was within reach and it
wasn't more than four or five points either way that we could buy some more
time for her.  
And I figured somewhere around the six‑minute mark, seven‑minute mark we'd be
good to go. I thought Kiah Stokes was really good tonight. I thought she did a
lot of really nice things. And as long as she kept doing that we would be
okay. I'm really proud of our freshmen and sophomores. I thought they had
really, really good days today. And they learned a lot. This will be good for
them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Stanford, Tara VanDerveer and student‑athletes
Neka Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike and Toni Kokenis.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're thrilled to be here. Our team has worked really hard.
We have I think some outstanding talent on our team, but we have a specially
good leadership and I think team camaraderie. Everyone is working hard to have
a great game tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Neka, I didn't get a chance to grab you to ask you this the other day, so
I'll ask it now. Can you just articulate your emotions and feelings about the
final days of playing with Chiney in college?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think it's‑‑ right now everything is happening fast but
at the same time slow because I'm trying to soak in every moment. Not
everybody can say they played with their sister, and it's been a lot of fun.
Definitely some ups and some downs, but mostly ups.  
And I'm just really‑‑ I think it's kind of a bittersweet moment. We want to
play two more games, and I want to have two more games with my sister and also
my teammates.  
But I think it's also kind of‑‑ I'm kind of passing the torch on. It's her
turn to do her two years on her own like I did my first two years. I think
she'll do fine, just like all my other teammates. I look forward watching her
in the future. It's been a lot of fun, and I'm ready to have fun on Sunday.  
  
Q. Chiney, what kind of inspiration has your sister been for you and what
has she meant to this team?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In everything that's been done she set the bar extremely
high. Growing up I was like, How am I going to compare? In high school she was
doing great things, winning Gatorade Awards and College Player of the Year.  
She's setting the bar super high, but what I learned in this process is just
to work as hard as she does and try and fill in her footsteps, I'm going to be
in a good place.  
I'm excited for her. It's pretty bittersweet that this could be the last few
games of our run. It's been a long run. But it also has been a little too
long, you know what I mean?  
But I'm just excited. We've had so many memories. They stack up. And I'm
excited to see where her journey will go and where ours will, because I have
sisters on the side too.  
  
Q. What have you guys learned from the past Final Fours and the
disappointment that you can apply here this weekend?  
TONI KOKENIS: I think last year we learned that like we need to play for all
40minutes. We kind of let the game slip away from us at the end.  
Just really picking up our defense is something we're focusing on, and we've
kind of let down a little bit in the second half in our past Final Four games,
and teams have scored more than they should in the second half, which kind of
hurt us.  
So we're definitely focusing on defense and just finishing games and focusing
for all 40minutes.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I totally agree with Toni. I think also it kind of has a
lot to do with having fun, and our team is really good at having fun. And
we're also good at staying poised. We don't panic. I think that's a really
good quality for our team. But, most importantly, playing for 40minutes is
really what it's down to.  
  
Q. Neka, the other day you used words ‑‑ you talked about the last couple of
experiences here at the Final Four. You said two years ago you were
devastated. Last year it was really annoying, I think was the word that you
used, the way you guys finished up. So you're here now again and this is your
last chance at it. What is your‑‑ what is your feeling kind of going into
these last‑‑ potentially last two games, and how much do you want to get this
done?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Surprisingly enough, I'm very calm. I've been calm‑‑ I was
probably the most stressed maybe against South Carolina, I think. I don't
know. And I was also pretty nervous for the Hampton game.  
But coming into the Final Four, I'm kind of taking it one day at a time, one
minute at a time, enjoying the times I have with my coaches and my team.  
I'm not trying to go overboard and be too ecstatic, but I'm very happy. I'm so
grateful that I'm here. Grateful for the awards that have been given to me and
Chiney and all the girls participating in the Final Four, and I'm just
enjoying every moment. I got to catch up with friends at the banquet
yesterday.  
And it's kind of tranquil for me right now. I'm not even worried. And I know
when it comes down to it, when I step on to the court, I just go out there and
have fun and I play as hard as I can.  
  
Q. Brittney Griner mentioned something that she called sister instinct; she
sees you guys have an on ‑court connection, and I'm sure you do, which
supersedes what you might have with your other teammates. And can you talk
about that? And, Toni, can you talk about what you see with them on the court?
Thank you.   
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I'm repeating myself, but I talk about playing on the court
with Chiney is like playing with three teammates, not four. We kind of
understand each other's games. And when it comes to constructive criticism,
things are a little different when we communicate between each other.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: On her end.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: But she's responsive. And it's also mutual. She helps me
out as well on the court. And a lot of times‑‑ sometimes Tara doesn't need to
say anything to her because I've already said it to her. Kate jokes around and
says I should have a whistle.  
But it's been a lot of fun. And I know Chiney can attest to me yelling at her.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: It's not that big of a deal. It's more than the yelling. She
knows I hear her. I may not listen, but I hear her.  
No, all jokes aside, it's been great. I think the best example was last game,
coming down to the wire a team will be pressing us, and I take the ball out
and I know she will work her butt off to catch the ball. Little things like
that; that she's not looking to make herself look good, she's looking to help
me out.  
And it's just something like that that we've sort of spread that kind of
intuition with our entire team. We're very close. That's one of the things I
say the best quality of our team is our chemistry. And it's not even just on
the court, it's off the court.  
We don't really argue that much. We all understand each other. People's
viewpoints get out. I think that really helps us a lot just being able to
understand each other and to push each other.  
And it starts with Coach Tara. She's really helped us. She gives us criticism,
and we soak it in. She tells us what to do, and we try to do it to the best of
our abilities.  
And that's the sister instinct I think Brittney was talking about.  
TONI KOKENIS: Well, I can definitely tell as like a teammate, when we'll like
go to a huddle or something, and either somebody might have made a mistake,
and they'll kind of just look at each other, and like someone will start to
say something, and then the other one is like, I know. So they have a little
like silent kind of conversation.  
But it's more like just‑‑ like they said, the whole like sisterhood has kind
of infiltrated our whole team and we're all sisters, and it's from watching
them and seeing how helpful they are to each other.  
  
Q. The question of playing at Denver's altitude always comes up for teams
coming in here. The fact that you played in Boulder this year, does that give
you any indications of how difficult it is to play here?  
TONI KOKENIS: We definitely think it's to our advantage that we played here
earlier in the year. And it really didn't bother us the first time. So we're
very confident and comfortable playing at the altitude, however high up it is.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: About 280.  
TONI KOKENIS: The Mile High City. Doesn't bother us at all and we feel pretty
good.  
  
Q. Neka and Chiney, how would you describe Brittney Griner's development
over the last few years, and how difficult exactly is it to guard somebody
like that without getting in foul trouble?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I can't say that I've been watching every one of her games,
but I definitely think that since she came out in high school she's definitely
gotten better.  
I just mentioned this to someone earlier. She's not just big, she's athletic,
and she has skills, which makes that kind of a triple dagger. But it's going
to be a challenge, and I'm excited. I'm stepping up to it, and I know our
entire team is as well.  
It's going to be a collaborative effort. But I think that with the belief in
ourselves that we'll be just fine. If we follow our rules, Tara and the
coaching staff has done a really great job of helping us figure out our
defensive plan, but at this point I'm just‑‑ I was excited from Selection
Monday that Baylor was on our side, and I'm so happy we get to play them,
especially with me being a senior. I don't want to say that I didn't get to
play her before I left, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think growing up in Houston we were miles apart, Nimitz,
Cy‑Fair, and even Dulles with Kelsey Bone. So we grew up together. We played
in the same basketball tournaments. Funny we never ever played Nimitz High
School, but I always saw her play against Dulles and Kelsey. It was a nice
little circle we had supporting each other knowing that we had hopes of
playing DI.  
But just seeing how far she's come, I remember the first time I saw the
YouTube video, it was on the local news, I went to sleep that night and it was
like, The phenom that can dunk, and it was just dunking, but then to see her
game evolve and expand and going right, left, finishing outside of the paint,
it's been great because it shows how much people can develop in basketball.  
And it's going to be a challenge, definitely. And I think we're all excited.
The only way you can approach something like this is you're all in, we're all
in, and we're going to do to counter what she brings.  
  
Q. Neka, following up on the Griner question, one, are you still tranquil
when you look at film of what you're going to face tomorrow? And also what's
the bigger challenge, on the offensive end or defensive end, or are they
equal?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, I'm pretty calm. I mean, because it's film. I've
been doing this for four years. I know how film is. Granted at this point
we've been watching a lot of it. But it's still film. And I think the coaching
staff does a really good job putting together tape reels of what we need to be
focusing on.  
We don't just look at Baylor; we look at things we've done well in different
situations. And, I mean, watching the tape, it's going to be a challenge. But
I'm really excited.  
What was your second question?  
  
Q. Offense and defense.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think it's going to be‑‑ it's going to be more of a
challenge for us to focus on offense really. If you don't follow your rules on
defense, then things don't go your way. But I think our team is really good at
following our rules. We have to make sure we play hard and defend for
40minutes.  
It's actually funny that you ask that, because Coach Donnie Dawkins, our men's
team, they just won the NIT, congrats, and he was talking to us before we left
about how it's going to be all about defense, defense, defense.  
And I think our defense is something that a lot of people kind of look over.
We do a really good job following our rules, and our coaches do a great job
scouting and letting us know what we have to do, but offensively, especially
for a team like us where we're versatile, we can score inside and out‑‑ inside
game is obviously going to be very different. It's different for every team
that plays against Baylor.  
But I think the challenges that are posed on offense are going to prove that
our team knows how to concentrate and focus and we can play together and kind
of adjust and strategize against Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey said she really recruited you hard. Did you consider Baylor?
And what made you decide on Stanford?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I definitely did consider Baylor. Coach Mulkey, she's a
great coach. It was really fun getting recruited by her. I made a lot of, you
know, I guess you could say‑‑ not really unofficial visits, I would always go
up and watch the games because our high school team‑‑ it's only about a
three‑hour drive from my house.  
And ultimately I chose Stanford because I felt that‑‑ as hard as it was,
because Baylor's a good school and a drive away from my home‑‑ and I think my
mom really wanted me to go there, but she's happy I'm at Stanford now. Because
my mom likes being so close.  
But it was all about I think just the academics and the athletic demands that
the Stanford community really demands from different players and athletes and
students.  
But, most importantly, when I went there I couldn't think of another place to
go after meeting all the people that I had met. Whether it was Tara and the
coaches or my teammates, or even just students that came to greet me at the
football game. And I can say right now that was probably the one reason why I
went to Stanford. And I've met so many people.  
I can say I'm friends with Andrew Luck. Like that's really cool. And I know
Chiney really likes that, too. The students there are superstars. The
professors are superstars. The coaches are superstars, even though Tara
probably doesn't want me to say that. But it's just worldly people there, and
I'm very happy I made the choice to go to Stanford.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. If I could ask the same thing of you about the sister instinct and the on
‑court connection between them and I guess how it's been infiltrated
throughout the team and what's your observations of that.   
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that first you have when they play together, they
have played together so long that they can anticipate what the other person is
going to do. So you do have that sister factor on the court, just Xs and Os,
passes, screens, things like that. Like Chiney said, throwing a long pass to
Neka; she knew she was going and she was going to catch it.  
I think off the court‑‑ I noticed this right away when Chiney was on our team
with Neka‑‑ that other people look at them and you have a great player like
Neka and now a rising star like Chiney and you see how they treat each other,
how they talk about each other, and they have a great relationship. And that
sisterhood does permeate our team.  
And I think it's a wonderful thing and it's something that everyone on our
team‑‑ I've talked to Amber about‑‑ she's from Houston‑‑ being little sister.  
It's just a really, really fun group to be around, and the leadership and the
maturity that Neka provides and then Chiney and Jos and all the way down, it's
something really special.  
  
Q. A couple teams have come through here and they out ‑and‑out said up there
today: We're here to win a national championship. I feel like you guys are
downplaying that a little bit. Would that be accurate?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're all here for that. That seems kind of obvious. But
it's always one step at a time. It's always doing the little things right. So
we're working as hard as we can preparing our team for Game No.1, which is
Baylor. And there's no national championship without beating them.  
  
Q. Tara, Baylor has really had only three nailbiters all year. You've had
considerably more than that. Is there a problem for a team if this does get to
be a close game, not having had that experience and going down to the end, is
that a problem? Can that be a problem for a team that's got such great
expectations as Baylor?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't really know how to figure out‑‑ I concentrate on
Stanford. For us, we just‑‑ we try to prepare. We haven't had‑‑ we did have an
overtime game, which I'm thankful for, but not at the time, but I am now.  
But I just really try to focus on what we will have to do. And they present so
many challenges. There's a reason that they haven't had a lot of close games
because of all the great things they do.  
But if you're‑‑ I think our team coming in being confident, being loose,
knowing what we need to do and then just applying themselves to doing what
their job is, then that's all I'm going to ask for.  
  
Q. Tara, how do you compare your personal desire to win a third national
title compared to the one ‑‑ the desire to win your first one way back when?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think I realize how much harder it is. When we went the
first time in 1990 and won the Regional, I was happy. I just thought: This is
it; I don't need anything more. Then when we got to the Final Four, I'm like:
Wow, who knows if you're ever coming back and let's try and get it.  
We did win the first time, and then we've gone back several times, and it's
really, really demanding. A lot of things have to go right. And I look at
years that we've been with the last five years, and really getting to the
championship game in 2008 and we didn't really play that well in the second
half especially against Tennessee. But they took it to us.  
I think that we realized kind of there's a whole big difference between the
semifinal game and the final game, and then the next year we didn't have
really‑‑ I don't think we matched up really well with Connecticut that year
and they were on a mission.  
'10 was playing Connecticut in the championship game, and I think that game,
again, had‑‑ we had a good shot at halftime, and then they just had a little
run that got away from us. And then last year not getting the championship
game, we had an opportunity and just didn't‑‑ we didn't do what we needed to
do.  
So I think that the experience that all of our players have had, our staff has
had, you know, we want it as bad as anyone this year. Our team wants it as
bad. Our staff wants it as bad. We're working as hard or harder than anyone.
So we know we just have to do the right things.  
  
Q. Robert Griffin, III, is going to be here to support Baylor. I'm wondering
if you've been able to convince Andrew Luck to come?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I haven't made the effort. Maybe John Elway. He might be in
town. I'd take him.  
  
Q. Would you agree with Neka's assessment that defense is the key to the
game in terms of that that's going to be ‑‑ that offense is going to be more
of a challenge that you guys are going to be locked down on, do you think?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's an equal challenge. I think it's an equal
challenge of how to defend them. And then she, Brittney Griner, is a
game‑changer. There's no two ways about it. She impacts the game at both ends
of the court. She's a phenomenal player. And she has improved so much.  
And they just‑‑ and they know‑‑ they know how to use her. So I think it's
going to be equally challenging for us at both ends of the court.  
  
Q. You sort of just started to touch on this, but in terms of attacking
them, where would you try to attack them offensively? Because they really are
athletic and long in almost every position.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think you're going to have to wait and watch tomorrow. But
we do have an idea. Our team is focused on specific things, what to do and
what not to do. And we have the benefit of watching, for the most part, 30 of
their games and really watching and seeing what things work and what things
don't work.  
  
Q. Can you put into words, Coach, what Neka has meant to this program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I could put them in words, but you don't have enough paper
and ink to print them all. I'll give you an idea. When we signed Neka, I had
two new assistants, Bobbie Kelsey and Kate Paye and then Amy Tucker had been
at Stanford. And I bought each one of them a GPS. I said, We're going in the
right direction.  
It's like she is an amazing young woman. She's improved so much from her
freshman year until now, and she will continue to improve. But more than that,
she's a solid person. How many coaches can say they've coached someone for
four years and they've never had one minute of getting upset with them, being
mad at them, having to have a parent‑‑ or coach/player or daughter word with
them.  
She's just outstanding. And it's why you coach. Everyone's out there looking
for a player like Neka, and she's sitting right next to me.  
  
Q. GPS, you bought one for Neka or ‑‑  
COACH VANDERVEER: The coaches. Neka, I'd be in trouble with. For Amy, Kate,
and Bobbie. That was in the old days before they had them on your phone.  
  
Q. Knowing you, assuming that you've got a plan that you're comfortable
with, and I'm wondering if that's the case, and how confident you are that the
guys can go out there and execute it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I was asked this already maybe by some that might be in this
room. But, yes, we do have a plan. And now the question is will we be able to
execute the plan. Thinking of the plan is a lot easier than executing the
plan.  
But I have a lot of confidence in our team. And I feel the same way Neka does.
We're very excited about this game. We love the challenge. We love to put the
puzzle together. This is a really, really different puzzle to put together,
playing against someone that's 6'8" that has 199blocks or against Odyssey Sims
who has 114 turnovers.  
I don't know that we've‑‑ we've played against a team one year that had three
All‑Americans, which was Connecticut. We played against talent before. But
this is a very talented team, top to bottom.  
And we know we're going to have to do the right things, and that's‑‑ I think
that that's what we've worked hard for all year. This is what we work hard all
summer and all fall to, who is going to box out tomorrow? Who is going to get
on the floor? Who is going to take a charge?  
So this will be the questions that, if I'm sitting up here happy, two days,
it's because we did those things. And if I'm not, then we didn't do those
things.  
  
Q. Baylor's favored tomorrow. And you're not underdogs very often and you're
probably underdogs in at least three of the four previous Final Fours.
Psychologically, do you do anything with the kids to kind of prepare them to
play a team that is considered superior than you guys?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yes. I mean, I think it's true. I don't think we go into so
many games where we're expected to win, and as Baylor does and as Connecticut
does and as Tennessee or Notre Dame, but we go into games where we're expected
to win and then even if we win by 20, that wasn't good enough.  
But this game, there might not be anyone in this room besides me that thinks
we are going to win. So we do some special things.  
  
Q. To ask the question about strategy in a different way. The teams who have
had relative success against Baylor, what have they been able to do?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think they've controlled the tempo. The scores are
low. They understand if your 5'7'' guard goes in against Brittney Griner she's
going to need a toothpick to pick out the leather from her teeth. They
understand certain things they're not going to change.  
I told our team: This is not a game to show me your macho move to the basket
against Brittney Griner. I don't need it.  
I told our team: We have to do what we're good at. Don't show me something
I've not seen before. Don't come out with if you've not made a 3 all year I'll
need to see it now.  
But I do think we study‑‑ I mean, it's really fun, I love it, we study what
people do against us, we study what they do against them. And if there are
things, there might be just things that maybe Odyssey Sims doesn't get as many
steals, maybe Brittney doesn't get as many blocks. And we try to look and see
tendencies. And with the technology that we have now, we can watch a lot of
stuff, and I do.  
  
Q. Texas Tech played them twice within 10 and seemed to sort of press out
the floor ‑‑  
COACH VANDERVEER: In fact, beat them last year.  
  
Q. They seem to try to sort of milk the clock before the ball could get
inside to ‑‑ I'm not sure if I'm saying that correctly.   
COACH VANDERVEER: I've watched that. That didn't get lost on me. We have to
study. And I'm sure they've studied games that were close for us, too. But we
have to play within ourselves. We have to have a plan that fits Stanford. We
can't say, well, Texas Tech did this and now we're going to do that. We have
to look at what they did, and we have to say, well, what do they do that fits
us and our personnel.  
As much as it's hard‑‑ who has Baylor played against that's like Neka? As hard
as it is to play against someone like Brittney Griner, and it is, who is going
to guard Neka? She's got a pretty versatile game.  
  
Q. Been doing it for a long time. You've gone against a lot of great
players, and Neka mentioned it several times, the rule that you guys have told
her to follow. Are you in a different page of the rule book in dealing with
Brittney Griner? And she kind of downplays if she's changing the game, but I
know the game has changed, in general, but is she changing it even more so?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Neka is talking about things like our team gets the fact
that we aren't here unless people do what they're supposed to do. We're not a
roll‑the‑ball‑out team where you can go out and take any shots you want or
decide if you want to sprint back on defense.  
What Neka means by following rules: We have to sprint back on defense. Box
out. We have to do the little things. If you're going to set a screen, set a
screen. Can't be ships passing in the night.  
So for us to be successful, to me, it's everyone being, as kind of Chiney
said, all in. It's not being a weak link. Not someone not doing what they're
supposed to do. Not knowing the scouting report. We do like written quizzes of
scouting reports in walkthroughs. So maybe our approach is a little bit
academic, because that's why I'm coaching the kids I do.  
I think that's all Neka meant by following the rules. Because we talk about
things: This is where you need to be on this play; these are the things you
need to do.  
And we're being‑‑ basketball to me is not rocket science. We have to defend
well. We have to score well. We have to rebound well. And through all that,
you know, I can't be blowing my top at people, and our kids have to have fun.  
And we're thrilled to be here, and we're really looking forward to tomorrow
night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Kim Mulkey, student‑athletes Destiny
Williams, Odyssey Sims and Brittney Griner.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, obviously you were here two years ago, and you guys have
maintained a very intense focus all year. Is it hard once you get in this
environment to keep that going?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, because you see the prize at the end. It's right there.
So it's not hard at all.  
  
Q. If you could each take this one on, can you just talk about the sisters
over at Stanford and what kind of matchup they present? And, Brittney,
specifically can you talk about how remarkable that you and Neka have not
really met in college basketball and how much you're looking forward to that
matchup?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Looking forward to it a lot. I haven't seen Neka or Chiney
since high school, since summer ball. They play remarkable together. That
sister instinct for each other on the floor at high/low. We're going to have
to guard them and keep them off the guards.  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: We expect a good matchup. They have two outstanding post
players; we have a bunch of outstanding post players. It's going to be a great
matchup. I think it's going to come down to who rebounds the ball well. Both
posts will get great touches and finish around the rim. It's going to be an
exciting game.  
  
Q. Brittney, Neka told us that you had played against her in an AAU game
somewhere around her junior year, and she said that her team ‑‑ that your team
won. What are your recollections of that game?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was a good game. I mean, it was just a good matchup. Me
and her going back and forth. I can't wait to do it again.  
  
Q. Brittney, how much are you aware that you are changing the game of
basketball and so many people before you, post players in particular, said
nobody's been like you before and you're changing the way the game's being
played?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, I wouldn't really say I'm changing it. I'm just
adding on to what great players before me have added on. And I know there will
be somebody there that comes along and do something I couldn't do and add on.
And that's the thing about it. Just keep adding on to the game.  
  
Q. Brittney, several coaches, particularly Coach Blair at Texas A &M says he
thinks you're the greatest woman's player of all time. You would need rings
and championships to validate that. Do you feel that kind of pressure in terms
of already being listed as one of the best ever and winning a championship?
How important is that to solidify you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't feel any pressure really. I kind of tune out
everything. And I know this year that's been the main focus, though, winning
the national championship. That's just what's driving me right now.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you talk about is it a little more exciting ‑‑ you're at the
Final Four; it's plenty exciting, but is it more exciting to play a Stanford
team you guys don't know? It's a new matchup for both teams from the past few
years.   
DESTINY WILLIAMS: It's exciting to play against a team you haven't seen all
year. It will be a great matchup. Stanford will do some things to try to
score, and we're going to do some things to score and turn out a defensive
rebounding.  
They are coached by a great coach, and we have a fantastic coach. So it's like
an even matchup. And it's going to be an exciting game for women's basketball,
for people to watch, and go out for a win.  
  
Q. Destiny, do you see much difference in the two sisters' game and on
Stanford? Are they pretty similar? Do you see many differences in them?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Neka has more experience than the younger sister. She's the
leader on that team. She's just helping her sister out to become a phenomenal
player like she is. And Neka has improved her shooting to her skills, and
Chiney is just more of an offensive rebounder, close‑to‑the‑basket‑type post,
and Neka extending her game, working on her 3 shooting.  
It's a little different, but pretty much hustle plays. They're the same about
that.  
  
Q. Destiny and Odyssey. Destiny, everybody's asking Brittney a lot of
things, but you have to ‑‑ you guys practice together. How would you stop her
and how difficult is the play against her in practice?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Well, she has a very, very, very, very long arm. So‑‑
(laughter)‑‑ so it is hard to get a shot off over her. But she helps us out a
lot to get our shots off quicker, to go around her and try to finish the
contact.  
There's a lot of things. You have to take off the dribble, because you're not
going to post up and score over her. Just things like that. And being more
physical towards her.  
She helped us out a lot in our game only to make us better players.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you're considered one of the best point guards in the country.
And Stanford been considered having trouble with the speed of somebody like
you. What do you expect from them and can they do anything to slow you down?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I just expect it to be a very physical game. It's going to be
battles for the boards for our post players. As far as guard player. And use
our speed and quickness and score and get the ball inside as much as possible.  
  
Q. Destiny and Odyssey, how do you guys turn out the 40 ‑0, the chasing that
and just concentrating on one game? You guys are chasing this 40‑0, this
pinnacle there. How do you tune that out and just go after one game at a
time?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: We haven't accomplished anything yet. Our goal throughout
the year was to win the championship. And once we get that, I think that we
all will be satisfied. 38 ballgames are great to have, and not to have our
loss is an honor and accomplishment to have along the way, but they're just
wins. And we have the trophy, something we can enjoy bigger and better.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: As far as what she said, it's the main thing to have a national
championship. And I see here we're 0‑0, we haven't won anything, nobody's won
anything, and we're all here‑‑ we all have the same goal, and hopefully we'll
just come out on top.  
  
Q. Odyssey, what's your mindset on the defensive end, especially when it
comes to on ball defending, can you take us inside what you're thinking about
when you're defending?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Pressure to the ball, that's pretty much it. I don't really have
anything that goes through my mind. I just try to pressure my defender as much
as possible and create a turnover.  
  
Q. Brittney, I don't believe you fouled out of a game since early in your
freshman year. With all your blocked shots, with all the physical play you
have inside, how have you managed to avoid foul trouble on a consistent basis?
What have you learned along the way?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just playing smart, trying to keep my body away. Really don't
need to body them up and block a shot. Like Destiny just said, I have very,
very, very, very long arms and I can reach around to block shots.  
  
Q. Brittney, you've always maintained that you wanted to go back to Baylor
for your fourth year. Why was that so important to you? And, secondly, not too
many college players make the U.S. Olympic Basketball Team. How much would it
mean to you to be part of the Olympics this year if you're chosen?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, as far as me leaving, I'm staying. I made a commitment.
I said I was coming here, and I'm going to stay here until my time's up. So
all the speculations of me leaving early are false. I'm staying here right
here at Baylor.  
COACH MULKEY: Could you say that a little louder? Because some of these keep
wanting to keep talking about it. Some want to keep writing about it. Would
you just repeat that slowly.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Baylor is my home. I'm staying here. I made a commitment. All
the speculations are false. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here.  
  
Q. Brittney, if you could talk a little bit about how Destiny Williams has
fit in with the program and what she contributes.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Destiny is, based on the boards, double‑doubles all the time
and there's always rebounds. I know if I don't get a rebound I can always
count on Destiny. She works well in the post with me and finding me and
letting me find her. She's knocking down shots at the top which help get the
defender off, second or third defender off me, and she's my other post player.  
  
Q. What would it mean to you to represent the country in the Olympics, being
a college player?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: As any basketball player, it's a dream to represent your
country, put on the U.S.A. jersey. So it would mean a lot, you know?  
  
Q. Odyssey, when we were still in Waco, you said you don't think you'll
really get excited for the Final Four until you get here. Now that you're
here, what's the experience been like thus far? What's been the coolest thing
that you've been able to do?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Well, it's been fun. We had a busy day yesterday. I can say the
Salute Dinner thing that was really fun. And that was like an experience many
people don't get to experience.  
And having fun. It's great for my team. We've been bonding. So we just are
getting ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brittney, does the sisters ‑‑ does their leaping ability make this maybe
a unique matchup for you this year in terms of who you match up with inside,
their ability to jump?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Like you said, they've got a great leaping ability. Gotta box
them out. When the shot goes up, you gotta find them. And we got leapers on
our team, too. So it will be a good matchup.  
  
Q. Odyssey, I'm not sure how many other sophomores were out there, maybe one
other one. What was it like to be part of that 10 ‑personteam, to stand out
there with those 10 players? And also Destiny talked about it, but being this
close to the end, how exciting is that?   
ODYSSEY SIMS: To be out there with the older girls, it's something special.
I'm one of the top 10 players in the country, it's a great experience, but
that's not my main focus. I'm here to win two basketball games. And we are
very close.  
And, like I said, just trying to stay focused and prepare as much as possible
and go in tomorrow with one mindset, and that's to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You have a lot of ex ‑players here today watching and enjoying the
moment. One in particular, Jessika Stratton. She's going to be coaching here
in Colorado Springs or in Colorado, actually, at Colorado Christian. Is there
any advice you would give to her as far as her future of pursuing coaching?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't need to give Jessika any advice. Jessika played for me
when I was first hired at Baylor, and Jessika was just an all‑out gutsy
gym‑type player. Gym rat. She was always in the gym.  
She's one of the finest Christian kids you'll ever be around. She will be a
great role model for her student‑athletes. And she was involved in a very
difficult game. She had the turnover when we lost to Tennessee with 2/10 of a
second on the clock. And I learned more from Jessika Stratton in that locker
room not being a very good coach toward her at the end of that game, and I've
written about it in my book and the type of person she is, she never took it
personal.  
So I have the utmost respect and admiration for her, and she will be great.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ‑‑ if you could give us an update on how your health is
and how the inflammation is at the moment?  
COACH MULKEY: Don't ask me to smile. And I think the distortion of the face is
mild compared to cases I have seen before.  
The biggest problem I'm having is my eyes. The light bothers me. The tears and
the dryness and itchiness they say is all a part of it. And my ears. I feel
like one ear is blown out and I can't tell if the other one is hearing or if
it's just off balance.  
As far as the distortion or whatever you want to call it of the face, hell,
I'm just another ugly coach (laughter). It is what it is. And I'm not vain, so
it doesn't matter.  
  
Q. Along the lines of what I asked Destiny, a lot of people might be excited
about this matchup with Stanford because it's something new, not something
we've seen this season or in the last few years. Are you excited about a
matchup against a team you haven't seen very often?  
COACH MULKEY: I have something to compare it to. I guarantee you Notre Dame
and Connecticut don't enjoy playing each other four times, but the good thing
is they're doing it at the Final Four. Yes, I would much rather play teams
that you don't know so much about.  
It's exciting for us because I don't think we've played Stanford since Neka
was a freshman. I'd have to go back and make sure I'm not overmedicated and
forgotten something here.  
But, yeah, it's exciting to play somebody different. We are familiar with
Stanford. I recruited all three of those Houston kids. And these kids, Odyssey
and Brittney and Brooklyn Pope, they've gone head to head in some serious
competition in the summer between the two organizations. So they're all
familiar with each other.  
  
Q. On the health thing. You said the lights. When you're ‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: Like right now it bothers me.  
  
Q. On the court, how is it?  
COACH MULKEY: It's not as bright. The only thing that bothered me on the court
was the band when I was on that end. My ears feel like they're about to
explode. I'm sure some referees feel that way when I get in their ear.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. Are you going to ask the band not to play as much?  
COACH MULKEY: Are you kidding me? I'm going to let that band rip it. Go for
it.  
  
Q. The same question asked Brittney: Do you feel the same pressure coaching
a player with such national/international acclaim in terms of her greatness?  
COACH MULKEY: Not at all. Not at all. And I want to say this to all of you:
Don't ask her about the Olympics when you go talk to her. That's a non‑issue.
She's kind of surprised that the Olympic team was even announced at the
college Final Four. Her focus is a national championship.  
Brittney is a blessing every day I go to work. Because so many great ones that
are as good as she is and have done more than she has done, you don't enjoy
coaching them sometimes because they know they're good and they don't work
hard and they have an attitude about them that they're better than everybody
else.  
When I'm done with Brittney Griner, the thing I'll tell people is: That child
brought her workpail to work every day. She brought it every day to practice.
She never had a bad day in practice.  
Her worst days were just missed shots or she thought she should have done
something better. But she brought her game to the floor every day.  
  
Q. Brittney mentioned a sister instinct that she sees. Do you see that they
have a communication on the court that maybe supersedes what you usually see
between teammates?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, she may be referring to the fact that the longer you play
with someone, you instinctively know things about each other and where they
want the ball, what their next move is.  
And obviously when you're sisters, you probably have played lots of basketball
together. And I would think that they do have that sisterly instinct in that
they played together all their lives.  
  
Q. That focus that has marked the season for you guys, have you seen it
sustained through this time since getting to Denver?  
COACH MULKEY: I just told them at half court that that hour of practice was‑‑
of course you're not out there showing your hand on anything. It's more for
the fans. But I saw a focused basketball team. I saw a team that came and
they're enjoying being out there. But at the same time, they focused on
finishing, shooting.  
Look, it's beyond coaches now. The coaches have gotten each of their teams
here. It's now in the players' hands. It's now players making plays.  
The big stage is when the big‑time players surface. It's not about coaching at
this point.  
  
Q. Kim, with as much focus on the post area with Neka and Brittney and them,
could it be a game decided by the back court? And then kind of off that
question, because of the type of post players they have, could Brooklyn play
even more in that rotation?  
COACH MULKEY: I think Brooklyn Pope's game is very similar to the Ogwumike
sisters. Brooklyn is our‑‑ you call it highest leaper, or she jumps higher
than anybody on our team.  
Brooklyn could dunk the basketball if her hands weren't so small. Yes, she
could be a factor in the game. But she's been a factor in the last several
games for us. So I anticipate her to be able to help Destiny and B.G. down
there.  
As far as the back court is concerned, I think our strengths, honestly, other
than Brittney Griner covering a lot of space down low, it's our perimeter
defense. I think our perimeter defense is pretty special. And it starts with
Odyssey Sims, NaeNae Hayden and Jordan Madden.  
  
Q. When evaluating the season and looking back up to this point, are there
any moments that stand out for you where had they gone a different way you
either may not be here or the season would have gone differently?  
COACH MULKEY: That moment was not this year. It was when we lost in the
Regional Finals in Dallas last year and those kids came back to summer school.
And obviously we can't be with them during the summer. But I just felt that
our strength and conditioning coach, who was with them all summer, and the
leadership that came back, the disappointment, the hunger, all that was taken
care of this summer.  
I thought team chemistry was a missing link last year, not that we didn't have
a team that didn't get along, but we had a freshman trying to lead a
basketball team to a Final Four. We had our best player just a sophomore. We
had our senior, our captain, our leader, our glue, playing with one eye.  
The timing of Melissa Jones' injury honestly cost us. And that's not to take
anything away from Texas A&M, because they just beat us. But I sure can't
afford to go into a big game like that when your glue and really your leader
is struggling to even stay on the floor because of her injury, let alone worry
about leading a basketball team.  
I thought last year's game just is the only game that I could tell you sent a
message to themselves. You can go one direction or you can go the other.  
  
Q. Shanay Washington obviously not going to play with her fourth ACL. What
has she added to the team in the time since the injury a month or so ago? And
I noticed she's here. Does her spirit help the guys in any way?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Shanay Washington was a starter for us as a freshman. She
and Griner were two of our players that started. That's how much I think of
her talent. And for her to have another knee injury. She has a decision to
make at the end of the year to either give up the game, medically have the
surgery, do I even have the surgery if I'm going to give up the game. There's
lots of things that I'm sure she's thinking about.  
But here's what I do know: She's a part of this team. She'll always be a part
of this team whether she can play again or not. She'll travel with us. And
whatever she's allowed to do, she will do. We have brought her along, and if
she's got a uniform on and we're playing for that championship and we're way
ahead and there's an opportunity to put her on that floor, I'm going to look
at her and say: Do you want to go step out there? That's how much I think of
Shanay Washington.  
  
Q. It's great to hear you sound so positive about what you're going through.
Can you talk about how important that is to maintain a positive attitude with
everything that's going on?  
COACH MULKEY: Listen, the alternatives are worse. Bell's palsy is fixable.
Bells palsy with time will get better. This is just a‑‑ I guess you call it a
little bump in the road.  
I can assure you the spit that will fly out of my face in a timeout won't faze
them. Or the spit that will come out of my mouth, they'll understand what I'm
saying.  
It's really nothing. It hasn't affected them. It hasn't affected me. It
aggravates me. It aggravates me, but there are worse things in life. And you
just deal with it. Kidney stone would hurt a lot worse than this. Having a
baby didn't hurt near as bad as a kidney stone. You deal with it.  
Every male in here needs to have a kidney stone. It's the closest thing to
child birth for y'all, so y'all need a kidney stone.  
Go ahead. Didn't mean to distract you.  
  
Q. How did Odyssey play in that game against A &M in that Regional Final?
And if she didn't play well, how does that sort of affect this season by
coming back and playing?  
COACH MULKEY: Odyssey Sims didn't play well at all. She will be the first one
to tell you. But you have to have a short memory in this business, but yet
inside you you have to have that competitive spirit that drives you.  
And I can assure you she's a different basketball player today than she was a
year ago. The talent was there a year ago. But she's more experienced. She has
really grown both in her mental makeup of how to handle it at this level, both
constructive criticism, both the understanding of what's on your shoulders as
a point guard on a basketball team, but she was awful in that game. And she
would tell you that.  
  
Q. Are you pretty confident in your ability of your team's ability to handle
a close game if it's tight down the stretch?  
COACH MULKEY: What choice do I have? You know, we've all been in tight games,
all four teams have been in blowouts to get here. I just feel like every day
in practice our competition within the team makes us better. There are many
days when Brooklyn Pope's on the other team and Terran Condrey is on the other
team with the other players that don't get as many minutes, they beat our
first team.  
And they don't like that. It becomes real heated and sometimes I have to call
it off, because it really gets physical and sometimes you like that and
sometimes you don't want it to be blown out of proportion.  
But I don't know that I'm going to coach any better if it's tied or if I'm not
going to coach good or make the wrong call.  
Everybody here is trying to win a national championship. And those that make
plays are going to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Muffet McGraw and student‑athletes
Skylar Diggins and Brittany Mallory.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, after eight times in 14months, is there anything about UConn
that you don't know, and do you think there's anything about them about you
guys that they don't know?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Not really. Like Coach said, there's no mystery left.
There's not going to be any surprises. It's all about heart, who is going to
play the hardest, who is going to execute and play well.  
  
Q. Skylar, along those lines, is it good or bad that you know this team
inside out; they know you guys inside out? Maybe for the Final Four you come
in prepared, but you already know everything about them?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Like Brittany said, it's a matter of execution now. We watched
them over and over, and I'm sure they have done the same, and now it's just a
matter of can we stop those plays that we know they're going to run, can they
stop our plays, who is going to get more hustle‑back plays, 50/50 balls,
rebounding, stopping them in transition, and just executing our offensive and
defensive game plan.  
  
Q. Skylar and Brittany, because of the frequency that you played UConn,
would you consider them your biggest rival?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Within the Big East, I would say so. We've played each other
so many times, it's been No.8 in the past two years. I mean, there's a lot of
heart between these two teams, when we go out, we just want to play hard and
win and come out on top. And every time you match up with them, you know it's
always going to be a battle.  
So it's become a rivalry.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about what the focus of the deciding factor was the
last time you guys played Connecticut?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Hustle plays. Those hustle plays. They kept balls alive. They
got offensive rebounds. Second‑chance points. Transition. Just hustle plays
for them. They outhustled us.  
  
Q. Can you speak about what it would mean to have Kayla McBride playing this
time around?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's been great having her back in the NCAA Tournament. Last
year we could have used her, and this year it's just been great. She's
contributing so much offensively, defensively. She does whatever Coach or the
team needs. And she's just really become a great player this year, and she's
really matured a lot. And we're glad to have her back.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Like Brittany said, she brings a lot to the team. Offensively,
her ability to create her own shot, her ability to guard the 4. And like
Brittany said, she does whatever the team needs.  
It's going to be good having her because I feel like she's the X factor.  
  
Q. What would you guys say has been the most important moment this year
where maybe if things would have gone a different way you wouldn't have been
here?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I don't know. I have to say when we lost to West Virginia. It
kind of was an eye‑opener for us. Definitely humbled us a lot. We've been on a
roll. In the Big East, I think it shows that you can't overlook anybody or
underestimate anybody. And that's what happens.  
We played a lot of good teams, a lot of tough games. I think that one really
made us turn it up. And we had close games. I think a lot of games do that. So
I think we had more drive after we lost to Baylor. I think we had close games
with Duke and just a lot of good teams that we played.  
  
Q. Have you guys ever experienced playing one team so many times like in
high school or AAU? And, if you have, how did that inform you as to what
you're going to experience tomorrow?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I personally haven't played a team that many times in any
season or AAU or anything. And it's just something that it's going to happen
when you play them twice in regular season and then you play them again in the
Big East Tournament.  
We just so happen to be on their side in the NCAA Tournament. So there's not
really much to expect. Just you gotta go out and play hard and just kind of
hope for the best outcome.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Brittany said it all.  
  
Q. How do you explain the success that you've had against UConn over the
last two seasons?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I think in previous years it was almost like they had Maya
Moore, and it was a lot‑‑ they were a great team. And once we beat them last
year in the Final Four, we kind of realized‑‑ it was an eye‑opener for us‑‑
that we can play with this team.  
We have just as many good players as them. And we can play with them. And
after we won last year, just kind of opened our eyes for us this year and just
realized that we're not playing anybody special. It's just another game,
another team, and we can really play with them.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think sometimes a lot of people get lost in the history of
the program and the jersey and that can intimidate you right away. I think
this team, the past previous games especially, we haven't been intimidated.
And no Maya Moore helps that out too.  
  
Q. A couple of days ago Kalana Greene was saying when UConn players come to
Connecticut they come with an inherent dislike for Notre Dame and playing
against Notre Dame. Do you guys come to Notre Dame with the same feeling about
playing Connecticut, and how necessary is that to ensure inspiration and
competitiveness in a game?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I think you come to any school you go to wanting to beat any
other school. You don't necessarily have to like the school, because you go to
beat them. That's your goal. You go to win a season, a regular season, Big
East championship.  
So I don't really know how else to say that. But you're not going to go and be
best friends with them on the court. And afterwards, like Sky and them, they
played U.S.A. ball together, and they're going to have friendships.  
But when it comes down to it, you're there to beat the other team.  
  
Q. What kind of community service do you do and how do you manage your time
between basketball and community service? And as a coach, how are you involved
in your community?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: We do a lot of community service. Our team‑‑ we're out at
the homeless shelters at elementary schools reading to the kids, trying to get
out there as much as possible, because our fans really give a lot to us and
they support us so much so we're trying to give back to them.  
And with schoolwork, it's tough being on the road and practice and trying to
get out in the community. It's a lot to handle. But you have great advisors
and a support staff that will help you kind of manage your time.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think it's important, especially being from South Bend, just
to get out there. And with women, I think we're so much more available than
men, if that makes sense to you. Just being able to get out there and just let
them know, look, you have role models, you have people that want to help you
out.  
And just being involved in the community is important, and Notre Dame has
always done that, when I was young and Coach McGraw would bring the team
around, till now.  
  
Q. When is the last time you guys either collectively or individually
watched footage of the last year's title game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Never.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I haven't. I only watched the game personally once.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I watched the game last week, played it last week or something
like that. Me and Dev caught the beginning of it. But I haven't watched the
full game either.  
  
Q. What classes are you taking?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Brit doesn't take class anymore. She's a seventh‑year senior
(laughter).  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I graduated already. I was a management entrepreneurship
major. I'm just taking some‑‑ a light class load.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I'm the same major as Brittany. Graduated in business
management with a focus on entrepreneurship. So strategic management, process
analytics classes, like the fun classes.  
  
Q. I was wondering, what advice would you give a 13 ‑year‑old if she wanted
to become a basketball player?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: First and foremost you've got to focus on school. You can't
get to any college really without good grades. You've got to stay in school
and really study and just try to get as many camps and play with as many
people as you can all the time, day and night. It's really about repetition
and practicing.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I agree with Brittany. Practice makes perfect. If you're
serious about it, get in the gym. Don't have to go to the gym with somebody.
Get to the gym. Get a basketball, dribble outside; get a tennis ball, dribble
in the house. That's what I did. My mom didn't like it too much.  
But you just practice. And you set your mind to it, and you can do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It seems when UConn lost to you guys in the last game of the regular
season, they were disoriented and sort of lost. But then they found themselves
and they've been on a run ever since. You guys lost to them in the Big East
Tournament Final, and then that was sort of running through and got refocused.
Did that game help you guys? A loss is never good, obviously, but did it help
you get the team ready and make the run back at the NCAAs?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it did help us in some ways. I don't think refocus is
maybe the word with this group, because I think they're pretty focused.  
But I think coming off a loss, you just get a little hungrier. I think it
definitely motivated us to get back in the gym, work hard, and just prepare
for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Having seen all three games, Natalie Novosel got to the line like 10
times, 11 times the first two games, and only twice in the third game. And I
know she initiates contact so often as she brings it into the lane. What do
you see there? Because there's such a free ‑throw disparity to that third
game. What do you tell her or what does she expect of herself as far as
getting the calls? It seems to be such a key part tomorrow night.   
COACH MCGRAW: It's a big part of her game. And she's really good at it. She's
been good at it in just about every game. In that last game she was in foul
trouble. And she didn't play quite as much and that probably had some impact
on it, because when you get two fouls in the first half you get a little
tentative. I'm guessing that's what happened to her in the third game.  
But it is her game. She can really drive the ball. She can shoot it. And
getting to the line is a big part of how she scores.  
  
Q. Would you focus, in particular, on any of the three games this year and
can you give us a sense of just how much game tape you will have watched of
those three games knowing obviously that you know their roster very well
already?  
COACH MCGRAW: We focused on the last one. It was the best one to see. I would
watch clips of it right before practice, just so I was in practice in a good
frame of mind, to really get out what we could from the team. And we showed
them a lot of clips about that, too.  
The assistants watch a lot more film of other games. I focused on ours and was
able to watch a few of those games. But really I didn't watch the game at
home. That was too long ago. I think they're a much different team now. So
really focused on the last two.  
  
Q. Being here for the second year, how is this team different than the team
that you brought to the Final Four and the championship game last year, and in
what ways?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think we're really similar to that team. We returned
four starters, and I think the veteran core group that we had, along with
Natalie Achonwa, really was well prepared.  
I think last year coming in to the Final Four as the underdog and the upset
coming in, it was like a Cinderella story. And I think there was a completely
different mindset.  
This year, coming in as the No.1 seed, I think it's a little more
businesslike. So I think that's the biggest difference.  
Kayla McBride, of course, for Becca Bruszewski is the trade we mailed. Kayla's
having a fantastic year. She brings the excitement. This is the first
tournament for her, so it's different looking through her eyes.  
  
Q. What do you see as the biggest difference in UConn the way they're
playing now as opposed to the February27th game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think Tiffany Hayes is playing better. I think Bria Hartley‑‑
you know, I think Faris is looking to score more in the NCAA Tournament than
she did before, a little more aggressive.  
Bria Hartley to me is just‑‑ she's really good. I really like her. I think she
really runs the team and does so many things well. And I think she's a huge
key to their success.  
  
Q. Just wondering your relationship with Geno, how it has evolved and how
you deal with some of the things like when he questions about the score
against Pittsburgh and some of the things at the Media Day when he talked
about Notre Dame football being the reason for the dissolution of the Big East
Conference and those sort of things.  
COACH MCGRAW: I've known Geno for a long time. I was the assistant coach at
St. Joe's for Jim Foster back in the'80s, and he was the previous assistant
coach who had just moved on to Virginia.  
So we've known each other for a long time. And people from Philly have a
different way of looking at things. And I think we understand each other,
where we're coming from.  
He likes to engage and try to get in people's heads, but I don't. And I
don't‑‑ I don't read a lot. I don't get online. I don't look for reasons to
get involved in that. So I just‑‑ I really just try to stay away from that.
And we continue to have a pretty good relationship.  
  
Q. How has your team evolved in the last couple of weeks through this
tournament?  
COACH MCGRAW: We're playing really well. I think we've been challenged. I
think we've really been questioned a lot. When the brackets came out, a lot of
people had Maryland in the Final Four. The other three teams were solid. But
we were the No.1 seed that was going to lose first. I think we played Liberty
and Cal, who were in the both top five in nation in rebounding, and our
rebounding numbers were questioned. Then we played Maryland and the size and
rebounding were questioned.  
So I think we've answered a lot of challenges. And I think it's made us a
really strong team. I think we've come out with a little bit of a chip on our
shoulder, having seen some of those things. So I think it's made us better.  
  
Q. What would be a good early indication on Sunday that things are going
well for you, systems running well? What will you be focused on, at least in
the first five minutes?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think most people feel like when you make your first shot it's
going to be a good day. So I think when you can score. When you get a really
good look and you make it, I think that kind of gives everybody a chance to
breathe a little bit.  
Defensively, I think when you can stop them. I think you get a couple of
stops. That gives you confidence. So I think the first few minutes really kind
of‑‑ you could take some motivation from either end, if you can get some stops
and you get good shots. We can say we're getting good shots, they're going to
drop. But it's always a lot better when they do fall early.  
  
Q. I've lived in Philly for 30years. And I just wanted to ask you, in
Philadelphia, there's always a flamboyance to all the basketball coaches.
There's hardly anybody there who is a wallflower. So does that make it easier
‑‑ first I would ask you: What's the mindset do you think of a Philadelphia
coach? And, second, because you've heard this kind of bluster from every other
coach who has been in Philadelphia, is it easier for you to just let it roll
off your shoulder?  
COACH MCGRAW: For people who don't know Philly, the saying is when they don't
have anything better to do, they go to the airport and do bad landings
(laughter).  
I think the Philadelphia coaches are brash and outspoken. I think there's a
lot of sarcasm used. I think they are right to the point.  
I think that's something that even with my team had to deal with: I'm going to
be honest and I'm going to tell you. And I think that's how most of those
coaches are.  
I forget part two of your question.  
  
Q. Because you grew up in that environment, is it easier to let the bluster
roll off?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yes, it's so easy to let that go, because I think initially you
kind of want to get into a fight. But it is easy to let it go. Especially
being‑‑ I'm a Midwesterner now. So I'm so much more laid back than I used to
be.  
  
Q. First of all, why haven't you allowed yourself to be the quintessential
Philadelphia coach? Why have you kept your personality in the background?
Secondly, did you and Skylar sit down before the season and talk about a
strategy in terms of all the national opportunities she might have for
publicity and other things that might come her way this year? And has there
been a lot of stuff that you've had to sort of counsel her to stay away and
wait until April or May or whenever?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'll take part two first. You know, I did not. We sat down with
Chris Masters and‑‑ and ‑‑ Chris and Sky right at the beginning of the year to
try to talk about how to help her navigate through the amazingly high number
of requests that she would get to do things.  
So we talked more from a trying to shelter her a little bit. We talked about
her Twitter account. She has goals for Player of the Year. We have the same.  
But we really didn't talk about how we're going to publicize you, how we're
going to do things for you. We kind of felt like you're going to play and
that's what's going to get you the attention.  
So I don't think we have a strategy coming in to how to promote her. I think
we just let her promote herself by playing and for everything that she does.
And certainly agreeing to give her those opportunities to go to ESPN Science
and do some things like that, we thought that was really important, and to do
the blogs for espnW, I think that was important, too.  
I think her Twitter account is really‑‑ that's an important thing for her to
do. And I feel like I still am the same person. I'm just an introvert, which
is a very different person to be as a head coach.  
  
Q. As a competitor, do you have an appreciation how this rivalry has really
escalated over the last two seasons because how many times you've played?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I'm excited it's a rivalry. I think when you lose to a
team as often as we did for a number of years, I think it's kind of an
exercise in futility more than a rivalry.  
So I'm happy that now it is a game that when we go in we look forward to it. I
think the challenge of it and‑‑ and I think in the Big East having two great
teams going at it like that with national attention all the time, I think that
says great things for the Big East Conference as well.  
  
Q. Wanted to follow up on the Twitter thing, in New York in October I
remember asking you about Twitter and nail polish, because Connecticut's got
all these rules about things that their players can't do, they can't wear.
Notre Dame seems to be a lot more relaxed in those areas. And I'm wondering
why you feel so differently than Connecticut and how necessary you think some
of these things are for team comportment.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think nail polish is essential (laughter). I think that‑‑ I
have a girly team and they love to get dressed up, as you saw last night. I
think it's important to have that kind of image off the court as well.  
I like to treat them like adults until they abuse the privilege. And so far
nobody's abused it. I've got great kids. They're really, really good citizens.
We don't have a lot of problems. And so as long as that stays the same, I'm
willing to give them whatever they want.  
  
Q. Curious what you think ‑‑ you turn around and there are men who leave
college after their freshman or sophomore year, they jump to the NBA. But,
yet, in the women's game, you're not eligible to go to the WNBA until you're
either 22 or you've played four years. One, is that fair for women? And, two,
just your overall thoughts of players that you have had that could have done
the same thing.   
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a great rule. I think getting your education is the
reason you go to college. I think that you want to come out with that degree
so after your career ends at the old age of 30 or so you're ready to go into
the world and do something else.  
I think it's a really good rule. I think the money is so small that there
isn't the attraction that the men have to leave college and make that kind of
money.  
So I think that's a big part of it as well. And if I was Brittney Griner I
would definitely go (laughter). And I think Elena Delle Donne, too, I think
both of them should leave (laughter).  
  
Q. What has made them so tough defensively this year? Tough for coaches, and
they can contest 2s, they're a tough team to score against. Why is that?  
COACH MCGRAW: They really are. I think Geno is just a really good coach and
their game plan is so sound. They look at your strengths and try to take them
away. I think they have some personnel‑driven rules, just have some general
rules. They do a lot in the half court.  
They don't have to come up and play a lot of full court. They don't play a lot
of zone. They just have really good fundamentals and man to man. And that's
hard to teach. And that's something that you have to really buy into as a
player. And clearly they have bought into that.  
  
Q. What was the team's biggest distraction, so to speak?  
COACH MCGRAW: The media. I think there's so many extra things that you have to
do when you get here that you feel like you don't really get to enjoy the time
with your team and your family. There's so many things that you have to go to
and so many people you have to talk to, and it would be really fun for them to
be here and just play the game.  
  
Q. Have you ever wanted to get involved in U.S.A. Basketball at a higher
level? And I don't know in the past if you were involved at all, but a lot of
major coaches participate. And like obviously Geno is going to coach the
Olympic team. Do you have those aspirations at some point?  
COACH MCGRAW: I don't. I was asked a few times over the years, I was on the
committee, which I really enjoyed being on the Selection Committee for four
years, but I really don't. I enjoy the summer off with family.  
I think the job is a 12‑month job as it is. And I'm pretty happy giving all my
attention to my team.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Geno Auriemma.  
COACH AURIEMMA: We got here Thursday night, and we still have to wait another
24hours or something to play, and I think the hardest thing about‑‑ the only
hard thing about being at the Final Four is how long you have to wait to play
the actual game.  
After we won Tuesday night, I wished we could have played Thursday, because
we're playing so well and we have such a good feeling about our team.  
But at this point I'm sure all four teams feel the same way and are anxious to
get going tomorrow. And as I told the players, it may not happen this way, but
I know they do and I know I do, I think we're about as prepared, we're about
as ready to play tomorrow as we've ever been. So I'm really anxious to get
going.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What were the things that you did differently as a team in the last time
you played Notre Dame that you didn't do the first two games?  
KELLY FARIS: I think one of the big things is that we had a bunch of
individuals step up at different times. And I think we've been doing that a
lot more recently in the last few games.  
But, specifically, I think it started in that last Notre Dame game, we just
had‑‑ like I said, it was just each individual at different pivotal points in
the game just stepped up and we didn't rely on just one person.  
TIFFANY HAYES: I agree with Kelly. I also think we just wanted it more. We
were tired of losing to the same team over and over again.  
And I definitely think we hustled a lot more in that game, a lot more hustle
plays, a lot of togetherness in that game. So I think that definitely helped
us out a lot.  
  
Q. Kelly, Notre Dame said about 25minutes ago how you guys know each other
inside and out and the biggest thing is the hustle plays, and that really
tomorrow night will probably come down to that because you know the plays, you
know the personnel. But the thing that you can control more than anything else
is how much you guys hustle and make the loose balls and whatever it may be.
Can you talk about how important that's going to be and how the familiarity ‑‑
there's probably not much you don't already know about each other.   
KELLY FARIS: I definitely agree. When you play a team that many times, like
you said, you start to know every player in and out, the plays, their
tendencies, that type of thing. So it does‑‑ it will come down to effort and
the hustle plays.  
And I think, like Tiffany said, we've been doing a lot better job of that
recently. So if we can keep that up, it will be good.  
  
Q. Connecticut, the UConn brand is so huge. This is my fifth Final Four and
this is your fifth for the school. But it's not the same team this year. It's
been a little bit more vulnerable than it has when Maya's been there. How has
that been as far as the mindset, not ‑‑ maybe Baylor is the big dog now and
you guys aren't?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I think it's good for us that all of us are able to step up in
one night and we don't just have one person doing everything. So there's no
superstars on our teams. We're all superstars, because any given night one of
us could score 20 if need be.  
So I think it works out in our favor.  
KELLY FARIS: I agree. I think it took us a little bit to kind of grasp that
concept that we don't have the superstar on our team that we can rely on. I
think we've been kind of used to that the last few years.  
So it's good, though. I think it's all coming together at the right time. And,
like Tiffany said, it definitely works out to our advantage, I think.  
  
Q. Has it been easier with this team because of the kind of tenacious
defense that you play, that that starts, that ignites everything else that
goes on with the rhythm of the game?  
KELLY FARIS: Well, ever since I got here, defense is obviously what we take
most pride in. So I think that's every year day in, day out we work on
defense. And especially this year, I think a lot of our offense we try to get
it to stem from our defense, whether we get a lot of pressure and turnovers
and get out in fastbreak.  
So it's good because we play‑‑ obviously we play a lot of 4 guards, and we can
be a faster team, get up and down the floor a lot quicker.  
  
Q. It seems like a different role for you guys this year. The underdog, so
to speak. You're No.1 seed, but you weren't the team that everyone's talking
about coming in here: Baylor, Baylor, Baylor, Notre Dame winning the Big East
regular season. Is it a little bit easier in a sense that there isn't that
overwhelming pressure of UConn is supposed to win this year? I mean, I know at
this school you're supposed to win every year, but there isn't that coming in,
that, wow, UConn is the favorite and if you don't win it's a terrible year for
UConn basketball?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I don't know, being the underdog, it's okay, because it's not
as much‑‑ like you said, you don't have a target on your back. That was cool
and everything the first two years, but I guess now we gotta take on another
role with being the underdog.  
Like I said, it's fine with us. It just gives us a chance to prove people
wrong.  
KELLY FARIS: Basketball's basketball in my mind. So whether you're the top dog
or the underdog, it's still going to be the same game. When you come to
Connecticut, there's always going to be expectations. And we have them of
ourselves. Our fan base has them. It's not easy to live up to them, but that's
what you come here for.  
So I don't know that we're going to necessarily go into the game thinking that
we're the underdog or all that type of stuff. In the end, it's just another
basketball game.  
  
Q. How important are these guard matchups, especially since you guys do,
like you said, play four guards sometimes, how hard are the matchups going to
be tomorrow? And, Tiffany, what have you specifically learned against the last
two games against Brittany?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I definitely think it's important. Like she said, we run four
guards. So it's big on the defensive end and leads to more scoring on the
other end. And, I mean, I've learned a lot from everybody on that team. You
just know that the whole team is a fighting team.  
And she's definitely a great player. She puts the team on her back sometimes
and carries them. So we definitely gotta watch out for everybody.  
We just can't focus on one person.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. So much to talk about familiarity and how you guys know each other inside
and out and eight times in two years and whatever it may be. But what's the
biggest thing for you guys to win tomorrow night? Because it's probably not
going to be the plays, because you know what you run; you know what they run.
But what's the biggest thing you guys have to do to be successful and get to
the championship again?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Notre Dame has three losses this year. And I don't know the
other two, the box score. But I know in a game where we played at their place,
in the game we played in the Big East championship game, we rebounded the ball
and we kept them off the free‑throw line. And I think if we do those two
things well tomorrow night, then we'll be in good shape.  
Notre Dame is maybe the best team in the country at getting to the free‑throw
line. And I would think that more than anything else that might be the key to
the game; to make sure that they have to make shots rather than just give them
free throws.  
And offensive rebounding and shooting free throws go hand in hand, because
every time you give up an offensive rebound, you end up fouling the guy who is
going back up with it.  
So those two things in my mind are going to be the keys for us anyway.  
  
Q. Looking back at the box scores, Natalie Novosel went to the line 11
times, nine in the second. I know she had some foul trouble the last game, but
it was also caused by a couple of charges by her, and she ended up with only a
couple of free throws. What do you hope to happen? Because she initiates
contact just about every time she has the ball. What, from your standpoint, do
you hope happens tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I hope the referees don't show up (laughter) and just let the
kids play basketball for 40minutes and don't blow the whistle at all. If the
game is a parade to the free‑throw line, like the Kentucky game, it's going to
sting for everybody.  
I think there's a fine line between knowing how to draw a foul and just
mindless blowing of the whistle because you just anticipate that somebody's
going to draw a foul.  
And I know what it's like to be on the other end of that, because Shea Ralph
was the same way. If Shea Ralph had a wide‑open layup, she'd wait until you
got near her and then punch you and shoot a layup and go to the free‑throw
line. It's just the way it was with Shea. And I think Natalie is a lot
similar. Very similar to Shea.  
So we've got to be smart enough to make sure that every shot that Notre Dame
makes is contested. But, at the same time, you can't not play hard. You can't
not be aggressive.  
And really, really good offensive players, they're just hard to stop. I mean,
it's not like we're going to keep them from getting some of the shots they
want. But the way you get a really good offensive player out of their rhythm
is you make them play defense and you turn whatever they're using against you
against them.  
So depending on how the game's being called, we're going to have to do as good
a job as they do at getting to the free‑throw line.  
We're just not as good at it as they are. That's the biggest problem.  
  
Q. How confident or not confident were you through the course of the season
that you guys would end up here?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, before the season, at Connecticut, it's kind of
tantamount to treason if you say we're not going to win a national
championship. And it's something even worse than that if you say I don't think
we can get to the Final Four.  
So I actually thought when the season started, that when practice started,
anyway, that a lot of things would have to go right for us to get to this
point where we are right now.  
And in November I thought we had a chance. And in December I thought we had a
chance. And as January and February came around, I thought we had no chance,
because our immaturity just kept popping up.  
I mean, every time we had a chance to prove how mature we were, we were
immature. But, unlike other places, we just kept winning. So it added to the
frustration. I knew we were immature, I knew we were doing lots of things
we're not used to seeing at Connecticut, but we were was winning, and it took
a couple of losses for us to finally understand that we needed to grow up and
we needed to grow up quickly.  
So it wasn't until the Big East tournament that I really, really thought we
had a shot at this thing. And once the Big East tournament ended, I thought
we've got as good a shot as anybody of winning this thing.  
  
Q. Just wanted to see about talking about your relationship with Muffet and
even in the face of some of the things ‑‑ I know in the Media Day you talked
about Notre Dame football kind of imploding the Big East and how many points
they scored against Pittsburgh this year and that sort of thing, and how that
all fits in the relationship.   
COACH AURIEMMA: My relationship with Muffet goes back to the mid‑'70s when I
left St.Joseph's University to go coach on the men's side and she took my
place at St. Joe's. And I've had a great relationship with Muffet all this
time. And that hasn't changed. That hasn't changed one bit. And the people on
her staff as well. Love every one of them. Have tremendous respect for all of
them, as friends and as professionals, as colleagues.  
My relationship with the University of Notre Dame, that's a different story.
Goes back to when I was a kid, probably, going to Catholic school all my life.
And not being able to get into Notre Dame, that probably missed me off, too.
And it just escalated from there (laughter). Because I had a couple of friends
that went to school there and played there, and you want to kill yourself
every time you came home for vacation.  
  
Q. Wanted to follow up with what Michel was asking you. Since the Big East
Tournament, in the last three weeks, what have you really liked about how the
team has responded to what you wanted all season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The number one thing that a player has to have to be
successful is confidence. And the one thing this team lacked was confidence.
They pretended and they acted like they had it, but it was fake. And every
chance I got in practice I wanted to kind of try to shake their confidence.
And I always kept winning. And it bothered me that this year more than other
years I kept winning more than I normally win, and I usually win all the time
in practice.  
But at least the other teams got sick and tired of me winning and would fight
back. This team just kind of took it on the chin and just said, okay, Coach
you win, fine. The more they did that, the more I got pissed. I'm like, How
are we ever going to get beyond just being mediocre, just being good? We can't
operate like this.  
These guys just‑‑ they take getting beat at practice. They take it way too
casually. There isn't this‑‑ they're not incensed about losing. And I've had
teams in the last four, five, 15, 20years that if they didn't get a question
right on a crossword puzzle before you did, they want to choke you.  
So I wasn't used to this. And it wasn't until, again, that last week of the
season that it started to affect them. And after we won the Big East
Tournament, they don't react that way anymore. Something clicked that week
between the last regular season game and the start of the tournament.  
And what we did during that week was we went to practice and I made them force
the issue, so that for the next five days everything we did was about building
confidence in ourselves and in each other to the point where we could trust
ourselves and trust each other.  
When you had this many young players‑‑ I don't know how many sophomores are
starting tomorrow for either team. We have two. And I don't know how many
freshmen are coming off the bench and playing huge roles tomorrow. We have
two, maybe three.  
So we're counting on people that haven't done all the things that they hope to
do. And with that comes, as I said, a lot of immaturity and a lot of mistrust.
If you're Kelly Faris and you operate at a certain level from having won a
national championship and being undefeated and now you're having to deal with
players who just don't understand what it takes to do that, I think it creates
a little bit of doubt in your mind about whether you can trust your teammates.  
And, like Kelly said, ever since the first game of the Big East Tournament,
that's gone. And I think you'll see that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've played both Baylor and Stanford; want to offer a little expert
analysis on the second game tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The big kid at Baylor is really good. She's really good. I
don't know why, but I think this is a good matchup for Stanford.  
And I think it's good because they haven't played each other. So Brittney and
Odyssey Sims and Baylor, they don't know anything about how to defend
Stanford. And Stanford's big kids don't know anything about playing against
somebody like Brittney Griner.  
So I really like this matchup. I really do. And all the people that are saying
this is a walk for Baylor, I don't think they're right. I'm not saying they're
not going to win. I don't know who is going to win. But those people that say
Baylor's got an 80percent chance of winning tomorrow night, I think they're
dead wrong. They might, but it's not going to be as easy as they think.  
  
Q. When you're talking about building the team's confidence during that five
‑day stretch, I wonder if you can offer a specific example of what you or the
coaches did to do that. How do you do that in practicality?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, think about this. I'll go back to my father, God rest
his soul. He only knew how to drive‑‑ he got his license, I think, when he was
60 because all the guys who used to drive him around died, I think. So he
needed a way to get around, and I left home, so he was stuck. And he only knew
how to drive from my house to where he worked and my house to where he went to
hang out with the guys on Friday nights and drink coffee.  
So when my mother would ask him to take him someplace, he would refuse, and
then she would make him because it was someplace where he didn't know how to
get to. So he would eventually get to an intersection, stop, three or four
lights would go by, people were honking, everything, he would turn around and
go home.  
When you're scared and you don't know what to do, you just stop and stand
there and you don't want to make any moves. You don't want to make any
decisions because you're afraid to make the wrong one. So you go back to what
is safe for you.  
And that's what my team had become during the whole month of February. During
the whole month of February we were a team that stood around and waited for
something to happen because we started to be afraid.  
So those five days of practice, every practice was about us attacking things
rather than waiting. So the way you saw us play in the Big East Tournament,
first couple of rounds of the NCAA Tournament, the Regionals, we were
constantly on the attack. We were constantly the aggressor.  
So what we did as a coaching staff, we took the thought process out of it and
just put the action back into our team instead of the thinking.  
And I'm hoping that tomorrow we can carry through on that. Because the worst
thing for a young kid to do, all the young kids we have on our team, is to be
thinking about what to do. And I thought that's where we were.  
  
Q. Every time you look up there's different men's basketball players who
leave after their freshman or sophomore years to go to the NBA. In the WNBA,
you either have to be 22 or play four years. One, do you think that's fair for
women? And, two, with all the All ‑Americans that you've had over the years,
has that ever been an issue with some of the players that may have wanted to
turn pro early?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Is it fair? I'm on both sides of that fence. If you go
to college, supposedly you're going to college to prepare yourself for a
career. So if you go to college and your career presents itself to you after
your first year and you have an opportunity to start a career that you've
always wanted and it's something that's going to be financially and other ways
rewarding, why shouldn't you go ahead and do it?  
I always use this example: If you're a music major and you go to college and
you play the guitar and the E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen shows up on
campus and the guy says, Oh, man, you're pretty good, do you want to travel
with us? No, I'm sorry, I want to finish my college education. Yeah, right.  
So from a basketball standpoint, I think it hurts the college game that kids
can come for one year and leave, because I don't think they put their heart
and soul into going to that school. They're just drive‑bys, you know? And I
hate that. I hate it with a passion.  
It hurts those kids. They leave after one year and they think they've got it
all figured out. And maybe 2 out of every 200 make it. The other ones end up
regretting it.  
I wish on the men's and women's side we had the baseball thing; either go
right from high school, God bless you, don't set foot on our campus because
you don't want to be there. Or if you make a commitment, you're there for
three years. Then after your third year, God bless you, you're free to go.  
But‑‑ there's always a but‑‑ but, on the other side, you wouldn't have the
four best teams in the country playing in the national championship in women's
basketball almost every year. So that's the plus side of it.  
  
Q. Muffet was asked earlier about her relationship with you and whether you
got under her skin and she said no, because having grown up in the Philly area
as a coach you're supposed to be flamboyant and sarcastic, so for her it's
easy to let it roll.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Was she talking about herself?  
  
Q. She's talking about every coach in Philadelphia.  
COACH AURIEMMA: About being flamboyant and sarcastic? Is she talking about
Tara?  
  
Q. She said it's easy to let it roll off her back because you're supposed to
be like that if you're from Philadelphia. Do you notice you can't get under
her skin because she's from that area and she knows, you know, no coach from
Philly is going to be a wallflower?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Come on. You know, Muffet and Kim Mulkey are pretty much of
the same era, I think, and they're what women's basketball coaches are
supposed to be like.  
They're tough. They're competitive. They have a unique style about them. They
can give it right back to you as well as take it.  
I don't think I've ever consciously tried to get under Muffet's skin. I do
that at the meetings, I do that privately, where we have fun with it. But I
don't think publicly I've ever tried. I bet you if she wasn't at Notre Dame I
probably wouldn't try as hard to get under her skin, but the fact she's at
Notre Dame it's easy.  
And I think that goes with the territory. It's like I'm the coach at
Connecticut. So there's a lot of things that go along with that. If I wasn't
the coach at Connecticut and we weren't this successful, nobody would care,
nobody would say a word.  
But the fact that Muffet's from Philly and I've known her for 35years and
she's at Notre Dame, and if they keep beating us, we're in for it. She's in
for it, big time. She's going to need more than a leather skirt. She's going
to have to wear body armor. I'm coming after her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.
