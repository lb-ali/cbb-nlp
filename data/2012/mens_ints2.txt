### [Anthony Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23480)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Lamar head coach Pat Knight, student‑athletes
Mike James and Anthony Miles. We'll begin with an opening statement by Coach
Knight.  
COACH KNIGHT: I don't do the coaches speak, so I'm not going to do it now. So
just questions. Go ahead.  
  
Q. You got an early lead and all of a sudden the shots started, just didn't
fall anymore. Talk a little bit about that.  
ANTHONY MILES: I mean, like you said, shots didn't fall. I don't know if it
was because we were a little timid or what it is. But second half we finally
relaxed.  
We started off hot, but I don't know, just a couple of bad plays and we just
couldn't get it going. So that hurt us going down the stretch.  
  
Q. Was that one of the most frustrating defenses you've ever faced while
being a player here at Lamar? It seems like you couldn't get anything going
inside or outside tonight.  
MIKE JAMES: Not really. I mean, they were a solid defensive team. They weren't
really defensive stopping team. I think more has to go back on our offense. I
just think we didn't execute today.  
  
Q. You talked about not executing your offense well. Was that why you didn't
shoot well or in what ways didn't you execute well?  
MIKE JAMES: I think we just didn't space out. We didn't cut like we normally
do. I don't know if, like Anthony said, we were timid or got caught up in the
spotlight. But we didn't play like Lamar, I didn't feel like, on the offensive
side.  
  
Q. Anthony, is it tough to get into a rhythm because of the type of offense
they're in, they're slowing it up like you saw at Stephen F. Austin and
Nicholls State this year? Was it tough to get into a rhythm because they were
slowing the ball down?  
ANTHONY MILES: Yes, but that's where patience comes in. We didn't seem to have
patience tonight. Like I said, I don't know. We were just a little timid and
we wanted to make that big play or what, but we just could never‑‑ we didn't
just finally settle down until the second half.  
And with a good team like this, it's an NCAA team you can't shoot yourself in
the foot like that. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Anthony, what do you take out of this experience? Especially these
seniors, they've been together, become a close tight ‑knit group. What do you
take from this experience of playing in this tournament?  
ANTHONY MILES: Just the long season we went through, man. We went through a
lot, man. And I led these guys, and I'm going to miss it. It's tough. Just the
whole Canada trip, the whole incident that happened a couple of weeks ago,
it's fun.  
Like through the whole season you just look at it. It hurts because you just
have a lot of fun with these guys and you just don't want it to stop.  
And I guess everything don't last forever and it's going to be tough, seeing
them go away and me go away leaving this university.  
But I couldn't ask for no more going to the NCAA and having a chance to play
in front of millions. I'm just grateful.  
  
Q. You're heading out. What memories will you take from Lamar, Mike?  
MIKE JAMES: It was a great experience. Like you said, everything we've been
through, Canada, just everything with the media, stuff like that. And even
coming to the NCAA Tournament, it's stuff that normal people don't get to go
through and we got to go through, we overcame it, had a great season. But it's
sad that it's so short.  
  
Q. You feel that Lamar is back on the map because for the late'70s,
early'80s this was a tradition of going to the NCAA Tournament? You guys feel
like Lamar has kind of put their stamp on the South Conference and back on the
map?  
ANTHONY MILES: I wouldn't say back on the map. You can't be a one‑hit wonder.
I know Coach Knight is going to do a good job with the program, and it's just
a good start to something great.  
I'm glad we did a good job, just putting us back on the scene. I got a lot of
faith they're going to keep it going and keep the winning column, you know,
margin up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said this team had a chance to leave a legacy, leave their stamp on
the program, to kick start it. Do you feel like they've left that legacy?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah, I mean, don't you? It's obvious you take a team that
hasn't been in the conference tournament, wins 23 games. They haven't won 20
games since 1988.  
Won the division, went to the NCAA Tournament, and they haven't been to the
NCAA Tournament since 2000. I think these guys did a heck of a job of leaving
their legacy.  
I don't know. If there are people that disagree about that, they're morons.
These guys just made Lamar relevant again. And it gives us something to build
on from here on out, and it puts pressure on the team next year to get
something done.  
I mean, these guys did something this year a lot of college athletes don't
ever get to experience. They're down right now. Losing hurts. But what a ride.
These guys were a blast to coach all year long.  
It was fun. I enjoyed it and I'm going to miss them. But these guys, boy, I'll
be talking about them until the day I die, this group.  
  
Q. There were times where Mike James is defending Matt Glass, how indicative
was that of just the kind of height disparity and the matchup problems that
they caused for you?  
COACH KNIGHT: They caused a lot of matchup problems. It's what you gotta deal
with. What they did a good job of‑‑ we weren't shooting the ball well because
we weren't cutting or moving. But they had great pressure on us. We took a lot
of contested shots. We held them to 30points in the first half. That's enough
to beat anybody. But we couldn't shoot. We couldn't get a shot, and we weren't
cutting and moving, so we were easier for them to guard. They put great
pressure on us.  
We took a lot of contested shots. We shoot 20‑something percent, and a team
like that gets a lead by 9, it's really like they're almost up 16 or 18,
because they're so good with the ball and take their time that, you don't like
to say it, but you can say it now, the game was kind of over after the first
half.  
They're a hard team to try to come back on, because if you try to make a run,
they're not going to fall for that. They're going to walk it up, take their
time, make you make a mistake. And they did a really good job running the shot
clock towards the end and making us call some bad fouls.  
And that's really because of them. I mean, they caused us to get tired, not to
think. And you stop moving your feet. Because we left them off the hook maybe
four or five times, it would have been huge stops for us, but they took their
time. And then with about five seconds to go, drove on us, we got our hands
on, weren't moving our feet.  
But we have a hard time playing against teams like that. They remind me of
Nicholls State and Stephen F. Austin. And of course we had our problems with
them. So I knew it was going to be that type of game.  
But I was hoping we could get off to a big lead and maybe sustain it because
they'd slow it up. But they did good being able to jump right on us.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it to see when the shot clock was winding down that
they would hit easy layups in the middle and you would have any backside
help?  
COACH KNIGHT: That's tough. We didn't guard the post extremely well, just kind
of laid behind and they stepped over us. But the most frustrating part is when
you foul.  
It's a 50/50 chance the kid's going to hit the shot, even if it's a layup. But
when you foul, put him on a line, that's even more frustrating.  
  
Q. What do you take away from your first year here at Lamar?  
COACH KNIGHT: I can't wait until next year. But I'm going to miss these guys.
It's been a special year. Sorry. You go from getting fired a year ago and make
the NCAA Tournament.  
It's not anything I did, it's what these six seniors did. So I'm going to miss
the under‑the‑bus gang, I can tell you that.  
  
Q. Did you just come up with that name for them?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah. It's pretty good, wasn't it?  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

South Florida  65  
California  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Cal head coach Mike Montgomery and
student‑athletes Harper Kamp and Allen Crabbe. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: I didn't imagine that happening. We dug ourselves a huge
hole in the first half and probably as bad as I've seen us play. We just
didn't seem to have energy. They shot the ball in, we couldn't make a shot;
they were getting loose balls, we couldn't get loose balls. We weren't doing
much of anything.  
We dug ourselves a huge hole. We've had problems with physical teams the last
few weeks. I think they were no exception.  
At one point it was 22‑2 in the paint, which is something that we knew was
going to be a little bit of a problem.  
They had good spacing, and their little guard really hurt us. We worked as
hard as we could to try not let him split the double, and he split it almost
at will. Got inside, made every shot.  
So we didn't have a lot of encouraging things. They played great. Give them
credit. They were fired up. They played hard. They played well. They made
shots. They made plays. We didn't.  
So obviously the end score was a little misleading, but at some point we just
implored our people to keep competing, trying to get back and get respectable,
because it was looking like it could get out of hand.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Allen, what was it that Rudd, No.2, was doing on defense against you? Was
it anything that you hadn't seen before? How was his style of defense?  
ALLEN CRABBE: He was just physical with me. Not letting me get thescreens, not
letting me get to spots that I'm comfortable in.  
And obviously that's something that I had to learn a lot this year with other
defenses not letting me get wide‑open shots and stuff.  
Just gotta give credit to him for not letting me get comfortable, not letting
me get into a rhythm.  
  
Q. Harper, can you talk about having this be the way an otherwise pretty
good season ends for you guys?  
HARPER KAMP: Yeah, it's tough. We had, I think, a good start to the season. We
had 24 wins overall. So it's hard to go out that way.  
But I think we just kind of‑‑ Coach said it in the locker room, we just had‑‑
we let up at some point, maybe stopped working as hard. We thought maybe
things would come a little bit easier, especially at the offensive end.  
I think we kind of just thought that people were going to let us have shots or
something, and it was not that way.  
  
Q. Allen or Harper, have you seen anybody quite like this? You guys got a
lot of reports on how good they were defensively. Was it hard to understand
exactly what they were like until you stepped on the court with them?  
HARPER KAMP: I think they were just very disciplined. I didn't notice them out
of position much. And that helps when‑‑ and then you add the physicality, I
think it really helps.  
And they were in the right spots keeping us from making solid cuts, from
making hard cuts, and we knew that going in.  
But there's things you can do to counter that, but I just don't think we did
that well enough tonight.  
  
Q. What were you thinking walking off the court at halftime? It had to be
startling for you and for the team.  
ALLEN CRABBE: I mean, we just didn't have any energy. And, speaking for
myself, it just seems like I take too long to get into the game. And I just
feel like we just didn't have any energy. That's all I can really say at this
point.  
  
Q. Harper, South Florida has a reputation of being a mediocre offensive team
and they struggle all the time. Did you expect them to come out and make
almost 70percent of their shots the first half?  
HARPER KAMP: That was hard. They made pretty much, I think, every open shot
they took. And I think it's really our fault as players for maybe
underestimating them at times.  
Maybe the reason that they got that reputation for being a mediocre offensive
team is because they play against great defensive teams every night.  
So I think we maybe had the wrong impression, and we let them‑‑ and myself, I
mean, I let‑‑ I think I had two 3s shot over me without a good hand contesting
it.  
And it was just‑‑ we were a mediocre defensive team tonight.  
  
Q. Allen, any thoughts on why it takes you as long as it did to get in any
kind of a rhythm, or in general, not just tonight, but maybe this season?  
ALLEN CRABBE: I guess it's just a mindset. You gotta come into the game ready
and just telling yourself that you're going to be aggressive and attack.  
Whether they box and one you, you've got to go out there and be aggressive. It
seems like I only play in spurts; I do something good, and I just disappear.
It's real inconsistent with me. I just gotta learn from it. Just gotta keep an
aggressive mindset for the whole 40minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously you won 24 games, did a lot of good things. But can you
talk about it's been a long season. You started off way back in the summer
going to Europe. You went through some serious health stuff. How are you
feeling and just kind of how do you reflect on the whole season?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, you know, the last, gosh, three or four weeks we just
haven't been‑‑ just didn't look like we had. We weren't hungry.  
We had the two great home games. We needed to have Oregon, Oregon State. Put
ourselves in a great position. We played really well in those games.  
And we headed out on the road and win a conference championship. And we all of
a sudden lost our mojo. I don't know. It's been hard. And our two seniors have
been really, really good. Some of the young players really don't know what it
takes and how hard you have to play, and just seemed like we lacked the hunger
coming into some of these games.  
And it's been that way. We had to really scrap to beat Stanford, which
probably got us in the tournament. And that was a huge relief to be able to do
that. But the other three games we just haven't really matched anybody's
energy.  
We're not very physical. We've gotten beat up pretty good just by teams that
are stronger and push us around a little bit.  
And it started to catch up with us towards the end of the season without
question.  
  
Q. Following up on Jeff's question, it's not a topic you like to talk about,
but just your health in general after having that scare in the fall?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: My health is just like yours. Well, it's not that bad
(laughter).  
I mean, I'm fine. I have nothing‑‑ I have nothing to report. Who knows what's
going on there. I didn't know I had it before. Everything's good. It's been a
long year. It's been tough, the Europe trip and then that whole thing and so
forth.  
But I've been through a lot of these, and you lose your last game a lot,
almost always. If you're good, you lose your last game and you feel bad, you
feel bad for the kids. You feel bad for playing as poorly as we did in the
first half, in particular. You want to represent your university better than
that. You want to represent your seniors better than that.  
We just struggled toward the end, some of which we maybe should have known.
David is getting against 250‑pound big guys in there and he's not able to hang
in. And Robert tries. And we kind of ran out of people that could do things.  
And we have to have three or four people be able to make plays. When they
don't make plays, we've got big problems.  
  
Q. There was a lot of chirping when USF got in from people who said they
didn't belong. After looking at them up close, how far do you think they can
go in the tournament and do you think they belong?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, I don't think there's any question we belong. They
were chirping at us for not belonging. For a while it sure looked like
everybody might have been right about that.  
I don't question that kind of stuff. They have a strong, physical basketball
team. They beat a couple of teams late. If you look at their schedule, there
was‑‑ they beat a couple of good teams late, but early on there are games they
won at home. You can look at everybody's schedule and make that argument.  
We didn't allow touch. I think Harper was correct. We stood there and allowed
people to shoot. We felt like if you look statistically at their team, they
didn't shoot their ball very well from 3. They were not a very good 3‑point
shooting team.  
We felt like they were an in‑the‑paint team, and yet they shot it in right,
just made baskets from 3. And then at one point it was 22‑2 in the paint. We
couldn't do anything about keeping the ball in the paint. Hated to go to the
zone late.  
It was just ‑‑ thought, well, let's try something, let's see if we can't make
this thing respectable. And they started missing shots. Now, is that because
they were up 20 whatever and we were down? I don't know.  
But I don't know how far they can go in the tournament. I can't predict that.
They're going to go in as a 12 seed against a 5 seed. You presume the
tournament committee knows what they're doing.  
You presume that on paper that Temple's a better team. But if they shoot the
ball the way they did tonight, if Temple doesn't do a better job than we did
defending, they'll run into problems.  
The one thing about it is that little guard is good. And he doesn't lose his
poise out there. He controls the tempo. And they play slow. I think Temple,
knowing Fran, will probably not be uncomfortable with playing slow.  
But he has the ball and he's not fazed with the late shot clock. He splits it
and he gets it to where he wants it to go.  
So they look like they belonged tonight. I will say that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

South Florida  65  
California  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll be joined by head coach Stan Heath and Victor Rudd and
Anthony Collins.  
Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH HEATH: I'm not sure Cal was at its very best tonight. But some of that
might have been them. Some of it might have been us.  
But I really, really liked for 30minutes the way we played. I liked the way we
guarded. I liked the way we shared the ball. I liked the way we managed the
clock. And I like the fact that guys were playing with great energy and
passion out there on the court.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you, you have to have a belief, but if we said back in
December South Florida was going to win a NCAA Tournament game, would you have
believed it?  
VICTOR RUDD: Yeah, I would have believed it. We're a good team, I think. We
don't expect to lose any games.  
ANTHONY COLLINS: I think so, too. We play great defense. So we just take our
time and get great shots on offense. I think we can beat anybody.  
  
Q. Anthony, everybody is talking about your defense coming in. You guys were
very assertive shooting the ball. Hit a couple floaters early. Just talk about
the aggressive nature you guys had on offense, especially early.  
ANTHONY COLLINS: We always talk about getting in the paint, getting in the
paint, close shots, high percentage to make it, so basically put pressure on
the defense and just attack, attack, and don't settle for jump shots.  
  
Q. Victor, how did you play defense against Crabbe the times you were on
him? What was your general approach to someone who is capable of getting in a
good shooting rhythm?  
VICTOR RUDD: I like what Coach said about getting in your breath and making
you uncomfortable. That's what I tried to do to him. I shadowed him wherever
he went, and I didn't want to give him a good look off of it.  
  
Q. Anthony, do you guys take offense when people talk about your offense and
how you guys can't produce and you're inconsistent offensively? Do you take
offense to that?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: Not really. I know people have their opinions. So they can
say what they want. But we're just going to play our style of play and take
our time and get whatever shot we want.  
  
Q. Both teams last night had big leads. One was up 15 with seven to play.
One was up 25 and lost. Were you thinking about that when it came down to the
second half and not being content with the lead kind of building on it at
least for the ten minutes in the second half?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: Yeah, we just wanted to come out and stay aggressive. And
last night, you know, the teams, when I watched them play in the night before,
that the teams played up and down real fast and was scoring the ball. But then
they kept‑‑ when they had the big lead, they still was coming down and
shooting fast shots. We wanted to go down also. But also take a good shot so
the other team couldn't come right back down fast and get a better shot.  
So we just tried to‑‑ if we had a break, then take it. If not, take the ball
out and just run some clock and get a better shot.  
  
Q. Victor, can you talk about what it means to beat a team from your home
state and playing the way you did tonight?  
VICTOR RUDD: It means a lot. When you want to play‑‑ when you play against
somebody from your city, from where I went to the Pac‑10 first, I want to win.
And it means a lot to me, especially me playing as well as I did, that I can
go home with bragging rights.  
  
Q. Victor, can you talk about winning on this stage and now getting to
travel tomorrow and play Temple on Friday and letting everybody see USF
basketball?  
VICTOR RUDD: Yeah, we're having a great time. It feels good to win on this
stage. People didn't expect us to be here. So we just want to make our point
proving that we deserve to be here. And we want to keep going.  
  
Q. Victor, can you expand on that philosophy? You said something about
getting in your opponent's breath or something like that. Can you talk about
that defensive philosophy?  
VICTOR RUDD: Coach really said it. But I read it, and I used it to myself. But
we get mad when people score, no matter what kind of bucket it is. And that's
what makes us have people scoring in 50, 40, because we don't like it when
people score at all, not even a free throw. So we get mad at each other, and
that's how we play great defense.  
  
Q. Anthony, the fact that you guys were able to get a lead, that Coach was
able to play the bench a little more, can that be a benefit for you guys since
you know you have a game coming up in 48hours?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: I think it is. Because you want‑‑ it's our first time in the
NCAA Tournament in a while, so it's good so everybody get in, get their feet
wet. So when it comes the time, just in case something happens, then everybody
has the experience to get in and play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What do you know about Temple? Just for your information, Fran Dunphy
said your team was the team that he pretended to be a fan of, just watching
games this year, never thinking that he was going to have to play you guys.
What do you know about them and what do you know about Fran?  
COACH HEATH: That's a heck of a compliment. And I know he's a terrific coach.
And his team is outstanding. And I have not‑‑ I'll be honest, I have not
watched anything on Temple. One of my assistants is going to fill me in quite
a bit. I'll watch some things tonight.  
I did see them early in the year. They beat Villanova, and I remember watching
a tape on Villanova when they played Temple. And I know they have very good
guard play. That's the thing I remember, good guard play that different guys
can handle the ball and make plays and score.  
So I know we're going to get challenged that way again. But I have a lot of
respect for Fran Dunphy and the job he's done at Temple and the coach he is.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting the program's first NCAA Tournament win and
doing it with your style and just the way you all play?  
COACH HEATH: Well, we're all thrilled. Our president, my athletic director,
it's always great to keep your bosses happy, and we're thrilled. And we didn't
want to just come here for one game.  
We were excited to get in here. But we did want to prove a little bit that we
deserve and we belong and we're legit. And I think the kids took that to
heart.  
But it's a building process and we took a big step in the right direction
today. But we want to take some more steps as well.  
  
Q. Anthony talked about wanting to get the ball into the paint and that
being a big part and not settling. But you guys made a lot of jump shots
tonight. Can you explain why it worked out tonight that you would shoot the
ball as well as you did, obviously not something that had been going on the
last two, three weeks?  
COACH HEATH: I think what's happened is the majority of people that maybe
start following us a little bit probably saw last two weeks of basketball. And
if you go back in time, you'll see we were among the top three field goal
percentage offenses in the Big East.  
We're also one of the top five or six 3‑point shooting teams in the league as
well. But the last four or five games it went down the tubes, it really did.  
And I think a big part of that was‑‑ I told this to my team. I thought since
maybe somewhere around mid‑January we were playing for our lives. We felt like
almost any game we lost was an elimination game.  
And I think in some ways it might have been my fault that we put a lot of
pressure on ourselves and maybe I coached that way, where just every
possession was just so important. And I felt once we got in the tournament and
we talked about this like, hey, we're in a new season. Let's relax and play.  
We've got some talent out there. They've got some guys that can play. And I
think you'll see us play more like this the rest of the way, that you'll see
us be able to score a lot easier than we did before. We have more weapons. Gus
Gilchrist, when he wants to be, he's as good as a post player as you'll find
around the country.  
Ron Anderson didn't have a great game today, Fitzpatrick, but when my front
line is playing well, and you saw what Rudd can do and Poland has some talent.
We have some weapons. If things aren't there, we've got a little guy right
here that can make it happen by himself if he needs to.  
  
Q. Talk about Ron Anderson how he was when he went down with the injury in
the second half.  
COACH HEATH: We'll get him evaluated. It was good to see him walk off the
court and get back in the game. I think it will be sore and stiff, we've got a
great medical staff. We've got two doctors and trainers, he'll get all the
attention he needs.  
He's a tough, tough, hard‑nosed kid, so there's no way in the world he's not
going to play, and he's got some relationships with Temple, too. It was one of
the schools he was looking at before he came to USF. I know he's going to want
to play well there.  
  
Q. Stan, you guys started so fast and with such energy. As a coach, are you
one of the guys who can tell when you're going to get that kind of passion
from your team, and were you impressed with it as well?  
COACH HEATH: Well, we've been having some pretty nice starts. We start off
fast against Notre Dame. It might have been 20‑6 against them or something
like that. But we've always seemed to have this lull, where it seems like for
about four or five minutes nothing's happening.  
And today we did a much better job of still attacking, still being aggressive
and putting the ball in the basket and continuing to be consistent
defensively. So I think that was the difference in our team.  
We didn't let up. We didn't have our let‑up until the last seven or eight
minutes of the game. So it came at a time where we were a little bit safer
than normal.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Vermont  71  
Lamar  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by the head coach of Vermont, John
Becker, as well as student‑athletes from Vermont, Four McGlynn and Brian
Voelkel.  
We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Becker.  
COACH BECKER: Really don't know what to say. I'm really excited and thrilled
for our guys to be able to get this win in the NCAA Tournament. Second NCAA
Tournament win in our school's history. And this one's for all the former UV
players and coaches and people who helped us get us to where we are today.  
And the guys really executed on both ends of the court. I thought 16 assists,
five turnovers was the stat of the game.  
We did a good job sharing the ball, being patient. We didn't turn it over. Got
some pressure late in the game. I thought our guys were very composed and
handled it great. We really executed on both ends of the court, stayed with
our game plan.  
It's a very good Lamar team. I'd like to congratulate them on a great year,
and we feel fortunate to get a win against a very well‑coached Lamar team.
We're excited to continue our journey this year and head down to North
Carolina tomorrow.  
But we'll enjoy tonight, and really proud of our guys. Another team effort.
I've been saying it all year. But this is a team, and we win with every guy
that comes in, contributes, Pat Bergmann came off the bench, I thought gave us
huge minutes. Four McGlynn obviously was really good on the offensive end of
the court. And really both ends of the court.  
And it was, again, a team effort. Our bench played great. We executed and we
made the plays we had to. And couldn't be more proud of the guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brian and Four, the past couple of days has shown that the First Four is
certainly legitimate. What do you say to people that think it's not a part of
the real NCAA Tournament?  
FOUR MCGLYNN: I think that a lot of people underestimate the position that we
were in as a First Four team, but for us it was a great honor.  
We won our conference championship and got an automatic bid. And, I mean, it's
really good. It just allows us to continue our season. And fortunately we got
a win today to keep our season going.  
BRIAN VOELKEL: Obviously it's just a big honor. If you were watching these
games, it's great basketball. And it's definitely‑‑ people are asking is it
kind of‑‑ are you kind of a little mad you got in the play‑in game. And not at
all. It's great to be able to play on TV and it's just great to be able to
play basketball and do what we love to do.  
  
Q. It seemed like no matter what you guys played within your offensive sets
and sort of maintained your game. Can you just talk about that and how you
were able to maintain that poise throughout the game?  
FOUR MCGLYNN: One thing that Coach Becker does a great job of is giving us a
lot of freedom within the offense to create plays for ourselves, create plays
for others.  
And we really do have a lot of freedom. One thing we always preach is to stay
composed. That's one thing we've been working on, especially in these
high‑intensity games. That's one thing you have to do is stay composed and
make sure you execute. Because coming down the stretch of the game, if you can
execute the plays in the game, it's going to put you in a great position to
win.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could address the fact that the biggest win in school
history is the 2005 win over Syracuse? I wondered if you could talk about
whether perhaps this might lead you on the road to another memory like that?  
BRIAN VOELKEL: Yeah, obviously the Syracuse game was a huge win for Vermont
and the community. Obviously we're going to come into North Carolina with a
lot of confidence and hopefully we can pull up another upset and give the
people in Burlington something to cheer about.  
  
Q. Four, shots were going down early, how important was it for the team to
get off to a solid start, similar to the way you started passing Stony Brook
in the league championship game?  
FOUR MCGLYNN: It was very important. We've been struggling on the road
shooting a little bit. But, I mean, this morning we got in, got some extra
shots up. Some of the guys struggling on the road with the coaches, and we
were very fortunate today. And, like you said, against Stony Brook to get
shots going early. That's huge on the road. Especially in a hostile
environment, it's good to get things going offensively.  
And, like we say, our defense leads our offense, and when we're playing
defense, playing our shell principles boxing out and getting rebounds, it's
easy to make shots because a lot of them are wide open in transition.  
  
Q. Brian, this was a place of the great comebacks last night. They came
back, cut it to 7 there in the second half. What did you guys talk about in
your huddle, et cetera, to keep your composure, et cetera, and then move on
out from there?  
BRIAN VOELKEL: That's pretty much what we talked about, just keeping our
composure. That's what we talked about all year. When times are getting tough,
just to stick together and just be there for each other.  
And I think, once again, we did a great job of that. They made their runs. But
we responded well. And we just ran our offense. Got easy buckets and then let
our defense do the rest.  
  
Q. Four, talk about your performance, first time in this environment and
just being natural like you have all season long.  
FOUR MCGLYNN: I mean, I don't think‑‑ I don't put any added pressure on any
one particular game because at the end of the day, once you get in there and
get into the flow of the game, it's just like any other game.  
But obviously my first NCAA Tournament game, I thought I played pretty well. I
got into a really good flow. My teammates, I have to give credit to them,
because they're the ones, especially Brian Voelkel who gives me the ball in
spots I'm wide open, it's easy to knock down open shots, especially when
you're getting great passes.  
  
Q. What's it like, Brian and Four, to know your next opponent's North
Carolina, No.1 seed, et cetera? How do you put that in your brain right now?  
BRIAN VOELKEL: It's incredible to be able to play such a storied program in
the tournament. It doesn't get any better than that. It's a childhood dream
just to be in that environment, be in this environment. And I just can't wait
to get out there and play hard and try to get an upset.  
FOUR MCGLYNN: Like Brian said, it's a huge honor. Historically North Carolina
is one of the best basketball programs that there's ever been. And for us it's
just a great honor. Coming from a mid‑major program, win our conference
championship and winning today in the first round.  
It's going to be awesome to go out there and play with arguably some of the
best players in the country.  
  
Q. Brian, playing such an athletic guard ‑oriented team that really scores a
lot, how were you able to contain them and keep them off the boards as well?  
BRIAN VOELKEL: We did pretty much what we've been doing all year and stayed
with our principles. Obviously we're one of the best defensive teams in the
country. We've maintained just doing what we do kind of. So I think we did a
great job of that. They were obviously a little more undersized than us, but
we were able to contain them. Our post players did a great job of holding
their post players down, and it was just a team effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Pat Bergmann. Seems like in the postseason he just
comes alive.  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, he's been playing really well. And Luke got off to a good
start, but I felt really good going with Pat. Something about seniors at the
end of their career, they don't want it to end, and I was going to go with Pat
tonight. Before the game I decided I was really going to give him a good look
and let him decide how his career ended.  
And he came up huge tonight at eight points. He's 4‑for‑4 from the floor, big
buckets, three rebounds, and he was good there.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the task that you now face? I realize
you're just five minutes away from a win, but can you talk about what you're
going to face and how difficult it's going to be?  
COACH BECKER: Obviously, North Carolina is one of the best teams in the
country, roster littered with future NBA stars. So we'll just do what we do.
And this time of year you have to‑‑ every team in this tournament is good and
is here for a reason.  
We're just going to continue to play our brand of basketball and just really
guard them with five guys and get back in transition, I know they run really
well, and run our offense and take our chances.  
  
Q. Five years ago you were a director of basketball operations making like
ten grand a year. Now you've won a NCAA Tournament game. Can you talk about
how much has changed and how much have you overcome in five years?  
COACH BECKER: Everything's changed. I can't thank enough the people that got
me to where I am today. My parents are in the back there. Had to borrow money
from them a couple of years ago, 38‑year‑old man with a couple of kids, to
realize a dream. And that's what family is for.  
And I'm a lucky man to have parents that supported me like that. And a wife
that was willing to go for this plan. And now it's coming up aces. But
everything's changed.  
I gotta thank Mike Lonergan for giving me the opportunity to come up here and
work for him. I learned a lot under him and he's a great coach.  
I'm just a very fortunate man to have a lot of people that love me, support
me, and give me opportunities.  
  
Q. John, your assessment about Four McGlynn, a rookie coming up that big on
such a big stage?  
COACH BECKER: He's not a normal freshman. He's got a lot of confidence. He
came in, hit his first shot on the very first play, and he was just really,
really good all game.  
He's just‑‑ I thought the big‑‑ one of the biggest plays in the game was late
in the game when they were making their comeback. They got under 10. We were
struggling. Shot clock was going down, Four got down to the baseline, shot
fake, got the guy in the air, jumped into him, got to the free‑throw line, and
I thought that really stemmed the tide a little bit and stopped their run.  
But he's a special player, and he's not your normal freshman. And I can't wait
to have him for another three‑plus years.  
  
Q. Your defensive effort today against a Lamar team that was averaging well
over 70 points a game?  
COACH BECKER: It's a continuing trend. The last seven games of the year we had
only given up 51points a game. Championship game was 29percent to a Stony
Brook team, today to a very good Lamar team, 33percent shooting.  
We just continue to‑‑ guys have bought in to understand that defense, and
rebounds is going to win us a lot of games and win us these games at the end
of the year.  
It's a team effort, when you get great help from our post guys. And tonight
Lamar's a very good rebounding team. They're aggressive, they're tough in
there.  
And early in the game, I thought the first half they got too many offensive
rebounds, getting all the 50/50 balls. Second half we did a better job with
that, and so that was one of the keys to the game.  
That's been our key all year is guard and rebound, and we'll figure out a way
to score enough points.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Lamar student‑athletes Anthony Miles and Mike
James.  
Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously the nation ‑‑ you guys got a lot of attention nationally when
Coach went off a few weeks ago. Can you just talk about the players' response
to that and what it did for the team, and just maybe your own personal
response to what happened?  
ANTHONY MILES: I just think our team responded in a positive way. And I know I
said this a lot of times when he did what he did, we could have curled up and
balled up in a corner and quit, but we never did.  
It kind of just made us‑‑ forced us to come together stronger and show the
world that we've got a really, really good team.  
MIKE JAMES: I think, like, it just made us come together, really. I think it
was a turning point in the season. It was either do or die, and we just
decided to keep going on.  
  
Q. Prior to, let's say, 48hours ago, what could you have told me about
Vermont? What did you know about them?  
ANTHONY MILES: That they're an NCAA team. They're really patient on offense.
And I got a chance to check them out when they was playing their conference
championship, and they're a good team and they're real patient and they're
well coached. And I'm just looking forward to playing them.  
MIKE JAMES: To be honest, I didn't watch the game in the conference. I didn't
know much about them; I just knew they were in the tournament.  
  
Q. Looking at Vermont, are there any other teams on the schedule that you
played this year that you can kind of compare them to and how so?  
ANTHONY MILES: If anybody, I could compare them to SFA in our conference.
They're real deliberate on what they want to do. They're not going to take too
many chances. They're really patient with the ball. They set their screens and
they're well coached. And it's a face in our conference, so I think we're well
prepared for their style of play. And we have to follow the report, and, if we
do, we'll be just fine.  
  
Q. Mike, where were you at when you saw Coach's rant that went off? Did you
see it on YouTube later? Just watch it on ESPN? Take me through where you were
at and what your initial reaction was, maybe seeing it coming or something
like that.  
MIKE JAMES: Me personally, I still haven't watched it, to be honest. Everybody
told me about it. I haven't watched it. I'm not a big media person. I don't
read into stuff like that. I haven't paid attention to it. I just try to play
basketball.  
  
Q. Did you hear anything about it?  
MIKE JAMES: Yeah, people call you, tell you stuff about it. But you gotta move
on. It's not part of the game. We're here to play basketball. We're not here
to join in all that.  
  
Q. Coach Rock is here with USF, just by coincidence have him here. Have you
had a chance to see him and what it's like to see him here this week?  
ANTHONY MILES: We haven't seen him here or nothing like that, but I'm looking
forward to seeing him. That's my guy. That's our coach. He's the one who came
and got us to come to Lamar. So we are excited to see him. We're happy for him
the things they did in South Florida.  
So it is good to reunite with our old coach. We all are human. We feel bad it
couldn't have been with him here. But things happen and we're happy that we're
all having successful seasons this year.  
MIKE JAMES: Like he said, we haven't seen him yet, but I'm excited to see him
personally. I haven't seen him in a long time. Like he's the dude that came
and got me, so I'm excited to see him.  
  
Q. Anthony, for those that don't get to see you play that much, could you
sort of describe Lamar's brand of basketball which made the team so successful
this season?  
ANTHONY MILES: I just think we've got a lot of people that can play man. We
have a lot of people, a lot of athletes on our team, we like to hit the glass
hard and we've got people who can put the ball in the hole.  
We're just a real physical, athletic team. And I think sometimes we'll get
caught up and we'll get ahead of teams and we'll let teams back in the game.  
But as of late, I mean, I think we've been doing a good job putting teams
away. Last couple of games we've been averaging 15‑point wins and things like
that.  
So I just think overall as a team we've got a great senior court and we've got
people on our team that will follow us. And I just think that it was a long
season. But at the end, it worked out well.  
  
Q. Last time you guys were in Ohio you played at Ohio State in December and
obviously struggled, had a tough night. What's better about the team now?
Where have you most improved and can you kind of compare where you are now to
where you were when you last came into Ohio?  
ANTHONY MILES: First time we played Ohio, I think that was the first half of
the season. And, like I said, I mean, even it was probably like our 10th or
11th game, it was kind of new, the offense, and just getting acquainted with
each other, where we want to get the ball and get the ball to certain guys and
their hot spots, and I think we weren't good at that.  
I think as the season went by, the offense and the pace we go at is starting
to flow better. We're starting to get the guys the ball where they want the
ball at and when to make a play or when not to make a play.  
And me also, the point guard, I think are also guarding offensive, when to
push it, when not to push it, when we got something good, take advantage of
it.  
And also defensively I think we've come together defensively better and with
helping each other and just communicating on the defensive side.  
So I just think we matured since we played Ohio State in Ohio last time we
were here.  
  
Q. Mike, you said on Sunday you were concerned that playing this first
‑round game, or play‑in game that people call it, might not seem like a real‑‑
the true NCAA Tournament experience. But now that you're here, how do you
feel?   
MIKE JAMES: I mean, they treat us well out here. It's like nothing I've ever
been a part of. And they showed us a good time. I mean, I'm having a fun time
being here. It's a nice experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
We're joined by Lamar head coach Pat Knight. Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously what happened a few weeks ago with your team has gotten so much
national attention. We haven't had a chance to talk to you. Can you rehash
just what this team ‑‑ how it's responded to that night and the fact that you
guys are actually in the tournament now?  
COACH KNIGHT: The main reason‑‑ I didn't do it to get national publicity. I
had a guy try to debate me this morning like we're on Crossfire, and that's
not why I did it. I hung up on the interview. As a coach you have to make
decisions that aren't going to be popular with the media or the fans. But if
you listen and worry about that, you're going to be sitting with them before
long.  
And so no one knows your team better, the temperament of the team, than the
head coach. And this is a different group. I suspended three starters
throughout the year for a total of seven games, and we're 6‑1\. Usually you'd
be about 1‑6\.  
And these are a tough group of kids. And, I mean, you can tell by the way we
play defense and rebound, and we've had a great year altogether, but it got to
the point‑‑ and to sum it up, on a Wednesday we won our 17th game, clinch
going to the conference tournament. And our next game was George Mason. And I
had a friend in town tell me: Hey, Coach, I'm worried that this team will give
up. They've given up the last three years the last two weeks of the season.
And you need to check the records. Plus, since they've already made the
conference tournament, this could be it for them.  
I want more for them than just making the conference tournament. Plus we still
had a chance to win 20 games, which they hadn't done in'88. I still thought we
could win the division. I thought if we got things going, we had a shot to
make a run at the tournament.  
But I checked the records. They lost three years ago, three out of four. Then
four out of four. Then three out of four last year. But we're going to George
Mason, playing the bracket buster.  
We get to George Mason that morning. I got my two centers, starting center and
backup center, missed the morning meeting and breakfast. Two of my starting
guards missed morning meeting and breakfast. Then the centers are ten minutes
late for the bus to go to shootaround, and then my two starting guards missed
the bus to go‑‑ they missed the bus to go to the shootaround. Have to get a
cab to get there.  
So suspended the center for the game, because I had warned him about something
that happened in the game before.  
Benched the backup center. Benched the two starting guards for about ten
minutes of each half. Well, now after the game I probably should have
suspended somebody else. But I thought, hey, we got two weeks left, let's
just‑‑ hey, you guys served your punishment; let's move on.  
Monday, guys missed weights in the morning. So I had to run them after
practice. Tuesday, we had three seniors that didn't get their study hours in.
So I got to run them Tuesday. And then Wednesday we don't even show up to play
the game. We start out playing 1‑for‑19\. It's Alumni Night. So now with four
games to go, and I know it happened in the past, we're 0‑1\.  
So I met with the staff beforehand. We've done everything. It's a long year.
So you've done everything from hug these guys, love these guys, hate these
guys, yell at these guys. Run them, suspend them.  
And you've tried everything you can to motivate them. So I told our guys I'm
going to do something‑‑ and trust me, I thought it would just stay in
Beaumont.  
But I'm going to take heat for it. There will be people that disagree, which
is fine. But I'm going to call these guys out to the media, because I think
they'll respond. And so that's why I did it.  
And then the next day, you know, Anthony Miles comes in, apologizes to me for
the things that had gone on the last couple of weeks. All the seniors show up,
shoot extra that day. And then we usually don't practice on Thursday. We had a
practice like we had on Monday, best practice we had in a month.  
So they started to get it. And plus I have six kids thatit wasn't just the
play on the basketball court; it's missing the study hours and the classwork.
I want six guys to get a degree.  
So it's not just to finish the season strong, we still have a couple of months
to go to get their degrees. And I just thought they could take it. Now, did I
think they'd win six in a row? No. I was just hoping to finish strong and
finish strong academic‑wise.  
You've got to give these guys credit. I mean, I was on cruise control for the
last six games. I didn't have to coach, really. They were telling me things:
Hey, Coach, we can switch this, we can do this on offense or defense. And it
was a joy to see these guys.  
The seniors were talking. I mean, they're an extension of the coaching staff.
And I took a chance. And I have no problem if people disagree. But it's not a
debate. I didn't do this as a debate. I did it because I thought it was the
best thing for my guys. And to see the look on their face after we won the
division was unbelievable.  
But then the look on their face and how happy they were after we won the
conference tournament, it was all worth it. All the heat I got, it was worth
it, because that's something these kids‑‑ greatness, no matter how brief, is
something you'll carry for the rest of your lives.  
These kids are going to be better for it in the long run to have that
experience. And when I took this job, this was a group of kids that people
didn't like in town. I mean, I had people telling me I should get rid of this
kid or that kid, but I took the job because I thought I had a good group of
kids that could win.  
And I wanted them‑‑ and I talked to them about it all year: You can either be
the group that leaves and they're happy you're gone, or you can be the group
that got its head in the right direction.  
And that's what this group is. This group has put a stamp on this program and
they made Lamar basketball relevant again.  
  
Q. When you got done speaking seven games ago, were you confident that they
would respond, or could they have gone the other way?  
COACH KNIGHT: Oh, yeah, I could have had a mutiny. That's the thing. I screwed
up at Texas Tech. One, obviously I didn't win enough games. And I put up with
too much BS and I coached scared. What I mean by coach scared, you worry about
the consequences and not the result. I said I'll never do that again. I'm the
guy that gets fired and all the good coaches put their neck on the line.  
I played for one. And growing up, Coach Krzyzewski, Coach Donoher that lives
here in Dayton, I mean, I've been spoiled, been around great coaches that took
chances. And I said when I get my second job I'll never do that again.  
But, yeah, that night you're thinking‑‑ boy, I mean, I wouldn't have been
surprised if I was the only guy that showed up with my assistants and we had
to play two on two against each other.  
But it went the other way, and I really thought it would go the other way,
because these kids really want to win. They've actually been coachable.  
And I'm dealing with a different type of athlete. I wouldn't have done it if I
had a bunch of freshmen. I wouldn't have done it if I had soft players. I
don't think you could do it at a bigger school.  
Like I've said, these kids haven't been coddled by AAU coaches, or I didn't
buy these kids. None of these kids have a street agent. These are blue‑collar
kids that have a chip on their shoulder that didn't get recruited by the
bigger schools.  
And I think you can‑‑ this is the purest level left, is at a smaller school,
because you can really coach these kids. You can mentor them. And for some of
these kids, I'm the only male figure they've had in their lives.  
So a lot of that goes into it. I think about what my dad did. I was a pain in
the butt as a player. My dad kicked me off. I got in trouble for drinking, got
kicked off the team. Imagine that tough‑love situation there, having to go
tell your dad. You get out of jail and you gotta go knock on his office door
and tell him what you just did.  
So I've been through it. And I see myself in these guys, but what got me
through it is I had a coach that had no problem putting foot to butt. And I
got my degree and now I'm a head basketball coach. And I wouldn't be here if I
weren't for my dad, and I had the same type of coaches in prep school and high
school.  
So it could have gone either way. But I was willing to take that chance
because I didn't want this season to fall apart.  
  
Q. What was your father's reaction when you talked to him after that post
‑conference tactic?  
COACH KNIGHT: He understood why I did it, because he's been around my team,
but he‑‑ and I'll clean it up a little bit: Don't ever do it again.  
But he understood why I did it, because he was like: You have a different
group of kids, tough kids that respond to kind of drastic punishment. But
you've done it. Don't do it again.  
But then it was that day of practice: Don't raise your voice, don't yell at
them, don't use‑‑ and I know you guys won't believe it‑‑ don't use bad
language. You've got to coach them. You've done your part trying to motivate
them, so now you've got to coach them up.  
So we just went into that practice like it really didn't happen. And just had
regular practices trying to coach these guys. Then we won our first game. He
was elated, but he kept on reminding me: You can't ever pull that card again.
It's kind of a last‑draw deal.  
And I made it to him. I was like: Dad, I could coach another 20years and I
don't think I'll have a team with this type of makeup where you could really
do that.  
But he was being a father. And he understood, but he didn't totally agree with
me.  
  
Q. What's different in your team, not just from them, but when you came in
to play Ohio State in December, you guys were struggling and that was a tough
night. But what's different from the team at the beginning of the year to
now?  
COACH KNIGHT: Confidence. Actually, that game gave us confidence. I think when
you play teams like Ohio State and Kentucky, Louisville on the road, and in
front of those crowds, it gives you confidence.  
And this is a confident group. And so it really helped us from a standpoint
winning on the road. We won a lot of games on the road this year. And that's
hard for any team.  
And I think this team's better defensively. I think they're tougher mentally.
But you have to go through all that stuff in the preseason.  
And I think it proves by the way I responded, by what I did. But if you look
at the season all year long, they had a pretty good year. But it was like
every two or three weeks we'd have a slip‑up, but I think these guys get it.  
Our leadership is unbelievable now. Used to have to come from the coaches. And
I think the guys finally got used to winning, that's tough too. When you
haven't won, how do you handle winning, having winning streaks. Because we had
five or six winning streaks this year.  
But now I think they've matured enough where they handle winning, kind of
expect it, and want to keep on winning and don't get caught up kind of
relaxing or getting the big head now if they win a game.  
  
Q. What are some of your impressions on Vermont after seeing them on film a
little bit and scouting them?  
COACH KNIGHT: I don't like them because they remind me of two teams we had
problems with in our league. They remind me a lot of Stephen F. Austin and
Nicholls State. I love the way they run their offense. They run the flex
offense, but they read out of it.  
They take their time. They always have three or four shooters out there at a
time. You can tell they're well coached. You know, they run their offense
around like the Indiana teams I had, Brian Evans, Pat Graham, guys that could
really shoot it.  
But the problem is those are teams that have given us problems, teams that
take their time, don't make mistakes. So we're going to have to, one, guard
the shooters, stay in the stance for 35seconds, try not to make mistakes. And
we need to try to speed it up a little bit. If we can get a steal or a
rebound, we need to push it up. Because with a team like Vermont, what's hard
when you play them, if they get a lead on you, even if it's like six points or
eight points, it's almost double that, 12points, because they take a lot of
time off the clock and are so patient.  
So I admire them as a team, but it's not the type of team I want to play.  
  
Q. You said on Sunday that being here in Dayton you're going to have a lot
of friends and family here. About how many people do you expect, and will your
dad be here?  
COACH KNIGHT: No, Coach has got to work. But I've already talked to him this
morning. He'll have his weekly conversation with Miles today before the game.  
I'll have probably like 50‑some people, but the problem is they're going to
have to buy their tickets. Being in a smaller school, I'm only given four
tickets, take care of family. My mom's coming up, which is good. Some of my
ex‑teammates.  
But that's the only difference. If you're coaching in the Big Ten or Big 12,
you can comp everybody's tickets. The only problem is people will have to buy
their tickets a little bit. But we'll have a big following.  
Plus what's so special about me, Don Donoher, close family friend, and I used
to come over here to Dayton all the time and hang out with his son, Brian, who
was one of my best friends. So being able to come back to the Midwest, but to
do it here in Dayton is special for me.  
  
Q. You made an interesting comment about the players getting it. And I was
just wondering as a coach, obviously victories in the games are great, but is
there almost something special, too, about the victory that comes not in a
game but comes off the court and maybe just seeing these guys do get it?  
COACH KNIGHT: That means more. It's great we got to the NCAA Tournament. Don't
get me wrong. But if we didn't make this run and they just got it, it would
have been just as satisfying for me, because this is what I was taught. You
can only play basketball for so long. Eventually you're going to be told you
can't play a kids game anymore.  
I want these guys to be successful. Just like we were at Indiana, after you
play. And for them being able to get it, even if we didn't make this run, it's
going to help them when they get a job. Going to help them when they raise a
family. That's the main thing. And I'm going to be with these guys‑‑ I'm there
for them the rest of their lives and will try to help them out.  
And I think coaches overlook that. I mean, there's so many kids I've talked to
coaching the minor leagues: When is the last time you talked to your head
coach? And for many of them it's the last time they played. Or if they weren't
one of the star players, they never talked to them.  
What my dad taught me and guys like Coach Krzyzewski, you almost get more
upset with your guys after they play for you when they're in real life and
they screw up.  
Because in college you get second chances, third chances, because you're a
kid. But in real life you don't get that. You get fired and you lose your job.  
So I think jobs as coaches‑‑ especially at a smaller school, the chances of my
guys going to the NBA isn't that high. So I want them to have success and be
able to fulfill their life. This is only one‑fourth of their life. They still
have three‑fourths left. And I think too many coaches treat kids like cattle
and once they're done with you, especially the ones that play a lot for you.  
But I treat No.1 through 13 the same. And when they come play for me, I'm not
their buddy. I'm not a player's coach, never played for one. But I will be
their best friend when they leave. That's what I mean by getting it. It's so
nice to see it. Now when they're off on their own, I don't have to worry about
them as much.  
  
Q. When you were coaching in Columbus, were you dead set on being a coach
the rest of your life, or were you kind of like feeling it out seeing if you
liked doing this or that point in your life, where were you?  
COACH KNIGHT: I was dead set. I got in the minor leagues because when I worked
for the Phoenix Suns right after college for Dick Van Arsdale as a gofer. And
I loved being with the NBA team. But I missed the competition.  
And so Mr.Van Arsdale is like the only thing that's as close to playing is
coaching. So I liked the pro game at the time, so they helped me get involved
with CBA and USBL and IBL, all those different leagues I coached in. But then
I found out the problem is at that level there's not a lot of coaching; you're
a sports psychologist.  
I actually had to call a timeout‑‑ we were playing in Minneapolis in the IBA,
I had two guys arguing because one guy stole the girl away from him that he
was working on all night at the bar. I had to pull the one guy out of the
game. That's the stuff you're dealing with. It's total psychology stuff.  
So my dad, he'd come to a couple of those games: I see what you're doing, but
you gotta get to college. Now that you've proven to me, you've gone off on
your own‑‑ he did not want me to get into coaching. I took these jobs in the
minor league on my own. When I finally proved I wanted to coach, that's when
he brought me back to Indiana. He said: You gotta get in the college game.
He's like: Pat, you're just a psychologist dealing with those guys at that
level. You need to come back where you can make a difference and actually
coach.  
So after one year with the Suns, I was pretty much dead set on getting into
coaching.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

BYU  78  
Iona  72

  
THE MODERATOR: Right now we're joined by BYU student‑athletes Brock Zylstra
and Noah Hartsock as well as head coach of BYU Dave Rose.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH ROSE: What an exciting game. I thought that the first 15minutes of that
game was really fast‑paced and Iona was really good. It was hard for us to
even catch them. They're good in transition. They were really active
defensively. We turned the ball over. They were good after we made baskets.
They raced it back on us and scored.  
We had to make some real adjustments defensively in those first 15minutes and
it didn't pay off until later. We started sending three back to try to slow
down their break. But those guards are really good. They're fast. They're
talented as far as their ability to drive the ball, score the ball, dish the
ball, shoot the ball.  
So it was tough. It was tough for us early. And the start of the second half,
kind of the same way, where we turned it over. But our guys fought. We fought
hard. We fought all game long.  
And we got a big win. And I'm really happy for our players.  
  
Q. Noah, this was the largest comeback in NCAA Tournament history. Can you
just talk about how it feels to be a part of that?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: You know, it's part of that March Madness I think and it's a
team that's worked hard all year. Never given up on anyone. And we just came
out here and we got down early but we're just trying to make adjustments.  
Coaching staff did a great job helping us, and players got out there, competed
and played as hard as they could.  
  
Q. Did you notice a difference when you became more aggressive with that
zone? Can you just talk about how that disrupted them offensively?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: When we got out there, we played a lot of zone this year. I
think we felt very comfortable in it. We were just trying to be active. We
started getting our hands on loose balls and tipping it. We just started
getting that momentum and confidence. That's what helped us make those runs.
And we were just being really aggressive as a team.  
And when we get in that mode, we become a team that's hard to stop.  
  
Q. Brock, Scott Machado had nine assists in the first half and you held him
to one in just the second half. And you were talking about adjustments. What
kind of adjustments did you make on the team and him in particular?  
BROCK ZYLSTRA: I didn't know that stat. But that's it's amazing. He's a great
player. We knew that coming into the game, that he can score as well as pass
the ball. He gets people open right under the basket in position to score.  
I think, like Noah was talking about, that we just were more aggressive. We
were doing to them what they were doing to us in the first half, getting hands
on balls and trying to just knock things away and just being more aggressive.  
So I think that contributed to that quite a bit with his one assist. But just
aggressive‑‑ aggression on the defensive end in the second half is what helped
that.  
  
Q. Noah, any part of you wondering if maybe President Obama should have
stuck around and seen you guys made history, were you thinking that after the
game?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: I started looking around and didn't see him. But I'm sure he
had some important things to take care of.  
But it was just great just being here at the game and just grateful that we
could man together and get a win.  
  
Q. Noah, how much did that little run you make right before halftime play
into the confidence that you guys had at halftime? And then can you kind of
share with us what was said in the locker room at halftime by the coaches?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: Yeah, I think that gave us a lot of confidence, making a little
run there, and we talked about it at halftime, Coach Rose, talking about how
that 15‑point lead wasn't safe, either we were up 15 or they were up 15, that
the style of the game that was being played, that a comeback could happen.  
We just focused on chipping it down, trying to get it 12, and trying to get it
at 10 at the 12‑minute mark and get it to six points. And we just kept doing
that little by little going on runs. And it really helped with our confidence
and the momentum swing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Dave, you were in this position against Gonzaga about a week ago and
couldn't come close to even getting a rally like that, what was the difference
tonight with the guys?  
COACH ROSE: I thought the pace of the game early was really fast. And the
challenge for us would be to fight through that and find a second wind where
we could keep that pace the entire game. And that was what I think was a big
difference for us. And one of the reasons I'm so proud of these players is it
wasn't like we just went on a 7‑, 8‑, 9‑possession run where we just made shot
after shot after shot.  
We had a lot of disappointing offensive possessions that we still had to react
to positively on the defensive end. And that shows some real character from
the guys.  
And I think that they were maybe a step slower in the second half for whatever
reason, which helped us. But a huge key for us was to try to control their
penetration, because when they got inside of our zone, they just kind of
torched us. And I think we did a better job in the second half of not letting
them in the seams of our zone.  
  
Q. On Sunday you talked about character of this team. Seeing what they've
done throughout the season, seeing the hardships they've overcome that maybe
not everybody else that watches them on TV has seen, now to set a record
coming from behind like this, what does that say about their character, not
just your seniors or team leaders, but guys who are role players too?  
COACH ROSE: Coming back from 25points down is really satisfying now that we've
won. At the time it wasn't that satisfying being down 25. But I don't think
that any one of us, especially our coaching staff or our players, doubted the
fact that we could chip into that lead.  
If we could get‑‑ and we're going to have to be very fortunate to be able to
get the lead. But when we got that thing down to‑‑ I think it was 10 and then
we got a steal, hit a big 3, got it to 7, and they called timeout, the look in
our players' eyes at that time was game on, we got a chance here, and we were
able to finish it off.  
  
Q. You played Damarcus Harrison way more than he's played lately, obviously
rewarded you with the 12points. Can you just talk about your decision to play
him, why you played him so much and how it paid dividends?  
COACH ROSE: I think that the break, the eight or nine days without a game,
really helped Damarcus in practice. We talked coming here, when we got the
information that we were going to be in the NCAA Tournament and our first
staff meeting, we talked about Damarcus and how well he had practiced. And I
think a lot of times you get so caught up in preparing for the next game that
practices are difficult, especially for young players that haven't played the
game before.  
And I think that break where we weren't preparing for another team, we were
practicing. We were really worrying about ourselves, and Damarcus had a couple
of really good practices early, and then the last three practices he was one
of the best guys on the floor.  
So I told you all along he's a really good player and I think his confidence
really grew tonight. But he stepped up in a really big‑time atmosphere and had
a great game, and a lot of that has to do with preparation.  
  
Q. I know last year you used a lot of zone to help protect Jimmer a lot. Is
it something that you've continued to use a lot through this year, or was that
an anomaly that you threw out there tonight?  
COACH ROSE: We've played more zone this year than probably we've ever played
in the six years we've been together as a staff. And a lot of that was we were
having a hard time keeping our big guys in the game. We were in foul trouble a
lot. That was a huge part of this game, the fact that there weren't very many
substitutions on our bench based on foul trouble, foul issues.  
But that zone has gotten better and better for us all year long. We play so
many new players, especially early in the year, and we're trying to win and
our man‑to‑man is pretty complicated with our assignments and rules, and we
played that zone quite a bit early.  
And with Brandon, as good as he is in the middle of that zone, as long as he
is, as good as he is rebounding and challenging shots, it actually had us look
more and more at playing zone and we kept winning games, and so we kept
playing it.  
Tonight was good, really good in the second half.  
  
Q. How maybe extra happy were you for Brandon Davies tonight considering he
wasn't able to play in the tournament last year?  
COACH ROSE: There's a time‑‑ one of the timeouts where I think Brandon took
the ball from half court and dribbled it on the break and charged, and it just
was not him. It's not what he does. And I kind of brought him over at the
timeout and just explained some things to him about how important it was for
him to play well for us, but for himself; that he waited for such a long time
and worked so hard to be in this situation, let's at least play like you play
and make the plays you make, and I think he settled down from there.  
And I'm happy. I'm really happy for him. He's been through a lot, but he's
been terrific through the whole thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by student‑athletes Harper Kamp and Jorge
Gutierrez.  
  
Q. Jorge, can you talk about what you feel like you guys need to do
different or better offensively to sort of get going again after the last few
games where you probably haven't played as well as you like?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: I think we need to be a little more aggressive. We saw tape
on USF, and we know they're pretty physical, pretty big. So I think we need to
help each other be physical, physical as well.  
HARPER KAMP: I agree. I think we just need to play with a better amount of
confidence and just get back to doing the things we know we can do well.  
  
Q. Jorge, the South Florida team prides itself on defense. And you look at
their stats, they keep scores low. You're the Pac ‑12 Conference Defensive
Player of the Year. How much of a challenge do you take with that, with that
title that you're bringing to this game, that Cal can play good defense as
well?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: Like I say, we watched a little bit of tape, and one of the
characteristics is that they're physical. They're in a great conference, and
they're big, they're physical.  
We just need to match their intensity and play together.  
  
Q. Jorge, of the teams you've played this year, is there a team that their
personality, their style, offense and defense, is there a team you faced this
year that you would compare them to?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: I don't think so. I think it's going to be the first team
that‑‑ we thought it's going to be a real challenge on the physical side of
the game.  
We're excited for the challenge, and we'll see what happens.  
  
Q. Harper, you mentioned a minute ago ‑‑ you said this on Sunday as well‑‑
you guys have lost a little bit of confidence lately. How does that happen
after playing so well for most of the year and how do you get it back at this
point in the season?  
HARPER KAMP: I think the last few games of our season were pretty tough. We're
playing against teams that know us really well and are able to play against us
and get a chance to play against us offensively.  
So we've just got to get back to things we were doing during the beginning of
the season, just setting up our cuts really well offensively and helping each
other get open, helping each other gain some confidence and just see the ball
go in a few times and just keep up our aggression.  
  
Q. Victor Rudd is from Los Angeles. He said he knew a couple of you guys
from high school. Do you remember playing against him or know of him from high
school, before that, at all?  
HARPER KAMP: Not from high school. But I do remember‑‑ I think he was at
Arizona State University, and I do remember him from there, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach Montgomery talked about the other day that you guys may be tired,
partly because of the depth issue. How have you looked in practice, the
limited practice you've had so far, and do you think that can even be an issue
at this point in the season?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: This is a new season, I feel like. This is a challenge for
us, and I think the playing time or practice time, it doesn't matter at this
point. We're excited to be here, and we're just going to play the way we do.  
  
Q. I know you only through the stories over the years, going way back. Is
there a sense of because you're where you are in your career now that this is
more important than anything up to this point? Do you have some sort of
finality feeling to this last run here?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: I feel like it's important to all of us. It could be our last
game. But we don't see it that way. We just came here to compete and to have
fun. We're just trying to enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. Harper, can you talk about the matchup inside with their front court
guys; they look like they have some length and size?  
HARPER KAMP: They definitely do. Still watching film, but from what I've seen
so far, big guys, physical guys, and guys that really work hard to get
position. I think that's one of the things that I've always focused on trying
to do as a big.  
So it's going to be tough. Going to have to work throughout an entire
possession, because they like to use the shot clock, and it's just going to be
one of those games we're going to have to grind it out down low.  
  
Q. Jorge, it appeared that you guys have played with feeling like there's a
lot of pressure on you in recent games, but today you look very relaxed, very
comfortable and talk about having fun. Are you feeling more relief at this
point being here, are you feeling like you can be a different player right now
because of that?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: Yeah, I mean we made it. Every team in the country feels like
they're glad to be here. And, like I said, we're just trying to be fun, trying
to enjoy the time we still have together as a team.  
  
Q. Jorge, the Pac ‑12 did not receive much respect nationally. Do you take
any responsibility or a sense that we have to show the rest of the country
that this conference is not as bad as it's perceived nationally? Do you think
about that at all, or at this point does that even matter?  
JORGE GUTIERREZ: I don't think it matters anymore. We get a chance, and we get
a chance to prove that we can play with anybody in the country. And, like I
said, we're just here to have fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
We're joined by head coach of Cal, Mike Montgomery. Questions?  
  
Q. What's the state of your team after losing three of the last four games
to close the season and ‑‑  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Chronicle the losses for us, if you would, please.  
  
Q. Want to know what the mental state of your team is now with this
opportunity compared to the end of the season.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: We're happy to have an opportunity. Obviously it wasn't a
given, as it turns out. We're just happy to have the opportunity.  
As I told our team yesterday on the practice floor, there's 280 DivisionI
basketball teams not playing in the NCAA Tournament. So we've got to relish
the thing a little bit.  
I don't think anything that we've not done recently has been from lack of
effort. So it was all we can do is go out and put our best foot forward and
play hard and play the kind of basketball we need to win.  
So it was a long trip yesterday in terms of just getting here and
logistically. So hopefully the day off today and we can have good crisp
practice tomorrow.  
South Florida is a good team. They're physical. They're strong. They've
obviously tested having played in a team that obviously was very well thought
of, with ten bids out of the league.  
So we know they're going to be ready.  
  
Q. Just the opposite of not putting in the effort, it appears sometimes
recently that your team is trying almost too hard, but today these guys looked
pretty relaxed. Are you getting a sense of that from them?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, if you look at it from the standpoint of the kids, as
John so adroitly pointed out, the three losses in the last four games, the
first two were for the conference championship on the road. The third one was
for the Pac‑10 championship in a neutral. So it's not‑‑ they're not givens.
They were hard games, games where people were very competitive.  
Here it's kind of a reward for the job that these kids did for an entire five
months. I mean, they're here. They've earned that right. And now it's lose or
out. And they know that.  
Not that there's not a lot riding on the game, because there certainly is, but
it's a different sort of feeling. And maybe there's less pressure from the
standpoint of, geez, if we win this, we win the Pac‑12\. If we win this, we go
to ‑‑ now it's let's just go play.  
  
Q. Your teams have been known for their defense over the years. I just want
to ask you what you like or what you appreciate about just the priority that
USF puts on its defensive play.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: I think it's smart. You can win with defense. They've got
some really good athletes. They've got some size. They've got some strength.
And in that league I don't know that right off the top that they probably felt
that they were going to have the most talent of anybody, at least I know
they've not been in the league a long time.  
So you're in a league that's got great basketball history. So Stan figured,
look, let's go defend first, let's use our size, our strength, maybe our
length, and try and defend and give ourselves the best chance to win. And
that's obviously worked for him.  
The other thing I would say, if I'm not mistaken, I think Stan worked for Izzo
at Michigan State. So after about ten minutes there he probably figured out
that he better know how to play defense. So, to his credit, they've done that.  
  
Q. Your players and USF players mentioned we don't have to play around
conference anymore. In your many years, is that more of a tactical relief or a
psychological relief? Which outweighs which?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Are you asking about the officials?  
If you have things that you like to do by the time you get to the second game
in a conference or a third game in a tournament, you know, they're going to
take away certain things. They're going to work real hard. I don't know that
in a one‑day prep or maybe two‑day prep, which is what we've had, that you're
going to kind of have to go play straight up. So you maybe feel like whatever
you do best you might get a chance to do it every now and again.  
And maybe there's the issue of how you're treated, maybe South Florida feels
like, gosh, we're not one of the premiers, or people don't treat us as one of
the premiers in the league so you don't feel like you get a shake. I don't
know. Those things are all kind of coach‑speak.  
But, yeah, you're going to go out and play and hopefully you're going to get a
chance to do what you do. You're not going to have people jump into spots that
before you even get there necessarily, the scout's going to be a little bit
more difficult in terms of the prep time.  
So it kind of clears that away a little bit and allows you to just go play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup up front and also your impressions of
their point guard?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Point guard is really good. He kind of stirs the drink. He
has the ball in his hands an awful lot. He's great at splitting doubles.  
He's really good in the paint. He's a very good mid‑range player. He's an okay
3‑point shooter, but that's not really what he does, just based on the number
that he's taken this year.  
But they run a ton of pick‑and‑rolls, with big, strong screens, and he's able
to take advantage of that and get in the paint, and he's over 50percent when
he gets there.  
So that will be a tough matchup. Victor Rudd was‑‑ I mean, he's a Southern
California kid or at least California kid. We watched Victor in high school.
He was at Arizona State. We know all about him. He's very, very talented, can
score it in bunches, and that's a tough matchup.  
He's taken the majority of the 3s for them. Inside, they're big, strong.
Obviously we've watched‑‑ and of course you're also talking about Big East
basketball. They want position. They're going to get it. And bodies fly.  
So we're going to have to be pretty solid down inside there. They're going to
have a size advantage inside. They don't play above the rim, necessarily,
inside, but they definitely can earn a spot and hold it with good, solid
low‑post play.  
It's going to be a tough matchup for, say, David Kravish and maybe Bak in
there just from the standpoint of size, and really a couple of them can step
away and shoot the ball. The kid off the bench‑‑ and I'm not going to try
names; I'll probably mess them up‑‑ that's not starting at the big, he steps
away and shoots the ball. He's their second 3‑point‑shooting kid over
40percent. Fitzgerald I think is his name.  
And so they're big and strong inside, and they like to go in the paint. We've
talked about getting a body on people, and we've kind of been used to being
pushed first and then trying to react back. And it will help us a lot if we
could try to get a body on somebody before we get pushed underneath.  
  
Q. When the players were here a few minutes ago, Jorge seemed relaxed. He
mentioned several times he's here and wants to have fun. Didn't necessarily
hear that during maybe the last half of the season. Do you sense a different
attitude with Jorge with this tournament now?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, again, I think that goes back a little bit to the
amount of pressure. I mean, we've been pretty roundly criticized for being
here winning 24 games. It's like we worked really hard to get where we are. We
worked really hard to have a chance to win the conference.  
And I think at this point they feel like they've earned the right to be here
and maybe the pressure's off. I mean, I'm not going to tell you that we're not
trying to win a national championship. But I think they recognize that the
odds of that happening are not very high. So let's go out and relax and try
and just play.  
And hopefully that's the attitude we have, and hopefully it will open up the
basket for us a little bit.  
  
Q. When you talk about opening up the basket and playing a little better
offensively, is this a difficult team to try to find yourselves against, or is
it more about you guys?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, they protect the basket. I think first and foremost,
you're not going to get in the lane very easily. And if you do, you're
probably not going to remain standing when you get done.  
They move to the ball pretty well. They protect the paint. They protect the
basket. They protect fastbreak opportunities by getting back on defense so
that you don't get the high‑percentage stuff off the break.  
And they're not going to give you a lot of second shots just based on their
size the fact they can defensively rebound the ball.  
So those are things that you try to get because they're high‑percentage
things. So that puts a little more premium on shooting the ball from outside.
So we're going to have to be able to make shots.  
That having been said, they're not going to give you wide‑open looks, but if
we run our offense we think we can get some good scoring opportunities. But
obviously the ball's going to have to go down, which is about performance,
which is always what it's about.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Western Kentucky  59  
Mississippi Valley  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by student‑athletes T.J. Price, George Fant,
Derrick Gordon, and Coach Ray Harper.  
Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH HARPER: Wow. I don't know where to begin. I keep saying about these
young men, they're resilient; they won't quit. They were ready to play some
more basketball.  
I told them after the game that we played totally out of character for about
34, 35minutes of the game. We could never‑‑ and give Mississippi Valley
credit, their defense had a lot to do with that.  
But we just weren't the same basketball team. We were too much one‑on‑one. We
weren't making extra passes. Panicked against some of their pressure. But the
one thing we never did was quit. And we just kept playing.  
And you could see that look in their eye: We're going to do this. And I'm just
happy that we're going to move on, play another basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Derrick, can you talk about another big run that you guys have had that's
probably three in a row now, if you count the Sunbelt tournament, you guys
come back from a double ‑digit lead to take a win towards the end of the
game?  
DERRICK GORDON: We're used to doing it. We did it all throughout the Sunbelt
tournament. No matter how much we was losing by, we were just going to keep on
fighting until the buzzer went off.  
That's something that teams don't know about us: We're going to keep fighting
no matter what's the score. And that's what we kept doing.  
  
Q. George, does this one even surprise you a little bit?  
GEORGE FANT: No, not really.  
  
Q. Seriously, honestly?  
GEORGE FANT: Honestly. I knew my team was going to keep fighting. Even when we
was down. I don't know how much we was down, but we were down about a lot. We
kept fighting.  
So the rest of my teammates keep fighting, keep fighting, we're going to come
back; that's what happened.  
  
Q. T.J., how disappointing would it have been if your season ended like the
first 35minutes of the game if you all played that way for the last five
minutes and went home 15 ‑point losers?  
T.J. PRICE: It wouldn't have felt too good. It would have been bad. Personally
I know I would have cried, personally, that's just how much I love the game.
And I just didn't want to be one and done. That wouldn't have been a good
feeling.  
  
Q. George, can you look back two months ago, Coach's fired. You guys start
that tough start. Just talk about going from there to where you all are right
now tonight?  
GEORGE FANT: Like I've been saying for the longest, we lost our coach. My
team, they stepped up. We got a new coach. He stepped up for the job. And we
played hard.  
We've been playing hard. And we're going to fight, be a tough team. Rebound.
Defend. And just the‑‑ we're going to defend the whole game. That's our goal.  
So we're just trying to play hard, keep advancing.  
  
Q. This touches on his question a little bit, what are some of the
differences in you gentlemen tonight and the way you played tonight at the
very end compared to the way you played early in the season? What was going
wrong then and what is going right now?  
DERRICK GORDON: This is something new for us. This is our first NCAA
Tournament. I mean, the lights is on. I mean, we just was rushing a lot at the
beginning of the game, doing things that we're not normally used to doing. But
at the end of the second half, about five minutes left to go, I mean, we all
just turned that switch on. We just decided that we're just not ready to go
home. We're just going to keep fighting and turn this thing around.  
GEORGE FANT: I think our biggest thing in change was toughness. We're a lot
tougher team, as you've seen these last few games. We make smart decisions
lately. And I have to say we're going to defend you. That's probably the
second biggest thing, we're going to defend you the whole game.  
T.J. PRICE: I'd say what George said, the main thing that was different was
defense. The first practice, with Coach, was the backup coach, first thing he
said: What we're going to do is we're going to play defense. Previously before
the games we was losing. It was close games that came down the stretch, and we
had mistakes come down, bad mistakes on defense, and that's how we lost.  
But now we're playing defense now, and other teams, it's hard for them to
score now. That's the biggest difference. Defense wins games, so that's how
we're winning now.  
  
Q. Derrick, could you sense, then, losing their, I guess, composure down the
stretch, and how much confidence did that give you to come back?  
DERRICK GORDON: Gave us a lot of confidence. Once my teammate O'Karo had a big
steal, went down for the dunk, that all just energized us and gave us a lot of
motivation and got us hyped into the game, and then we got another turnover
and another turnover after that.  
I mean, that's just something that we like to do. I mean, O'Karo, he came‑‑ he
did that a lot in past games, made huge plays and other players made huge
plays after that. That's just something that we do very well and a lot of
people don't know about.  
  
Q. George, what are your thoughts on playing Kentucky next, and from being a
Kentucky guy and probably haven't seen them a lot over the years?  
GEORGE FANT: We won. We're going to advance and we're going to play. We're
going to play defense. We're going to rebound. It doesn't matter what the name
says on the jersey. I mean, even if they're the No.1 team, we're going to keep
playing the way we've been playing. We have a game plan, we're going to
execute it.  
  
Q. Coach said you played out of character for 35minutes. You had the
president sitting on the baseline. If you threw a bad pass, you probably could
hit him. How much was that and just the whole NCAA Tournament ‑‑ how much was
all that part of that being out of character maybe?  
GEORGE FANT: Like you said, the president was in the house. Being in the
tournament the first time with all of our freshmen, it was just a hard
adjustment for us. Once we started getting used to it and just forgetting
about everything and playing our game, then it looked up for us. Obviously we
turned them over a few times and got a few big rebounds and blocks and just
played hard, and it worked out for our advantage.  
  
Q. Derrick, how much are you looking forward to seeing your buddy Michael
Kidd ‑Gilchrist, and are you going to be talking in the days to come?  
DERRICK GORDON: We'll eventually say something to each other while we're on
the court, because, I mean, I haven't seen him in person since I graduated. I
was only able to talk to him on the phone and stuff.  
But at the end of the day we gotta handle our business. They're a great
basketball program. They're No.1 seed. I mean, it's going to be real good to
see them, but when the ball's thrown in the air, that's my enemy right there.  
  
Q. T.J. and maybe you guys can do it, too, just what do you think of
President Obama was watching you all tonight and how it felt or if you noticed
him and just it's not an everyday fan there?  
T.J. PRICE: Well, to me, it really wasn't no different from‑‑ I know he's the
president and everything, but I was just really too focused. To me it was I
know the president was in the house, but he was another fan watching the two
basketball teams going and it had no effect on me. I wanted to play hard and
play for my teammates and make sure we get a win.  
GEORGE FANT: It was a great feeling him being in the house. But just like T.J.
said, once the ball was thrown up, that pretty much went out the window. We
were here to win. That's what we did.  
DERRICK GORDON: I mean, for him to be in the house, it's a crazy feeling.
That's the President of the United States coming to watch our game. But I
really didn't look at him as much while the game was going on because we had
to worry about taking care of our business.  
But we wanted to put on a show. I mean, things didn't work out our way in
35minutes, but it came out the W. I'm sure he liked what he saw.  
  
Q. Derrick, how did you stay focused after missing four free throws and the
shot that could have taken the lead? How did you stay focused in the end?  
DERRICK GORDON: This is not my first time being in that situation. So, I mean,
I can't get down on myself. I mean, this is the NCAA Tournament. It's either
win or go home. So I couldn't dwell on that. I missed four free throws. That
could have been a big changing moment in the game.  
But I wasn't really worrying about it. I kept fighting and I knew we would be
keep fighting as a team we would come away with the victory.  
  
Q. George, have you thought at all about shooting over Anthony Davis?  
GEORGE FANT: No, I just am really ready to play. He's a great player. And I'm
just going to try to be physical and play as hard as I can against him, see
what happens. But as far as worrying about him blocking my shot it's not a big
deal for me. You're not a good player if you don't get blocked sometimes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys are known now for these comebacks, but can you afford to
do that against a team like the No.1 team in the country?  
COACH HARPER: No, we need to get ahead on the opening tip. And the shot clock
break, and we can hold the ball the rest of the game.  
We have it down, get down 13 with about seven minutes to go, and turn the
engines on go play. But hopefully we won't get down that much Thursday
evening.  
  
Q. Just some thoughts about the team that you inherited a few weeks ago.
What did you see in these guys that you've been able to make such a dramatic
turnaround in such a short period of time?  
COACH HARPER: Well, we talked about from day one to not worry about wins and
losses. That will take care of itself. Let's worry about getting better each
day. And anyone that‑‑ these guys, I think they said it as soon as you asked a
question, we really went to work on the defensive end. If we practiced two
hours, an hour and 15minutes of it spent on the defensive end, we must‑‑ we
had to become a good defensive team. If you're going to win this time of year,
you must be able to defend.  
And fortunately those guys bought in. They decided that this is how we're
going to do it. And they've had plenty of chances to quit. They've had plenty
of opportunities to say this is too hard, your practices are too hard, you're
too tough on us, but they didn't.  
You could see them starting to believe. And there's been times where‑‑ when we
took the timeout and we were down 13, I said, guys‑‑ trust me, I didn't say
we're okay, but I did tell them: We're going to win this basketball game. And
you could see the look in those kids' eyes; they believed it. They really
believed they were going to come back and win.  
And I think anyone that's in that huddle knew we were going to make a run at
them. Now, whether we're going to get over the hump, who knows. But I knew we
were going to make a run at them.  
When I looked down the bench and O'Karo Akamune is like, Coach, give me one
shot, that's how smart I am, oh, go get‑‑ I don't know who he took out, 18,
and he's the guy who turned the game around.  
  
Q. You were down 16 with five minutes left. You really thought you could
win?  
COACH HARPER: Absolutely. The final horn hadn't gone off. We're going to
believe until the bitter end. And I think if you're a coach or you're a player
that doesn't believe that, you're in the wrong profession. You need to find
something else to do. Because if I don't believe that we have a chance, I'm
not giving those kids my very best effort.  
And I'll go down with them fighting. Win or lose.  
  
Q. The game on Thursday, kind of two parts, what do you feel like the
atmosphere will be like as far as how many fans you'll have versus Kentucky?
And then second part, just what kind of ‑‑ what does that mean for the state
to kind of have that matchup?  
COACH HARPER: Well, I think it's great. I think we are‑‑ we pride ourselves on
being the best basketball state in the country. We think‑‑ we always say the
best basketball in the country is played in the state of Kentucky.  
And obviously it will be a great crowd. And it's two storied basketball
programs playing against each other.  
We're happy to move along, have an opportunity to play again on Thursday
evening.  
  
Q. You talk about your team's resiliency, but what is it about your team
when they're down by that much late in the game? Does a light click on with
them? Or what is it about them that they can come back like that?  
COACH HARPER: They don't quit. They still believe. We were in one of our
presses, and everybody was in tune. Everybody was rotating at the right time.  
And, again, O'Karo was the guy. I thought he was the one that the light‑‑ that
flipped it. And you could see everyone feeding off of his energy, and
fortunate to make a play at the end to win the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision a little bit to switch up to a more full
court press there in about the past five minutes of the game, and seemed like
you got one steal and got flustered and kept snowballing at the end?  
COACH HARPER: We were out of options. We tried our zone press two or three
times. I probably didn't have the right lineups in there.  
They threw over the top. We helped up when we should have protected the
basket. They got a dunk. So we've been a better zone pressing team than the
man‑to‑man lately. But we thought this is it. We've got to throw it here and
see what happens.  
We knew we had to have O'Karo in the game to make it work. And guys did a good
job. We did a good job of keeping the ball out of 25's hands, and when he did
get it, really doing a good job of trapping him. I think we got a couple of
turnovers on him late as well.  
  
Q. You guys rebounded really well tonight. How much of that is a part of
your normal modus operandi?  
COACH HARPER: That's been something that we really pride ourselves on, that we
talk about. There's only two things we write on the board before every game,
and it's defense and rebounding. And this time of year it's how you win in
advance.  
We turned the basketball over way too much to be able to advance and be
playing. We said one of the keys, handle their pressure and our transition
defense. And we were terrible in both of those areas.  
But thank goodness we were pretty good on the glass and we did an okay job
with our half court defense. We must be much better taking care of the
basketball in about 48hours.  
  
Q. Obviously everybody knows that a 16 has never beaten a No.1. Will you
challenge your team with that or will you not just deal with that at all?  
COACH HARPER: Guys, for right now, we've talked about briefly in the hallway
of how good Kentucky is, and of course we've seen them on television. They may
have the top two picks in the draft. Everyone's picking them to cut down the
nets in New Orleans. So, hey, we're going to roll in there, see what happens.  
We're playing the best basketball team in the country. And I'm just happy that
our kids are going to have that opportunity.  
  
Q. You guys are a No.16 seed. And it's really fortunate for you all to have
two locations that are so close to Bowling Green. Can you speak on just how
fortunate you guys are to be able to play so close to home?  
COACH HARPER: I'm just happy that our fans are able to watch us play. I think
it's important that the last time we were in Portland, Oregon, and it's tough
for the fans to get there. But I think it's great for us. We were excited
about tonight. And I think you saw a lot of red in the arena this evening. And
I think you'll see a lot of red in the arena at the Yum Center on Thursday.  
  
Q. You mentioned Western's got tradition. It's used to going to the
tournament and doing things in the tournament. But what does it mean for the
program for this group of guys to do this right now and for them being young,
just to have this experience?  
COACH HARPER: I think it's huge. It's invaluable. Haven't really talked about
it publicly. But in the confines of the coaches and some mentors, I've really
discussed how much this may mean to these young men in the future. Because
anyone that watched us play could tell we were out of character.  
That's not the basketball team that we've been. I think they got caught up in
the moment. The first time in the NCAA Tournament. Hopefully they'll have this
opportunity again. We've got something to build on. And I've been a part of
some really good things. Some things are really special. And one of the most
important things I thought was you had to have those guys returning to explain
to those new guys how hard you have to work on those days when I'm really
pushing them in practice; that they see the light at the end of the tunnel.  
Next year Derrick Gordon, George Fant, and those guys can tell these guys: We
need to go harder because we're playing for something come March. So I think
it could be invaluable to us in the future.  
  
Q. Just to comment maybe a little on what do you think this game coming up
will be like for Vinny Zollo, who for a long time was kind of known as a guy
who used to be committed to Kentucky and kind of maybe changing his identity
now for you guys and contributing for you guys?  
COACH HARPER: I don't know. I'm sure he's a Kentucky kid for‑‑ all of our guys
are going to be excited, just because we're moving on and continuing to play
in the NCAA Tournament.  
What we don't want to get caught up in is the hype of the one‑on‑one matchups
or Vinny, this guy. But anytime you've got a kid from Kentucky, you've got
Western Kentucky University versus Kentucky, it's going to be a big night for
them.  
  
Q. I asked the players the other day maybe this game might be a benefit
getting the jitters out of the way. Do you think given how the team started
off this game that that might be even more true given they seemed a little
nervous or tentative at the beginning of the game?  
COACH HARPER: I'm glad it's out of the way and we won, because, like I said,
we need to play flawless basketball Thursday night. That means about 28 less
turnovers than we had tonight. Rebounded just like we rebounded it tonight.
Defend better. Shoot it much better than we did and not miss any free throws.  
So, yes, I'm glad we were able to get this one out of the way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

BYU  78  
Iona  72

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now are student‑athletes Mike Glover and Scott
Machado of Iona, as well as head coach Tim Cluess.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH CLUESS: I give BYU all the credit for the comeback they made. They made
shots, they made plays. We had opportunities, but I think we were 1‑for‑15 on
3s in the second half. You're not going to beat anyone that way.  
We've had a couple of these losses this year like that and it really stems
from the fact that when we don't make shots, we're not the same type of team.
We're a small team. They went inside, did a great job of getting it inside and
kicking it back out and making plays.  
So I give them a lot of credit. We weren't good enough in the second half to
withstand that comeback. I think giving up 10 of the points in the first half
in the last four months when Mike got in foul trouble gave them confidence
going into the halftime, and we had a couple of chances when we had it like 12
or 14 in the second half to extend it, and we missed, I can't tell you,
countless layups and foul shots in crucial times and wide‑open, wide‑open
looks.  
You can't do that and win, so congratulations to them and thank you guys for
hosting such a great tournament. Wish we would have put on a better
second‑half performance.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Scott, you guys scored 55points in the first 16 minutes. They get more
aggressive with that zone. Can you talk about how that zone disrupted your
team offensively?  
SCOTT MACHADO: I feel they were pressuring more in the zone. It wasn't just
like a steady zone, just sitting in the zone. They were pressuring the ball.
They were making it hard to get in the lane and make passes into the interior.  
And I take full blame for driving in the lane and not being able to get the
ball to my man, to my teammates, and, I mean, I had five turnovers and one
assist in the second half. And I feel like I could have did a better job at
that.  
  
Q. Scott, everything was working so great in the first half. Can you
describe what you guys were feeling when it seemed like nothing was working
for you guys at all in the second half?  
SCOTT MACHADO: Coach hit it right on the money. When we're not making shots,
it's kind of hard to be able to press like we were in the first half. It's
hard for us to get stops at that end because we're so small. I think the
number was 34, or 24, the one that was hitting all the shots.  
He was just shooting right over us. And his length was just‑‑ I mean, it was
hard to guard. And when we're not making shots, we can't press him. We
couldn't do what we did in the first half. So it messed up our whole game
plan.  
  
Q. Scott, can you just describe what it's like to go through that sort of
dramatic shift from 55points those first 16minutes and then you go through
that tough stretch where I think it's like 10 points over the next 16minutes?
Just talk about that shift and just what that's like.  
SCOTT MACHADO: It sucks. It sucks. I feel like when there's games like this
and we're trying to win a game like this, I feel like we all have to make the
little things happen.  
If we're missing layups and wide‑open shots, there's nothing we can do about
that. We have to make those go down. And if we're not making them go down, we
can't have the second half that we had, what we had in the first half.  
  
Q. Mike and Scott, you had a couple of these earlier in the year and had
some that got away, did you guys feel that you had moved beyond something like
this? Did you feel like you had turned a corner in February where you were
beyond blowing leads of this ilk?  
SCOTT MACHADO: Yeah, I did feel like we did come over that and we haven't had
that happen in a while. I think we kind of forgot how that was. And we just
let this one slip right by us. That's it.  
  
Q. Scott and Mike, can you talk about how you're feeling now now that your
careers are over, and at some point will you look back and think you enjoyed
this experience, but what are you feeling like right now?  
SCOTT MACHADO: Well, for me, when I first got to this program, it wasn't a
winning program. And we built this program up from a 0‑something season, and
then we built it all the way up to a winning program.  
And I was here at the start of that, and with all the coaches that came
through and all the players that they brought into the program helped build
that as well. And I just seen the program change and all the love around the
school and all the community and everybody just coming back to the school and
showing a lot of support for the school, which is an excellent thing.  
And I feel like‑‑ I mean, we accomplished something, but at the end of the day
we lost a big game that we should have won.  
MIKE GLOVER: I would just like to thank Coach Cluess for giving me the
opportunity to even play for the team this year, for Iona College. Me going
out as a senior like this is pretty disappointing.  
I'm just fortunate to play with guys like Scott and MoMo, and this year we've
had history to share as far as bringing the team back to the NCAA since I
think 2006.  
So I'm appreciative and just fortunate to just be blessed with the talent that
I have on this basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys like to play fast, keep the ball moving. It seemed
as when they went into the zone you guys were shooting quickly, not getting a
lot of ball reversal. Was that a big problem for you?  
COACH CLUESS: Absolutely. I think we were holding on to the ball too long. I
think their length stretched us out a little bit more than we like to be
stretched out. We were starting our offense a few steps over half court. I
think they did a good job of that. And we weren't making the extra pass.  
Part of it was like our guards didn't drive the gaps to kick. They stood out
there and just made passes. And even when we threw the ball into a gap, we
didn't reverse the ball quick enough. We just seemed to eat the ball for a
second or two, and that allowed them to recover.  
And they do a great job of recovering with their length and size and moving
really well. And I think we should have been better with the basketball, as
far as movement goes.  
  
Q. Was there a point when you get to a timeout there where it was really
starting to get tense with the guys, and what did you try and do, if so, to
try to turn it around?  
COACH CLUESS: We just tried to talk to them about being in the situation
before and making plays and just trying to still trust each other and not
trying to do things you can't do, but to get more movement going again and to
move the ball better than we had and to also defend better.  
Our pressure hurt them in the first half. Second half we didn't have that many
opportunities to get into it because we didn't score the ball. But when we
did, we weren't as aggressive with it and we just kind of allowed them to get
into their half court sets.  
And, again, a lot of their success came with big size that could just make
plays over us. And when we're not making shots and they're starting to get a
comfort zone, that's a big part of the run of that start because they're
feeling good about themselves.  
We got good looks, we got layups and foul shots and open 3s and open pull‑ups,
and it felt like there was a lid on for all of our guys. It's a point where
these guys have won games for us, we tried them, and I have my trust in that,
I can't go away from that trust because they've done it all year long, outside
of a game here, game there where we've had bad shooting games.  
We know we're built right now to have to make jump shots. So when that's not
occurring for us, we know we're in a lot of trouble. Mike Glover, 6'5", 6'6",
plays his tail off, gives us everything he can. He's very much undersized. You
saw when he got swallowed up inside with BYU's size, and we don't have the
next guy to go to yet in our program. That's an area where we need to address
in our recruiting areas.  
  
Q. Did you play fast enough early to neutralize the height and was that part
of the strategy coming in?  
COACH CLUESS: I thought we did a good job in the first half doing that. We
actually made them I think put two point guards in together at a time and only
have one big in.  
But when Mike got his second foul about four and a half, five minutes to go,
somewhere around that, in the first half, the whole momentum of the game swung
right there.  
The guys who went in for him, they were getting second shots, we weren't
controlling the boards. Early on we did a nice job on the boards and not
getting beat there where it hurt us. That started to turn. And some of those
shots we had that could have kept it a 20‑point game going into the locker
room, which is a whole different mentality, the same guys who were making them
earlier in the half just, unfortunately, missed it that time. It's a game of
streaks.  
We knew or I knew they were going to get better than the way they were playing
in the first half. Obviously we didn't think we would fall off that much.  
  
Q. I'm curious, did you ‑‑ there's nothing obviously you can do about the
height, but did you see in your guys the same tendency sometimes to perhaps
not pass it as much, to not move it as quickly, to try to do a little bit too
much individually that you saw in Fairfield, that you saw‑‑  
COACH CLUESS: In the second half? I saw the decision. I'm not going to say it
was a conscious effort not to do it. I just think some of the decisions we
made were not great decisions. And I think all of our guys gave everything
they had. We didn't make great decisions in execution or delivery of the
basketball.  
And that comes with young men. There's times that every coach has to deal with
this maybe not to this magnitude. And that's our job is to try to get us
better at it and obviously I didn't do my job well enough.  
  
Q. Coach, are you aware that this is the largest comeback in NCAA Tournament
history, and if so does that make it more difficult to maybe put it behind you
knowing it's a part of history now?  
COACH CLUESS: You know what, I said that in the locker room not knowing that,
because I just imagined it probably was.  
And it's going to be one that we have to live with the rest of our lives that
we had an opportunity here to win in advance. And, again, you're looking for
answers out there, looking for guys to make a play and had we been able to
make one or two, even late in the game when it was a game again, we have a
layup point‑blank by one of our better players, he comes up short. We have two
foul shots by him he misses both. You go down to the other end their good
player is drilling it with guys in his face and draped all over him and
knocking him down. And big time players have to make big time plays.  
And we're going to have to live with this one because it's a tough one we let
get away. No excuses. I'm taking all of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 13, 2012

  

### [Kevin Burwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23471)

### [Paul Crosby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23470)

### [Sean Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23469)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Western Kentucky  59  
Mississippi Valley  58

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us are student‑athletes from Mississippi Valley State
Kevin Burwell and Paul Crosby as well as head coach Sean Woods.  
We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Woods, then we'll go to
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH WOODS: Wow. First of all, I'm so very, very proud of my guys. We've had
a historical run. And it's unfortunate that it ended this way. We fought our
hearts out for 35 1/2 minutes, and we just let it slip away.  
But I told my guys in the locker room the same thing that Coach Pitino told us
when I lost to Duke back in 1992, and that was: Don't let this game define
your basketball career, especially here at Mississippi Valley State
University, because you've done‑‑ because you've gone over and beyond the
expectations for a school of our magnitude and the trials and tribulations
that we have.  
And it's a testament to you guys, to my guys, of what they've done. It's
unfortunate the way it ended.  
But it's over now. We can't dwell on that. I'm still proud of these guys. The
same guys that made the mistakes down the stretch are the same guys that
helped me win 17 in a row.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kevin, Western is known for their big comebacks. How much was that part
of the planning going in when you guys had a good lead coming down the
stretch?  
KEVIN BURWELL: Well, during the time I was just trying to tell my teammates to
stay composed because they are known for making big comebacks like that. I was
telling them to stay disciplined and the little things, free throws, and just
boxing out, getting offensive and defensive rebounds like we was doing when we
got that lead.  
I was just trying to keep reminding our team and keep them composed.  
  
Q. Paul, can you just talk about the experience of having President Obama
right there and how that factored into the game and just your thoughts
entering this game?  
PAUL CROSBY: It didn't play too much of a factor. We were pumped for this game
anyways. But them guys, man, they wanted it more than us the last five
minutes, and they deserved to win.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys turned it over a lot late. What was going on there? You
guys got a little frazzled.  
KEVIN BURWELL: Yeah, a couple turnovers can lead into that right there. I was
really trying to compose our guys, getting into our sets before we started our
offense.  
But, unfortunately, we couldn't do that. So that's what happened. We started
turning the ball over.  
  
Q. Kevin, seemed like throughout the game you were kind of gesturing toward
President Obama a little bit. Can you talk about that and just how his
presence may have impacted things for you?  
KEVIN BURWELL: Well, you know, like we said yesterday, I think we had
interviews, we were just putting on a show for him. But at the same time, like
Paul said, we was up for this game. We was already aroused for it. So in the
heat of the moment, I just pointed at him a couple of times. That's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Just in terms of the emotion of this, is it in any way similar to what
you went through as a player?  
COACH WOODS: Highs and lows, man, that's college basketball. The difference is
I'm not playing.  
But I'm proud of my guys. Man, it's been a heck of a run. I'm very
disappointed how it ended. But they fought hard and did some great things to
even put us in this position here.  
  
Q. Sean, how much of this was Western's ability to rally, and how much of it
was your guys' inability to finish it off?  
COACH WOODS: It was a little bit of both. I thought it was just our guys got
rattled, got excited, and got a little bit beside themselves.  
Normally in a situation like that, maybe it's one guy or two. But when it's
all five, it was like a snowball effect. I called a timeout and settled them
down. We beat it a time or two, got to the free‑throw line, and all of a
sudden we went back to it.  
So guys were just trying to make plays. We weren't smart down the stretch. We
had a two on one trying to take it to the rim instead of bringing it back out
because they had to foul us, and we didn't.  
But that's how we play. We wanted to attack and keep on going. And it's hard
to turn a team off when they were going so good. We had a rhythm that was
pretty doggone good today, and all of a sudden that rhythm stopped.  
But you gotta give your hats off to Western. They kept fighting.  
  
Q. Sean, what did you do to prepare these guys for the stage with the
president being here and obviously this being an NCAA Tournament game as
well?  
COACH WOODS: You know, all year long we just take one game at a time. And you
gotta know our situation and our school. Something always going on that
distracts us from the actual game of basketball.  
I tell people all the time, you know, 20percent of our life at our place is
basketball; 80percent is something else.  
We get here today and it was a normal situation. We had to stop. Had to get
checked. Nothing went smoothly because the president's here and everybody's
running around and things like that.  
When we got to the locker room, I said this is something we're used to. And
for the most part we treated it that way. We came in confident, played great
for 35minutes. I mean, we absolutely dominated them for 35minutes and let it
slip out of our hands.  
  
Q. Can you put into words the chance you guys had to play on Thursday to the
stage, the exposure, and all of that for your school that's now slipped
away?  
COACH WOODS: Everybody knows I played at U.K., and there's a lot of history
there and sentimental feelings there. I was only thinking about Western
Kentucky, I promise you, I want to get this game, and then play the No.1 team
in the country. And that was when we were going to have fun and let the chips
fall where they may.  
But this is a game we thought we should have won, could win, and should have
won, and then we were going to go against the No.1 team in the country. But
this was the most important deal up until this point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

### [John Becker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23477)

### [Matt Glass](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23479)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning. We're joined by Vermont student‑athletes Luke
Apfeld and Matt Glass.  
Questions?  
  
Q. Matt, are you surprised to be here, and what is this atmosphere like
jumping into it right now?  
MATT GLASS: It's very exciting for all of us right now. It's an honor for us
to be here. We couldn't be more excited to play, and we're looking forward to
getting on the court tomorrow.  
  
Q. I realize that because the president's here and the prime minister, that
it's changed things for everybody. But is it difficult for you to play a game
in an arena where you have not played before, you won't get a chance to
practice at the UD Arena, I don't think?  
MATT GLASS: It can be a little difficult sometimes. But we're just going to do
our best getting used to the atmosphere tomorrow as quickly as we can. And
hopefully on the first few minutes of the game we can get used to the court a
little bit and settle down.  
  
Q. Matt, how much do you rely on keeping the team focused? It's kind of a
crazy atmosphere situation for everybody. You as a leader of the team, how
much is that part of what you're trying to do today?  
MATT GLASS: We want to stay as focused as possible today. There are a lot of
distractions out here. It's a pretty wild atmosphere, something that we're not
really used to with a lot of younger guys. So it's really important to keep
our focus today to learn as much as we can about Lamar and to prepare as much
as we can for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Luke, obviously you guys just won the title just a couple of days ago.
It's been sort of a whirlwind couple of days. What's been the schedule like
since then and how are you guys able to try to prepare, turn this around
quickly?  
LUKE APFELD: It's been fun, but we know our goal is to win a game in the NCAA
Tournament, make a run. Our season is not over. The guys have been excited
with beating Stony Brook down there and then coming back into to Burlington,
seeing our fans and stuff like that.  
Like Matt said earlier, we've just been trying to stay focused and really live
in the moment and remember that we still have some basketball to play.  
  
Q. Could each of you talk a little bit about Lamar, what you know about
them, what you've heard about them?  
MATT GLASS: We know they're very fast in transition. We know they're very
athletic. They've got a lot of very talented guards. So we're going to have to
work really hard on the defensive end to keep those guards‑‑ limit their
penetration and really have a great defensive effort to try to contain them.  
LUKE APFELD: It's definitely a battle of contrasting styles. But the coaches
have been stressing that we need to play Vermont basketball and do what's made
us successful and gotten us to the point this year that we are at now. Like
Matt said, that's defense and rebounding and execution on offense.  
  
Q. How often is the Syracuse win from 2005 brought up to you guys?  
LUKE APFELD: I know personally I was redshirting the year we last went to the
tournament, two years ago, and we were about to play Syracuse, and we watched
the Syracuse game from a while back before that.  
But it's definitely kind of a standard we hold ourselves to, I think, because
that was a great Vermont team, possibly the greatest ever, and they did some
great things.  
But we're concentrating on ourselves and realize they did great things, but we
hopefully can do great things as well.  
  
Q. Along those lines, Matt, you were from Vermont, grew up in Vermont, you
followed the game closely. What were sort of your reactions to that team or
how close were you following that team in 2005?  
MATT GLASS: I was right there every second of that game. I was glued to the
television that day. And I couldn't have been more excited for T.J., Taylor
and those guys.  
So to now be in this tournament, I never thought that I would end up here, and
to have an opportunity to play a winable game in this first round here, it's
exciting, and we're going to get as focused as we can and try to play our best
basketball tomorrow.  
  
Q. Luke, is this a good opportunity for the team because you're playing
another mid ‑major school, as opposed to playing a No.1‑ranked team in the
country, another 16 seed? Is that a good opportunity for the team to go out
and get a NCAA Tournament win?  
LUKE APFELD: I think it is. It's a good measuring stick for us, especially
coming this late in the season. We've had a very up‑and‑down season, and
thankfully it ended on a positive note in terms of the regular season and the
tournament. But definitely playing another mid‑major team, a difficult game,
it's going to be‑‑ it's a great measuring stick, especially for some of our
younger guys, and it hopefully will be a great way to go out for Matt.  
  
Q. Matt, with such a young team, you're on such a big stage here, are you as
a leader trying to keep the team grounded, some of the younger players?  
MATT GLASS: Trying to keep guys grounded as much as possible, but at the same
time it's important to enjoy the atmosphere and everything that comes with it.
We're excited to be here, and we're going to do our best to get focused in on
tomorrow and to stay in that moment.  
But at the same time, we're going to definitely enjoy that moment and have fun
with this game.  
  
Q. Matt, what makes Four so good?  
MATT GLASS: Four puts in a lot of work behind the scenes. He doesn't just roll
up on game day and knock down shots. He's always in the gym. He's a gym rat if
I've ever seen one. He puts in more time than almost anybody I've ever been
around.  
So I think all that hard work that he puts in and all those reps he gets up
behind the scenes just on game day, it becomes easy for him. And we couldn't
be happier with his performances, and as a freshman he's got nowhere to go but
up.  
  
Q. Either Matt or Luke, over the past couple of years you've been one of the
best road teams in the country, you won two true road games to win your
conference tournament. What's made you guys so good away from Patrick?  
LUKE APFELD: I think it's a testament to our coaching staff and their ability
to prepare us for games away and home. But especially away, as you were
mentioning, they were doing a good job keeping us focused. And even though the
atmosphere may be hostile, they do a good job keeping us focused and keeping
us playing Vermont basketball. And, again, to our guys who followed this, the
scouting report, and stick to what the coaches are telling us, it makes
winning on the road a lot easier.  
MATT GLASS: We take our preparation very seriously. That starts with the
coaches, and everything that they do to prepare us for every game. We have
very detailed scouting reports that we do our best to study and get down pat
before the game starts.  
So I think that puts us in good position come game time, and fortunately we've
been able to carry it out successfully, more often than not.  
  
Q. Luke, obviously the team's been battle tested the last couple of weeks.
Had to come from behind from deficits and had to win double overtime wins, win
the championship on the road. Has all this experience prepared the team for an
atmosphere like this?  
LUKE APFELD: Absolutely. I think it all started with our Binghamton loss which
was probably the toughest moment in the season for us.  
But after that, the coaches kept stressing how we were going to battle
adversity and how the Binghamton game wouldn't be the last hard spot in our
season. And I think we really responded well, especially the weekend down in
Hartford, and then in Stony Brook game guys just stayed focused, stayed with
the plan.  
You're going to be down at some point in the game, things won't be going your
way, but their ability to keep us in the game and in the moment, like Matt
said, I think that's really‑‑ it will bode well for us in the future.  
  
Q. Both you guys were with the program but not actually playing the last
time this team was in the NCAA Tournament. Anything about the experience that
caught either one of you guys by surprise, either a good way, bad way, just
different than what you were expecting?  
MATT GLASS: Just to be a part of it and to actually be mentally preparing
myself to be on the court this time and to be playing and to be trying to help
my team, that's just an adjustment itself.  
But it's exciting. At the same time, it's something that I was waiting for for
a while. So I'm just really thankful that I'm here and really glad to be here.  
LUKE APFELD: Yeah, I think that we're both realizing how fun it is sitting on
the sidelines, you're kind of‑‑ while you're still part of the team, you're
kind of separate from the team at the same time. And just going through this
whole season, it's been a tough season, great wins, great losses, and now to
be here it's been fun. And college basketball is awesome and something we're
finally being able to experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
We're joined by Vermont head coach John Becker.  
  
Q. How often is the Syracuse win in'05 brought up to these guys, or do you
try not to talk about things like that?  
COACH BECKER: Oh, no, we'll talk about it as much as you want. It comes up
quite a bit.  
I was just in another interview where it came up. And it's probably the
greatest win of Vermont basketball history.  
So we love talking about that game. And really proud of that and hopefully we
can get the program's second NCAA victory tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Is it a little bit disjointed for you because you don't get to practice
on the actual court that you'll be playing?  
COACH BECKER: We'll shoot around there tomorrow. So today we'll have a good
practice over at Wright State, and so we'll get to shoot around there
tomorrow, which will be fine.  
I understand there's a lot going on over there today. So we'll enjoy the no
distractions and have a good practice today, which will be important.  
  
Q. I know we talked to you ‑‑ Sunday night you didn't know much about your
opponent, being just learning. Now you've had a chance to study the film,
what's your impressions of your opponent, Lamar?  
COACH BECKER: Lamar's a talented team, likes to get out in transition, play
really fast. A lot of talented offensive players. So it's going to be a game
of contrasting styles, and we'll have our hands full tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Are there any teams that you've played this year that are similar to
Lamar that you draw some kind of comparison?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, I think there's comparisons to Iona. I think that both
teams like to play really fast. Both have a lot of good offensive players,
good guards, and so I think they're similar. The team we've talked about is
Iona.  
  
Q. Playing a guard ‑oriented offense like that, is this an opportunity for
some of your bigs, some of your front court players to make an impact on this
game?  
COACH BECKER: Hopefully. We play inside‑out basketball. We like to play
through our bigs. And so we will‑‑ I think this will be a game that they'll
have an opportunity, a size advantage on some of their guys and opportunity to
throw it in there and play through those guys. So their bigs are good shot
blockers and they do have some size, so it's not going to be easy.  
But we're going to play the same way we've played all year, and we'll play
inside out and hopefully those guys have some success.  
  
Q. Lamar coach Pat Knight caught a lot of attention for the press conference
he had about three weeks ago. Did you have any thoughts on that and how he
approached that with his team?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, I think he understood his team. He understood that they
needed some encouragement. And I think it worked. They've won six games since
then. And, like he said since, he understood he had tough kids on his team and
that they would respond to that kind of public calling‑out type of situation.
And that's all part of coaching and understanding your team and what it takes
to get the guys motivated and refocused.  
In hindsight, it worked perfectly.  
  
Q. Some teams don't really like the First Four because it's a quick
turnaround and you end up ‑‑ well, it's a difficult turnaround and on short
notice. In this instance, though, it seems like it's an opportunity for a team
to get a win, to get a little momentum going into the tournament. And a win's
a win, I would think, in the tournament.   
COACH BECKER: Absolutely. We're looking at this as an opportunity to play a
team that is similar RPI, we have the exact same record, similar type
conferences, as far as RPI goes also. So an opportunity for us to compete and
play a game that we think we have a chance to win and just prolong this NCAA
experience a few more days and longer.  
We're looking forward to it. We're really excited for being here. I want to
thank Dayton for hosting this. It's a great basketball town. And we're real
excited to be here.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the last couple of weeks since the Binghamton
game and finishing off the season and two comebacks in the America East
Tournament and now here in the NCAA Tournament, just emotionally for you and
the team what's the last couple of weeks been like?  
COACH BECKER: The Binghamton game was obviously disappointing. We won 10 games
going into that game and had a chance to close out our regular season and be
regular season champions and tripped up there at Bimington.  
They beat us that night, but that loss I think is what's propelled us to where
we are today, to be honest with you, and refocused our guys and made them
understand that we have a small margin for error and we have to play a certain
way and do certain things to be successful against anyone.  
And since then the guys have got that message loud and clear, and they've
responded and we've played really well since then. We played two true road
games in our conference tournament, and some‑‑ faced a lot of adversity and
tough environments and were able to win those games.  
So we learned a hard lesson that night, and since then I think we've been
playing really well.  
  
Q. John, you have such a young roster, hardly any of them have experience on
this stage. How do you keep the team loose? Was their performance in the early
goings at Stony Brook give you hope going into this game as far as their
attitude and their composure?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, I feel good, especially after the weekend at Hartford and
Stony Brook game. It's a loose group. If you've ever been around our team,
it's a loose group. So I'm not worried about them getting too uptight. And
we'll just continue to try to keep things as normal as possible for them and
keep things as they've been every game and approach it the same way and let
them enjoy, obviously, the experience.  
But when we get into practice and other things like that, it will be business
as usual. And we're excited to play this game, and I expect our guys to come
out and play well tomorrow night.  
  
Q. When you took over your first year and started in October, did you
imagine you would be sitting here?  
COACH BECKER: Honestly, no. I mean, this is more than I had expected in my
first year. I knew we had a good team coming back. And we compete every year
for our conference championship.  
We've been postseason eight of the last 10 years, we've been in the
championship game of our conference tournament seven out of the last 10 years,
and this is now our fifth NCAA Tournament appearance in the last 10 years. So
I knew we had a chance.  
But we had a very tough nonconference schedule. And we had some tough losses
early in the year. And with a young team, you never know how that's going to‑‑
how they'll respond to that.  
But once we got into conference play and things started to click and guys
started to‑‑ I think those early nonconference games started to pay off, and
we started to win some close games, and then we got on a little‑‑ got on a
nice 10‑game winning streak there.  
So, yeah, we feel fortunate to be here. And this is beyond my wildest dreams.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Florida student‑athletes Anthony Collins
and Ron Anderson, Jr. Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the first time you saw Anthony and what
he brings to your team?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: First, I think that everybody in the gym, they were just
kind of relieved. They felt like he went out there and just did a great job at
making everybody else on the court's job a lot easier.  
He was very flashy. He came out with energy. And basically right away just
took over the game, took over the tempo of the game and basically said he was
going to be the general on the court and make all the decisions.  
  
Q. For those who aren't familiar with your team, this is for Ron, if you can
describe your team's style of play, how would you characterize it?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Team style of play, we pride ourselves on defense a lot. I
think that's been the foundation of our team throughout the course of the
year.  
Offense‑‑ our offense is‑‑ we kind of pick it up from our defense. When we go
out on defense, we pride ourselves on getting stops, keeping it below 60. If
we can kind of hold a team below 60, then we know‑‑ then we feel pretty good
about what we did out there on defense.  
  
Q. Anthony, tell us what you guys know about Cal at this point if you
would?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: We know that they have good perimeter players. They're very
skilled and that they run their offense well.  
  
Q. Anthony, when you came in as a freshman, what did you expect? How much
did you expect to play? What were your goals coming in, and how long before
you figured out: I'm good enough to play now?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: I just tried to come out and play hard and didn't worry about
how many minutes I played, just tried to come out and help my team in any way
I could.  
  
Q. What do you make of people that say that your brand of basketball is,
quote, ugly or it's tough to watch, things like that, that kind of criticism?
What do you make of that? How do you respond to stuff like that?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Brand of basketball, I mean, history kind of shows that
different teams have succeeded different ways. And this is certainly not the
first time you've seen a defensive team go out and be successful. A lot of
times nowadays people are more interested in the flashiness of a game or how
high somebody's jumping or how many blocked shots you can get.  
But when it's all said and done, it all boils down to fundamentals. Every head
coach across the nation, the first day of practice, they always harp on
defense. That's where you start off with.  
And for us it's really helped us out, won us most of our games this year. And,
like I said, that's our foundation.  
So if it's going good, we want to stick to it, and as far as it's not a sloppy
game or we're not putting up a lot of points. A win is a win. And the team's
really‑‑ we're just really excited. We're excited to be here and excited that
our defense has helped us get here.  
  
Q. Picking up on that, talking to our Florida colleagues, the Big East, I
think you were picked 14th. You've heard all this ugly basketball stuff all
season. Apparently Obama's website had you guys listed as San Francisco. When
you hear all this stuff, is it haha, or does it tick you off? What's the
feeling among the team when you kind of get these reactions?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Honestly, we've been kind of dealing with adversity all
year of basically everybody outside the locker room probably not having as
much confidence in us as we would like.  
But at the same time we kind of fuel off that. And it's nothing negative. But
we just‑‑ we know that we're a good basketball team. We know how much work we
put in every day. And we know how hard we work.  
And really the only thing, we just want the nation to understand that, too. We
want the nation to know we're going out just like everybody else. And we're
really working hard. We're fighting hard.  
So as far as being undeserving of it, we're very grateful for having the spot.
And we're going to continue doing what we're doing, continue playing Bulls
basketball and playing defense. And no matter how sloppy it is or unflashy it
might be, we're still going to stick with our foundation and hope for the
best.  
  
Q. Ron, how much do you remember that first NCAA Tournament game you played
at Kansas State and how do you take that memory or experience into this
game?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: I remember it like it was yesterday. I mean, it was an
experience that you don't get very often. Not too many people understand how
difficult it is to make the tournament. I guess coming in as a freshman that
year it was a little bit easier, but I had a couple of first‑rounders on my
team that helped me out.  
But this year being that nobody's averaging double figures, everybody's coming
in, knows their role. We had to become a team and we had to build through the
course of the year.  
And I think that's what makes coming back to the tournament, especially for my
senior year, that much more sweet, knowing that the road to get here had its
challenges and we overcame a lot.  
  
Q. Does Coach Heath ever talk about his Elite Eight team? Anything that you
guys can draw from that, if so?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Yeah, I mean, he talks about it a lot, saying that the
Elite Eight team, coming in, you know, nobody really expected them to probably
make that type of run. And we believe him. We trusted him all year. And we
understand that every decision he makes is for the success of our team.  
He just wants us to succeed. So he has that experience. And nobody's ever
really been‑‑ nobody on our team has been in that position before. So we just
kind of just want to follow his leadership and just listen to what he's saying
and try and go out there and play the way he wants us to.  
  
Q. Of the teams you played this year, especially the Big East, who does Cal
look like? Who do they remind you the most of?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Well, Coach in the locker room just now, he was talking
about how in the Big East we've basically seen every style of play. The Big
East and Cal, they have really good guard play. I probably wouldn't be able to
single it down to one particular team.  
I'll probably just say the guard play, they like baseline screens. They like
penetrating to the middle. So you can kind of equate their style of offense
and what they try and do to score points to teams in the East.  
  
Q. When you guys are really locked in on defense, can you get a sense on the
court that other teams can get out of their comfort zone and get kind of
frustrated because you are taking them out of what they need to do?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Absolutely. I mean, I feel like when we feel comfortable
out there on defense, and we know because the tempo of the game is kind of the
way we like it.  
When we kind of‑‑ when we get the other team to break out of their offense a
little bit or go away from their game plan, the tempo and the way we want
things, they kind of fall into place for us.  
And you see that. We'll come out of a huddle sometimes and we'll tell each
other: All right, the next three times down the court we want to get three
stops. And the five guys on the court we really‑‑ we pride ourselves going out
there and getting those three stops. When we get one, we yell it out: Got one
stop.  
That's just for like the players on the court. We try and go and build off of
that. That brings energy for the team. That brings the confidence of the team
up. And all those things are really vital to win the game. I think that will
probably be the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Coach Pitino in the Big East tournament compared you guys to getting a
root canal. Do you guys take pride that you're making people uncomfortable
with the style of play?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: That's a Hall of Fame coach giving us a great compliment.
If our defense is that of a root canal‑‑ he's been doing this for a very long
time‑‑ then that's as good as a compliment as I think our team has received
all year.  
And it's good to feel like that. And being a senior on the team and knowing
that we played defense and having had coaches not want to go up against our
defense or not wanting to prepare against it, I think that really says
something about ourselves, about the coaching staff. Because the coaching
staff is essentially‑‑ they tell us how we're going to defend from game to
game, everything changes.  
I mean, it's an honor to hear him say that.  
  
Q. Ron, there was a time people wondered if he was good enough to play as a
freshman and then if he was good enough to play in the Big East. Is he big
enough, is he good enough for the NCAA Tournament?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: Everybody‑‑ I think everybody knew how good Anthony was
except for the people who hadn't seen him. He was with us, he was with us
working out during the summer and before the season started, and we all were
just excited for him to hit the court so everybody could see what we saw.  
I think that he's proven it game in, game out. And this is his first year.
He's put us on his back for many a games, competitive games. He had a great
game against Napier and he was the starting point guard on the return
championship game. He's had really good games against great point guards,
point guards that basically built up a name for themselves within the
conference.  
So I feel like you can't really go without looking at that also. And Anthony
is going to do wonderful in the tournament. He's cool, calm and collected when
he hits the court, and that's what you need. Especially an asset from a
freshman. You don't get that all the time. So going into the tournament with
him I'm excited. I'm confident that we'll do good.  
  
Q. How do you feel about preparing for a team given just 48hours' notice, a
team that you've never played before and haven't seen much of?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: Basically I think you just stick to your principles, but also
you have to switch things up according to them and don't let them do certain
tendencies that they like to do, but also stick to the principles that got you
here. So I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Anthony, physically how are you feeling? I know you had the finger that
got hurt at the end of the last game there in New York. What happened there
and how do you feel physically?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: Just a finger I hurt in high school, just got retweaked in
the game. It's a little swollen, but I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Ron, have you ever seen him panicked in maybe a non ‑basketball thing,
where, you know, he can't find something? And Anthony, to the same question,
was there a moment in your life where you remember being really panicked?  
RON ANDERSON, JR.: The only time I saw him panic, I was about to beat him in
video games on NBA. That was the only time. Other than that he's been good.  
ANTHONY COLLINS: I would say about when I'm about to lose in video games or
something.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Stan Heath, head coach of South Florida.  
  
Q. It's a familiar one, but could you talk a little bit about what Anthony
brings to your team, the maturity and the calm?  
COACH HEATH: He was a Christmas gift. He's special. He really is. The first
time he got the ball out there on the court in a game and I saw how he ran the
team, guys responded to him, he was able to read the defense and make plays, I
knew we had something pretty special.  
I think sometimes we talk about his passing and his ball handling. His defense
and his toughness is just as good.  
And I think really when you talk about who we are and what we do, we're a very
good defensive team, and I always think it starts with the point guard
position.  
That guy, when he has the ability to neutralize the other team's point, and we
play a lot of great point guards, it allows the guys the freedom to lock in on
their guys.  
So he's been a fantastic player for us so far, and I know he's got a bright
future ahead of him.  
  
Q. How tough is it to get a team, offense and flash, whatever they want to
do when they come to college, how tough is it to get them to buy into being
this kind of defensive team and playing this style of basketball?  
COACH HEATH: It's not easy. But I think what's more‑‑ what makes it a little
bit easier this year was the difficulties we had last year. When you only win
ten games and you come back into the next season, you're in spring, you're in
the summer and you're trying to get ready for a season and the only thing that
coach is talking about: Listen, we're going to have to sacrifice
individualistic play, we're going to have to sacrifice scoring, we're going to
have to build our team around toughness, defense and team play, and as a
player you say to yourself do I want to win or do I want to lose?  
And you have to make that decision. And those guys made a decision that
winning was the most important thing ahead of individualistic things, and
that's why we are where we are.  
  
Q. Stan, in New York they were asking Pitino about the possibility of
playing you guys, and he said it felt like getting a root canal. I just want
to ask you about how much of the defensive success is making teams and making
players feel uncomfortable on the court?  
COACH HEATH: That's a big‑time compliment from a great coach. And that's what
we want to do. We want to disrupt you. We want to smell your breath. We want
to get underneath your skin.  
We want to make life miserable for you. And we want to do it the right way. We
want to do it with moving feet and active hands and helping and talking and
all those different things, and closing it with rebounds.  
But that's what we want to do. And we have good personnel. We have long guys.
We have guys that have good footwork, and we have a couple of guys that, I
think, when you look at Ron Anderson or Hugh Robertson, or if you look at even
Anthony Collins, you have three guys that I think have a really high IQ for
basketball as a whole, but even a higher IQ for defense on the other end.  
  
Q. Going back in prior years, when you're trying to get out of the Big East
basement and it's not happening, do you worry about confidence or guys being
able to see the light at the end of the tunnel and sticking with things?  
COACH HEATH: Well, we've had‑‑ I've been here five years, and year three we
were knocking right on the door. We were 9‑and‑9 in conference play. We had 20
wins.  
I think we finished ninth in the league and only 18 wins that year. And I
think that was the starting point for us where we felt and tasted a little bit
of success. We had a terrific player in Dominique Jones who set a great deal
of leadership and another kid, Chris Howard, those guys were fantastic.  
So this wasn't just this happened this year. Toarlyn Fitzpatrick was on that
team. Ron Anderson was sitting out as a redshirt that year. So some of the
guys were part of that, and the next year, which was last year, was the year
that we struggled. And obviously losing Dominique Jones was a big part of our
setback. We really felt last year was the year we could make that jump.  
So having that table set a couple of years ago and having some of those guys
being a part of that, I knew the leadership guys, the older guys, Augustus
Gilchrist was on that team as well, wanted to get back to that situation.  
That's what set the table up for this year.  
  
Q. Stan, what little you've seen of Cal or how much you've seen of them,
what's your characterization of the team you're going to face?  
COACH HEATH: I'm very impressed with them. Mike Montgomery is an excellent
coach and his team plays extremely well together. They're highly skilled
offensively. They have four guys in double figures.  
And when you look at Gutierrez and Kamp and Crabbe, those three guys are
terrific basketball players, and they understand how to play. They play well
together. They're very sound fundamentally. So we know we're playing a very,
very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Touching on Hugh a little bit on his defensive efforts, when he came to
the program, how long did it take you to see that he was going to be a very
special defensive player and what did you see out of him that opened your
eyes?  
COACH HEATH: When we recruited him I knew we needed a guy like that. We were
losing Chris Howard who did a great job of guarding people. And I knew we
needed a guy that had the ability to guard people. And he didn't have
necessarily an offensive strength, wouldn't say he was a great ball handler or
great shooter or anything like that, he was more of a slasher, but I knew he
had some length and quickness and could guard people. I think it's important
to have guys that fit certain roles.  
In our league and around the country you're going to face wing players that
are normally the leading scorers on their basketball team. I really believe
you need to have a guy that can hold that person under their averages or shut
them down or at least keep them under control to give your team a chance to
win.  
So when I saw Hugh, right away I thought he had the ability. The thing you
never know in recruiting is will a kid buy into accepting a role like that,
and that's why you have to give Hugh a lot of credit because he was willing to
make that sacrifice to play a unique role where he was the defensive stopper.  
Now, I don't say: Hugh, that's all you do. Hugh needs to be an offensive
player and needs to score for us, but he knows that's the number one thing he
does to help our team win.  
  
Q. How much are you using your Elite Eight run back at Kansas State for this
program and going forward with that?  
COACH HEATH: Not a lot. I did mention it a little bit to the guys, and only
because I wanted them to understand teams like VCU from last year that were in
the same situation as us, what Butler's done over the year.  
What UConn did last year finishing ninth in the league and winning the
national championship. I wanted them to know you're in a select field of 68
teams that have legitimate chance to win the national championship, and
anything can happen. Your first game is your most important game.  
You can't overlook anyone. And the other thing I'm going to talk to them later
on is whenever‑‑ and I learned this from Tom Izzo, and I think this is a great
way to look at this, we are in a tournament bracket right now. This tournament
bracket, this is the Dayton/Nashville bracket, and we need to win three games
to win this championship, and I think if you can give them smaller goals to
set, it helps them as they continue down the line. So those are kind of the
references I use from the past.  
And that team I thought‑‑ and I think all teams, our team needs to feel this
way, this is really the players' time of the year. They're going to decide how
far they want to go.  
If they're going to put the energy and effort and really play out there
together, they're going to have a chance to move along. If all of a sudden
someone sees the light come on, I want to be the star, get 20points, they want
to do it a different way, they want to give the effort, then you're going to
have a short trip here.  
Those are the references I use towards Kent State and different programs I've
been in.  
  
Q. You started by calling Anthony a Christmas gift. Why do people
underestimate a guy like that? Why does he slip not necessarily through the
cracks, because he's here, but he's a kid from Houston, what happened?  
COACH HEATH: Just look at him. He doesn't look the part. He looks like your
12‑year‑old kid down the street. He's such a nice kid. He's a terrific
student. He's probably been one of the easiest guys I've ever coached in my
life that not only will he take coaching and do whatever you tell him to do,
he picks it up so quickly.  
And then you watch him out there on the court. And we're going‑‑ it seems like
every game, especially in our league‑‑ we're going up against a guy, and I'm
saying, man, we're getting ready to go up against Peyton Silva, we're getting
ready to go up against this guy or that guy or this guy, how in the heck are
we going to stop him?  
And now I don't even worry about it. I don't care who it is, who we're
playing. And I don't know how he does it. He doesn't look exceptionally quick.
He doesn't look like he can jump or he's explosive, but he gets the job done.  
And that's all that matters.  
  
Q. How many times have you met Anthony before you heard his voice?  
COACH HEATH: How many times had I met him?  
  
Q. How many times did you meet him before you finally heard his voice?  
COACH HEATH: I didn't hear his voice until we started playing games, because‑‑
I don't know if I'm answering your question, but the voice I think you're
talking about is the voice of leadership, the voice of confidence, the voice
of toughness. That's the voice that our players and coaches hear when he's
playing out there on the court.  
The voice you hear up here is a shy kid from Houston, Texas, that really
doesn't want to be in the lights. But the voice you hear in the court and in
the huddles and locker room is a totally different voice, and that's what
makes him really unique.  
  
Q. The games tonight don't necessarily have any relevance, but will your
kids be over at the arena tonight watching it or not?  
COACH HEATH: We talked about it going back and forth, and I think with
everything going on with the president and everything like that, it just would
be a little bit much to try to do it.  
I wouldn't mind the guys getting a taste of the environment. We did that at
the Big East tournament. But I think it will be harder to do tonight. But
we'll watch it on TV.  
  
Q. Cal's offense has stumbled a little bit in recent games. When you watch
them, how much is Gutierrez a key in terms of what they do? He's not the point
guard, but sort of the facilitator a little bit. And what's your impressions
of him more specifically?  
COACH HEATH: I'm really impressed with him, and I think, like most teams,
we're all excited about playing someone different that doesn't know every
little detail of what we do from a scouting standpoint.  
But I'm very impressed with him. I do think he is the key to their offense.
His ability to move without the basketball, to come off screens and shoot it,
come off screens and drive into gaps and make plays for other people, and just
the intensity, the pace that he plays at is at a really high level.  
And I think he makes them tick. I think Kamp‑‑ those two guys I think make
them tick, their two seniors, which normally that's the way it is. But he's a
guy that we have to do a good job on. And I think that's the only way we have
a chance, is if we can hold our own against him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 12, 2012

  

### [George Fant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23468)

### [Derrick Gordon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23467)

### [Ray Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23465)

### [Kahlil McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23466)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to introduce our players from Western Kentucky. We
have Kahlil McDonald next to me and Derrick Gordon and George Fant.  
  
Q. George, do you have a lot of family and friends coming up? I know you're
from Cincinnati.  
GEORGE FANT: Definitely a lot of family coming up.  
  
Q. Make you excited or nervous?  
GEORGE FANT: Pretty excited. First time they've got to see me play in a long
time in person.  
  
Q. Are you nervous at all?  
KAHLIL MCDONALD: Nervous, it comes with the territory. But I'm embracing it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the nerves, if any, tomorrow playing with President
Obama in the house tomorrow night?  
KAHLIL MCDONALD: Once you step on the court, it's like, and you get that first
up and down, it goes away, really. It's just butterflies, really. I think the
best players have that, but once it goes away, it's game time.  
  
Q. Also, Kahlil, you guys are the only team in the entire 68 ‑team field
that has a losing record. You've won six straight. Does that mean anything?
Should fans read anything into that at all?  
KAHLIL MCDONALD: People can read into whatever they want. We're going to play
like we have been playing the last six games. That's what got us here, and
that's what we're going to keep doing.  
  
Q. The fact that you won your conference tournament and you're here, was
this somethingwhen you went into the conference tournament thinking we can get
in the NCAA? Just kind of what fuels you to get to this point?  
KAHLIL MCDONALD: Just it's do or die. That's what it is right now, too, once
again, but it's just a bigger stage and we're going to keep that same mindset.  
  
Q. There aren't many teams that have ever changed coaches during the season
and made this tournament. It's very rare. For whoever feels like talking about
it, could you go back and remember what it was like when you guys made the
coaching change and just what the mentality among the players was at that
point, what was going through your heads?  
KAHLIL MCDONALD: Basically just‑‑ we've been through a lot of adversity, and
that made us tougher, really. I'm pretty sure everybody's minds was like going
crazy, but it shows how tough we are because we got through it and we got a
conference championship. And now we're here.  
  
Q. You're such a young team, and you've been through so much. Do you have
any sense that you guys are maybe sort of the underdogs rooting interest in
this tournament?  
DERRICK GORDON: I'd say so. A lot of people are underestimating us. We can't
worry about what people think. We just gotta go out there and play our game
like we've been doing the whole time in the conference tournament.  
GEORGE FANT: I can say for our freshmen we don't consider ourselves freshmen
anymore. Those days are long gone for us. We consider ourselves upperclassmen,
because it's toward the end of the year. We're just ready to go out and play.  
  
Q. Going back to the coaching change, I'm sure there's some disappointment,
there's relationships there, but a lot of times it reenergizes a team. What
was the mood when you guys changed coaches? Was it disappointing or was it
reenergizing?  
KAHLIL MCDONALD: Really, I just think that we looked at it as, I mean, just
change. It's a change, I mean, and then life. What if you both get fired? You
still have to work. That's how we looked at it, as work, and that's what we
came to do.  
GEORGE FANT: Same thing. This game is a business. Once you get into college,
it's a job for you. It's not just for fun, but you also have fun at it. But
it's a job.  
Things happen, we have changes in the game. And you just gotta keep building
off of it and look at it as a business, even with a new coach.  
  
Q. A lot of times you'll see a team have adversity, maybe they change a
coach early on, you'll see the team come apart a little bit. I was wondering
if you could go back to that time, was there a time when you worried about
that happening and did you have player meetings and talk about what you were
going to do?  
GEORGE FANT: We definitely had player meetings, but as far as coming apart,
none at all. Even with a new coach, we all came together and talked like with
our senior, and he told us just to keep our heads high and keep looking
forward, don't look back. It was middle of the season. We had a lot of games
left and the conference tournament as well. So we had a lot of time to get
better, which we did.  
THE MODERATOR: I'll introduce the head coach of Western Kentucky. This is Ray
Harper. I'd like to open it to questions.  
  
Q. Just wanted to talk about the coaching change. What was your first order
of business when you took over?  
COACH HARPER: Just to make sure that we helped these kids get better each day.
We said there was 57days until the conference tournament. Let's try to get
better each day and hopefully be playing our best basketball at that time.  
And we had some great guys to work with, and that's what we focused on each
and every day.  
  
Q. Often when you see a team change coaches at mid ‑season there's a real
fall‑out, it affects the players in many ways. How were your guys able to kind
of pull through that and not come apart?  
COACH HARPER: That would be a question you'd have to ask them. I don't know. I
mean, again, all we tried to focus on was the task at hand. And the task at
hand was to try and get better. We weren't a very good basketball team, we
weren't playing very well, and there were some areas we needed to get better.  
And, again, I had a great staff to work with. And the last three or four weeks
we were playing very good basketball, and I'm just happy that these kids have
an opportunity to play again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Could you talk about tomorrow night's game is obviously going to be in
the international spotlight with President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron
being here. What's it going to be like for your team playing with those two in
the audience?  
COACH HARPER: I hope they don't notice those two. I hope they notice those
five guys in the other jersey, because they're the ones that are going to
score all the buckets tomorrow night.  
We just need to focus on the things that we can control, what's gotten us to
this point, and we know what that is.  
As long as we come out tomorrow night and play with the type of effort and
intensity that we've been playing with, I'll be fine.  
But I think anyone in the crowd, when they leave tomorrow night, they'll say
that team is tough and they compete.  
  
Q. You mentioned in the last few weeks you guys started playing a lot
better. Which area specifically did you see the most improvement in?  
COACH HARPER: I think obviously the defensive end is an area that we've really
focused on. I thought it really started to take hold in the last two to
threeweeks. But, more importantly, our mental toughness.  
We'd get down in the past. I could see our guys, they didn't know how to
react. And now I think we trailed in every game in the conference tournament.
One game by as many as 13, with less than eight minutes to go, and there was
no panic.  
And our guys continue to believe that they could win the basketball game. And
they've learned some lessons that will carry them, help them much longer than
this basketball season. It's going to help them through life; that there will
be tough days, but you must stay and believe‑‑ if you believe in what you're
doing, you've got a chance.  
And I'm proud of these guys for being so resilient. And no one gave us a
chance to be here today, other than the guys that are in that locker room and
that coaching staff.  
  
Q. You guys are the only team in this tournament with a losing record. Do
you think much about that?  
COACH HARPER: I think more about we're 6‑0 in our last six games. We're 10‑4
in our last 14. Anyone that's watched our basketball team play, we should have
been 13‑1\. We gave some away when we just did not know how to close out
games. We know how to close out games now.  
But we're not going to live in the rearview mirror. We're not concerned about
who we were. We know who we are now, and that's what I'm most excited about.  
  
Q. One more question about the coaching change. Was there a time back then
where you looked at you have such a young team and you're going through all
this, you just kind of go: Oh, my goodness, how are we going to do this?  
COACH HARPER: No, not really. Again, our primary focus was let's get better.
And as a coaching staff, how do we help these kids get better, what are the
areas that we need to focus on, whether it be mental approach to the game,
whether it be on the defensive end, whether it be on the offensive end.  
And, again, I had an unbelievable group of guys to work with. And not just the
players, but the other coaches. And that's why we are setting here today. We
had a group of guys that believed in what we were telling them.  
And did it happen overnight? No. But it's a process. And once the process took
hold, I could see a real difference in this team.  
And we needed something good to happen. I mean, we were working awfully hard,
and we finally had something good happen when we beat Arkansas Little Rock at
home. And from that point forward, I thought our team started playing very
good basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 12, 2012

  

### [Brandon Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18305)

### [Noah Hartsock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20799)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by BYU student‑athletes Brandon Davis and Noah
Hartsock.  
Questions.  
  
Q. For either of you, you've been here before. You've got young teammates
that haven't been. Do you talk to them very much about this environment and
what to expect tomorrow?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: Yeah, I've talked to them a little bit, just it's going to be a
great game, get ready for the atmosphere and just the competitive nature of
the tournament.  
And we've had two days of good practice, and we're really excited for this
opportunity.  
  
Q. You guys have had a little bit of a layoff. How do you think that will
affect tomorrow, just having so much time off between games?  
BRANDON DAVIS: We've definitely had a lot of rest. We've actually found use of
it, finding time to get treatments that we need to get our bodies back going.
But other than that, you know, we're expected to practice pretty hard today
and getting our shootaround tomorrow and just get things loosened up. So we'll
be fine in that area.  
  
Q. Could either of you talk about what it's like this year in the NCAA as
opposed to last year where it was the Jimmer circus?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: It's a big difference. I remember last year having that 3 seed,
a lot of expectations not only to win the first game, but advance deep into
the tournament.  
You know, it's a neat feeling, because it's the First Four, and it's still
exciting, I'll say that, just being part of the tournament once more, and
being part of this program that's been to it quite a bit. It's a lot of fun,
and excited for another tournament, another chance at a tournament title.  
  
Q. And also just as a follow ‑up, do either of you‑‑ do you remember Lamont
Jones when he played for Arizona against you guys?  
BRANDON DAVIS: Yeah, we do.  
  
Q. And he sounds like he's a little bit happy that maybe Jimmer is not
around. What kind of player is he and do you remember anything at all about
your games with Arizona perhaps when he was there?  
BRANDON DAVIS: He's a great player. He definitely hurt us when we were there.
I think he had 20‑something points around there.  
He's a great shooter, great guy, great player. It's going to be fun to‑‑ he's
our only really familiar face on that team that we know maybe more than anyone
else on that team.  
  
Q. Noah, a lot of people are describing this game as a potential track meet,
up ‑and‑down basketball. You guys like to run as much as anybody, but is there
a point where you don't want to run as much as maybe they do?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: It's going to be kind of that game, just up and down. But we
talked about it. We're going to push the ball like we've always been doing.
And every time we get a chance to get down in transition, we're going to try
to take advantage of that.  
Obviously we've got to stop them. They scored nearly half their points in
transition basketball game. And we just gotta try to jam them, slow them down,
and try to limit those opportunities that they might have.  
  
Q. Noah, first of all, because no one ever asks you about your leg, how is
it feeling? How close is it back to normal or 100percent, if you will? And
does Iona remind you of anybody you played during the regular season?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: You know, the leg's feeling pretty good right now. The only
thing that's really bothering me is maybe my ankle. The knee's feeling really
good. But I've been able to practice on it. It feels pretty good right now.  
And I don't know if we played a team that really resembles Iona, because you
watch the film, they just get up and down so quick. They have great guards,
excellent shooters. I don't think we've ever matched up to a team like that
before.  
But I'm just excited to go out there and compete with them and see how the
game goes.  
  
Q. They've obviously got a guy who dishes out a lot of assists. How does
that impact you guys inside? Will they be just taking a lot of shots from the
perimeter and it's rebounding, or is it more than that?  
BRANDON DAVIS: They're a solid team. They score in a variety of ways. They
have their leading assist guy in the nation, and part of our game plan is
getting him stopped and getting him to do things he doesn't want to do.  
But we're expecting them to score from every angle, and we just have to play
our D and get them stopped the best we can.  
  
Q. They don't play a guy regularly that's over 6'7 ", I think. Is that a
situation where you're kind of licking your chops, for lack of a better
word?  
BRANDON DAVIS: They're great players. They're big, strong dudes. They know how
to play. They know how to use their bodies. And it's going to be a battle
regardless of their height. And we're expected to see different defenses by
them down low and everything.  
So it's not a matter of who‑‑ like who is going to be defending me or Noah,
it's going to take a lot out of us offensively to score on both those guys,
whoever they bring in.  
  
Q. Noah, what has past experience in this tournament taught you about how to
win and advance in this setting?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: What I've seen is especially the opening‑round games, they go
down to the wire. And you just kind of make the right plays. That's what I
think we need to do.  
It's going to be two teams vying for another day to play. And I've been
telling these guys, you know, we gotta play hard for 40minutes, especially the
last two minutes, we've got to play really hard all the way down. Because
that's what these type of games are. Hardly are there any blowouts or
anything; it's one of those games that goes back and forth the whole time.  
  
Q. Noah, the President's going to be here tomorrow night. Your thoughts on
that, and then you still in the Romney camp?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: I'm not a big political guy. I know who the President is, but I
know that he played some pickup ball at North Carolina not too long ago, but
other than that, you know, just another fan in the stands.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously prepared for NCAA games before, but to prepare
for a Thursday game compared to a Tuesday game, can you kind of describe what
kind of gets sped up real quick or maybe even left out because you just don't
have time?  
NOAH HARTSOCK: Just thinking‑‑ you know, you get fewer days of practice, fewer
days of prepping for the team. So it's kind of getting thrown back into like
tournament play, West Coast conference, something like that, where you find
out the day before who you're going to play and then you just gotta prepare
and go out and play it. So just quick turnaround.  
But we've just been focusing a lot this past week on ourselves, getting up and
down the court, competing hard, and just being aggressive. And that's the best
that we could do right now. We got on the scouting report and we just got to
really focus on that right now and go out here and practice and get ready for
it.  
  
Q. If there's one stat at the end of the game that will determine whether
you guys are successful or not, what would that stat be?  
BRANDON DAVIS: Honestly, I don't know. I think it's just going to come down to
our effort and getting these guys stopped. They can score. Like I said
earlier, they score in every way possible.  
And it's going to take a lot of just flat‑out effort on our part to get them
stopped and play great defense.  
  
Q. Do any of you on the team, do you think, go online when you first find
out about the team, maybe coaches are putting together a game plan, do you go
online to find anything about the team, the school, or do coaches encourage
you to just wait until they gave a report?  
BRANDON DAVIS: Everything I have I've gotten from the coaches, the film, the
scouting reports. I trust their judgment more than mine. So I just try to do
things that they want me to do.  
NOAH HARTSOCK: Nice (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
We're joined by BYU head coach Dave Rose. Questions?  
  
Q. How is past recent tournament success, how will that ‑‑ do you think that
will help your team going into tomorrow's game?  
COACH ROSE: I hope it helps in our preparation. As far as when you start
playing, the guys who can feel the most comfortable out there in this
environment the quickest I think are the ones the most successful.  
Usually you can rely on experienced players, players who have been through
this environment to maybe feel a little more comfortable.  
But that's kind of what you hope happens. Once the ball's tipped and it comes
down to execution, comes down to effort, and hopefully that your team can
start to play the way you've played all year long in this environment as soon
as possible.  
  
Q. Labels tend to get put on teams, Cinderella and that kind of thing. And
Iona seems to want to play the underdog card. As a coaching staff, do you ever
have to deal with that psychology about either embracing a label or deflecting
it?  
COACH ROSE: Well, as far as our approach, that's not a big thing for me,
personally. I think that there are times when, if your team has maybe been
written off, that you kind of maybe use that as motivation to try and help
your team believe in each other and believe in themselves.  
But the first round of a tournament game, I think that what you want to do is,
especially with as quick a turnaround as this game is, you just want to get
your team ready the best you can to play your best basketball.  
And there's a lot that goes into preparation for the other team. But with a
really quick turnaround, I think the biggest concern for us is to try to get
us to play the way we want to play and try to slow them down somehow.  
  
Q. Along those lines, a lot of people are saying this might turn into a
track meet. Is that the way you want to play tomorrow, or do you kind of want
to limit that a little bit?  
COACH ROSE: Well, what I want to do is get our guys into the flow of the game,
how we play. And that's an up‑tempo, fast‑paced game. What we really have to
concentrate on is in transition defense, to make them take contested shots.  
Their point guard is as good with the ball as anybody we've ever played. And
he not only can finish at the rim, he's a great 3‑point shooter. And then he
can really make plays for his teammates. And his teammates are good finishers.
They can finish at the rim, they can finish from the 3‑point line. We're
playing the leading scoring team in the country with the point guard who has
the most assists.  
So it's not a team that's creating things for themselves. They play together.
They share the ball, and transition defense will be a huge factor in this
game.  
And I would bet that he would tell you the same thing; that he probably thinks
transition defense is a big key for his team, because that's how we both play.  
  
Q. How does this year feel different, perhaps, than last year where
everybody was caught up in Jimmer ‑mania coming to the tournament?  
COACH ROSE: You know, the feeling of being in the tournament is very similar.
I mean, it's just that our team's excited. Our coaching staff is excited to be
in the tournament.  
I think that as far as the biggest difference is probably not the hype with
Jimmer, it's probably in the turnaround; that you go from a‑‑ that we've
actually played‑‑ we played our last game a week ago Saturday and found out
who we were going to play last night and now we're here in Dayton this
morning, or this afternoon, and play tomorrow night.  
So that's probably the biggest difference as far as how things feel. And
coaching staff's done a terrific job putting our game plan together. Now our
players need to get a good practice in tonight and get a good night's sleep,
and hopefully we'll play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. For the first time the NCAA released how they ranked all 68 teams that
made it. And based on where you're ranked, if you do the math, you probably
should have been a 12 seed, but yet you're a 14. Is that something that you
even worry about? Does it rankle you at all, or do you just say "hmm" and move
on?  
COACH ROSE: Probably I just feel that we're excited to be in the tournament.
And if it was difficult for them to fit us in the tournament, then I'm
grateful for the work they did to help us fit in. And hopefully we can
advance. That's what we want to do, is just advance.  
  
Q. With the kind of layoff you've had given the injuries and stuff, has this
been a good thing for your team to have that extra rest?  
COACH ROSE: It's hard to say, because rhythm, feel, repetition I think is
something that coaches really rely on as far as how their team's going to
play.  
And I think that the time off has been good for our players who have needed to
heal, and hopefully we'll physically be better prepared.  
But mentally and how we execute, that will be a question mark for us because
of the time. It's been a long time since we played, and hopefully we can get
back really comfortable into how we play, what we want to do, how we need to
execute, because all it will take is a few minutes and this team can‑‑ they
can score a lot of points in a very small amount of time.  
And so we're going to have to be good all game long and we'll have to be
really consistent throughout the game.  
  
Q. Wonder if you remember much about Lamont Jones?  
COACH ROSE: Yeah, I remember him. He got 20 against us last year. He hit four
3s in EnergySolutions Arena when we played Arizona. That's a team‑‑ especially
late in the game he was good.  
And looks like he's doing the exact same thing here with Iona. He's very good
off the dribble, can finish mid‑range, can get to the rim, finish, great
3‑point shooter.  
When he catches the ball in any position once the ball crosses half court,
he's looking for an opportunity to make an offensive play.  
And if you shut him down with help, then you've caused yourself some real
issues, because they're so good at sharing the ball and so is he. He's a guy
who can hit that open man, and he's going to pass it to another guy who is a
very skilled offensive player, because they have five guys on the floor at all
times that can score. So it's a challenge.  
But MoMo is a terrific player, one of the best we've played against.  
  
Q. The chance to get Noah healthier if not totally healthy and get him a
final opportunity in this tournament, how much did that weigh on your mind the
past week and how valuable is that for you to see him get that chance?  
COACH ROSE: We just kind of hoped that he would respond, and had a great
practice Wednesday, did some individual skill work during the week, and then
Saturday. And Wednesday he actually looked a little bit better. But somewhat
the same. He wasn't very explosive.  
Saturday we all got a little bit excited because it looked like he felt a lot
better and made some moves in the post where he actually showed some type of
explosion, especially off that injured leg.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could speak to the technology of just getting the
tapes real quick. I know you've been to a lot of tournaments, but sounds like
there was a pretty quick availability to have access to Iona.  
COACH ROSE: We had two Iona games loaded on my iPad before I got out of the
broadcast building back to my office. And you'd probably have to talk to Chad
Bunn about how that happens, because I really‑‑ that's not my expertise.  
I'm really good once it gets on my iPad, but how it gets from wherever he
finds it and loads it‑‑ but our coaches have done a wonderful job.  
Since then we've added five or six, seven more games. So we've got a pretty
good look at what they do. You don't need to watch too many films to know what
they do, because they do the same thing and they do it to everybody. They're
really good at it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iona student‑athletes Mike Glover, Scott
Machado, and Lamont Jones.  
  
Q. For all of you, what has the last week been like after you lost knowing
that you were very much on the bubble and hoping that you would get into the
tournament?  
LAMONT JONES: It's been kind of stressful, but at the same time just trying to
keep level‑headed. We just have to keep in our mind that we still have work to
do, we still have practice. We still had basketball left, whether it was the
NCAA or NIT, somewhere within that we were going to be doing something. So we
just to had remember that there was still basketball left and just to go to
work every day hard as we can and not get down on ourselves.  
  
Q. Do you feel a little bit of pressure just to prove to the country, prove
that the Selection Committee was correct in letting two teams from a
conference in here, and that you can kind of justify your presence?  
SCOTT MACHADO: Pressure, no. More or less wanted to show what we do. More or
less showing the hard work that we put on in practice every day and what we've
been doing all year. And just getting this opportunity is wonderful for us,
because now we get to show the whole country what Iona basketball is about.  
And we just want to prove everybody‑‑ everybody that chose us right in the
committee, and we want to show everybody that we can play and that we can
compete with the best.  
  
Q. You've played BYU twice. Your impressions of the games that you played
while with Arizona against the Cougars?  
LAMONT JONES: It's a totally different team. Obviously they had Jimmer
Fredette my first two years playing them. So that was a tough outing. We lost
to them twice.  
But it's a different team that they have now. They still bring back Brandon
Davies and Hartsock, which are two great players.  
But I think we can hang with them. I haven't really watched them much this
year. We just have to play Iona basketball and not really worry about what BYU
brings or what happened two years ago, a year prior. We just have to go in
there and this is a new team and this is a new day.  
  
Q. Are you aware of some of the national negative publicity on you guys
getting in here, for one? For two, are you aware that the team that was in
that spot last year won here and went to the Final Four?  
SCOTT MACHADO: We're well aware of it. But we really don't look at that. We
really don't bother with what people are saying. We just want to prove
ourselves, and we want to prove not only to ourselves, but to everybody else
that we can play and we're here to play.  
  
Q. Along the same lines, obviously if you're in the Commonwealth a year ago,
George Mason a couple of years before that, have come from having to prove
something early on to going all the way to the Final Four. Is that something
that lends you a little confidence going into this, that proves that almost
anybody in the field can beat almost anybody else?  
LAMONT JONES: It's basketball. And it's DivisionI basketball. Everybody can
play. Everybody can put the ball in the hoop. Everybody can play defense.  
If you couldn't, you wouldn't be playing. It doesn't matter what conference
you're in. As George Mason showed, and as VCU showed last year, it doesn't
matter. It's all about the heart that you have beating in your chest and the
teammates that you come to work with every day and the belief that you have in
each other and your coaching staff, and if you have that, you'll go a long
way.  
  
Q. MoMo, with your big ‑game experience last year, is your role any more
important the next 24hours than it usually is?  
LAMONT JONES: I would like to think so. Just trying to keep our guys
level‑headed, just explaining to them how tough it's going to be. Every game
is going to be a grind‑out game. It's going to go down to the wire.  
But I don't think it gets‑‑ I don't think my role comes any bigger than what
it's been. I think it's something that my guys look for me to do every day
throughout the year.  
We've talked about the situation plenty of times. It's just now that it's
reality and we just have to go and put forth the effort.  
  
Q. What do you feel is the number one thing you have to do against BYU,
maybe a stat in particular that you need to have control over, or what is it
in particular that you think you need to do to win?  
MIKE GLOVER: Well, earlier today we was watching scouting report. And with the
lack of size that we have, we noticed that they have a big front court.  
So our job is to pretty much just get dirty down there in the paint and every
time the shot go up just basically rebound. Like with the lack of size of
myself and Taaj really, we need some more rebounding presence.  
So with BYU front court, our job‑‑ our main thing to win the basketball game
tomorrow is basically defense and rebounding the basketball.  
  
Q. Scott or Mike, you guys probably got in because of your nonconference
schedule. What is it like to go a whole month without playing a home game?  
SCOTT MACHADO: It's a grind. It's very difficult. Some said it's like‑‑ it's
like you being in the NBA and traveling every day to another game. And we go
play and we come home for a day, practice, and then leave the next. Or we
leave that same day.  
And it was just game, travel, come back, schoolwork, class, practice, travel,
game, and do the same thing over. And it was a long stretch, and it was a hard
time. But, I mean, it was something that we all wanted to go through and we
knew we had to to have a good season, and we had a successful road trip.  
  
Q. MoMo, again, you guys played a fast tempo. BYU plays at a faster tempo.
You guys lead the nation in scoring, and BYU is right there, top 15, right
with you. Is it refreshing to play a team that will play with you, and how
often do you see teams that want to take you out of that and slow you down?
And, in that respect, is it a fun team to play because they will go up and
down?  
LAMONT JONES: Everybody tries to play like that with us. Even if they don't
play that style, they'll try to. And then they'll try to take us out of our
game and try to slow the game down. But with BYU playing a fast‑paced game‑‑
and, again, I've played against them twice‑‑ I don't think they play nearly as
fast as we do. I think we still have a speed advantage on them.  
I think if we can do what we do every day and just, like I said, maintain the
focus at hand, we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Scott, I've heard you referred to as the best point guard in America that
most of America's never seen. What do you think about that statement?  
SCOTT MACHADO: I think they're right. I feel like this is the opportunity that
I have and my team has to show what got us here. And that the whole team, as a
whole, help me become that best point guard. So it's just an opportunity that
I get to show my talent to the world.  
  
Q. MoMo, can you just recollect what those games against BYU that you played
in were like, what do you recall from those games, and watching film, what has
changed with the BYU team?  
LAMONT JONES: To be honest, I remember Jimmer Fredette. That sticks out like a
sore thumb. The rest of it was just kind of a blur. The first game he had, I
want to say he had like 50. The next game he probably had 40.  
So more than half of their points came from him. Now it's a team where they
spread out the points, and they've got different players that contribute to
their success this year. And we can't look any of that off. It is a totally
different team, but, like I said before, it's the NCAA Tournament, and it's
basketball. Everybody can play.  
  
Q. Did you guys think if you were going to get in that it would be here in
the First Four?  
LAMONT JONES: Yeah, we talked about it. It was just something that we was just
hoping for, whether it's the First Four, 11th seed, a 12 seed, it doesn't
matter. NCAA Tournament is the NCAA Tournament. And we're just grateful to be
here, us and our coaching staff.  
I think we worked hard every day to get here. Whether it was the last spot in
or the first spot in. I think that we deserve to be here, and I think this
gives us a chance to show what we can really do and how much of a team we
really are.  
  
Q. Mike, from what I understand, you played junior college basketball in
Utah a little bit. When the name BYU popped up to play you guys, what was the
first thing that came to your mind?  
MIKE GLOVER: Well, my junior year was in Price, Utah. It was I think about an
hour away from Provo. Never had the opportunity to go out there and visit. We
was always on the road.  
BYU playing‑‑ I mean playing against a Utah team, it feels like junior college
all over again. But as a team this year, I thinkwe stay within ourselves
throughout the whole year to get us to this point. And me being a senior, it's
my last year going out with Scott and MoMo, my first year playing in the NCAA
Tournament. So I'm just fortunate to be here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
I'd like to welcome head coach of Iona, Tim Cluess. Questions?  
  
Q. Can you just take us through the last 24hours from the nerves to cramming
for BYU to putting travel plans together and now being here?  
COACH CLUESS: As we got close to the selection time, it really felt like a big
game was about to occur that you're waiting in the locker room for the game to
start.  
You just feel your energy starting to flow. And commercials on TV were coming
on, and they started with the South bracket first, you get more and more
excited you start saying I don't know if we're really going to have a shot at
this.  
When your team's name is selected, you look up there, take a second look, and
next thing you know everyone's overjoyed and really enjoying themselves and
sharing it with each other.  
And it's a great thing for our school and our team, so I'm really happy.  
  
Q. Is it difficult at all from a coaching standpoint where you've gone
through the apprehension are we going to get in, you get in, and it's like
relief that you're in, and now it's a series of emotions, as you just said? Is
it difficult now to get them to bear down and think about what's ahead?  
COACH CLUESS: You know what's interesting, when you're a team like ours that
gets in like that, not expecting, not sure if you get it, the kids have such
an adrenalin rush, that that's one of the worries I have.  
Like when you see them this morning, they were gassed like they had played a
game last night. We had an early practice today. I'm looking at how long is it
going to take us to bounce back from that and how much adrenalin did we use.  
As a coaching staff after we got everyone together, it went from jubilation to
it's time to get to work now. You only have a couple of minutes to enjoy it.
You have to return about a million phone calls and thank everyone you've known
since you were born and go from there.  
  
Q. How's your crash course in BYU coming and what do you think?  
COACH CLUESS: It's getting there. I know they're a heck of a basketball team.
I did watch them last year a lot as well. MoMo had built some confidence into
me until a few minutes ago, because he told me he was going to be a much
better defender against BYU than he was in the past, and I just found out he
guarded Jimmer Fredette, so I don't know‑‑ stopping‑‑ giving him 40 and 50, so
I'm hoping he does a little better job this time.  
No, they're a great program. I was fortunate enough to be on a team that
played them when Danny Ainge played way back when. So for me it's a little
historical playing them again.  
But I know we have our hands cut out. And I'm proud of our team and I think
our team has the ability on a given night to play with anybody, and I'm hoping
that's tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Is that St. Johns?  
COACH CLUESS: Yes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Scott and what kind of player he is and how this stage
might let America see him?  
COACH CLUESS: When we went to Puerto Rico in the preseason, Scott was on a
bigger stage than normal playing against some high‑level teams for the first
time this year and showed that he was a completely different player than a
year ago.  
He shared the ball at an unprecedented rate. I think he left that tournament
averaging about 13 or 14 assists a game in that tournament. He also worked
very hard in the offseason on his shooting. So he's become over 40percent
3‑point shooter.  
So when you have someone that's that dangerous with the ball, can get it to
the right guys, the right spot, and also knock down shots, it helps our team a
lot because we are small. We need to stretch people out. We need to hit the
open man. And we like to run. And that's the style we like to play. So he's
become the perfect point guard for our system.  
  
Q. An interesting tournament game obviously since you don't know about the
team, but have you set a deadline for when you stop really worrying about BYU
and when you just try and get your guys ready? Is it like tomorrow morning? Is
it just stop chasing ghosts and get ready to play in the morning?  
COACH CLUESS: We started doing that. In all fairness, we started doing that
this morning, even at our workout. We did talk about BYU, but only for about
15minutes of our practice.  
More of it was just really getting our own stuff going and working on some
things and fine tuning a few things that we thought we would be important in
this game.  
Now we're starting to watch some film of them as we're here. We'll get into
some more film later tonight. I think you're right: Sometime after breakfast
tomorrow it's just about us again, and let's just go out, play loose, have
fun, play the way we want to play and let people see what we're all about.  
  
Q. A team that a lot of people said didn't belong in last year's tournament
came here and won and then went to the Final Four. Is that something you'll
broach with your players at all?  
COACH CLUESS: Absolutely. I think it's a magical year for VCU last year, the
fact that they were here, and went from here to there. Means anything's
possible.  
That's the great thing about mid majors, low majors to get this opportunity,
is that we can all dream.  
The question is: Why not us?  
  
Q. Talk about the uniqueness of this game tomorrow night, the First Four,
it's a national stage, really the beginning of March Madness, and you're not
like one of 20 other games going on like Thursday or Friday.  
COACH CLUESS: I think it's great for our program and our school. It showcases
our school, showcases our program, gives people across the country a chance to
see what Iona basketball and Iona College is all about and all the good things
it has to offer, not only athletically, but academically.  
I'm thrilled that people‑‑ players and recruits that we're trying to get
involved with are going to have a chance to see us and spend a little time
watching us, and coaches are going to see us. We're going to hope that's going
to help our recruiting base as we move forward with this program.  
  
Q. Could you give us kind of a capsule of your guards and your back court
and what stands out about them and what makes them so good?  
COACH CLUESS: I'll tell you, we probably have five or six guys who can really
knock down the 3, and they're also extremely willing to share the ball. We put
several point guards on the court at the same time, sometimes two, sometimes
three. Occasionally this year we've had four out there together.  
Because of how we share the ball, I think that enables us to play against
teams of more size. And we do pressure the balls well. I don't know if that
will be effective against BYU or not. They have a very good passing team and
they're very good with the basketball. We'll find that out tomorrow night.  
And I think that ability in our back court and having Mike Glover kind of just
handle the inside really mostly by himself with a little help from some other
guys, that's why we've had some success.  
  
Q. You guys go through a lot of conference play as a favorite. And now to
maybe be on an even scale, does that change the psychology for your team at
all?  
COACH CLUESS: I think our guys should go into the game loose, to be honest
with you, because when you're playing as a favorite all the time, I think
people are shooting at you. It's not easy going on the road all the time and
being the target.  
I wouldn't even say that we're on an even playing with BYU. BYU is I think a
Sweet 16 team or something last year and has a richer history than we do.  
So for us to go into this game, we're looking at it like we're the Cinderella
team and we're going to try to go out and show everyone we can play.  
  
Q. On a lighter note, what about the fact that you're playing in front of
the President tomorrow night?  
COACH CLUESS: Like I said before, force them right, I've seen this game. It's
great that the President is spending time to come here to such a great event
as the NCAA and a tip‑off. It's tremendous that he can find the time with his
busy schedule, which is a lot more important than what we do.  
  
Q. There are a lot of good things going on with each team that maybe betrays
a 14 ‑versus‑14 matchup. Would you agree with that, that's maybe a little
higher caliber than 14s?  
COACH CLUESS: I absolutely agree with that. I think both teams are very good
teams and could play with a lot of teams at a higher level, higher‑ranking
level for this tournament. And it's going to be a very interesting game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to introduce our student‑athletes, Paul Crosby, Kevin
Burwell, Amos Studivant, and Cor‑J Cox.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the trip up here to Dayton, what the experience
has been like so far, do any of you have any connections to Dayton, Ohio,
anything like that?  
PAUL CROSBY: It's been exciting. It's been fun. The last 24hours has been
crazy. Been traveling a lot.  
But we can't wait. We can't wait for to play Western Kentucky. That's been our
goal to get to this point. And it's been fun so far.  
KEVIN BURWELL: I agree with him, too. It's just been a blessing to have this
trip. A lot of teams don't get to come here.  
So we're really looking forward tohaving a great game against them. And just
here to have fun. It's our last go‑around. So we're just here to enjoy the
ride.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about the atmosphere of the First Four and how
like you guys are on the big stage now, and how does that play into how your
mindset for tomorrow?  
KEVIN BURWELL: Well, I think we've been traveling a lot in our nonconference
schedule. So to us, the seniors, it's really not too much. We still are trying
to remain humble. We're taking this game just like another one. We're going to
come out there and try and handle business.  
  
Q. Can you guys take turns talking about that brutal early season schedule?
How tough was it to go through that without getting discouraged? I know you
guys do it every year, but you guys are playing the best teams in the country
and taking your lumps. How tough is it to go through something like that?  
AMOS STUDIVANT: Well, it's pretty tough going into those environments, pretty
much hostile environments where you're up against the big dogs, so‑called,
you're the underdogs.  
But we always know the goal. The goal is to go in, get better, get the
experience and come out and be ready for our conference.  
And it paid off. We kept our heads up and we stayed strong through the whole
journey.  
COR‑J COX: Like he said, just going into hostile environments and just playing
your hardest, getting better, getting ready for the conference. That's
something that's an honor. We stay humble and get out of there unscathed.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about playing in front of President Obama and
British Prime Minister Cameron tomorrow?  
KEVIN BURWELL: A lot of our guys are excited, a lot of our coaches are excited
for it, too, so it's going to be an honor. It's the President. Everybody wants
to see the President. It's going to be an honor. We're going to go have fun,
enjoying the game with him.  
COR‑J COX: Make sure he have fun watching.  
KEVIN BURWELL: That, too.  
  
Q. Does Coach ever talk to you about his last time at the NCAA Tournament?  
KEVIN BURWELL: He just‑‑ he says‑‑ like he talked about the experience and all
that. But he told us we just handle our business, we're going to experience
the same thing he experienced. I mean, he never really talked about it.  
He's always about us and handling business on the court. He doesn't talk about
his past like that, unless he's joking or something.  
PAUL CROSBY: Take it one game at a time. That's what he talks about.  
  
Q. Have you seen video of his shot?  
PAUL CROSBY: Oh, yeah, yeah.  
KEVIN BURWELL: Several times.  
PAUL CROSBY: All the time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
I'd like to welcome head coach of Mississippi Valley State, Sean Woods.  
  
Q. Can you give us a quick scouting report about Western Kentucky?  
COACH WOODS: I'll tell you what, they're a hard‑nosed team and they're playing
a little high right now with a lot of confidence. We've got to match their
intensity, especially inside on the boards and keep them from getting drives
to the rim and also keep us from getting in foul trouble.  
So we've got to contain the basketball under control, match their intensity as
far as attacking the glass, and then we've got to impose our will on them from
our defensive pressure also.  
So we've got some similarities, but we just gotta contain those few little
things that they present.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the early season schedule you guys go
through? I know the players understand it's for a greater good toward the end.
Is it tough to keep them up after the losses keep mounting?  
COACH WOODS: I'll tell you what, use it for recruiting, but losing is losing,
I don't care if you play North Carolina or if you're playing Saint Mary's of
the poor. You can get used to losing. Losing can become a habit.  
I was blessed this year and I wanted to do some things different, because I
knew we had to play the same tough schedule. I didn't beat my guys up this
year as far as with losses because I'm real big on going back and watching
tape and seeing something that could have‑‑ that could be a game‑changer, and
I'd go back in and be like why didn't you do this or that.  
What we wanted to do this year was really stay positive. Keep our eye on the
prize as far as winning our league, winning our conference, and having an
opportunity to be here.  
So what we did was we wanted to take something from each team that we played
that makes them successful, whether how they walk, how they talk, how they
practice, how they prepare, nuances, and put it into our arsenal, because we
knew that we should be or could have been one of the most talented teams in
our league.  
  
Q. I know you don't want to look ahead, but the possibility exists where you
could play against your former team if you guys are to get past this game. Is
that something you've thought about?  
COACH WOODS: You think about it. But right now I'm worried about Western
Kentucky. That's been our motto all year, and that's why we've been able to
win 17 straight.  
Our league is just staying focused on the task at hand and the game in front
of us, and right now it's Western Kentucky.  
  
Q. What have you told your players just about your own NCAA Tournament
experience and what they should expect in an atmosphere like this?  
COACH WOODS: Well, I told them to embrace everything. But the main thing is
when we get out in between those lines. All this is preliminary stuff right
now. Enjoy it. Because we come from a small school and we don't get a lot of
coverage, so enjoy this situation, but remember the task at hand, and that's
to beat Western Kentucky.  
  
Q. Also playing in front of two major dignitaries, the President of the
United States and the British Prime Minister, what are the thoughts about that
and the fact that you were picked for this game?  
COACH WOODS: Now, that's an experience, okay, now we can embrace that. How
many times do you get the President to come watch you play? So that's a good
thing.  
But even then Western Kentucky is still trying to beat your butt. So let the
President enjoy how hard you play and how good you play together so he can
have something good to say about you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Wisconsin  60  
Vanderbilt  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, it was a great college game if you didn't care who won.
We're very disappointed to have not won. We certainly had some opportunities
there at the end, and they made a few more plays than we did and deserved to
win.  
I'm really proud of my team and proud of my seniors, especially. They've given
us so much over the course of their careers. It really hurts for them because
they've invested so much in our program and done so much that's good and right
in college athletics.  
I'm very, very proud of them and very disappointed that we were not able to
win. But we congratulate Wisconsin because they did, and they made a few more
plays than we did.  
  
Q. John, how would you describe that last look that you had?  
JOHN JENKINS: It was a pretty good look. I felt like I got a good chance of
having it going in, just like a lot of looks I had today. It just didn't drop
for me.  
  
Q. John, can you talk about that? Because you don't have days where the ball
doesn't go in. Also, what were you holding again on the last inbounds pass
that was batted down by their center?  
JOHN JENKINS: Well, people who are going to shoot have off days, and it was
one of mine today, unfortunately. I wanted to keep playing. I didn't want to
give up on it.  
The last play, I think the ball got tipped. My back was turned, so I didn't
see the end of it. I think the ball got tipped, and that was it.  
  
Q. Jeffery, the defense that they put on you, how much of an effect did that
have on your shooting woes today, or was it just a matter of the ball not
going in for you?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: I think it was more a matter of the ball not going in. All of
my shots pretty much felt good. They just were a little bit short or a little
bit too long. Things like that happen in basketball. The ball isn't always
going to bounce your way, but I felt like I got really good looks.  
  
Q. Jeffery, was it tough for you to get into a rhythm because of the foul
trouble?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, when you start off the game like that and you
have to kind of play spot minutes, it's tough to get into the rhythm of the
game. So, yeah, it was a tough first half.  
  
Q. Festus, can you address, Wisconsin got a number of sort of loose ball
rebounds there at the end, especially a key one with 16 seconds left. What do
you remember on that possession?  
FESTUS EZELI: I remember the shot clock running down. Taylor took a shot, I
think that's who it was. I mean, long shots produce long rebounds. We know
that. I don't know, we just didn't come up with the ball.  
  
Q. Jeffery, obviously not the way you wanted fog out in The Pit, but can you
talk about what the experience was like playing here this week?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: It was a bittersweet experience. I was hoping to get the same
kind of ending I got last time I was here. It was really nice to be able to
come back and play in front of NewMexico fans and friends and family that I
haven't gotten an opportunity to play in front of for four years.  
But this wasn't the outcome that we were looking for. We wanted to come down
here and win two games. Unfortunately, they just made a couple more plays than
we did down that stretch of the game.  
  
Q. How much do you think Festus not starting affected that hole you guys
were in?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: Not at all. It's up to whoever is on the court to show up and
be ready. I mean, we played without Fest starting a bunch this year, and
nothing like that has happened. They just made some good plays at the
beginning of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stallings.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously the zone at the end of the game gave Wisconsin some
trouble, but did that give you guys a problem rebounding there at the end, do
you think?  
COACH STALLINGS: No, I thought we rebounded really well. They just got two
long ones there at the end back‑to‑back. I'd really have to see the replay to
see why.  
But they hustled those down and, obviously, that was big in the game. But the
zone worked. It helped us get back in the game, and it was certainly
bothersome to them in the last several minutes of the game. Unfortunately we
just didn't come up with those two balls.  
We got a really good look at the basket. We were at the foul line to tie the
game up. We just had some things that didn't play out the way we wanted them
to. But the zone was our best chance to win the game, for sure.  
  
Q. The last play you drew up, that inbound that Berggren blocked out. Can
you take us through what you hoped to get out of it?  
COACH STALLINGS: We had three different options. We had three different things
going. I actually‑‑ the last one might have, which was the one we thought we'd
get to, we thought they would see the first two. I think Jenkins was going to
be open there on the left side of the court, which is really what we were
playing for. Unfortunately, the ball got tipped. He's a big, long guy. That's
a tough pass to throw with not much space back there.  
  
Q. What did you think of John's look for that potential three?  
COACH STALLINGS: He was wide open. He's a great shooter, period. He's a really
great shooter going left, and he was going left and he was wide open. They
were afraid to switch because we had gotten them on the roll a couple times,
so they didn't show out. It might have been the best look he had the whole
game.  
So we ran the play, ran it to perfection. Got it right where we wanted him,
and he's made so many that have caused us to win games, and unfortunately,
that one just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't want to cost you any money, but you were upset after that
missed shot by John, and it wasn't about the missed shot; is that correct?  
COACH STALLINGS: Yeah, that's correct.  
  
Q. Coach, Evans got off to a really hot start, and you really buckled down
on defense after that. What changes did you make to take him out of the game
after?  
COACH STALLINGS: We just tried to deny him the ball. We doubled him a couple
times. One time he threw it to us, so we just tried to vary our looks at him
and put some different people on him and things like that. I mean, he couldn't
keep going the way he was going the whole day or he would have had a hundred
points, so he had to slow down at some point.  
  
Q. Kevin, you mentioned that Jenkins had maybe as good a look as he had all
day on that last one. You went 5 for 19 from three in the game. Did "W" do as
good a job this season limiting your looks from behind the arc?   
COACH STALLINGS: If you look at them, statistically, they're very good at
defending the three. We knew that going in. You try to get good looks against
them, we got some, some we didn't. We took some contested ones. That last one
wasn't contested. But we ran a play that had worked for us throughout the
game, and it gave us the exact.  
If had you just asked me what I was hoping to get in the play, what you saw
was exactly what I was hoping for. When you give that kid a wide open look, he
makes most of them. Today he didn't make it, which, that's okay. If we could
go out there and do it again, I'd like to see that look again, and I'd give it
to him again.  
  
Q. Coach, what recourse do you have after a game is over to talk about a
call that you don't think was called correctly?  
COACH STALLINGS: That call didn't cost us the game. The guy that got fouled
had just missed before that anyway. So who is to say he would have made the
free throws? That didn't cost us the game. Wisconsin cost us the game. They
played better than we did, and they made plays at the end, hustled down a
couple balls that were loose that were maybe 50‑50 balls that we might have
gotten.  
There was no call that cost us the game. It was just was what it was, but that
didn't cost us the game. Them playing better than we did is what cost us the
game.  
  
Q. What was the play call there on that last play?  
COACH STALLINGS: Our play?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH STALLINGS: You want to know the name of it?  
  
Q. What was the setup?  
COACH STALLINGS: It was just a side‑ball screen, and our five‑man setting a
ball screen for John, and John going left. We screened the five-man into the
ball screen to create some separation with his defender. They had been showing
out on it all game long, but we had started getting the roll guy on our ball.
So we got a dunk.  
So they were afraid to give up the lay‑up. That's why John ended up wide open.
We got the guy screened, John jabbed him, came off, and I think he took two
dribbles. It was real clean. He was real clear. Like I said, we'd run the same
play again if we had it to do over again.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Baylor  80  
Colorado  63

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, first of all, my hat goes off to Baylor. They played a heck
of a game tonight, and they deserve to win. In terms of Colorado basketball, I
couldn't be more proud of this group and the way they've represented us all
year long.  
We came up short tonight. In the second half, we couldn't make a shot,
couldn't get our offense going, especially when they went to zone. That kind
of changed the game.  
Tell you what, the fight and determination and the grit these guys have shown
over the last 10 to 12 days is inspiring to me. I'm just very, very proud of
our four seniors and the way they've handled themselves all year. We have two
of them up here and two of them still in the locker room. But they did this
program proud.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Colorado student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Carlon, you guys talked about their length yesterday. Were you surprised
they were able to get loose behind three, especially Heslip? He was really the
difference.  
CARLON BROWN: I thought we did the best we could. Obviously, it wasn't good
enough. Once he got going, it was almost impossible to stop. But I give our
guys credit for trying to stop them and making the extra effort. He was just
hot. Like Coach said, we couldn't make any shots to counteract that momentum
they were getting from him.  
No, it doesn't surprise me. They've got a good coach, great team, and they
definitely set some good screens for him to get open.  
  
Q. What will these last two weeks and what you guys did mean to you once the
pain of this loss is over?  
AUSTIN DUFAULT: Besides tonight's loss, obviously, it's been the funnest two
weeks of my life with these guys, just everything that we've accomplished.
It's just been really special and something I'll never forget.  
  
Q. Austin, during your run through the Pac ‑12 tournament and in your prior
game out here, your strength on the offensive boards was a big difference for
you. Today you guys just weren't able to keep up with them. What was kind of
the difference today?   
AUSTIN DUFAULT: I think they just did a great job. They really keyed on that.
They knew that was one thing we've been doing well, and they just did a great
job boxing us out. You've got to give them credit tonight. They were the more
physical team. We played as hard as we could, but they just got it done
tonight.  
  
Q. Carlon, what do you think the future of this program is?  
CARLON BROWN: I think the future is in great hands under Coach Boyle and his
staff. They've got some great guys coming in, a top 25 recruiting class, along
with the guys that are returning, these two freshman stars, Askia and Spencer,
and the back‑ups, Jeremy and Sab. The list goes down to Shane and everybody
else. So I expect Coach Boyle to get back here and this team to get back here
and do better than we did and advance.  
  
Q. The last seven minutes, what kind of went wrong? Do you think it was just
four tough games last week, another tough game on Thursday, did it all just
kind of catch up to you?  
CARLON BROWN: We're not a team of excuses, so we're not going to say that's
the reason. We just didn't make shots when we needed to make shots. Turned the
ball over so many times in key moments of the game. Really that zone stifled
us. We just didn't have it. No excuses.  
Baylor did the best job in guarding us so far caused us to turn the ball over.
They got hot hands on shots and were able to run and capitalize our turnovers
on mistakes. All the credit goes to them. It was nothing we did wrong.  
  
Q. Askia, what will this experience do for you and the younger guys that
have more time left in the program? These guys obviously fought for three
years to get here, and you get here right away, what can this do for you
guys?  
ASKIA BOOKER: First I want to say thank you to them, the four seniors, because
we wouldn't be in this position without them. Just to the future, I mean, this
is a great experience for me mentally just to go against these guys out here
that have been here for a while. I'm a new guy that came in, and I tried to
make an impact. I only want to make a bigger impact next year on the team and
try to get back to the same place or further.  
I mean, the list goes on when you talk about guys returning and guys coming in
for next year. I think it will be great. But thanks to these guys that that's
where all the credit goes to.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Boyle.  
  
Q. What impressed you the most about the way Baylor could just flip a switch
and take a one ‑possession game and just blow it out like that?   
COACH BOYLE: Well, I mean, Heslip was the difference. He was unconscious
tonight. They run good stuff to get them open. They ran a back screen. Nate
really guarded it well, and I think popped for a three. I mean, he made some
tough shots. But he was the difference in the game, there was no question
about it, Brady Heslip and their 17 offensive rebounds.  
If you look at the numbers in the first half, we shot 56%. They shot 34%, but
we're down two, because they had 12 offensive rebounds. We knew that was going
to be the key to the game, and we just couldn't get it done on the boards.
They're long. They're athletic, and they're physical. We just didn't get it
done tonight.  
The thing I like about our guys, Carlon said, we're not going to make excuses.
We got beat. But Brady Heslip was the difference in the game, and I thought
Pierre Jackson was terrific as well.  
We knew going in, those were the two guys. We had to contain Pierre Jackson
and we had to get to Brady Heslip. We didn't do a good job with either one.
Pierre had 15 points and 10 assists, and Heslip goes off for 27. So, you've
got to credit them. They're very explosive. Very talented. Very long.  
  
Q. What is the team going to look like next year, and what does the future
look like?  
COACH BOYLE: I couldn't be more excited. I couldn't be more optimistic. I told
the guys in the locker room, "Guys, it's not going to take us nine more years
to get back here."  
I don't know when it will happen. We were fortunate to get here this year. But
I think what this team did these last, again, ten days, two weeks, however
long it's been, is something that's really galvanized our team, our fan base.  
I can't say enough about our fans that came down tonight. I wish we could have
played better for them, but there is some excitement around our program right
now that we're going to capitalize on, and we're going to keep getting better.  
Our young guys I love. The back‑ups need to have great off‑seasons, and the
new guys coming in got to strap it on because we're going to be young next
year. We're going to have one senior instead of four. It's going to be a
different group, just like this years was. But I expect us to get better as
the year goes on, and I'm as optimistic about Colorado basketball today as I
ever have been. It's a testament to what this team has done the last two weeks
to put us in this position.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the assignment you gave André Roberson and he's
obviously giving away four inches to one of the best players in the country.
How do you think he acquitted himself and also a year ago he was considered an
athlete. How much better a basketball player is he than he was a year ago?  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, André's made tremendous strides. He really has as a
basketball player. His skillset is better offensively. It's still not where it
needs to be. There is still room for development and growth there.  
But I knew last year once he got starters' minutes he could do what he's doing
on the rebounding part of it. But I thought he did a good job against Jones
tonight. I really did. You look at Jones' line, he has seven points and four
rebounds.  
So André battled him. He was giving away size. Usually André's more athletic
than the guys he's going up against. He still needs to become a better box‑out
guy. He missed some box ‑outs tonight.  
André's a big part of our future. We want to have him have another great
summer, continue to get better. With the guys we've got coming in, he's going
to be a big part of next year's team and hopefully beyond.  
  
Q. What will you remember most about these last two weeks? What do you think
sparked you guys from where you were in Corvallis to getting this far?  
COACH BOYLE: What I'll remember is just the toughness and the grit that this
group played with and the belief that they started to get in themselves. I
think, again, it started in the Pac‑12 tournament, obviously. I don't think
you can point to any one thing that was a tipping point.  
But I think our one‑point win over Oregon gave us a lot of confidence against
a team that had just beaten us a week before. We matched up well with Cal, and
we just got on a roll.  
But this team came together and had a belief in itself that you have to have
to make a run like this, and we believed we were going to win tonight. We
really did. Carlon won't say it, but I will. You can tell by the way we shot
the ball in the second half against their zone, the way we shot our free
throws, our legs went. I pushed these guys. I was going to ride them till the
end and I did and we came up a little short. The gas tank kind of ran out
offensively. But these last two weeks have been really special.  
  
Q. Shane and Jeremy and obviously Ski made some plays, not a lot of plays
for some of those guys, but some really good plays. What will this experience
do for some of your bench guys next year?  
COACH BOYLE: It will help. Being on this stage, it can do nothing but help
those guys. It gives them confidence, and the thought that, hey, we can be
here and we belong here. Hopefully it inspires them to come back and work even
harder.  
We've got two new practice gyms that they built for us, and hopefully those
things are getting worn out. We'll give these guys some type off well
deserved. But this spring and summer and next fall we need to get back into
work and continue to get better.  
Again, I like the projection of where this program is and where it's going.
Couldn't be more proud.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Wisconsin  60  
Vanderbilt  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH RYAN: I'm just so proud of the effort that our guys gave, as you can
imagine. I just sat back there and listened to questions about the look that
Vanderbilt got. They beat us at that opportunity. That was a wide open shot as
we gave up the whole game. It just didn't happen to go down. We're the
beneficiaries of maybe a play here or there.  
But Kevin was right about the other thing. There were some loose balls, some
50‑50 balls, and we did get them, and that's a tribute to these guys.  
  
Q. Jordan, when did you think that you had a potential Sweet 16 team that
you were leading?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: As soon as the season began. Last summer, before the season
started, we knew we had coming in. We had a pretty balanced scoring attack. We
felt like we had guys that could put the ball in the hole. Any time you lose
guys like John and Keaton and Tim, it's going to look like you might not be
much coming in next year, but I think that's a credit to Coach too. It seemed
like year‑in and year‑out we lose guys but just replace them.  
  
Q. Jared, can you take us through your final offensive rebound and even the
final sequence of the game there?  
JARED BERGGREN: I knew I was close to the end line there, so I was hoping I
didn't come down on the line. I was a little nervous about that, I guess. I
was able to come down with the ball. I was look to go either get a timeout or
throw it off a defender behind me. Throw it to a teammate or something. They
ended up getting a hand on it, knocking it out of bounds and they were lucky
enough to retain possession.  
  
Q. If you can follow up, obviously your job was to stop that inbounds pass.
What were you trying to do, just swat that ball there?  
JARED BERGGREN: Yeah, well, we knew they couldn't run. We knew they weren't
going to throw anything short. Obviously, it had to be a long pass. Coach told
me just keep my hands up, use my length, and just try to get a finger tip on
it. I ended up pretty much getting my whole hand on it, getting the deflection
and it was good.  
  
Q. Jordan, I think it's been only three teams have been to more NCAA
Tournaments in consecutive years, yet you haven't been to the Final Four. Do
you feel like this team still has something to prove on a national level? That
you're an elite program?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, I think every year we take the approach never satisfied.
The beautiful thing about the NCAA Tournament is we're going to enjoy that win
for about 45 minutes. Some guys might be done enjoying it already because
we've got to get ready for a really good Syracuse team.  
But we're ready to go. We're enjoying our experience this year and just trying
to make it last as long as we can, just trying to play hard every possession,
every game.  
  
Q. Offensively you hadn't contributed much in recent games, today you did.
What was the difference? Confidence in your shot and the ability to just take
it?  
BEN BRUST: I've got great teammates. Jordan and Rob, their senior leadership
has been key throughout the past couple weeks. They never gave up on me, and
the whole team has confidence in each other. So we're just going to keep that
going forward.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know it happens pretty fast, but what's going through your mind
when Jenkins got that really good look there at the end?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: We were talking about it earlier. He's one of the best scorers
in the country, one of the best shooters in the country. So when you see a guy
get a look like that, your heart kind of drops. I know my mom already bought
tickets to Boston, so I was hoping that it didn't go in.  
But Jared did a great job of recovering there and making it as difficult as
possible. Ryan did a great job of checking out down low and securing the
rebound. But it was definitely heart definitely stopped for a second there.  
  
Q. The late shot clock buckets that you made, especially late in the game,
how much of that was by design to lull Vandy in? Or was it more of a case that
you didn't have an opening until it was down to one second?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: It was just more of kind of an opening. But Coach said to me in
the huddle you've got to step up as a senior and take that shot. I know I
missed a few, but got one to go down, and obviously the one that's I missed,
my teammate it's a great job.  
Josh with that huge offensive rebound at 16 seconds. I can't say enough about
him. He was throwing up at 3:00 a.m. this morning, and he did a great job of
just coming in. He dogged Jenkins as much as he could. That's why we're able
to have the success we have because we have teammates like Josh.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about that last ten minutes. It seemed that you were
looking for your shot. Was that something coach told you to do or did you just
come in and see the opportunity?  
BEN BRUST: I think coming off the bench, Coach tells everyone to be ready.
Just take advantage of the opportunities that were there. They were there
today, and teammates found me and knocked them down.  
  
Q. You guys were talking about Vanderbilt's open look, but that three
‑pointer you hit, was that as clean a look as you might have gotten?   
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, I know Jared set a pretty good screen up top. I just
tried to make a play, tried to make a shot. For the most part, I don't think
anybody but Ryan shot the ball that great. It wasn't pretty, but we made just
enough plays down the stretch to beat a really good team. We're proud of that
win, and now we've got to get ready for Syracuse.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Evans, another hot start. Can you talk about that keeping you going in
the first half and that big rebound at the end?  
COACH RYAN: All of our players are opportunistic. We don't have a guy that we
say, okay, the first five shots are going to be taken by this guy. We just
don't have that, even when we had some players that are still playing at the
next level. You just have to be ready to take what the defense gives you.  
I think our teams have been really good at that. Unselfish guys, understand
what we have at Wisconsin, who we are, and that's why they came here to play
for us.  
  
Q. To follow up on the question about Ryan. Where was his game when he got
here, and where have you seen the biggest spikes in his performance?  
COACH RYAN: He was pretty raw, but we could see the athleticism. He wanted to
be a player. His eyes on the visit. What he talked about. Great student. Big
Ten roots. We don't get Ryan Evans if his dad hadn't wrestled at Minnesota and
his uncle wrestled at Wisconsin. I kind of remind Ryan every once in a while
that I think he needs to wrestle a little bit. He needs to mix it up maybe a
little bit more. He's smooth, but we'd like to have him be a little bit more
physical.  
So that's when you say, well, where was he and is he now? He's getting
stronger, and he's filling out even more. He's definitely one of those guys
that's so much fun. When you go home and you reflect and you look at games or
after practices, you actually realize that as a coaching staff he rewards what
you give him. Feels good. It's like a teacher in a classroom. Kids do well on
the test, and teacher goes home, you know, that feels pretty good.  
So when a guy gets better and a guy does the thing that's he's doing, helps
his teammates. It teaches the younger guy that's if you work hard these kind
of things can happen. I think in our society has been lost a little bit, but
that's for another day. He's not entitled. He wasn't‑‑ everybody wasn't
chasing him. He wasn't on anybody's list. He just plays and enjoys it.  
  
Q. The guys felt like they still need something to prove in terms of
Wisconsin being an elite program and getting to that Final Four. Do you think
you need anything to prove?  
COACH RYAN: What is your highest award as a writer? Have you won the top
award?  
  
Q. No, I have not.  
COACH RYAN: Are you still trying?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH RYAN: That's our guys. We love this game, and we really don't care about
the peripheral things that are‑‑ I would think that people have learned that
over the years. There are just some programs that have a way of doing things.
They keep working hard, and then sometimes every once in a while things fall
into place. Guys get hot. That's what the NCAA Tournament is. We're not
anything but who we are, and people can dissect that anyway they want.  
  
Q. Who are you?  
COACH RYAN: We're going to the Sweet 16 in 2012 to play a very good team. That
means we survived and advanced. Gets harder. Everybody wants to win.  
  
Q. How concerned were you that Josh would be limited or wouldn't be able to
go at all?  
COACH RYAN: I didn't even want to say anything about it. Jordan let the cat
out of the bag here. You know, the IVs. I mean, we didn't know. We didn't know
if he was going to be able to play. But we know that he didn't have a very
pleasant morning after midnight.  
But he gave us what he had. The medical staff isn't going to let him play if
he doesn't have certain vitals. No way in the world Josh Gasser wasn't going
to play in that game. But really we don't make a big thing out of that, and I
wasn't going to say anything.  
I always tell Patrick not to get that stuff out in the media. We've had guys
with the flu during the year. Have you ever heard us say anything about it?
Jordan's the first guy. I've got to talk to him on the way back. We don't make
excuses at Wisconsin.  
  
Q. I read a story that said you arrived in the state of Wisconsin on March
17, 1976. If that's true, can you tell me what you remember about arriving in
the state? Also, what is your county of lineage?  
COACH RYAN: I realize people in Wisconsin drink a lot of beer because it was
St. Patrick's Day. Not any more than anybody else. But I realized Wisconsin is
a state that they love life. They know how to enjoy themselves, but they also
know how to work hard, and they appreciate people that work hard. Just
watching Barry's football teams and other football teams before Barry, there
is a certain way that people play. It's what fans become‑‑ they appreciate
effort.  
Again, we led the Big Ten in average attendance. We're always one of the top
teams in the country. I think there were only 300 or 400 tickets this year
that weren't sold after about eight or nine years of sellouts. It's just the
way it happened. Wisconsin, I haven't left. It's a good place.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about limiting Jenkins and Taylor, the two top
SEC scorers?  
COACH RYAN: Well, what you have to do is you have to take the coaching staff.
Gary Close had the scout on this, and just pat him on the back and say there
are some things that we did with some jump outs where we switched off or some
keys. In a one day turnaround for our guys to stick to those rules pretty
well, that's what I mean. That last shot was the one time that we did not have
him covered. Little nerve‑wracking.  
But it's what we do with people that are good. I mean, we guarded a guy like
Gatens from Iowa the same way, and he's fading backwards. He's fading
sideways. He's hitting threes. I mean, it doesn't always work, but I like our
percentages.  
  
Q. Had some pretty good success in this building now. Any impressions on it
before you leave?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I think other than the allergy issue, which I guess is
everywhere, especially this time of the year, great city. The people at the
hotel couldn't have been any nicer. They were very helpful. It was nice to get
the Wisconsin fans here that were here. And our teams usually travel well, so
hopefully in Boston we'll pick up a few more. We don't care if people jump on
the bandwagon because the bandwagon needs to get bigger. We need some help.  
But Albuquerque, great city. I've always liked it, and I was only here once
before. But it was a great experience because I had it with my dad.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Baylor  80  
Colorado  63

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH DREW: I was very proud of the second half, and especially the last ten
minutes how we clamped down on the defensive end, really did a great job
rebounding. Then Brady was obviously on fire, but his teammates did a great
job getting him the ball. Brady's one of the first to tell you my teammates
really got me open and got me the ball. That humility is what makes our team
successful.  
As far as Colorado, I think we were in the championship game of the Big 12
Tournament playing four games in four days and lost. I have so much respect
for them in how they won that tournament and were able to come in here and win
a game. They've done an outstanding job and have a lot of toughness. They're
going to be very successful in the future.  
  
Q. Brady, how would you describe your evening?  
BRADY HESLIP: I'm just feeling great right now, first of all, because we won.
I'm just happy for my seniors. Quincy Acy, nobody wanted to go home today. We
played like that in the second half for sure. So it's an amazing feeling right
now.  
As for the shooting, Pierre does a great job finding me when I'm open and
finding me in transition. Acy sets great screens and it was just one of those
nights.  
  
Q. Brady, can you describe what it feels like to get into that kind of
groove? You just kind of know you're going to hit it when you're that hot?  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, when they say great screens and they make passes that are
on target and on time, it just make it's easy for me, especially if I'm in
rhythm and feeling good shooting. It just makes it even easier.  
  
Q. Brady, can you talk a little about your lineage? Everybody knows you were
practically born with a basketball in your hands and how that got you to this
point with your father and your uncle?  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, it's something that I've been around since I was 3 years
old. I think I made my first basket. Ever since I was growing up, they never
forced it on me. It was just something that I fell in love with. My dad, my
uncle, my mom, and grandpa and grandma have just been really supportive of me
through all my years and supportive of me following my dream.  
  
Q. Pierre and Quincy, do you have a name for this when he goes off in games
like this? What do you call it?  
QUINCY ACY: Straps.  
  
Q. Why?  
PIERRE JACKSON: Strap the scene. That's what we say when you make threes, and
Brady strapped the scene tonight.  
QUINCY ACY: We got that from the red shirt Bobo Morgan.  
  
Q. How would you describe, Pierre, Brady's shooting night?  
PIERRE JACKSON: I don't know. I know he's capable of it, man, we've just got
to get him open, and he did a great job of getting his shot off fast and it
went in. Strapped the scene.  
  
Q. Question for Quincy about Brady, when you see him putting the ball up,
how confident are you that it's going in? How comfortable are you when you see
him about to drop the three?  
QUINCY ACY: I know how hard he's worked. When he came in, we knew how good of
a shooter he was. Every time I went to the gym at night, I would see him in
there sometimes twice a day. He works for it. I know whenever he gets hot, he
can outshoot anybody. I think he got me two assists, so, you know, that's
always good.  
  
Q. Brady, on a typical summer day, how many threes are you taking in the gym
by yourself? Number two, what is your brand of chewing gum when you're
playing?  
BRADY HESLIP: Oh, man, the brand I chew of gum is supplied by Mr. DC, the best
trainer in college basketball. It's Doublemint. And on a summer day, I don't
know exactly how many threes I would get up, but I wake up early in the
morning before class and I go work out. Then I go to the gym after class and
work out. Then I'll have whatever we do in the afternoon, and then I'll get
more shots at night, so, a lot.  
  
Q. Quincy and Pierre, can you talk about the decision to switch to the zone
and how effective it was at the end of the game?  
QUINCY ACY: Well, that's the advantage of having a great coach. Sometimes we
might have to switch to man and guard people. But the zone, I think it really
bothered them, and I think it was unexpected. Sometimes they might prepare for
our zone and they might have stuff for it or whatever.  
But I think whenever we started out in man, they got comfortable, then we
switched to zone, and that really threw them for a loop. We did a good job of
flying everywhere. Whatever defense we choose to play, if guys buy into it, I
think we'll be successful.  
PIERRE JACKSON: Yeah, Quincy said it all. It goes to the coaching staff.
Decided to switch it up on them.  
  
Q. Brady and Quincy, from what I understand, Brady Heslip was the number one
trending topic on Twitter in the United States. Not sure what you can say to
it, but how does that feel and what does that mean for Baylor basketball,
actually?  
BRADY HESLIP: Pierre knows all about that. He's the Twitter master. He's got
all the followers, so I'm just trying to catch him.  
No, it's cool. I guess that's what happens nowadays with the media. But I'm
really just happy that we won the game.  
QUINCY ACY: That's a big deal to have a lot of people talking about you. I
guess that's good in a positive way. You don't want to be trending for
anything bad, so good job. Follow us on Twitter too, guys.  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, you can put that in there.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Drew.  
  
Q. Coach, K ‑State's out today, Missouri loses yesterday. It's just and you
Kansas left. How important is it for you guys to fly the flag for the Big 12
from here on out?   
COACH DREW: Well, obviously there is a lot of pride in the Big 12 conference,
and we think‑‑ is Iowa State out? Shows you that I haven't seen any scores
today. I've been focused on what we have.  
But definitely the Big 12, we think, is an outstanding conference. We're going
to work as hard as we can, not only for Baylor University, but for the Big 12.
I think that's why it shows the parity, number one, the match‑ups you get in
the NCAA Tournament. The last thing with that, again, that's why it's March
Madness, the excitement that anybody can beat anybody on any given night.  
I think going through the grind of the Big 12 conference, some teams might not
be able to do that, but on one game, one night, 40 minutes, anybody can beat
anybody in Division 1. There are that many good players, that many good
coaches, that many good fans.  
  
Q. Coach, I think Brady only got one shot in the first nine minutes of the
second half?  
COACH DREW: Bad coaching (smiling).  
  
Q. Did you change anything, or was it just emphasis?  
COACH DREW: Well, we ran some plays to get him open, but most of all, the
credit goes to the guys. They found him and they got him open. I thought
Colorado really made it tough for our interior to score as efficient as we
normally do. I think we missed some easy buckets. Because they were helping so
much, it allowed Brady to get open on some of the screening action.  
What I was most impressed with, and we haven't mentioned anything about the
altitude to our team, but he was the only one that I thought shooting‑wise
didn't show any affects to play 39 minutes, shoot that well, and not have any
effects of the altitude.  
I think that goes back to Quincy Acy talked about his hard work. He's in the
gym two times a day, sometimes three times a day. So he's used to fighting
through fatigue and shooting when he's tired. That's why he's a successful
player.  
  
Q. I think the story is going to be the three ‑pointers. But that defensive
switch there at the end, how big was that, and why did you decide to go to it
at that point?   
COACH DREW: First of all, credit Colorado. We were having trouble stopping
them. They were shooting 50‑something percent. They had scored a bunch of
times in a row. That is the biggest challenge we've had all year as a coaching
staff. We have a lot of depth and a lot of options.  
What's so tough for a player, and anyone can relate in work, if one day your
boss gives you the top story, gives you the top story, and then the next day
doesn't use you for days and you're like, "What did I do wrong?"  
So that's been tough for us because when we play certain lineups, we play a
certain style. When we play other lineups, we play a certain style.  
Credit the leadership to the team because very easily it could have been about
me, myself and I; and if it is, then none of that works and your depth becomes
your biggest weakness rather than your biggest strength.  
  
Q. Pierre's ball handling in penetration provided a lot of problems for
Colorado. How important is that for you guys to make a run deeper into the
tournament?  
COACH DREW: Well, Pierre's penetration and ball handling that's bothered a lot
of opponents. He missed a lot of shots tonight he normally doesn't miss. To
have ten assists is outstanding, five steals. He just does so much stuff. When
he turns it over, there is a good chance he steals it back before they get it
down the court anyway.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Vanderbilt student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jeffery, you guys have played Kentucky tough twice during the regular
season. Could have probably won both games. I'm just curious, how much did you
need, if at all, to beat them in the SEC final, whether it's to build some
confidence or heading into this tournament what you could accomplish?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: I think it served as a great confidence boost for us. We've
been really confident throughout the year that we would start playing well and
that things would come together. But to see everything work out the way it did
last weekend, going through the tournament and actually beating those guys,
they were rightfully the No. 1 team in the country. They had won 25, 26 game
that's row.  
So beating those guys was great momentum. Heading into here, I think it was
one of the best things that could happen to us at that point in the season. I
really feel like we're playing some great basketball right now.  
  
Q. Brad, I heard some of you guys comment after the game last night that a
monkey was off your back for winning that first round game. What do you think
the net effect of that will be getting that first win in this tournament?  
BRAD TINSLEY: Yeah, I think it just relieves a lot of whatever pressure there
was on that game. We can kind of get past that aura of us losing in the first
round and just kind of concentrate on Wisconsin and playing a tough game
against them. There's a lot of excitement and a lot of joy out of our locker
room. It was just great for our guys and our program.  
  
Q. Jeffery, just in general what do you think the keys are going to be
against Wisconsin tomorrow, both what you need to do offensively and what you
need to defend them because they like to run the shot clock down?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: We're going to have to be really patient on both ends. They
take a lot of time when they have the ball on offense. We can't get impatient
and start rushing stuff trying to get the game going too fast. They do a
really good job of making shots and making plays at the end of the shot clock,
and we just have to play solid defense. Then when we get the ball, we have to
try to push it and get the pace going in the game.  
  
Q. Lance and Brad, I wondered what you guys have felt about the altitude or
if it was even something you guys noticed?  
LANCE GOULBOURNE: I noticed it in the first couple minutes of the game, to be
honest. I was a little winded faster than normal. I'm not used to playing in
altitude like this. Last year we played in Denver, but I feel like in
Albuquerque for some reason it got to me a little more. But being here for
three days now, it shouldn't be a problem going forward.  
BRAD TINSLEY: Yeah, I definitely agree with Lance. The first couple minutes I
think it got to us a little bit just trying to get your wind. Once we settled
in the first couple minutes and kind of got used to it, it was fine from
there.  
  
Q. Brad, unless I was mistaken on the video after you guys beat Kentucky, it
looked like Kevin was crying on the bench. Had his face buried in a towel. Was
it that emotional of a victory that night for him?  
BRAD TINSLEY: Yeah, I think so. It meant a lot to our program and him
especially. He's had an unbelievable career at Vanderbilt. He told us after
the game that was one of the happiest moments he's had as a coach at
Vanderbilt. So it meant a lot to all of us. Just the excitement and joy caught
up to a lot of us and it showed.  
  
Q. Jeffery, there is a kid on the Badgers, Rob Wilson, who was kind of an
unknown until the last few weeks and he had 30 against Indiana. He kind of
came out of nowhere. He adds a lot of athleticism to their lineup. I'm
wondering as you scout them and prepare for them, what do you think of his
game?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: He's kind of the X‑factor in the game. He came out of nowhere
and started making a lot of great plays for those guys. So we have to do a
really good job of limiting his attempts, limiting the way he potentially can
hurt us, which is shooting, making three point shots, making open shots for
them. So he'll be the key to the game and we're looking forward to the
challenge.  
  
Q. How important has Ezeli been to what you can do on both ends of the
court?  
LANCE GOULBOURNE: I think his presence is well documented on the defensive end
of the court. He's a big, physical kid. He blocks shots for us. Even when he's
not blocking shots, he also shots, and it's kind of intimidating for people
coming in and driving into our lane because they know he's going to
potentially block a shot.  
On offense, he gives us a pressure release. We can throw the ball in there and
he can go to work and dominate in the paint. He gets to the free‑throw line a
lot, and that helps us out because obviously games are won at the free‑throw
line a lot.  
He's just been progressing very well this year. He obviously started very slow
with his injuries, but he's been getting better. For us to win going forward,
he's going to have to be very dominant and I think he will be.  
  
Q. Your seeding was no more than posted and you became the trendy pick to
make a little run here in the tournament. How have you guys dealt with that?  
LANCE GOULBOURNE: Just by keeping focus on the game ahead of us. Not looking
at what people's expectations may be of us. We wanted to focus on Harvard. We
did well with that challenge, and now today we prepare for a Wisconsin team
tomorrow who is a very good team. We're just focused on the next game and not
worried about what may come after that. Just staying focused and preparing for
what's ahead of us.  
  
Q. Brad, wondered if you guys had a chance to experience anything in
Albuquerque yet and what your impression of it is?  
BRAD TINSLEY: I had a really good friend play here a couple years back, Troy
DeVries, and I came to watch a game when he played. He played with Danny
Granger. It was an unbelievable experience. The fans here are really cool down
in The Pit. I had no clue about this atmosphere here until I came to watch
that game. It was really awesome to see their support for the team, and even
the support we got yesterday. It's just an awesome atmosphere for college
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stallings.  
  
Q. I'm doing a story about Rob Wilson, kind of the sixth guy on the Badgers
that's kind of come on of late. I'm just wondering what his athleticism and
what he adds to the Badgers in terms of scouting and preparation for playing
them?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, Bo would first of all be the better guy to answer that
question. But from what I can see on tape is he gives them another scorer,
obviously experienced because of his age and some athleticism. He has the
ability to drive the ball to the basket as well as break loose for a bunch of
threes like he did on senior night.  
So that's a great weapon to have coming off your bench when you have a guy
that can come in and change the game a little bit athletically and also change
it from a three‑point perspective.  
  
Q. Obviously you started the season with Ezeli with the suspension, but I'm
curious now with the way you guys played in the SEC Tournament and the way
you're playing now, is this the team that you thought you might have at the
beginning of the year?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, honestly, no, because Festus has not ever gotten back
to a hundred percent, aside from that, on a regular basis, yes. Now we have‑‑
we started the same team, I think, every game in conference play. So these
were the guys that I thought we'd have, but he has not been quite as healthy
as we would have thought prior to the start of the season.  
  
Q. These guys seemed elated after winning yesterday to get past the first
round. How much was that hanging over the head of this program, and how do you
think it will affect you going forward?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, I think that it was a bigger weight than we would have
liked for it to have been. But nonetheless, it was something that was
discussed frequently and talked about a lot nationally, talked about a lot
locally. So it did feel like a weight off our back, for sure.  
There was probably more relief yesterday for us than excitement, and that's
kind of a shame, because you really deserve to enjoy this and be excited about
any success that you have. But be that as it may, I think going forward, now
we've kind of ridded ourselves of that and we can be the loose and free
confident team that we aspire to be. That's certainly who we need to be
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about the changes you've seen in Jenkins' game on
the court and his leadership off the court?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, the changes in his game have been terrific. His
shooting skills speak for themselves. You don't have to discuss those too much
and haven't had to discuss them much since he arrived on campus.  
But his defense has just gotten so much better. He's now a quality defender
that we can rely on and actually really depend on, and that's a big change
from his first two years. His ball handling, his passing, he made a couple of
really nice passes yesterday off ball screens. So his ball handling and
passing have gotten better also, as has his ability to take the ball to the
rim and get to the foul line.  
He's had several games this year where he shot 10‑plus free throws. So as good
a shooter as he is, that's obviously a valuable thing as well. So I would say
those are the areas that he has shown the most improvement in, and he's a
tremendous worker. He spends as much time in the gym trying to get better as
anybody I've ever coached. He deserves to get better. Those are the guys that
improve.  
  
Q. How much better are you defensively than you were when last season ended?
You kind of alluded of Jenkins improving in that area. Is that the biggest
factor for that improvement?  
COACH STALLINGS: We're a lot better. Although it didn't seem like it yesterday
in the second half, but we're a lot better defensively than we were a year
ago. Our numbers attest to that. As a matter of fact, going into the last week
of conference play, I think that we were .01 of a percentage point behind
Kentucky for the best defensive field goal percentage in the league. We
slipped a little bit the last week of the league.  
But nevertheless, I would say that John's improvement has been a significant
factor. But I think collectively we've gotten better, our age, our experience.
Tinsley's gotten better. Festus has gotten better. Festus was a real presence
around the basket, which you could see yesterday in the game. So we have guys
that are close to being elite defenders or elite defenders, we think, and we
can cover a lot of the places on the court with pretty good defensive players.  
That and I think that we've bought into defense. I think this team has bought
into defense a little bit more than last year's team did.  
  
Q. You look at the scouting report for Harvard, the discipline and defense
they had. How similar or different is the scouting report with Wisconsin, and
do you like the contrast of styles there?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, there are some similarities between Harvard and
Wisconsin in that they, I believe, one, Wisconsin has allowed the fewest
points per game in the country, and maybe Harvard was third or fourth. So
there was a similarity.  
Both of them are very willing to get late on the shot clock to get what they
want to get offensively. So I think there are two very striking similarities.
But Wisconsin has a unique style of play. They're unique on both ends in some
respects. Without going into any detail, it's one of the reasons that they've
been very successful is because they're really in tune with what their coach
wants and how they have to play in order to be successful. That's why they win
is because they buy into what their coaches are asking for, and they execute
it very well.  
  
Q. You mentioned there was a sense of relief beating Harvard. I'm curious
what the feelings were beating Kentucky in the SEC Tournament after coming
close those first two times in a regular season?  
COACH STALLINGS: I would have described that emotion more as more jubilation,
more excited. A tremendous sense of accomplishment to have won a championship
and beaten perhaps a team that's been the best team in college basketball all
season long.  
We had two very competitive games with them in the regular season, both of
those games they out‑executed us in the last three or four minutes of the
game. The last one we out‑executed them, and that's why we were able to win.  
It was a very gratifying, jubilant moment for us.  
  
Q. I saw a stat where your starters have 451 starts. What are the benefits
of running on a four ‑year program in this day and age? Is Wisconsin even kind
of similar to that?   
COACH STALLINGS: Well, the benefit of it is you have guys that are experienced
and you have guys that are around for a longer period of time and they can
learn what it is that you want and need and all of those things as long as
they buy in, which our group certainly has.  
I think that experience is a great equalizer, but talent a lot of times will
trump experience. We would take guys that were one or two and done. If we got
one, we'd be just fine with that, but we haven't gotten any of those yet. The
ones‑‑ the guy that's we have in our program right now have done a great job
for us for four years.  
These seniors have really done a terrific job for our university and our
basketball program and it's been a real pleasure to coach them and to watch
them grow.  
  
Q. The fact that Wisconsin even though they lost some players from last
year, they were in the Sweet 16, second round for this particular bunch is
uncharted waters. Is there any advantage or disadvantage to that going into
tomorrow?  
COACH STALLINGS: I don't think so. I think now it's just about playing really
good teams. We played a really good team yesterday, but now that we've kind of
gotten past that hurdle, which quite honestly wasn't a hurdle so much for the
coaching staff as it was for this senior class. Now it's about going out and
playing.  
The team that executes the best, the team that makes the plays at the end of
the game, the team that plays the hardest‑‑ it's like any other game where two
teams were very evenly matched. I think that's the kind of game I expect the
least. The team that can do those things will probably be the team that comes
out with a victory.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for Wisconsin student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, you have generally been assigned to players this year, but I'm
curious if you've scouted Vanderbilt? When you look at Jenkins, what do you
see and what kind of challenges does he pose?  
JOSH GASSER: He's definitely one of the best offensive players around, no
doubt about that, and a prolific three‑point shooter. That is the first thing
that pops out. But he can come off screens to take it to the rim. So we've
obviously faced tough players, so that's definitely going to help going
against him. But it should be a fun challenge.  
  
Q. Mike and Jordan, can you tell me what the emergence of Rob Wilson in the
last six weeks has meant for your team on the court and maybe in the locker
room?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, it's meant a lot. It's been a morale booster at times. I
think everybody in the locker room has been really happy to see Rob get it
going the way he has. But it's obviously been big in games where other people
struggled, myself or anybody else that struggled, especially in the Indiana
game. It's been big. It's been great to see him step up.  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Yeah, definitely it's a good thing. Kind of seems as Rob got
going I was kind of struggling, but that's all right. That's how the season
goes. It's good to see him. We're all happy for Rob. It's good to see him at
the end of his career step up like he has in the last six weeks. As Jordan
said, it's been a big help, especially in the Indiana game, and the game with
Ohio State and stuff like that. It's been huge for us.  
  
Q. You guys haven't bombed out of a tournament, but you haven't had a long
run either. How hungry is this team for tournament success?  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: I think we're extremely hungry. We got a little taste of it
last year, but we always want more. That's kind of our motto. It's kind of how
everybody in our locker room is. We always want more. We always want better.
We challenge each other every day and try to get better every day. I think
last year was a good treat, but we want more.  
  
Q. Jordan, after watching your team play yesterday, you guys seemed
relentless in the way you do things in the repetition. It's the same thing
over and over. Are you a frustrating team to play against?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: You're right, we do work on things. Coach Ryan stresses getting
things right and making good habits. It's kind of what makes us good at some
of the things we do, especially defensively, just sticking the things we do.
But in terms of being frustrated playing against us, I guess I can't really
answer that because I haven't played against us.  
But you hear different things from people, and everybody has their own
opinion. Coach said yesterday everybody has their own opinion, but that's what
makes it fun is everybody having their own opinion. Especially in March,
everybody's going to voice their opinion now too.  
  
Q. Jordan and Josh, lot of people talk about the altitude here being a
factor, and both of you guys played a lot of minutes yesterday. Did you guys
notice it at all?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Not really. We got out here Tuesday, and we've been out here. I
think Coach Ryan really stressed that. Just wanted to get us out here and
acclimated to the altitude. I think we've done a good job of handling that.  
It's all basketball at the end of the day. Everybody's going to be fatigued.
The altitude's going to affect everybody, if it does affect anybody in any
way. So you've just got to come out and play hard.  
JOSH GASSER: In the game and few days of practice, tell you the truth, I did
feel a little tired. But it's just the way it goes. It's good we got out here
a few days early to get used to things, but adrenaline can get you through
that during the game.  
  
Q. You guys watched TV, and I think you saw everyone kind of jumped on the
Vandy bandwagon as soon as they got their slot in the NCAA Tournament on
Sunday. Do you embrace the underdog role a little bit or how do you feel about
that?  
JOSH GASSER: Yeah, why not? It's just another tough opponent on the journey.
So they deserve the credit they've gotten, and we know they're a really good
team beating Kentucky in the championship game. They're just like us. They've
had some big wins. They've been pretty soiled all year long, so expecting it
to be a tough battle of 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jordan, after watching Ezeli in person yesterday, how does that affect
your ability to get to the paint and make something happen? In a day where
there are not that many true centers, he is one.  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, he's a monster. He's an imposing force down there. But
we've got some bigs too in Jared, and Ryan's probably an undersized four, but
he can definitely do more than hold his own down under the basket.  
In terms of just getting in the paint, it doesn't really change. Just try and
get in there, and when you get in there, make good decisions. Try to find your
teammates or finish around the rim.  
  
Q. Jordan, you mentioned Ezeli and Jared, and you've talked about the fact
Do you think he is up for this challenge? Are you eager to see how he goes up
against a guy that good?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: I think Jared's ready for it. Ezeli's a big guy, and he's
deserved all the credit he's garnered throughout his career. But Jared's faced
Jared Sullinger and Draymond Green throughout the year, and they're no
slouches either.  
I think Jared and Ryan, whoever draws him will be more than ready for the
challenge. As a team I think so too. It definitely is going to be a challenge,
but we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Jordan, what do you do against a guy like Jenkins?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: It doesn't really change. Like Josh says, we've seen scorers
like that before. He's a really talented player. Same thing with Ezeli, we've
played with guys like William Buford throughout the league, Brandon Paul, all
guys that can fill it up. And Josh has done a great job with all those guys.
We have to help him as a team, but as an individual, he's going to be ready
for that. He's going to come with his A game, so we have to bring ours too.  
  
Q. Mike, what are the particular challenges of your defense guarding
opponents who have multiple three ‑point shooters?   
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: We've got to make sure‑‑ our whole philosophy is to try to
run guys off the line and not letting them get going. If they have multiple
guys, we can't help quite as much off those guys. We have to make sure we take
that away. And force them into tough two‑point jump shots. That's kind of our
philosophy.  
Coach Ryan always preaches it. Teams beat you from behind the three‑point line
and getting to the rim and getting free throws. But if a team can beat you
with contested two‑point jump shots, you've got to clap your hands and say you
guys were better than us today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Wisconsin coach, Bo Ryan.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Vanderbilt and what you see and what you don't see as
far as their aggressive three ‑point style?   
COACH RYAN: Well, that's what jumps out, but they do other things pretty well
too. You have to remember, they've played in games in the 50s, played in games
in the 80s, and they've played everything in between. So they can play at any
pace, and they can dictate the pace themselves. They're so athletic and have
size, so they're really not limited in any areas.  
After all the games we've looked at of them, trying to find weaknesses is hard
to do. So we have to play to our strengths. We've got to shoot a good
percentage because if you really have to rely on a lot of stuff inside against
them, it's going to be tough.  
  
Q. In light of what you just said, how important is tempo in this game? Is
something we over blow?  
COACH RYAN: The people that talk about tempo and the people that get into that
stuff are people that have never played. That's okay, because the game of
basketball, it can't just be the guys on the court. There's got to be coaches.
There's got to be fans. There's got to be people that try to analyze.  
The one thing that you always have to remember, have you ever met a coach
that's been successful that isn't the type of person that growing up on the
playground didn't figure out somehow, some way, a way to win: Marbles,
baseball cards, horse, jacks, and don't laugh, in my neighborhood in Chester,
jacks for guys was big‑‑ and I had real quick hands.  
So I did pretty well. Found a way to win - Tennis, racquetball, if you're not
a power player, do you lob? Do you play to people's weaknesses better?
Whatever it is, there are people who try to figure out ways to be successful.
And there's a lot of different ways to do it.  
So it always tickles me when people talk about tempo or speed and all that. I
think what you have to do is you've got to figure out the best way for your
team to come out on the left‑hand side.  
Having coached a team that averaged almost 98 points a game 20‑something years
ago, a team that still holds the NCAA defensive record for 47 and a half
points in a season with the shot clock on the three‑point line‑‑ whew, I
almost couldn't get that out.  
So being around 40 years, I just laugh when I hear people in studios and
people‑‑ that's why I always have the sound down. I know I'm not doing
anything for ratings here. But here's the deal: If you really watch people
play and you know basketball, I think people would think twice about when they
refer to tempo. I really do.  
  
Q. Vanderbilt has struggled at times with teams with effective point guard
play, and you have a very good one. Could you talk about what makes Jordan
such a special player?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I had all the box scores from every game from Vanderbilt on
a sheet of paper. Here's the sheet of the wins and here's the sheet of the
losses. So you're saying I need to go back and look at that short list of
losses and see who the point guards were?  
They've played against every kind of offense, every kind of team. When you get
to this level of the NCAA Tournament, or even get to the NCAA Tournament, you
figure you've seen just about everything. But if you say that they've
struggled against that, we do have a very good point guard.  
We trust the team to him on the floor, in the locker room, and he's been a
great leader. He's been a great leader since the first day he walked on
campus. He understands the game. He understands his teammates. He understands
what our strengths are and what we need to play to.  
  
Q. Kevin Stallings didn't like this reference. I just wanted to see how you
reacted to it. Top 50 guys. How much pride do you take?  
COACH RYAN: What top 50?  
  
Q. Well, taking guys that maybe aren't top 50 guys, but they come out on the
other end but are stars, all Big Ten, go to the NBA?  
COACH RYAN: I know you guys are going to go, he's kidding me. I have never
looked at a‑‑ I don't even know what top 50 means. You know what, I have guys
at Wisconsin that want to be there and take on the academic challenges. I've
got guys at Wisconsin that want to work hard and want to be a part of
something special, and they want to continue a tradition.  
So, again, that's for people who probably haven't played that do those
rankings, I would think. I don't look at them. I don't say to my assistants,
okay, you have to go out there and get me a guy that's the fifth ranked power
forward in the country. I've never done that. We've got some good players
though.  
  
Q. Have you talked to your guys about ‑‑ what have you talked to your guys
about dealing with a scorer like John Jenkins?   
COACH RYAN: We've played some pretty good teams, but, wow. Some three‑point
shooters are better just catch and shoot. Feet square, shoulder square. Some
are pretty good off of staggereds and especially going left, going right.  
So you look at the tendencies of all these threes that he's made or missed. We
haven't found a weakness. He can score from the three‑point line about any way
possible step backs, fades. If you know of any way to stop him, please feel
free. I can get you my number.  
What a prolific scorer. When they use that term, I've heard them use it about
a lot of guys, but for him, if you looked it up, you'd see his picture.  
  
Q. I know it's only one round plus in, and the tournament is a bit of a crap
shoot. But based on what you saw this year, did you expect the Big Ten to
perform like it has thus far?  
COACH RYAN: Well, yeah, it is. You called it a crap shoot. Sometimes it isn't
the line; it's the match‑up that you have and the type of team. You could
always go back and say, okay, if we had been sent to this region and that was
our first game or this was our second game‑‑ coaches do that every once in a
while. I'm so proud of the league. I just really think that the league has
prepared us to play other people.  
Now what the results are going to be, that's to be seen. But I think in our
conference with those coaches and the way they do things and how the league
made everybody better as the league went on. That's the best chance we have.
So I thought we prepared each other.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Colorado's student‑athletes.  
  
Q. It seems like it was only two weeks ago you guys were playing in Oregon.
What triggered the dramatic run? And what's it been like since then?  
NATE TOMLINSON: It has been a bit of a change. We took two hard losses in
Corvallis. We had to come together as a group when we got back to Boulder. We
had one of our best practices of the year a couple days before we went out to
L.A., we really came together as a group out there, and the roll just
continued into last night.  
  
Q. This question is for Carlon and Nate. I know you guys are probably used
to hearing it when you're playing on your home court. But what was it like
last night with the Colorado fans, and did that make a difference in your
performance at all?  
CARLON BROWN: It was great walking out to the floor, seeing all the black and
gold at the top. Really gave us a lot of energy. We did feel like we were
playing at home. So our fans have been great all year. Obviously, bringing
them to L.A. was a great attribute to us winning. We can't thank Mike Bohn and
the CU fans enough for their continued support throughout this run.  
NATE TOMLINSON: Yeah, I can't say more than what Carlon said. They've been
great the whole year and really helped us get through some tough games at home
and obviously on the road in L.A. Like Carlon said, they've been awesome all
year.  
  
Q. Austin and Nate, you guys played a UNLV team that you hadn't played in
forever. Now this is a team that you're familiar with in Baylor. How different
is it preparing for a team that you know as well as you do from playing them
in the Big 12?  
AUSTIN DUFAULT: It's definitely nice just having the familiarity with them.
They pretty much have the same team back from last year with a couple of
additions. So they play the same way, the same personnel. So both teams know a
lot about each other, and I think it should be a good match‑up.  
NATE TOMLINSON: Yeah, like Austin said, being familiar with the team helps a
lot this time of the year. It helped us out in L.A.  
Like you said, Baylor plays the same way they did last year, real athletic and
real big. We know what we have to do to beat them. We were close to beating
them last year at their place, and if we do the same things, we'll be all
right.  
  
Q. Nate, does it seem a little unusual playing Baylor the year after you all
left the conference that you played in together?  
NATE TOMLINSON: Yeah, this time of year you don't know who you're going to
play. But us being familiar with Baylor is good for us, I think. We saw that
we could potentially play them, it was a good feeling. Always had good battles
against them. I don't think it will be anything different tomorrow.  
  
Q. Austin, is this going to be the best team you've played? It seems like on
paper anyway looking at the schedule, this might be the best team. Where are
your advantages going to be? Where are CU's advantages going to be in this
match ‑up?   
AUSTIN DUFAULT: They're just a really big and athletic team. But one thing
about us is our interior guys can step out on the perimeter, and we're going
to be difficult to guard, I think, in pick‑and‑roll situations because we can
either roll or pop. We're pretty versatile.  
As far as our guards, their guards are pretty small, a couple of them, so
hopefully we can try to take advantage of that match‑up there.  
Definitely talent‑wise, probably the best team we've played this year. Got a
lot of great guys, NBA guys, but that's why you play the game.  
  
Q. Carlon, Pac ‑12 basketball has been a little bit disrespected across the
country. You got two bids. What kind of chance is this for you guys to not
only show for yourself, but for your conference?   
CARLON BROWN: I think tomorrow's a great opportunity for us to see what‑‑ I
mean for the nation to see what we're capable of doing. Obviously, like these
guys are saying, Baylor's a great team, but if we execute the game plan that
Coach has in store, we don't feel that we should be scared or that we're an
inferior opponent. We just feel we have to play our game and execute.  
We're not necessarily carrying a torch ourselves for the Pac‑12, but we know
that's what the media's building upon and what the Pac‑12 wants us to do. But
mainly we're playing for ourselves, each other, our fans and our coaching
staff.  
NATE TOMLINSON: Yeah, I was really surprised when I saw Cal's game the other
night. I think Cal's an excellent team. I think they had a bit of a tough
first half that put them behind the eight ball. I think the Pac‑12 is a better
league than what it's gotten credit for this year. There are a lot of tough
teams at the top of the league that battled all year. Like I said, I was very
surprised with what Cal did the other night.  
AUSTIN DUFAULT: Yeah, just agreeing with these two guys. I think the Pac‑12's
a good league. I don't think by any means we have to go out there and prove
our league or anything like that. We've just got to go out there and play, and
if we do that, we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Austin and Carlon, the length that Baylor has, how do you overcome that?
How do you run your offense effectively against as long as this team is? You
haven't faced one as long as they are this season.  
AUSTIN DUFAULT: We just have to play smart. They've got a lot of guys that
want to come in and block shots and stuff like that. We've just got to make
good decision when's we attack the basket and be able to knock down shots when
we have open shots. Defensively we've just got to play physical, box out and
clear out space with our box‑outs, and I think we'll be okay.  
CARLON BROWN: In addition to that, I just think we have to play with
confidence. We can't really think about their length. We've just got to come
out and play our game and be more aggressive. That's what we were doing in
L.A. and what we were doing last night, and it's worked to our advantage.  
If we stop and think they're taller than us, stronger than us or bigger than
us, it doesn't matter when you're in March and playing in these type of game
situations where it's win or go home. That's what everybody's thinking about.
It's either we win or go home. The length and the size is not going to matter
tomorrow. We're just going to play our game.  
  
Q. Carlon and then Nate, back to your point earlier about how you're playing
for Colorado, obviously. Do you guys have much affinity for the Pac ‑12
considering that you guys have been a part of it for a matter of what, months,
I guess it is? Do you feel any pride or whatever in playing for the Pac‑12, or
not?   
CARLON BROWN: There is a sense of pride. Obviously you represent your
conference no matter what it is, whether it's a power six or a mid‑major. But
like I said, we're mainly playing for ourselves and our community because
we've had a rough season. Everything hasn't gone as planned. We're just trying
to finish it to the best ability that we can.  
We surprised a lot of people, but at the same time, we feel like we're not
done yet and we're destined for greater things beyond, hopefully, tomorrow.  
NATE TOMLINSON: I think the Pac‑12 got a bad rap at the beginning of the year.
We took some hard losses. Cal lost to Mizzou pretty badly. But as the year had
gone on there was an opportunity to show what we could prove. But our boys are
playing for what's across our chest, Colorado, and if Pac‑12 gets credit for
that, fair enough.  
  
Q. Austin and Carlon, you guys talked about the craziness of the black and
gold out there. Just wondering what it's been like for you? Have your phones
been blowing up from texts from people? And are any of those texts from the
seniors who didn't get this opportunity last year?  
AUSTIN DUFAULT: Yeah, today, actually. Javon Coney who was on last year's team
texted me. Me and Nate have been talking to Marcus Releford who is over in
Sweden and pretty much everybody. They're just congratulating us on how we've
done this year. We just continue to tell them we wish you guys had this
opportunity last year, so we're trying to make the most of it for them this
year.  
CARLON BROWN: Yeah, there's definitely been a lot of texts and chatter on
Twitter and Facebook for the whole team. It's good. It feel goods to know
people are paying attention to Colorado basketball. The buzz up there in
Boulder is unbelievable right now. We're just trying to make sure we keep that
up.  
  
Q. Carlon, they're big. They're tall, but can you use maybe the mismatch to
your advantage because you're smaller and maybe quicker type of thing?  
CARLON BROWN: We're definitely going to try to exploit what we do well, and
that is run our transition game and get stops on defense and rebounds. Like I
said earlier to Mark, the game doesn't change. It's still five‑on‑five of the
same reps and the same inches to the court. So looking beyond all of that,
we've got to come out and play our game, execute, and we should be fine,
really.  
  
Q. You're putting together a little top ‑10‑dunk festival here lately. I was
just wondering, for those of us who don't dunk as much as you, what is going
through your mind when you see that opportunity, if anything? How does it
feel?   
CARLON BROWN: Nothing's going through my mind. I'm just trying to get two
points. Whether it be a dunk or a lay‑up, I'm just able to get some great
breakaways to the basket and great passes for my teammates to finish. I'm not
really focused on making the Top 10 list every night. I'm just trying to win
games for Colorado basketball.  
  
Q. When you see the replays of those, does that kind of make you go ‑‑  
CARLON BROWN: No, not really. All these dunks I've done before, so I know what
I'm capable of doing. I'm just thankful to God that I have this talent. Nate
says wait till he gets a breakaway (laughing).  
  
Q. Carlon and Austin, what does it mean to have a chance to take CU to the
Sweet 16 for the first time in 43 years?  
CARLON BROWN: It means everything. It's a lot of history riding on this game.
We can definitely leave an imprint and a legacy in Colorado basketball and set
a high standard for a lot of teams to come under Coach Boyle. So we're
definitely proud of where we're at.  
But like I said, we're not satisfied with what's left in front of us. Winning
tomorrow would mean everything not only to this team but to that community and
our fan base who has been very supportive and very proud of us.  
AUSTIN DUFAULT: Yeah, it would mean a lot to be able to go to the Sweet 16 and
represent our program, just show the growth that we've had over the last few
years as a program. The projection for where we want to go in the future,
leaving it to the younger guys once we leave is something that's really
special, and hopefully we can leave a good imprint like Carlon said.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Boyle.  
  
Q. The UNLV team that you guys hadn't played in forever and weren't familiar
with, does it help that you played Baylor before last year in the Big 12,
obviously, and in this short turnaround, does it make it better?  
COACH BOYLE: I think the short turnaround helps, but again, it helps them too
because they know us just like we know them from last year. So I don't think
it's an advantage either way in terms of our team or their team.  
But it certainly helps us in our preparation. Our veteran players that are
coming back that know a lot of the Baylor returnees. They've got a couple of
new guys, just like we do. But it helps your mindset as a coach, because you
at least have some familiarity. Because the short turnarounds with teams that
you don't know or a style that you've never seen before can create some angst
for you, but we don't have that right now. The only angst we have is their
front line of long, tall, athletic guys.  
  
Q. They have a couple of NBA guys, players that helped you get here, even
though they're not here. Have you or anybody on the team heard from them since
last night?  
COACH BOYLE: I know our players have. I haven't heard from them. I know when
we were in Los Angeles last week we communicated, like kids do nowadays, with
texts. But since we've been here since last night I haven't. But I quit
checking my phone for texts after last night.  
I know coming over here yesterday I asked Austin and Nate and Carlon if they
had talked to those guys, and they said they talked to all of them. So they've
been communicating, but not so much our staff right now.  
  
Q. You've faced length this season, UCLA and Stanford and had issues with
that. This team you're going to see tomorrow might be as long as any you've
seen since you've been a head coach. How do you combat that and deal with
their length?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, we've challenged our guys to be physical. We have to be
physical with them. If you get in a jumping contest, we're going to lose.
We've got to get bodies on them defensively in the post. When the shot goes
up, we have to create space with our box outs because you can't fight that any
other way.  
We have to be physical. We have to be the aggressor. We have to exert control
over a 15‑foot radius of the basket. That's easier said than done with these
guys. My whole thing is make them work for everything they get. If you make a
mistake against Baylor, it's a dunk at the basket; and we want to limit that
as best we can, make them shoot jump shots over our hand, which is always our
goal no matter who we're playing. But with tall, athletic guys it presents a
problem.  
Oregon State's a team that we've had some success against, not so much in
Corvallis, but we've been up and down in that regard. So it's going to be a
heck of a challenge.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job your assistants did in L.A. getting the guys
ready for four opponents in four nights in the wee hours? Also does the
Thursday ‑Saturday Pac‑12 schedule help you in these type of situations?   
COACH BOYLE: Absolutely. I've got to say this about our coaching staff, they
do not get enough credit. Our assistant coaches and our whole administrative
team does a great job with our guys who are on the road. But specifically Mike
Rohn who had to scout last night. Jean Prioleau who has the Baylor scout, and
Tom Abatemarco who has been around college basketball for years. Those three
guys do a tremendous job. They work extremely hard. They watch a lot of film.
If I watch two games on tape, they'll have watched six. They work probably
three times as hard as I do in terms of the preparation because as a head
coach, you only have so many hours in the day.  
They do a great job of prepping our team. Our players have a lot of confidence
in their game plans and their words, and I do too. So I can't say enough about
the job our staff did in L.A. You don't win four games in four days against
the quality opponents we did without having great preparation. So they get a
lot of credit for that. I'm glad you asked that, because they deserve that
recognition.  
The Pac‑12, yeah, Thursday‑Saturday helps us. Absolutely, it helps us
Thursday‑Saturday. It took us a while early in the season. We talked about it.
We weren't necessarily very good in November and December. We scheduled some
non‑conference games with one day in between to kind of get us ready for
league play, and we didn't handle that real well. But as the season has gone
on we have. I think it will help our players as we progress into the future in
certainly tournaments like this.  
  
Q. The last eight to nine minutes of your last two ballgames have been a
little tense, and you've always talked about closing out and so forth. What do
you do to get a better closeout in a game like tomorrow, if can you?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, what we have to do is we talk about the three‑pronged
approach with Colorado basketball. We play hard. We play smart. We play
together.  
The playing hard part and playing together part has not been a problem. It's
the playing smart part that sometimes we need a little bit of work on. With
that being said, I think we have a smart team, but there is a fine line. I
talked about it after the game last night. When you have a lead between
playing smart and taking good shots and having good offensive possessions and
playing tentative, and playing not to lose rather than playing to win.  
We have to do a better job of playing to win even when we have a lead, yet
playing smart. Not shooting after one pass, letting the offense work a little
bit.  
UNLV, I have to credit them last night, because I think their pressure
bothered us. They got up into us. We tried to practice that on Tuesday and
Wednesday, but we can't simulate their athleticism in practice. We just can't.
We didn't handle it as good as we could have or should have.  
But I think having great offensive possessions where you work and make the
defense work and then execute at the end of it, we were two or three of those
away from breaking that game open and breaking UNLV's back, and we didn't.  
They came down and scored and they got on a roll. It was game on from there.
We have to do a better job of playing smart down the stretch. That entails a
lot of different things.  
  
Q. Over the last 20 years the phrase home ‑court advantage and Colorado
basketball haven't always been closely related. How much do you think your
support helped this team in your previous game last night, and how much could
it help tomorrow?   
COACH BOYLE: I hope it helps tomorrow because that means we've got a lot of
Buff fans in the state. We had a good contingent last night, I thought. It
inspires our players. It starts with our students and the 50 that came to the
Pac‑12 tournament that Mike Bohn arranged for; and now we have 100 down here,
and I think more drove on their own.  
It inspires our players and gives them something to play for. We talk to our
guys all the time about playing for somebody other than yourself. Whether it's
our student section, whether it's our fan base, our season ticket holders or
alumni base, the people back in Colorado who are watching the game on TV with
their friends, we owe it to the fan base that's supported us to this point.
This is a great opportunity to expand that. That's what we want to do.  
You have to seize the opportunity when it's there, and it's there for us right
now. We want to continue this. We don't want this to be just a one‑hit wonder.
We want to continue to build the support at home that we've started, and
that's the challenge.  
  
Q. You've spoken eloquently about trying to represent the Pac ‑12 and things
like that. So now you're going against the conference you left. What did you
think about conference realignment? And do you think this match‑up sort of
adds a little juice to it given the circumstances?   
COACH BOYLE: It doesn't to me because, again, those decisions are made so far
above coach's heads that I never got into where we should be or wanted to be.
We're going to play where they tell us to play, and we're going to play
against who is on our schedule.  
That might be something for fans to think about and talk about. But in terms
of us and how we approach it, how we feel about it, I don't have any feelings
in that regard, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Late finish last night, and you're just talking about the preparation for
Baylor. Do you guys go back last night and begin your preparation or did that
begin this morning?  
COACH BOYLE: No, that began last week. Again, Coach Rohn on our staff had the
UNLV scout. Coach Prioleau had the Baylor scout; and Coach Abatemarco had the
SouthDakota State scout.  
So Sunday night, Selection Sunday is when the preparation began for those
guys. So they've watched the film. Again, that's where trust and confidence in
your assistants comes into play. Last night I said, "Okay, Coach Prioleau,
where we at? What do we have to do?" He briefs you.  
I've got a chance to watch film this morning and this afternoon before we came
over here. We watched it with our team. We got our scouting report in, our
game plan in, we'll practice here, and off we go tomorrow night.  
So it's a very short turnaround time, but that preparation started last week
on our staff, so it's not as quick as you think.  
Back to Ryan's point, I think our players who are used to the
Thursday‑Saturday turnaround, that's how we approach our league schedule. We
don't talk about Saturday's opponent all week, but the assistant is. On
Friday, hey, we're putting the game plan in.  
So our guys are very good at digesting the game plan on a very short
turnaround like we have right here, and we've got a smart group of guys, some
veteran guys who understand what it's all about.  
  
Q. How disappointing was it not to get in the tournament last year? And how
exciting has it been to get into this one?  
COACH BOYLE: Extremely disappointing last year. I said it on Sunday when the
pairings came out. I'm more angry now about last year's snub than I was last
year. Last year I was in shock to be honest with you. Again, there is nothing
you can do about it.  
But I think it's been a source of inspiration for our players that we've used.
We've talked about getting in touch with those six guys that were on the team
last year that didn't have this opportunity. So it's been a source of
inspiration for our guys and me as well.  
Again, we played our way in this year. So we're proud of that, and we've got
to change the national perception of Colorado basketball. Hopefully we're on
the way to doing that.  
  
Q. As far as individual match ‑ups tomorrow night, what are a couple you're
really looking at and why?   
COACH BOYLE: Well, I think André Roberson on Perry Jones is an interesting
one. Perry is obviously‑‑ André didn't go up against as much guys he's given
four inches to. They're just as athletic and long as he is. So that's a
match‑up that's going to be interesting. I think Nate Tomlinson and Spencer
Dinwiddie and Askia Booker are the different guys we'll have on Pierre
Jackson.  
I think Pierre Jackson for Baylor is a real key match‑up. The guy leads them
in scoring. He averages six and a half assists per game. He makes them go in a
lot of different areas. So I think trying to control him and contain him as
best we can, then limit Perry Jones. Those two are key.  
With that being said, watching Baylor, the guy that scares the daylights out
of me is Quincy Acy. I think he's as tough and strong and aggressive as any
post player we've played against all year. I've got a lot of respect for him
and how hard he plays every possession that he's on the floor.  
I'm leaving a lot of guys out that are pretty talented. I could go down the
list for you. But I think those three are the ones we've got to‑‑ we've got to
limit them to one shot, bottom line. We can't give them two or three chances
on offensive rebounds and expect to win this game.  
  
Q. One of the cool things about the NCAA Tournament for people around the
country is if you're a 10 or 11 or 12 seed, with every good game and every
good play people, whether it's VCU or George Mason or the Zags back in the
day, more and more people jump on the bandwagon. Can Colorado be the cuddly
underdog, or are you too well known as a university for that?  
COACH BOYLE: No, no. I think we can be an underdog. We haven't been here in
nine years. We haven't won in a game since '96 or '97 whatever it was when
Chansi was here. I think right now we are. We don't want to be in a position
where we're the underdog eventually. But right now, we are. We're an 11 seed.
They picked us 11th in the Pac‑12, right? Lot of interesting things about that
No. 11 for us this year.  
It's amazing as a coach when you're inside the tournament how focused and
dialed in you are. When you're outside looking in you're looking to the seeds
and who is beating who. I couldn't tell you who is playing today, who is
winning today, who is losing today. You're so wrapped up in the moment
yourself. That's more, I think, for you guys to look at and certainly the fans
around the country to look at. You're right. That's what makes this tournament
so special.  
  
Q. Could you make the argument that last year's run and last year's success
in the NIT has benefited this team though?  
COACH BOYLE: Absolutely. Especially our veterans. I think we had success in
the NIT last year. We won some games, albeit they were at home. But we gained
some confidence in tournament play. You go back to the Big 12 Tournament last
year where we got to the semifinals and battled KU pretty darn strong on the
road at The Sprint Center and lost by 6 or 8 points, whatever it was. Had a
good showing there. They had a good showing in the NIT, and it just followed
through this year in the Pac‑12 tournament.  
So this is a confident team, and a team that's taken a lot of lessons from
last year with it. They're benefiting us today.  
  
Q. You talked about you guys playing for more than just yourselves, but not
only carrying the Pac ‑12 banner, do you feel like you're carrying the banner
for all of college basketball in Colorado since it's been 43 years since
anyone from the State went to the Sweet 16?  
COACH BOYLE: Yes, absolutely, we're carrying that banner. It's a position we
want to put ourselves in. I don't think anybody two weeks ago gave us a shot
to be here where we are today, but we're here.  
Again, we've got a wonderful opportunity tomorrow night against a good,
talented basketball team and program to carry that banner and to make a whole
State proud, which is kind of neat. We are the University of Colorado. We're
the flagship university, and we want to represent the state well.  
I didn't realize it had been 43 years for the Sweet 16 run, but now I do.
We'll talk about that as well with our guys.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Baylor student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Quincy Acy, does it seem a little unusual playing Colorado again?  
QUINCY ACY: Yeah, I mean, we saw them in the bracket though and we knew it
could be a potential match‑up. But, yeah, it seems a little weird since
they're not home anymore, the Big 12, that is.  
  
Q. Quincy, what do you remember about that game last year? It seemed like it
followed the pattern a little bit of Colorado's game last night, except you
guys got over the top.  
QUINCY ACY: A lot of rebounds, I remember Roberson had like ten offensive
rebounds against us. That's been Achilles heel for us this year. So we're
going to look to try to limit his offensive rebounds and contain everybody on
their team. They've got a lot of different players from last year and they're
a different team.  
  
Q. Brady and Pierre, there was a time in the last year or so when Baylor
didn't really ‑‑ nobody really knew where you guys were going to end up. I
know that's kind of‑‑ as far as in a conference, I know that's kind of an AD
and a coach issue. But did you guys have any concerns about that?   
BRADY HESLIP: We see it when it's in the media and stuff, so it makes you a
little uneasy not knowing what's going to happen. But they figured it out in a
couple of weeks and we were just patient with it. I'm happy with the way it
turned out.  
PIERRE JACKSON: I honestly didn't know we were going into a different
conference or anything. I think we were fine in the Big 12 though.  
  
Q. Quincy, describe your coach and how he gets the most out of you as
players?  
QUINCY ACY: Coach Drew is very charismatic. He's always energized. He treats
you like grown-ups. He doesn't just treat you like a little kid, I guess. He
expects you to act like a pro. He gives us a lot of leeway, which is good, but
it also comes with trust. He expects you to know what you're doing on the
court. He expects consistency.  
Coach Drew is a great coach. I love his coaching staff, and it brings the most
out of us just because he gives us the confidence to do what we know we're
capable of because he knows what we're capable of.  
  
Q. First year of both you guys playing. Could you talk about how long it
took you to develop that on ‑court chemistry and what that was like for both
of you out there?   
PIERRE JACKSON: It didn't take long for me. Like I said on my visit, I felt
comfortable with them. So after the summer happened, we went to Canada, and
they're just great players and great teammates, and they made me get
comfortable really fast, so it was really easy for me.  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, I think it started in Canada. Pierre did a great job
distributing to everybody. I remember a lot of specific occasions where he was
just making a crazy pass to me and I'd be wide open for a three. So I'd say it
started in the summer, and it just went all year and kind of got stronger all
year.  
  
Q. Did you show the boys around your neighborhood there, Brady, when you
were up there?  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, we went on a scavenger hunt. We didn't do too much other
than that. We just kind of hung out and won a few games, had some fun as a
team and got closer and everything like that. It was a good trip.  
  
Q. In terms of this team being able to come back, I believe it's five times
now this team has come back from double digits. Can you talk a little bit
about that, Brady and Quincy Miller? Is that a situation you guys would rather
not be in though?  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, I think it's a situation nobody wants to be in, but
sometimes it just happens in the game of basketball. You can't really control
it. But it doesn't faze us really because we've been down so many times before
and we know how to find the resolve to get back in the game. It's not like
anybody panics or gets concerned. We know it's a 40‑minute game and it's a
game of runs. So if one team makes a run, we know we're coming back with
another one.  
QUINCY MILLER: Nobody ever wants to be down by double digit points; but we
always find the resolve to come back, just like Brady said.  
  
Q. Quincy Miller, your first NCAA Tournament game yesterday. How similar or
different was it in your mind than what you thought it might be?  
QUINCY MILLER: I thought it was exactly how I thought it would be. Just
playing against a great team like that. I knew it was going to be intense the
whole game. It was what I expected.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the team came out maybe a little jittery? Did you feel
like maybe you've got those nerves maybe over with now?  
QUINCY ACY: Yeah, we had a couple mental mistakes on defense early on, and
they made us pay for it by hitting some good shots. Coach called us over to
the bench and told us we had to get it together or we were going to go home
early.  
Guys did a great job of fighting back and paying attention to what Coach had
for us and we started getting stops and stuff. But they're a great team, and
they executed their game plan well.  
  
Q. Following up on that, Quincy, I know Pierre said he was nervous at the
start of the game. How were you at the start of the game, and did it take you
a while to kind of relax and just play?  
QUINCY MILLER: Yeah, I was nervous just because it was my first NCAA game. But
it didn't take me that long to get unnervous (laughing).  
  
Q. Quincy, can you just talk about the familiarity factor with playing
Colorado and then just a Big 12, Pac ‑12? Did you feel there was any kind of a
statement there to be made?   
QUINCY ACY: We don't want to talk about no statements or nothing like that.
But it's good to play a team that we have film of from last year and stuff
like that and a couple players are the same. But they're a different team.
They have a different mindset this year. They're on a good run coming from
that conference tournament.  
They have great players that are playing really well right now. We have to pay
attention to this year's film, and we can still gain a little bit from last
year from plays and stuff. But we're really going to have to execute our game
plan well.  
  
Q. When you guys have gotten behind by double digits as you have several
times, what is Coach Drew's demeanor in a situation like that? Is it
motivational, X's and O's or what?  
BRADY HESLIP: Usually he'll call a timeout, and one thing about Coach Drew is
he's the most positive coach I've ever seen. He's never yelling at anybody for
negative things. We get in the huddle and we're not talking about what just
happened. We're talking about how to do things better and just encouraging us
like, all right, let's get back to our game now, that's over with and stuff
like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Drew.  
  
Q. Did you think you'd be playing Colorado this soon after they left the Big
12 or is this a little unusual?  
COACH DREW: Unusual from the standpoint you don't really think about playing
people in postseason. You think about playing them in maybe exempt tournaments
or home at home series, but you don't think about playing who you might play
in postseason.  
  
Q. They have a bunch of new players and you have new players, but there are
some players back from both teams. Does it help that you all played them last
year? Maybe the coaching style or anything like that?  
COACH DREW: Normally, yes, but since Tad had just gotten there and only been
there for a year, I don't really know if we had a great feel for what they
did. They had a lot of veteran players that aren't there anymore. So we're
like everybody else that we're facing right now trying to familiarize
ourselves as much as possible with them.  
One thing people don't realize sometimes during the season coaches are so busy
with their next opponent and their own team, they don't get a chance to watch
much other basketball. So a lot of times you're not as familiar with different
teams as fans might be who watch more games on TV.  
  
Q. What did you see from them last night? Have you gotten a chance to look
at that game?  
COACH DREW: I think we've definitely seen enough film to know why they've been
winning is because defensively they've really been solid. Tad has always
prided himself on trying to instill a good defensive team, and he's done a
remarkable job up there, especially with the turnover from last year's team to
having a young group to get them to play as hard defensively as they've been
doing, then rebounding.  
Roberson's an animal on the glass. He had ten offensive rebounds at our place
last year, so we know how good he is and what he can do. He's improved his
overall skill package on the offensive end too.  
Besides that, I know transition. They've pushed it. We need to make sure that
we do a good job limiting easy buckets for them.  
  
Q. I'm curious when Colorado and Nebraska left and then a lot of other teams
were thinking about it, what were your emotions when Baylor was sort of in
this area where they didn't know where you were going to end up?  
COACH DREW: I think like every other coach in the Big 12 you just hated it
because it was such a good conference and league at the time. When it's
experiencing as much success, why change? But at the same time, I was blessed
and fortunate enough to know the leadership and our university were going to
put us in a great situation. So I just had to worry about recruiting and our
team.  
But I know Colorado's been successful this year in the Pac, and I'm sure
they're enjoying being there.  
  
Q. Your team has displayed the ability to come back from double digit
deficits, but I guess how important is it to avoid that situation or at least
limit the runs against?  
COACH DREW: Well, you can trust me, I'd prefer to be up rather than down. But
I think that's the experience we've gained throughout the year. With a younger
team you worry when you get down you might panic and start taking shots and
making plays that you don't normally make. I think yesterday was a great
illustration of that from the standpoint we got down. Weren't playing well
early on, but we maintained our poise and were able to come back and put
together a nice 15 minutes in the first half.  
  
Q. Four of your five starters yesterday in their first NCAA Tournament
action. Did you sense going into the game jitters at all? And what did you do
to try to calm that?  
COACH DREW: I didn't do a very good job calming it, but the good thing is
after you get up and down a little bit, those jitters leave you. That's just
every kid dreams of playing in the NCAA Tournament, so if you're not excited,
you're not nervous, you're not ready to go, you wouldn't be playing at the
level you're playing at because this is why you do what you do.  
  
Q. Five of the eight that played last night, that was their first time. I
know it's just one game, but how much do you think that helps getting a game
under their belt going into this second game?  
COACH DREW: I think it definitely‑‑ you get rid of some of the anxiety, some
of the nerves. You're always more tired for the second game because it's hard
sleeping after wins. Your adrenaline's going. You're excited. So I think both
teams will be more relaxed. Although Colorado was pretty good, so I don't know
if they need to be any more relaxed. I know definitely our last 15 minutes of
the first half is how we'd like to play for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. How strong was the play of your starting guards and do you expect that
kind of performance moving forward?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think that's the great thing about our team. Before the
game if you would have said Quincy Acy's going to score four points and Perry
Jones is going to score two points and you're still going to win, I think
that, again, speaks to the depth of our team and the talent from other people.  
We've won games where our guards haven't scored. We've won games where our
bigs haven't scored. So I think having a balanced attack is important because
some games people play well. Some games they don't. Sometimes defenses take
away certain things and give other things.  
For us, we like it when everybody scores. You can get a bunch of people in
double figures. But at the same time, our depth is definitely a strength of
our team.  
  
Q. A number of people have discredited Pac ‑12 basketball this year, I think
including the tournament committee gave them two bids. How do you think
Colorado would stack up in the Big 12?   
COACH DREW: I think just like they did when they were still in the Big 12. I
thought they were very competitive. Just like any of us, really hard to win on
their home court. In the Big 12 is tough to win on the road anywhere.  
That's where with the selection and stuff, I know so many of those things are
done on RPI and strength of schedule. One thing that sometimes we forget to
talk about is people play some non‑conference games with schools in your area
and region, and if they happen to be down that hurts your strength of
schedule. But if they happen to be up, that helps. I know if you're in the
tournament and you're playing in March Madness, you're a good team and you're
well‑coached.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Colorado  68  
UNLV  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Rice, an opening statement, please.  
COACH RICE: First thing I want to do is give credit to Colorado. They were
tough, as their team has been all year long. They earned a hard‑fought
victory.  
I told the team after the game that losing is very, very hard. It never gets
any easier. But I said the thing that makes me the saddest is any time it's
the end of the season, it's the last time that we as coaches get an
opportunity to coach our group.  
At the start of the year we dedicated the year to our seniors, first year
staff, and those guys have given us absolutely everything that they have.  
I told them that all the success we're going to have in the future, I'll
always refer back, or I'll always refer to the seniors and the job they did
for us this year and for the returning guys, it's important for us to bottle
up exactly how we feel right now, so we can get to work. Because while this
was a very rewarding season, we're proud of a lot of the things that we
accomplished. We didn't ever feel like we were satisfied with how it went.  
Certainly these two guys to my left are going to be a big part of our
off‑season. We're going to learn from it. Everything we'll do from now until
the start of next season is getting us ready to get back to the NCAA
Tournament again.  
I'm very proud of our group this year. Accomplished a lot. Just did not get
off to a very good start tonight. Missed some easy shots and lost a little bit
of a sense of urgency, and we made a furious comeback. We're down 20 with 15
minutes to go and made up 18 points in about an 11‑minute period. When we play
like that, we're very good. It's just hard to dig ourselves into that kind of
a hole.  
Again, I'm very proud of our team. Very proud of the season we had, and just
know that we've got a lot of work to do between now and next season. Again,
congratulations to Colorado and best of luck to them in the next round.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the UNLV student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you talk about what you felt got you into that 20 ‑point
hole tonight, and just talk about your emotions of losing a game like this for
the third year in a row in the opening round of the tournament?   
ANTHONY MARSHALL: We got some good looks early on. Our shooters felt
comfortable. Everybody felt comfortable. We just didn't make shots and they
did. That kind of put us in a hole. They outrebounded us the first half. Any
time you're playing a good team like that, it's kind of hard to come back. But
we made a fight and a surge to come back, but the balls just didn't fall our
way toward the end.  
It's disappointing. I think I'm more hurtful for our seniors, not getting them
out of the first round. They laid the foundation for us and stuff so we've got
a lot to build off of and just get ready for next year.  
  
Q. Justin, when you guys were making that run, they broke off that big dunk
and that seemed to kind of quiet your momentum a little bit. Just how big of a
momentum killer was that for you guys?  
JUSTIN HAWKINS: I would say it was pretty big, but we knew they were going to
get a score sooner or later. But we still had a lot of time left after that
dunk. We were only down 5 with 1:15 left, and we knew we were going to knock
down shots and just keep playing defense until the end.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you expand on the disappointment? You guys talked so much
about how you wanted to use last year's slow start to play better this time
around? How frustrating is it that history repeated it safely little bit?  
ANTHONY MARSHALL: Very frustrating. Like I said, I felt we know coming into
the game what's at stake. Any time you get down early at this level it's kind
of hard to fight back because you're playing the best teams all the way
around. It's no cupcake where can you get down and just come back easily.  
I'm proud of our guys. We made a fight. Never rolled over and just kept
battling. It's very disappointing and hurtful for our seniors. They put in so
much time and effort into the program over the years. They've been tremendous.
So to go out like this is very disappointing and hurtful.  
  
Q. Justin, looking back on everything, do you consider this a successful
season?  
JUSTIN HAWKINS: I believe it's a very successful season. New coaching staff,
players really didn't know how to react at first, but I think we all bought
into the system well. We got a lot of good wins. We had a lot of losses, but I
wouldn't really count those losses. We really learned from all of those. I
just felt that looking back after now we really stepped up big.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. For the first 25 minutes or so did you feel like Colorado was a much
tougher team and they were kind of taking it to you?  
COACH RICE: I did think that they played with a greater sense of urgency than
we did. I thought that we certainly got off to a rough start. I think the
shame in it would have been for our seniors if we hadn't made the comeback
that we made and if those guys would have had to live with the fact that we
just didn't play well and didn't make that kind of a comeback.  
I'm very proud of the guys. Extremely disappointed for our team. I thought we
certainly had a great opportunity to challenge a very good Colorado team, but
disappointed with the way the game started, but incredibly proud of the
comeback. I think that will give us some momentum going into the off‑season.  
  
Q. What do you attribute the shooting woes to for the first three quarters
of that game?  
COACH RICE: I think any time you don't shoot the ball well, you have to give
credit to Colorado. Tad's defense is extremely good. We just missed open
looks. We have not shot the ball overly well for about the last three or four
weeks.  
I do think that we've got a team that's been a little bit tired. We had some
time to get our legs back and we got good looks. Just were not able to make
them tonight. We take those same looks again, it's how we won 26 games and
have been ranked 13 straight weeks, and it just did not go in tonight.  
The frustrating thing was the number of offensive rebounds that we gave up to
start the game. That put us in too deep of a hole.  
  
Q. With this being your first year as a head coach, what are some of the
things that you've learned throughout the season that you'll take to next
year?  
COACH RICE: Well, I think first of all, I learned that we've got a team that's
got a chance to be special. We've got a group of 11 guys, all of whom stayed,
and I think it speaks volumes about UNLV and our coaching staff and the
direction that we're going. The fact that we were going to win 26 games this
year and be ranked 13 straight weeks and be undefeated in the regular season
at home, certainly gives us something to build on.  
I have a group that's very disappointed in the locker room and is ready to get
back to work. I've got a number of recruits that are excited to get to campus
and get going with the next season. I just think it's a situation where there
are special things that are happening, and this is the start.  
We're disappointed with how it ended for our seniors. We wanted to continue
on. We felt like we had a team that could have played a little bit longer. You
just wonder sometimes as a coaching staff, as we all watch NCAA Tournaments,
why do good teams not shoot the ball well?  
We've all watched games in the first four, we all watched games today. We saw
teams that played over their heads. We saw teams that are good that didn't
play nearly as well as they're capable. That's the beauty and a frustration of
a one‑and‑done type tournament.  
That's why everybody gets so excited about it. I know we're here. We'll learn
from it. We're bitterly disappointed, but we've got a group that works hard
and try to make sure that it never happens like this again.  
  
Q. You appear pretty upset early in the second half. Called two timeouts
after a couple of defensive lapses. What were you seeing out there that you
were angry about? And what did you think kind of helped you turn things around
and make the comeback? Was it the full court defensive pressure?  
COACH RICE: I think from a coaching standpoint you're just always trying to
look for a way to motivate your guys to play. We've got a group that did not
play well to start the game, yet we know how much they wanted to play well, so
just was trying to give them the motivation they needed.  
Certainly they got a few steals, probably the magnitude of what was going on
probably had an effect on the fact that we turned Colorado over 23 times, but
was just proud of our guys and how they responded. Can only talk about it took
them too long to respond, but the bottom line is like we have all year long,
we responded.  
We came up four points short, but it put us in a situation where we can build
on this and move forward. We'll learn from it and be better for it next time
around.  
  
Q. Can you expand a little bit on ‑‑ this wasn't technically a road game,
but it was away from The Mack, and just expand on the frustration and why this
team doesn't play up to its capabilities away from home?   
COACH RICE: I think one thing all year long is that we've struggled a little
bit establishing a go‑to guy. We've got a lot of willing guys who have worked
extremely hard. So I think going into the off‑season, one of our goals and
those of you who are around our program know that we have a number of team
goals. One of our main goals next year will be to play better away from The
Thomas & Mack Center. We're extremely proud of winning. We went undefeated in
the regular season on our home floor.  
But we need to play better away from The Thomas & Mack Center. We'll do that.
I don't think we have all the answers right now. I just know that we've got a
team that's very disappointed and determined.  
I've always said that when you are in the NCAA Tournament, you get knocked
out, it's always difficult, no matter whether you lose in the first round or
until the tournament is over because you just feel that somehow, some way you
should still be playing. It will be tough for us until that Monday of the
Final Four.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Vanderbilt  79  
Harvard  70

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH STALLINGS: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Harvard and Tommy.
What a great job he's done with that program and what a great job they've done
with that team. We knew they were good going in, and we knew we had to play a
good game in order to win, and that's exactly what happened.  
As far as the game itself, we were able to make a good spurt there at the end
of the first half, and then we came out to start the second half and didn't
defend very well. They were having some success offensively. Then we got our
defense locked in and got the lead up to about 18. Then the kid got hot from
three, and they got some momentum and we got a little tentative. It all of a
sudden became a ballgame again.  
I thought we got a little tentative there in that stretch at the end. Almost
like we were playing not to lose instead of playing to win. We want to play to
win for 40 minutes. We don't ever want to play not to lose.  
Again, my most sincere congratulations to Harvard on their season, and I'm
awfully proud of my team. I'm proud of the fact that we've had a good amount
of negativity about our first round losses the last two years, so our guys
have had to listen to a lot of that.  
I'm really proud of them for not only what they did last weekend, which was
quite an accomplishment, but also what they were able to do today. I'm glad
they got to experience this because this was the only success that they had
not experienced since being in our program. I'm really grateful for them that
they got to experience it today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Vanderbilt student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jeffery and Festus, in the world of college basketball, you guys are old.
Do you ever think about that? Are you aware of that, especially when your
rivals at Kentucky are led by a bunch of 18 ‑year‑old kids. Here you guys are,
and you're 21 years old?   
JEFFERY TAYLOR: I think that means something. Experience is invaluable in
situations like that. We've been here twice before, so we knew what to expect
coming into this game. So, yeah, definitely experience means a lot.  
FESTUS EZELI: Yeah, same thing as what he said. I think our experience has
helped us through a lot. I think we think about it in terms of experience and
not in terms of us being old. Experience has been very, very useful to us the
whole year, and it's going to keep being useful to us.  
  
Q. For the seniors, can you put into perspective what this win means knowing
what's happened in the past that you guys have finally made it? It's your last
year, and you've finally made it through this round?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: It's very meaningful for us. We've had a lot of obstacles and
hurdles we've had to clear throughout our time here at Vanderbilt. This one
definitely means something to us. We're looking forward to a great game
against Wisconsin on Saturday.  
BRAD TINSLEY: It really means a lot for the seniors to be our last time in the
NCAA Tournament. Just to kind of get that monkey off our back and win a close
game in the first round. It just means a lot to us old guys, the coaching
staff and the program.  
  
Q. It's not just me that created the perception, but Oliver from Harvard
sort of said that it was in his head if they could push you late to see what
would happen. Now the perception, obviously, will be gone. When they started
making their run, what led you to be able to snuff it out as well as did you
down the stretch there?  
JOHN JENKINS: The biggest cue for us is being poised. I think leadership is
definitely a factor in that guys huddled up and decided we need to lock down
and get rebounds down the stretch, and we did that when we had to. We hit big
free throws.  
  
Q. Jeffery and John, when 00 got hot, what were you thinking? What were you
trying to do to stop him?  
JOHN JENKINS: I hadn't seen somebody get that hot in a long time. He was
making them from everywhere, no matter how deep they were and the shot clock
going down, it was money. So it was very impressive.  
  
Q. Festus, talk about the importance of defensively kind of dominating
inside today? And take me through that one possession where you got three
offensive rebounds in the second half? And John, you made that shot, how
important that series was right there?  
FESTUS EZELI: I see my job on this team as being a defensive force. That's
pretty much what I do, a lot of times try to clean up the mess of some of my
teammates. We do a good job of supporting each other and trying to clean up
the mess by the rim of blocked shots and rebounds. I think I did an okay job
of that tonight.  
The three offensive rebounds, I think that was the point where they were
making a little bit of a run as well, so that's one of my jobs as well. I just
wanted to go and get them and help my teammates out.  
  
Q. Talk about the emotional lift that gave for you guys when you had your
three offensive rebounds. You come back, miss those threes and get the three
‑point play. What did that do for you guys to get over that first of what
seemed to be many humps during that late run?   
BRAD TINSLEY: I think that play really meant a lot. Any time you can have a
high‑energy play like that and finish it, it really just boosts your energy
and boosts your confidence. Festus did an unbelievable job of battling through
physicality and getting those three rebounds and kicking out to John. John
made an unbelievable shot. It was a pretty amazing play.  
  
Q. John, how deep do you think this team can go? Do you think this team is
built to win right now? Would you be disappointed with anything less than a
Final Four berth?  
JOHN JENKINS: We're just taking it one game at a time. Not focused on the
future right now. This is a big win for us. We're going to have fun with this
and get ready for Wisconsin.  
  
Q. Brad and Jeff, if you could weigh in. When they start making their push
late, you got up by as much as 18. Did you feel that was going to be enough
regardless what Harvard did? Did you, as Kevin mentioned, feel timid?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: I think when we got that big lead we kind of relaxed a little
bit. When they started making the run, we kind of got a little timid. We
started standing on offense and defense. Then we kind of righted the ship.
Other years maybe this outcome wouldn't have happened, but we have the
experience now. We have guys on the team that have a strong will to win, and
we weren't going to let that happen again. So we righted the ship and now
we're sitting here.  
BRAD TINSLEY: I think our maturity showed up a little bit there. Coach is
right, we definitely were playing not to lose and playing to win. Can you
never do that, especially in the NCAA Tournament. But I think our poise and
maturity showed up at the end, and we were just able to get stops and hit our
free throws.  
  
Q. Jeff, you got to play in front of your uncle for the first time. A guy
that's been there and a mentor for you those two years at Hobbs. Talk about
playing in front of him for the first time?  
JEFFERY TAYLOR: It was a strange feeling to be back at The Pit. I think it
kind of affected me a little bit at the beginning of the game. Then I kind of
relaxed and just started playing. It was a great feeling to get to play in
front of my family, especially my uncle. He's done a lot for me in my life. It
was just a special feeling, a special day for me.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stallings.  
  
Q. I asked you yesterday about focus coming off the Kentucky game. When did
you know it was there after the ball went up? Because you were really
confident yesterday.  
COACH STALLINGS: I just knew that these guys were going to come to play.
Actually, the way this whole game unfolded was probably the best‑case scenario
for us. I'm not sure that you ever really get a chance to exorcise, not
exercise, but you don't get a chance to rid those demons unless you get into a
close game and have to perform and make the plays.  
If the game is at 18 and it goes on to be 25, which we never expected, but if
it goes on to be 25, we win. But I'm not sure we get as much accomplished.  
We had to make plays. We had to make free throws. We had to get stops. We had
to take care of the ball. We will to do a lot of things in this game that for
us that's a good thing. For us to have to do those things at the end is good.
There should be a measure of confidence that comes from that.  
But I didn't want to be in that tight of a situation with the way we had the
game going in our favor. But since we won, I'm glad it unfolded that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what this win means for you personally, knowing what
these seniors have been through in the past few years?  
COACH STALLINGS: I think the gratification, other than advancing in this game,
is now they got to experience the one thing they hadn't experienced since
they've been at Vanderbilt, and that is success at the NCAA Tournament. Don't
take that to mean that we're satisfied because we're obviously not.  
But I'm very, very pleased for them because of the things that have happened
in the past and the negativity that's gone with those losses.  
I'm proud of them. I'm very, very happy for them because, more than anything
else, they deserve to have success in this tournament before they graduated
because they've meant so much to our program.  
  
Q. The whole brainy school thing is a nice little angle. But something that
is relevant is the graduation rate aspect that they're talking about to be a
minimum that schools are going to have to have for the tournaments in 2014 or
2013. How does that help Vanderbilt?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, it probably doesn't help Vanderbilt other than maybe it
would preclude some teams from getting in. But our mission is not to be glad
that somebody didn't get in because they didn't perform academically. Schools
like ours and Harvard, we're going to perform, and that's never going to be an
issue.  
I couldn't tell you what our APR is because I never have to worry about it.
I've never once ever thought about our APR. That's different than a lot of
guys that do what I do. I said this in here yesterday, so I apologize to those
who have already heard this. The last guy that didn't graduate from Vanderbilt
to play basketball was a senior, and finished his eligibility in the late
1970s.  
So we never worry about the academic stuff because our place is set up for
guys to go to school, guys are going to graduate, and they're going to do what
they're supposed to do and we're proud of that.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could talk about that sequence where you got all those
offensive rebounds and John stuck that one?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, Fest just turned into the biggest, baddest dude on the
floor at that point, which he was a number of times today. But he really
controlled the inside of the lane for us defensively.  
But that particular sequence, John takes the three, Fest gets the rebound.
Throw it's back out to John, John's got a better look at three, misses it,
Fest gets the rebound again. John takes another three, misses it, and Fest
gets the rebound, and Johnny gets an and‑one. So the worst shot of the bunch
that he took was the one he made.  
Thank goodness for Festus. He's a beautiful kid and has been a great kid in
our program for five years. I'm really happy to see him play the way he played
today.  
  
Q. You touched on it before, but can you talk a little bit more about maybe
the last six minutes of the game when they held you without a field goal? Was
there ever a time you thought here we go again or they were going to overtake
you?  
COACH STALLINGS: I never thought they were going to overtake us, but I
certainly thought it was getting a lot closer than I was hoping for. But not
having a field goal is more of a function of we had a whole bunch of free
throws, so we got fouled a lot.  
I'll take minimal field goals if we shoot twice as many free throws as our
opponent, which we did. And you can look at our statistics and see that that's
a prominent thing in how we play. We get to the foul line a lot.  
So I'm not concerned about the no field goals in the last six minutes. I was
more concerned with the tentativeness and the clock watching and, just like I
said before, that we weren't playing to win. We were playing not to lose. That
may be a function of what's happened the last two years with these kids in the
first round.  
But in any event, like I said, we're all the better for it now because we had
to make plays. We had a big steal on the sideline. Dai‑Jon Parker came up with
a big loose ball. That might have been the most important play of the game.
Then we get free throws, and we did a good job at the foul line.  
So they don't ask you how you did it at this point. It's just whether you did
it or not. I tell our guys all the time, it's not an art contest, it's a math
contest.  
We could care less how it looks. We just want to know what the score is at the
end, and obviously, we want to have more than they did.  
  
Q. Going on the question that I was asking the guys earlier in terms of
being seniors, and you have four start four seniors and a junior. Kind of
unusual these days in the college basketball landscape. They talked about
experience. Some people tend to go for youth, talent, whatever you want to
call it, over ‑experience. What is your take on comparing the two?   
COACH STALLINGS: Depends on how good the youth and talent is. If it's better
than the age and experience, I'd rather have the youth and the talent. But in
our particular case, we've got some young, talented guys, but our older guys
are better. So they've grown up in our program. They have built our program to
a level that Vanderbilt's not accustomed to.  
So I thought our experience showed throughout the game. Not just in the last
few minutes, but throughout the game. I thought us getting the separation at
the end of the first half, getting more separation in the second half. I
thought that was our experience and our relentlessness towards how we try to
play.  
But this group of guys have been absolutely amazing on the floor, off the
floor, in the classroom, in the community. They've been absolutely amazing
representatives of our institution. No coach could ever be prouder of his guys
than I am of these guys.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about that turnover there where the kid was trying to
build the ball off one of your players, it really led to eight straight free
throws there. Talk about that. It seemed like it was a gift with a minute
left.  
COACH STALLINGS: Yeah, it was a six‑point game, and they've got a chance to
make it quite interesting if they can get the ball to Rivard for another
three. So we got them kind of pinned on the sideline and played good defense.
He tried to throw the ball off our guy and he missed.  
It seemed to me like the ball bounced two times before anybody made a move to
get it. Fortunately Dai‑Jon Parker is one of the fastest kids on our team. He
ran it down and made a good decision to bring the ball back out and get it to
John and they had to foul.  
That was certainly a critical play because if something happens where they get
a bucket, now you have a different feel to what's going on.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense on Rivard in the last three minutes? Because after
he hit one three, they really clamped down and kept him quiet after that.  
COACH STALLINGS: I don't want to act like we did this great job. The kid got
20 points on 7 shots, and that's a pretty good return on your investment. He
torched us in the second half like nobody's business. I'm not going to take
any credit. At some point, if he had kept going, it would have been 10 for 11,
instead of 6 out of 7. At some point, hopefully we did something. What we did
was almost not enough, because that kid was spectacular today.  
  
Q. Lance had foul trouble today. I think he told me it was the first game
he's ever fouled out in his life. I guess, how did you guys manage to still
dictate inside without him? Did you have to change maybe your style of play
based on how the game was being called?  
COACH STALLINGS: No, we ended up getting a lot of good minutes from Rod Odum
is what happened. Rod gave us really good minutes, hit some shots, got some
rebounds. So, honestly, going into the game, if you had asked me to pick one
guy on my team that I thought was going to play really well it would have been
Lance. Lance had a great week of practice. He was completely locked in,
completely ready, I thought.  
So I'm disappointed for Lance, but at the same time, we were able to win a
game in this tournament with him not playing nearly his best. I know he'll
come back out on Saturday and play a lot better.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Baylor  68  
South Dakota State  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH DREW: Before the game, I know our guys were prepared for a very good
game. SouthDakota State coming in, we had a lot of respect. We knew they were
a great team and we're pleased to get the win. I think in the beginning of the
game we showed our jitters a little bit, then after that, I was very pleased
with how we calmed down and got back to playing basketball.  
We only had four turnovers in the second half. We rebounded very well.
Defensively, especially the last ten minutes of the first half, I thought we
guarded well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Baylor student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brady, first couple of minutes you're in a zone and you quickly switched
out. How does that help the three guards it seemed like that's been effective
in the man?  
BRADY HESLIP: Definitely. When we go man, we're a feisty team on defense. We
all work hard and try to rotate and play for each other. But that team's a
really good team overall, and they can really shoot the ball. So once we
realized that, we had to switch to man.  
  
Q. Pierre, Coach Drew talked about little nerves there at the beginning. Did
you feel that? I guess maybe talk about how you guys kind of answered that
early punch from them?  
PIERRE JACKSON: Yeah, I was extremely nervous, but once we got down there and
warmed up, I was fine.  
They came out there swinging, knocking down open shots, knocking down
contested threes. Coach called a timeout, and we had to regather ourselves,
and we switched to man. A.J. came in and brought the defensive punch that we
needed, and we got stops and got the lead.  
  
Q. Brady, when they got up early, coming into this game, this was kind of a
sexy pick as an upset. When you guys got down early, was any of that running
through your mind?  
BRADY HESLIP: No, not at all. We've started games sloppy before this year, and
we found the resolve to come back. Today was no different. We knew that was a
great team, and we didn't think they were going to come out there and just
give the game to us. We were ready for a 40‑minute fight.  
They really came out swinging and knocking down shots and making some great
plays and playing unselfish. So none of that crossed our minds. We knew we
were going to regather ourselves and rebound from it.  
  
Q. Quincy, you guys pretty much controlled the boards. Is that something
like you all felt you had to do against a smaller team?  
QUINCY MILLER: Yes, definitely. We knew we had to rebound. Coming in, that's
what Coach Drew is always talking about, rebounding the ball.  
  
Q. Pierre, what's it a struggle particularly early to get the ball inside?
Were they just kind of denying, denying?  
PIERRE JACKSON: Yeah, every team does a scouting report no matter how much
time they've got. They knew how we forced the ball in. So our bigs, they
collapsed really and had great help‑side on the bigs so they couldn't really
work and do their best. They did a good defensive job at the start with that.  
  
Q. Quincy, when they started coming back, what kind of held you guys
together and allowed you to hold them off there at the end?  
QUINCY MILLER: We've been in a lot of games where teams came back. We just
kept our composure and that's a sign of us maturing.  
  
Q. Pierre, for some of us that haven't seen them before, wanted to get the
inside scoop on the glow ‑in‑the‑dark uniforms. I know it's not the first time
you've worn them, but what is the story with those?   
PIERRE JACKSON: I don't know. I don't know where it came from. I happened to
see it in this book in my coach's office, and I got a sneak peak and I liked
it. We've got a pretty good record with them, so I really could care less.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Drew.  
  
Q. Anthony Jones really gave you a big lift in the first half. He hadn't
been playing a whole lot, but he really came through.  
COACH DREW: I think that's one of our biggest strengths to our team all year
long, we said our leadership and our depth. You look at it, if people said
coming into the game Quincy Acy's going to have four points. Perry Jones is
going to have two points. Are you going to win? Most people would say no. But
the great thing is that's where we have other people that can step up.  
Anthony Jones, I think every coach would dream of coaching a player like him.
When he started, he was a great teammate. When he hasn't played, he's been a
great teammate, and he's always put the team first. Those guys are hard to
find nowadays. I'm very proud of him and happy for his success tonight. And we
have confidence in him, no question about it.  
  
Q. They don't have the size to match up with you inside. What specifically
did they do to try to take away that interior?  
COACH DREW: If you look at their help‑side, they did a tremendous job fronting
the post and having a lot of people in the back so you couldn't lob over. When
we have outside shots that are open, we like to take them. We wanted to get
inside, play inside out. I thought for the first half we were getting to the
paint quite a bit. But for some reason we didn't finish as much as we normally
do inside. I thought we missed some of those.  
Again, how can you tell your team's nervous? Perry has a wide open lay‑up to
start the game. He hadn't missed a wide open lay‑up since, I don't know,
non‑conference? I think that kind of showed in the beginning of the game just
where we were at. I think we had four or five quick turnovers. Then in the
second half, we only had four turnovers.  
Again, SouthDakota State did a tremendous job not being nervous, and coming
out and making shots, getting us down. But that's why we've played a tough
schedule in the non‑conference. That's why we have the Big 12 season to get us
ready.  
If we were up 8‑0, we knew it was going to be a big game. If we were down 8‑0,
we knew it was going to be a great game. That's what we get in March Madness.  
  
Q. Same thing that I was asking Brady. You guys were kind of the sexy upset
pick here this week?  
COACH DREW: It wasn't for me (laughing). But go ahead.  
  
Q. From the pundits, so to speak. How do you keep your team away from that
and keep them focused on the task?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think you'd see why people would say this. SouthDakota
State's an outstanding team. They're the last team to beat Washington. They
beat them by 19 points at their place, and had 32 straight non‑conference wins
at home, dating back to '08 when Valpo beat them. I'll give Valpo a plug.  
But I was going to say, we knew it was going to be a hard‑fought game. If you
look at it, with our having four of the five starters never playing in the
NCAA Tournament, experience tends to tell you what you're going to get from
people. Inexperience, you don't know. Again, very pleased that we came back,
kept our composure. Any time you win in the NCAA Tournament, Coach is happy.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about your time at Valpo, that is the last program that
made any kind of tournament run and most of them lost in the first round. But
even losing in the first round, giving a team like Baylor a run, what does
that do for a mid ‑major like Valpo or SouthDakota State?   
COACH DREW: I think it will really help their recruiting because nationally a
lot of student‑athletes will know about them and like their style of play.
Coach does a great job. They're fun to watch. Recruits want to play in that
kind of style.  
They have good kids, it seems like. So I'm sure other people want to be a part
of that program. Glad we don't have to play them next year.  
  
Q. How big was Pierre's defense as a catalyst for you guys? You got 23
points off turnovers.  
COACH DREW: I think A.J. really did a very good job first and foremost on
Wolters. He's a great player, as we all know. Pierre, I thought was active in
help side and helped out. But A.J. was tonight one of his better defensive
performances.  
Then I thought Deuce learned a couple things tonight because he wasn't too
effective early on. I think hopefully that will help him prepare for the later
opponents we play.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Wisconsin  73  
Montana  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Tinkle, an opening statement about this afternoon's game.  
COACH TINKLE: Just got to give a ton of credit to Wisconsin. They were ready
to go, played well, shot lights out. They were more physical than us. We pride
ourselves on creating doubt in the minds of our opponents, and I thought they
really did a good job of that tonight.  
Our guys battled back. We made a nice little run there in the second half and
they always had an answer, a lot of dagger plays there in the second half, so
proud of my group. It's been a heck of a year. We said in the locker room,
it's been a while since we tasted defeat. It was a heck of a run that these
guys put together, and I'm awfully proud of that. Getting to this position is
great.  
We asked our returning players to use this as a little fuel moving forward as
motivation to try to get back here and maybe one day move on a little bit. But
super proud of these guys. Really proud of my seniors that have meant so much
to us. We were beaten by a better team today. We congratulate Wisconsin, but
I'm still very, very proud of these guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Montana student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Will, can you discuss what they did defensively against you guys, in
particular against you, and why they were able to get so many open looks and
knock them down?  
WILL CHERRY: Defensively their bigs did a good job of blocking shots at the
top. They got it at the top. They were waiting for me to go up, and they got
it at the top. Kudos to them. I think he ended with like seven or eight
blocks. He did a good job getting at the top and not fouling it. Getting his
hands up without fouling. That was big for them.  
They were switching everything with Derek. They know they did a good job of
scouting us and pick‑and‑popping with Derek. He's one of our best three‑point
shooters on the team, so they did a good job of scouting that.  
Offensively they did a good job of swinging a ball and finding the mismatches
early and exploiting us. They did a good job of driving and getting to the
line in the first half. In the second half, they just were just relentless on
the offensive end.  
I think they started the second half with four offensive rebounds that ended
up with a basket by Jordan Taylor. The offensive rebounds are killer. When
we're trying to make a push, you can't give up offensive rebounds because
those are daggers. They were throwing it right back at the shooters for
threes, and that's about it.  
  
Q. Derek, that second half I felt like you guys have been down by double
digits before at the half, and you guys really needed to get out to a good
start. But three turnovers, I guess, just talk about that second half getting
off to that start?  
DEREK SELVIG: Yeah, we just couldn't get on a roll. Usually we like to create
momentum in transition, and just didn't feel like we could get out and run.
Our offense ended some plays with fouls when they ran some shot clocks down
and got some shots, we fouled them. So we didn't do a good job there.  
Credit to the guys that were out there. They made a little run and knocked
down some shots where we weren't able to do that earlier.  
  
Q. Will, getting that far down to a team that's as deliberate as Wisconsin,
is it a frustrating style to play against?  
WILL CHERRY: I wouldn't say so much frustrating. I mean when you're down at
times, it can be frustrating, but Coach Tinkle has been preaching to us poise
and character throughout the whole season, so that's what we pride ourselves
on being blue collared players, and we kept on fighting for 40. That's what we
can ask for.  
We made a run to get it to ten, but like Derek said, we made some plays down
the stretch where we couldn't. So we just tried to keep playing and be
relentless.  
But like you said, they're blue collar to the tee. They weren't turning the
ball over. We sped them up at times, but I felt like somehow they always
kicked it to an open shooter who made a dagger three, and put a little damper
in our comeback.  
I wouldn't say it was so much frustrating, but you've got to give it to them.
They were under control for the whole 40 minutes and didn't let us speed them
up.  
  
Q. Art, just talk about what was it about their defense that was so
difficult to kind of crack for you guys?  
ART STEWARD: It was mainly they were switching. They were switching a lot. We
like to roll, we like to set picks and rolls, and that kind of messes up
everything. It kind of spread it out and left the bigs down low and the guards
on the wings. It kind of kept it hard for us to switch on things. It would be
a lot of mismatches on that side, but that's mainly it.  
  
Q. Will, I know you knew that Jordan Taylor was going to be a challenge. Was
he even better than you maybe expected though?  
WILL CHERRY: Not at all. I never underestimate anybody. I gave him credit all
week going in. I knew what I was going up against. He's one of the better
guards in the country.  
At the same time, I wasn't taking anything away from my game or my teammates.
We came in this game ready to play and ready to win. We just came up a little
short.  
As far as Jordan Taylor, I expected every bit of what he did today. He was a
great leader on the floor. He got his teammates the ball and really ran their
team when we started making a comeback.  
  
Q. Derek and Art, as seniors, I know this probably wasn't the way you wanted
to go out, but can you just reflect on your career and when did you start
thinking about that during the game or when the buzzer went off?  
DEREK SELVIG: Just thinking back right now, this year was a heck of a run. I'm
just really thankful for the coaches and my teammates for making it so
special. It's tough to go out this way, but those guys were just ready to play
and we just made mistakes when we couldn't, and that's the difference.  
ART STEWARD: I thought about it at the buzzer. We had a great in‑season run,
and we made it to the tourney, but of course we wanted to advance. We went out
pretty big. I can't complain with that, and I've got to give thanks to the
coaches and the players that I played with.  
  
Q. Art, you kind of kept your team in the game especially in the first half.
Did you feel like you had a mismatch?  
ART STEWARD: Kind of. They play good defense. They help, and my game is
post‑up, down‑low, and they came out and help. I've got to find an open play
and force it up or something like that. It's just something that we work on in
practice, and I felt like I had to step up a little bit, but my team helped
me. They found me. They found me with the ball. They knew where I was
comfortable. We know where we're all comfortable at?  
  
Q. Will, what will it take for this team to get back here and maybe take the
next step next year?  
WILL CHERRY: Same thing, but just a little harder, a little harder, a little
more together. Just take another step. We can't forget about what got us here
in the first place. We worked hard all year. We bought into what the coaches
were preaching each and every day at practice. We didn't let any outside deal
get into our locker room. We stayed together as a team 1 through 15 along with
the coaching staff.  
We'll feel it. Last year was the same deal. We ended up losing the game to get
here. We carried that over into spring workouts after two weeks, after we
lost, and we worked hard. If we can keep working hard, keep working hard and
never be satisfied, we'll be back here. No doubt about that, because we're
never satisfied. We're hungry. We do things the Grizzly way like Coach Tinkle
is always preaching. The Grizzly way is hard and smart together. If we can
keep those things rolling we'll be back here without a doubt.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Tinkle.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it about their defense that's maybe so frustrating to go
against?  
COACH TINKLE: Well, they just switched a lot of things, and we've seen other
teams do that. I thought we settled early when we had opportunities to attack
their bigs when they switched out jump shots, then when we finally got them to
attack. We took bad angles. We picked our dribble up too far from the basket
and he was able to get his hands on them instead of turning the corner. We
always preach when you attack, go through their chin. We didn't do that. End
of the half, we were double pumping, you know. At this stage, you've got to go
strong. We didn't do that.  
Second half, I thought we'd rally, and we just didn't have it. We made a nice
little run or two, but then we got a little bit out of character defensively.  
Let's face it, there were plenty of opportunities within this game where we
had shots at the basket that could have burst a little bit of their momentum
and gotten some going, and we missed multiple opportunities at the rim.  
They did do a great job defensively switching. We tried to get mismatches on
the post with our bigs on their littles. We couldn't convert. We tried to
exploit the mismatches of our littles against their bigs. We didn't finish. So
I give them all the credit in the world for frustrating us.  
But, man, if we just make some of those baskets, take advantage of a couple of
those mismatches, maybe our guys could get a little more confident.  
  
Q. Evan's hot start, how big a factor was that?  
COACH TINKLE: It was big, obviously. We knew we thought that was a key
match‑up for us. He's too good to call an X‑factor, but that one match‑up that
you want to try to hold down, we thought it was him. Man or zone, we were
guarding him with our hands down, and that's not how we guard. So he had
little face‑up jumpers to get them going and get them off the schneid. I mean,
you've seen us all year. We were in zone, and we were leaving shooters wide
open. That's just not us.  
So we were a little bit out of character. Give some of the credit to Wisconsin
for their aggression that they started with, but we've got to take some of the
blame for not quite having the same sense of purpose and being on edge that
we've been on all year to put us in this position.  
  
Q. You can't take anything away from this season. I know it's always tough
to lose in the first round. But just talk about the season overall and how you
guys have grown from start to finish?  
COACH TINKLE: It was a great season. We had some shaky games early on. We knew
that if our guys would buy in and stay together that those early losses and
some of the adversity we faced wouldn't affect us in March.  
We put together a hell of a run, a school record 14 wins in a row, school
record 15‑1 in conference. These guys have accomplished a lot. We told them
that in the locker room. This stings. We've got to take them behind the wood
shed a little bit. The guys are coming back, they'll learn from this
experience, and hopefully it will fuel their fire in the off‑season.  
Like you heard Will say, it happened a year ago, and we need to get tougher so
that we can get back here and advance, maybe. It's a tough deal getting here.
It's not a given. It's only happened nine times in our school's history, but
we don't want to just be a part of the dance. We want to be able to stay on
the dance floor for a little while.  
  
Q. You talked about Ryan Evans, and Will talked about Jordan Taylor. But
what was your biggest concern facing these guys that it might turn out this
way?  
COACH TINKLE: We thought we had to defend the three‑point line. We thought
that was a big key and rebound with them. They were 6 for 12 at half, ended up
10 for 19. We led our league in defensive field goal percentage and
three‑points. But we allowed them to get open looks early and they got their
confidence going.  
In the second half, we were happy with our effort in the first half on the
glass. Second half they just mopped us up. They made some adjustments, went
small. We tried to go big and take advantage of it. We couldn't finish. So
then we tried to go small, and we couldn't rebound with them.  
  
Q. You said in your opening statement how you like to create doubt in the
minds of opponents. How difficult is that against a guy like Taylor running
the show over there?  
COACH TINKLE: It's difficult, but I thought we had our opportunities. If we
could have just converted some of those shots at the rim in the first half,
and you put a little bit of doubt in their mind. Then the pressure of that
hoop starts to shrink a little. We've been a second half team. We came out and
did make a run, but then, boy, that Bruesewitz kid hits a couple of big threes
at the end of the shot clock.  
We had Jordan Taylor trapped in the short corner with 8 seconds on the shot
clock. We let him split us and lay it in. We had a come silly fouls late in
the shot clock. Those are mistakes we made that we don't normally make.  
So now you start to close that gap and the noose, so to speak, gets a little
bit tighter. We just didn't make those runs, and they squashed any time that
we tried to. So obviously they were the ones that created the doubt this
afternoon.  
  
Q. You mentioned defending the three ‑point line. Bruesewitz hadn't hit a
three since February 9th. Were you aware of that in your scouting report?   
COACH TINKLE: There is a reason he takes as many as he does though, because
Coach knows he can make them. But I'm sure in their conference, the opponents
know that he can make them, that's why his percentage is a little bit down.  
But we absolutely knew that he was a threat, that we couldn't let him get it
going. There were a couple of situations where we dug a little bit too much,
too far off in the post. They flipped it back out, and he drilled one. Then
the other one, he had a touch and it bounced around and dropped in.  
So when you play hard and play together, you kind of earn those breaks, and
they did today. Unfortunately, we weren't able to.  
  
Q. The shot blocking to Berggren, is that something you haven't had to see a
whole bunch this season? Is that maybe why you weren't prepared for that?  
COACH TINKLE: Our guys shoot. Our guys play with Brian Qualley. I just thought
our approach at attacking the basket wasn't what it needed to be. Like I
explained in my opening statement, he was able to get his hands on them, but
it did maybe cause some of our guys to get back on their heels a little bit. I
know some of our bigger wings usually attack the basket a little bit more
solidly than they did, and that hurt us.  
We had a lot of points in the paint. 26‑16, but just think if we convert some
of those lay‑ups and finish, then I think that would have caused us or allowed
us to maybe relax and not feel that pressure of each and every possession
having to make the perfect play, if that makes sense.  
  
Q. When Will went out with the two fouls like 3:00 minutes or so in the
first half, and they were able to get the double ‑digit lead at halftime, the
one thing you guys have done in your comebacks is you've cut it to five or so
at halftime to give yourself a manageable deficit. Is that a key stretch there
those last three minutes?   
COACH TINKLE: I don't think at all. I don't think at all. It was a six‑point
game when we picked it up. It was a ten‑point game at halftime. So I don't
want him to pick up his third, and then we don't have him.  
I don't think so. They ended with a little momentum, but we were more than
happy to be in the game with a three‑possession game or whatever, ten‑point
game. So, no, I don't think so.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.  
COACH TINKLE: Thank you.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Baylor  68  
South Dakota State  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH NAGY: Well, just looking at it, number one, you're so worried about
their inside players, and their guards really hurt us tonight. We talked after
the game, just very frustrated that we didn't play our best.  
Baylor had a lot to do with that, but we certainly had a lot of opportunities
we let slip away. Thirteen turnovers was too many. What beat us was the first
half. They were more physical, and that just shouldn't have happened. That's
where we lost the game was in the first half, not the second half.  
The thing about it is even though things didn't go well for us and weren't
going well for us most of the game, and most of our guys just didn't play at
the top of their game, our kids didn't quit. I was really proud of them of
that. But, you know, that's of little consolation when you're talking to kids
after a game like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Griffan, as a senior you guys got off to an incredible start in the game
tonight, that had to increase your confidence in the team with that 8 ‑0 jump?
  
GRIFFAN CALLAHAN: Yeah, it definitely did. We came out really hot, shooting
the ball well and getting stops. But we started boxing out and that's where we
lost it on the offensive glass. They got some second‑chance points, and they
just beat us up in the first half.  
  
Q. Nate, you guys had some uncharacteristic turnovers and stuff that you
guys aren't maybe used to. How did you handle that? How would you react to how
you guys played despite those uncharacteristic turnovers happening to you
guys?  
NATE WOLTERS: Yeah, I definitely had too many turnovers, and as a team we had
too many. When you play a great team like that, they thrive in transition, so
that was a big part of the loss.  
  
Q. Nate, what do you think that was? Nerves are going to show up, often they
show up early. You didn't have the nerves early, but it seemed that you and
Jordan ‑‑ did you feel a little nervous as the game was going on?   
NATE WOLTERS: I wasn't nervous. I just lost the ball a couple times. There's
really nothing you can do about that.  
  
Q. Chad, does that make it tough when you knew you had a big lead early. You
looked like you fought back and might have a chance to win at the end, so it
was not like you were overwhelmed or anything. Does that make it tougher, the
fact that you had a chance to win at the end?  
CHAD WHITE: Yeah, I'd say it does a lot. We came into this game expecting to
win, and we had our chances. They just beat us up on the rebounds and we lost
our opportunity.  
  
Q. Griffan, talk about the crowd. It really probably felt a little bit like
a home game. When you guys got going, it was loud in there and they were all
for you.  
GRIFFAN CALLAHAN: Yeah, it was great. Our fans are great, and our fans got
some other fans into it. That helped out and got us going a little bit. But in
the end, they were just too much for us.  
  
Q. Griffan, aside from giving up the rebounds, you guys seemed to defend
their bigs pretty well. Can you talk about what was key to that? I think Jones
finished with two points or something?  
GRIFFAN CALLAHAN: That was a key coming in. We've got to dig really hard on
Acy and Jones. That's what we did. We have to make our guards beat us, and
they did beat us. We stuck to our game plan, but their guards got some big
shots for them.  
  
Q. I realize it's tough to look at the long ‑term now, but is there any way
to speak to the experience of playing in NCAA Tournament games? Is that
something you're going to look back on 20 years from now and say I got to play
in the big dance? What was that experience like for you?  
GRIFFAN CALLAHAN: Oh, yeah. It was a dream for me. I've always dreamed of
coming here, seeing it on TV. It's just an amazing experience for me. Yeah,
I'll never forget it. I'm happy to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Chad, how about for you guys? You guys will miss Griff, but you've got
everybody else coming back. What does this do in terms of fuelling the fire
going forward or expectations? How do you think this changes things for you
guys to be back?  
CHAD WHITE: I don't know. We've got to replace Griffan, and Griff's a role
model of mine. We've got to have some players step it up. Yeah, our
expectations are up now, and I think we have a target on our back now.  
  
Q. Nate, they were the third seed. You guys had a chance to beat them. I
know you're sad now that you lost, but you've got to be really proud of the
program.  
NATE WOLTERS: Yeah, they're a really good team, and we knew if we shot the
ball well, we'd have a chance and we did that early. We just couldn't make
plays down the stretch. We couldn't get the rebound when we need it or a big
shot when we need it, so it was tough luck.  
  
Q. This is a big week for you guys in terms of being here and tons of
national publicity. Lot of people know about your program now, and you get a
picture on "Sports Illustrated." What's that part of it like, sort of being
elevated in a way you guys aren't used to?   
NATE WOLTERS: It's definitely good for the program moving forward. We
definitely wanted to win this game, but I think more people know about
SouthDakota State now, so it definitely helps for the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Nagy.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering how you felt your team handled itself in its first
‑ever experience like this?  
COACH NAGY: We weren't great. I'm proud of them. I really am, because we did
play well, and obviously the way the game started it was like, holy cow, we're
really going to handle this. But I was frustrated. I'm not going to lie to
you. I was very frustrated and angry at halftime about the way that we
competed.  
In order for us to beat Baylor, we were going to have to compete better than
we did in the first half. We just did not compete. I thought once they settled
down, they really whipped us physically.  
You can say what you want, but we don't want that to happen to us. I don't
care who it is. So I leave here with some frustration. I know our players do
too. But at the same point, I don't want to take any credit away from Baylor.
This is the best team we've ever played in the history of SouthDakota State.
We know that. We knew it going in. If you're going to beat 12 on the boards,
you've got to do better than 10 for 30 from three. We needed to make four more
threes, and we had those looks and we've made them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team's effort in the second half? It would have
been very easy and understandable for them to just fold when they were down by
a ton of points, but they just kept fighting back.  
COACH NAGY: Yeah, I was extremely proud of them for that because very rarely
did it look good for them. We just couldn't get anything going like we'd like
to get going and part of that is Baylor. Their guards are extremely quick and
really pressured us. I thought that was more of a problem than even their
length. Everybody talks about their length, but their guards did a nice job, I
thought, of wearing us down.  
Yeah, the way things were going, we could have easily bowed out and gotten
beat by 25, and our kids didn't. They didn't quit and I'm proud of them for
that.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're thinking about this loss. But what does this mean
moving ahead? Everybody back, you've got to feel good about getting back here
again and things like that.  
COACH NAGY: We could have a better year than we had this year and not get back
here. We know that. How difficult it is, the stretch, and then it comes down
to three days in March. You better be playing well.  
It's one of the things I told the players after the games. We've had the
experience. It is going to be hard for us to replace Griffan. It just is. His
leadership, his toughness, we'll have to have people fill those gaps for us.
But that's the way it always works.  
I told him, a year from now I want to be standing here celebrating a victory
instead of feeling like we're failing.  
  
Q. What was your reaction as the game goes on? Despite the struggles, you
get a lay ‑up, down 4, you miss it. You get a three at the end, and you miss
it. What's going on at that point when you have it, it just doesn't fall?  
COACH NAGY: It's a little frustration because we had our chances. It wasn't
like we didn't have our chances, we had them. I do think we played so few
players tonight. We played six most of the game. That probably had something
to do with it. It just seemed late when we really needed that three, we just
didn't have the legs to put it in.  
The altitude can affect you, but Baylor's playing in altitude too, so you
don't use that as an excuse. But we just didn't have the legs. When you're
shooting threes, you have to have the legs.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like Nate and some of the other guys were having trouble
getting a handle on the ball at times tonight. Is there any way to sort of
explain that phenomenon at all?  
COACH NAGY: No, not necessarily. There's no way I can explain it. We had a
pass in there to Jordan that slipped out of his hands on a lay‑up. It did just
seem like Nate really struggled to get a handle on the ball tonight, and I
don't know why that is. I don't know why that is.  
  
Q. Talk about Jordan's night for the second game in a row. He really
struggled. Any idea why? Secondly, although a win certainly has a definite
price or a lot of benefits for you, does being picked by a lot of national
pundits, having them think well of your program and really giving Baylor a
battle, do you think that will pay off in the short term with recruits or
whatever?  
COACH NAGY: Number one, I don't know why‑‑ I mean, Jordan got off to a great
start. He hit that first jumper, and it really felt like ‑‑ I think most of
all, and I talked to Jordan about it, I think their length bothered him. He's
not used to having a 6'10" guy covering that much ground coming off a screen.
It just seemed he was unsure as to whether he should shoot it or pump fake and
drive.  
When he was open I wanted him to shoot it, but he just kept feeling like they
were right there. He got the one tipped, and I think that probably bothered
him.  
Then in terms, I guess I wish Seth Davis would have kind of kept quiet. I
think he didn't help us at all. And those things are great. Yes, it's still
good for our program that those guys have seen us or know about us or believe
in us. It certainly isn't going to hurt that we took Baylor to the wire,
because again, you can come into a game and get beaten by 30. We're not going
to beat Baylor by 30, but they could beat us by 30.  
So the fact that things didn't go well and we hung around and certainly
competed, that says something about our kids, and that's not going to hurt
recruiting.  
  
Q. Coach, you said before the game Pierre was one of your chief concerns or
biggest concerns on Baylor's team. Did that play out? Was he everything you
thought?  
COACH NAGY: He's tremendous. We've not faced a quicker guard than him. I mean,
he's a tremendous, tremendous player. Not only‑‑ the thing about him is he can
score. He can score off the dribble. He can get a shot any time he wants it,
even as small as he is. But he still involves the other guys. He's a
tremendous passer. He's as good a point guard as we've seen this year.  
  
Q. You kind of touched upon what this means to SouthDakota State and trying
to get back here next year and all that. But is there anyway to sort of
generally summarize what getting to the NCAA Tournament, getting SouthDakota
State on the lips and in the minds of so many people? Is there any way to
summarize what that means to your program?  
COACH NAGY: In one word, it's overwhelming, to start with. It's something that
most of us aren't used to. At the same point, it's satisfying. Satisfying for
our kids. As I think back on it, and I said overwhelming, satisfying would be
the number one word. Because when I look back and I think about how hard our
kids have worked, and how hard they worked in the weight room and how much
they've been in the gym, for that to pay off, as a coach, to see that hard
work pays off‑‑ because when you preach it all the time and for it to happen
is a very satisfying thing for a coach.  
I know the players are satisfied. I know that obviously walking out of here
today not winning is no consolation today, but I told them. I said SouthDakota
State's going to get back here, and they're going to get back here. When they
put me in the grave and you're an old man, you're going to be able to say I
was on the first team from SouthDakota State that went there. Nobody will ever
be able to take that from them. It's been very satisfying.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Chad. Early in the season he was tentative in big games.
Tonight he was not at all. Talk about his progression and what you expect from
him going forward?  
COACH NAGY: Number one, I expected Chad to be our second leading scorer this
year and I think some injuries slowed him. But that would be what I expect of
him next year. Really what we need right now is for Brayden and Chad to make
big jumps on the wing and become better players, become better players off the
dribble so that we can really put pressure on people offensively. Because I
think that we can do that. I definitely think that we can do that.  
Chad is a tremendous player. At 6'6" the way he shoots the basketball, he's a
great asset, and he takes pressure off people when he's playing like that.
I've always had a great confidence in Chad. When I saw Chad as a sophomore in
high school, even then I thought he was the best player in the state, and I've
always had a lot of confidence in him. I think if we can get his confidence
higher, he can play the point for us. He can pass well. He does so many things
very well. He's very versatile.  
  
Q. I know your guys lost, but how much fun has this been for you and your
team?  
COACH NAGY: Well, losing is not fun for me. I'm not going to lie to you. It's
hard for me to think through that right now just because I'm a little
frustrated with how we played, even though I'm very proud of our kids.  
But it's been, you know, you can't explain the experience. The best thing is
to have your kids be able to go through it one time. If you ever get back here
with those same kids, it will be a lot easier. It will be less overwhelming.  
But for me, the most satisfying thing is to go through it‑‑ not to go through
it as a coach, but to go through it with that group of kids who we love very
much and who have given us everything that we've asked them to give us.  
I just continue to tell them, play like you're loved. Your performance does
not‑‑ you do not have to perform well for us to love you. We already love you.
So we want you to play freely and play like you're loved.  
We shot the ball tonight. We weren't afraid to shoot it. It just didn't go in
the basket and things didn't go well for us. But I feel honored to go through
it with those kids because they've done so much for me. I don't feel like I've
done anything for them. I feel like they've done everything for me.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Colorado  68  
UNLV  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Boyle, an opening statement, please.  
COACH BOYLE: First of all, I think we beat a very, very good basketball team
and a very good program tonight, so I want to congratulate UNLV on a great
year. I guess looking back, NCAA Tournament games shouldn't be easy, but we
didn't handle our lead in the second half as well as we'd like to.  
But the one thing about our team we've shown is a toughness and a resiliency
all year. We talked at halftime about UNLV making a run on us, and they did.
But we handled it. We got stops when we had to get stops. We did just enough.
If you had told me before the game we'd turn it over 23 times and miss 10 free
throws and beat a team as good as UNLV I would have said you're crazy.  
But we found a way to do it. It's a testament to these three guys and the rest
of those guys in that locker room. I couldn't be more proud of the way these
guys played and represented our university tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Colorado student‑athletes.  
  
Q. André, how do you explain the last week and a half?  
ANDRÉ ROBERSON: You know, it's been great. I feel like our guys are playing
well, playing with a lot of confidence, and we're just going to try to keep it
rolling. I just feel like we can take down Baylor coming up.  
  
Q. Specifically, how?  
ANDRÉ ROBERSON: We believe in ourselves. We believe in everything Coach Boyle
tells us. We execute our game plan. We try to do it our best. Defense and
rebounding, that's our motto. Every time we do that, we win games.  
  
Q. Booker and Roberson, Carlon's dunk with 2:30 ‑‑ he's done that before
this year and kind of sparked you. Can you tell how that sparked you with 2:30
left?   
ASKIA BOOKER: I think that's a big confidence booster. When you see your
teammate go up there with 2:00 minutes left and throw the ball down like that,
I think it gets the crowd into it as well, which builds a little more momentum
going into the last 2:00 minutes of the game. I think that helped a lot.  
ANDRÉ ROBERSON: It just gave us energy, and we fed off of it. Also the crowd;
it was great. They came all the way from Colorado to support us, so it always
feels great that we know they have our backs. So it was good.  
  
Q. Booker and Roberson, I'm a little old so I forget these things, but I
think the last time Colorado won an NCAA game was 1997. How old were both of
you, and do you remember it?  
ANDRÉ ROBERSON: I do not remember it. I don't think I was born yet. No‑‑ I
know I was born (laughing). I don't know.  
COACH BOYLE: How old were you in '96?  
ASKIA BOOKER: I was three. I was three.  
ANDRÉ ROBERSON: I don't know. It's a great accomplishment. I feel like it's a
testament to what we've been doing since day one. Hard work pays off.  
ASKIA BOOKER: I'm not too big on history, but I'm just happy that we're here
and we won.  
  
Q. Carlon, you were signed up to guard Chace Stanback, and him and Mike
Moser combined for 7 for 27 from the field. You guys knew that was going to be
a tough match ‑up. What was your game plan on a shooter like that?   
CARLON BROWN: With Chace, we just knew we had to run him off the three‑point
line because he's comfortable pulling off the transition and off the jab step.
So I tried to do my best job of crowding him. With Moser, André did a great
job crowding him and making sure he didn't get offensive rebounds. We were
able to get stops and run.  
  
Q. Carlon, your coach talked about your team not practicing particularly
well, but you guys came out on fire. What do you attribute that to?  
CARLON BROWN: The last couple practices haven't been the ones that pleased
Coach Boyle and the coaching staff. But we knew once game time came we were
going to be ready. It was hard to turn the switch on and off, but somehow the
team does it. Hopefully we can maintain that same switch.  
But we should have a great practice tomorrow with a lot of energy, get some
shots up and get ready for this game plan on Saturday.  
  
Q. André, you're the only player up there that played against Baylor a year
ago in the Big 12. What do you know about them going into this match ‑up that
you guys have with them on Saturday?   
ANDRÉ ROBERSON: They're long, athletic and they sit in that 2‑3 zone. So I
feel like one thing we can do is offensive rebound. It's hard to rebound for
them out of the zone. So I feel like our guys can do that. Just mix it up in
there for them. They get out running transition, so they're a great team
overall. I just feel like we'll take on the challenge.  
  
Q. I'm not going to get you guys worked up and bring up that tenth place
prediction in the Pac ‑12 again.   
ASKIA BOOKER: 11th, 11th.  
  
Q. Okay. But I remember, Booker, dropping in on you early in the conference
season when you had beaten Utah, and for a young guy, you seemed pretty
confident about what this team could do. How surprised are you by where you
are right now?  
ASKIA BOOKER: Personally for myself?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
ASKIA BOOKER: I'm very surprised coming from high school. Not many people
believed in me, so I worked my tail off my junior year and my senior year in
high school. I thank Tad and the rest of CU for taking me in and taking me
under their wing, especially these guys as teammates. They've supported me
very well, and I thank them a lot for that. I've come a long way, especially
I'm happy I made it to the NCAA Tournament with these guys. I wouldn't rather
be here with anybody else. So I came a long way.  
CARLON BROWN: Can I say something to that? He's not surprised. He just told
you a nice lie because earlier when we were in the room he said, "Man, as long
as Colorado got me, we're going to win." So he's very confident in himself.
We're glad he's confident. He played a great game today, and glad to have him
and experience. They're two great freshmen. Coach Boyle did a great job
recruiting them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Boyle.  
  
Q. Tad, did you notice the atmosphere for a neutral site game played at
10:00 Eastern time? Have you ever watched a game here or been here?  
COACH BOYLE: No, I mean, I brought my high school team when I was a high
school coach to team camp here, but never been in The Pit. I've heard a lot
about it. I think it lived up to its reputation tonight. We brought fans. UNLV
brought fans. Then NewMexico, Albuquerque, the fans for UNM came out.  
This is a great basketball community. It's a great basketball venue. I love
the intimacy of it and the energy in that arena. I think both teams fed off of
it at different times during the game.  
This is what it's all about. I've been part of NCAA Tournament first round or
second round games where you could hear a pin drop. Some of the‑‑ I'm glad we
played in the night session because sometimes with people working it's hard to
fill the arenas. But certainly the night session everybody came out, and it
was a great college basketball atmosphere. That's what it's supposed to be
about. So I'm glad Albuquerque got the bid, and I'm glad that we were sent
here.  
  
Q. Coach, did you have a sense after the practices didn't go so well the
last two days that they were going to come out with that kind of energy?  
COACH BOYLE: I trust this team. I really do. I have. I think we've really
found another level since we went to L.A. and did what we did. As a coach you
want maximum effort. You want your guys dialed in and sharp certainly the day
before a game.  
I dismissed Tuesday's practice as maybe a little hangover from L.A., but when
we came down here and didn't practice well, it concerned me at the time. But
after it was over with, I looked back at what these guys have been through
emotionally, mentally and physically over the last week, and I've got to cut
them a break.  
As a coach, sometimes I've got to temper my expectations of what we're asking
them to do, especially in practice. We've got three seniors that are playing
that have a lot of maturity and a lot of heart, and that permeates through our
whole team. I've got to cut them some slack on that practice.  
I just told them afterwards‑‑ we came for our shoot-around here, and we had
great energy, so that led me to believe we'd be ready tonight and we were.  
  
Q. You're ahead 53 ‑33 with about 13:00 left. I don't remember exactly when
the timeout you took was. It was either 57‑53 or 57‑55\. I suspect that maybe
you were just a tad nervous at that point. But what do you tell your team and
how do you calm them down?   
COACH BOYLE: We have to maintain our aggressiveness without taking bad shots.
There is a fine line between holding the ball and losing your aggressiveness
and rushing and taking bad shots. We didn't do that very well. We got on our
heels, and then they made their run. We had some deer in the head lights look.  
I wanted to save some timeouts for down the stretch in case we needed them. I
think I used two or three during that period. We have to execute better. Using
shot clock is smart at that time, but then when the shot clock's running down,
we've got to be smarter and make better plays. We had a lot of empty
possessions in that period of time, and I take responsibility for that. For
not having our guys dialed in, prepared, and that's what you have to do this
time of year.  
So we dodged a little bit of a bullet there. Again, part of that was UNLV
making shots and getting on a run, but we didn't help ourselves. If we could
just crank out some great possessions, use some clock and execute at the end,
we could have broke them. But we didn't break them. We let them back in.  
But I credit UNLV for that. We talked at halftime about them making a run. We
knew they were going to make a run at some point. We just had to mentally
handle it. I think our guys did. It got a little closer than I'd like it to
be.  
  
Q. Coach, if you don't mind going big picture for a moment. Your first full
recruiting class with Spencer and Askia, their first year on campus, go to the
NCAA Tournament and now you win a game. What are expectations where is the bar
raised in this program now?  
COACH BOYLE: We just want to keep getting better. That's our mantra. Every day
we want to get better as coaches, as players. If you do that, it's going to
happen. Your program's going to get better. Your coaching is going to get
better. Your players are going to get better. We want to recruit well, which
we have. We have five guys coming in next year who are all special players.  
I don't get into expectations because you're internal expectations are we want
to play hard, we want to play smart, and we want to play together. If we do
those things and we defend and rebound, things will take care of themselves.  
So I don't get caught up into the outside expectations of what are put on us.
I just want to get better every day, and I think we've done that since we've
been here.  
  
Q. Coach, all season long we've heard how the Mountain West had exceeded the
Pac ‑12 as a premier conference in the west. California does not play well
last night. Did you feel like you're sort of carrying the banner for your
conference too?   
COACH BOYLE: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. We owed it to the rest of the teams
in our league. The rest of the institutions in our league to play well
tonight. The only way you get rid of that stigma, and it's not going to be
there for very long because I know how the teams in our league are recruiting,
and I know the young players that are in our league. The Pac‑12 is going to be
much better next year than it was this year. But it's incumbent upon us as
coaches to have better non‑conference wins than we had this year. That's the
only way we can do it.  
This is a great postseason win to kind of get us hopefully on track to do
that, and we have another opportunity on Saturday to do that.  
  
Q. Having said that, would you be willing to come down and play the Lobos in
The Pit?  
COACH BOYLE: It would be a great home‑and‑home series. It's a great basketball
atmosphere. We're creating a great one up at the University of Colorado. So I
don't see why that couldn't happen. It's got to be the right situation for
Coach Alford and where their program is and ours, but I'm open to a lot of
scheduling opportunities.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Brown's dunk there at 2:30? It seemed
like UNLV had gone on a 22 ‑4 run. I know you can't slap them in the face, but
it seems like that was kind of the slap in the face that the team needed to
wake them up.   
COACH BOYLE: We talked in those timeouts. Our guys were not handling it well,
that was obvious. We talked about playing with poise, playing with composure,
and continuing to attack. When we got stops, we wanted to run. That's one of
the things that had gotten us that lead to begin with.  
When we got that stop and we pitched it ahead to Carlon, that dunk brought our
team energy, confidence back. I wish it would have happened a little bit
sooner rather than later, but it put us up 5. Our guys started believing
again.  
But poise and composure down the stretch is what you have to have. We lost it
for a minute, but we got it back; and for that I've got to give our guys
credit.  
  
Q. Would you talk a little more about Carlon and him overcoming some stuff
and playing like he did?  
COACH BOYLE: The people that have followed our program this year know that
Carlon went through a significant slump. I don't know for seven, eight games,
nine games, I forget. But he really struggled shooting the ball. I'm really
proud of the way he handled it. It's one of the things as a coach that I
didn't necessarily know how to bring him out of it. Carlon didn't know how to
bring himself out of it. We just kept talking about taking good shots, being
aggressive, and defend and rebound.  
We broke out of it in L.A., and it couldn't have been a better time. He's a
terrific player. You have to have your best players play well at this time of
year to have a chance, and Carlon and André really stepped up. Askia Booker
was terrific tonight. The lift he gave us in the first half when Spencer was
in foul trouble cannot be mistaken.  
But our guys all feed off Carlon. We stemmed the tide when he went through
that slump. I'm proud of him for breaking out of it because it wasn't easy.  
  
Q. This team's had to believe in the possibility that it could do it, could
get in the dance and then win at the end of this game. Does that build on
itself or is there any way of telling?  
COACH BOYLE: It builds on itself. Especially what we've gone through the
last‑‑ I can't tell you. Andy asked the question of André about what the last
ten days have been like. I don't think there's an explanation for it. But the
one thing I can tell you with 100% certainty is this team believes in itself.  
After what we went through in L.A., and we went down there with the idea we're
beating Utah for our 20th win of the season, for the first time ever in
Colorado history, we did that. We snuck one out against Oregon the next night,
and we just got on a roll. We matched up well with Cal, and it's kind of taken
on a life of its own. I don't see why it can't continue.  
It's going to get harder as we go; we know that. But I believe in this team.
They believe in themselves, and as long as you do that this time of year
you've got a shot.  
  
Q. What was going on with the inbound plays and the struggles there?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, we didn't use, again, poise and composure. The first
turnover was a spot throw in, so André couldn't run the baseline. Our guards
got to do a better job of getting open. We didn't execute well.  
We talked at halftime, hey, press offense is going to be key. At some point
they're going to have to bring it on us, and UNLV's not a pressing team. We
talked about using the pass fake because they're so long and athletic, they
anticipate well. We've got to pass fake. Our press offense wasn't good enough,
and we turned it over a few times.  
Again, 23 turnovers is too many. We dodged a bullet tonight. But we work on
it. You know, you've got to make plays. Players have to make plays this time
of year. For a while there we didn't. We were making losing plays, not winning
plays.  
But it's not one guy. It's not coming to meet passes and not completing
passes. You've got to pass and catch. That was one of the things I was so mad
at practice yesterday. We couldn't pass and catch. It's like if you can't pass
and catch, you're going to have trouble winning games.  
  
Q. I know you've been focused on the Pac ‑12 this year, but last year you
played in Waco and lost a close game down there. How familiar are you with
Baylor? Especially not only the guys like Perry Jones and Quincy Acy that have
been there, but guys like Pierre Jackson who is coming in?   
COACH BOYLE: I've watched them on TV. Baylor's a quality program. We did play
them down there. I know André has been watching film. They're playing a lot
more man, as you know, as opposed to their zone. They've still got their zone
in their stable.  
But I'm familiar with their players and the new kids Jackson and Heslip are
great additions to their team. Pierre Jackson's a great point guard. A guy who
we're going to have to really pay a lot of attention to. He's kind of the
straw in their drink. And that Heslip kid really stretches the defense. He's
kind of our Levi Knutson from last year.  
So quality players, quality program, and we're going to have to play better
than we did tonight to have a chance against Baylor, certainly in the second
half.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Wisconsin  73  
Montana  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Ryan, an opening statement, please.  
COACH RYAN: First of all, I'd like to congratulate the University of Montana
for an unbelievable season. Those numbers that these guys put up were pretty
good. We knew how good a team they were, and they should be extremely proud of
their season.  
I'm really proud of our guys. I thought we did some things really well. Couple
areas we're going to need to shore up, but I like the overall effort, and
looking forward to playing again.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, you've played a lot of games here, obviously. Is this as close to
a perfect game as you've had?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: I guess, I don't know. It was a good game. We're just happy to
have the win. It was a great team win. Everybody added something, whether it
was Mike or Ben off the bench, knocking down shots. Jared getting blocks,
playing great defense. So it was just a great team win. Like Coach said, we're
happy to be able to play again.  
  
Q. Jordan, what was the key in moving the ball and getting open shots
against their defense?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Just that. Just moving bodies and then moving the ball. We got
stagnant at times, but we kept bringing in fresh guys, like I said. If Mike
and Ben or Rob or Ryan whoever it was, if they weren't making shots they were
moving themselves and kind of opening up gaps for guys to make plays and stuff
like that. A perfect example, I think, is the one where I fell down, and Mike
just kind of kept moving in behind the defense and I just kind of threw it to
him, and he did a good job of opening himself up.  
  
Q. Jared, what is the key if you're playing a smaller guy and he penetrates
down the lane blocking that shot without fouling him?  
JARED BERGGREN: Just trying to do a good job of protecting the basket. There
were a lot of situations where I ended up picking up the ball handler,
normally a smaller guard attacking the rim. Probably could have done a better
job taking away the lane lines. I let him get to the rim a little too easy
sometimes, but I was lucky enough to get a finger tip on a few of them to
alter the shot.  
But it's pretty much just trying to play big, wait on it, wait till they leave
their feet, don't jump too soon. There are a few times I tried to pump fake,
and just stayed on them. I forced them into a travel one time which some of
the coaches were saying to look for, so just trying to protect the basket.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you talk a little about your first half? It seemed like
everything you threw up was going in.  
RYAN EVANS: Yeah, I wanted to come out and play aggressive and loose. Not with
the idea that I was going to have five turnovers, but kind of help relieve
pressure from Jordan and the rest of them. My teammates kind of backed me up
when I did have those turnovers. I know Rob took a charge and probably kept me
in the game a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Jordan, this hot start that Ryan got off to, did that help the team's
confidence as a whole?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, any time you have a guy like that just kind of start off
like that, it definitely gets you going as a team, but it also opens up a lot
of other guys, it frees up. Now they're thinking about Ryan. He started 4 for
4 or 5 for 5, whatever it was. Now they're thinking about him even more so
than they were coming in. It just opens things up.  
We've been saying all year that we've got a lot of guys who can put it in the
hole, and Ryan's been great all year.  
  
Q. Jordan, it's been said that you've been kind of taking a back seat this
season. Kind of dishing a lot more. Tonight it seemed that you were a lot more
aggressive. Is that the new Jordan Taylor we're going to see in the
tournament?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: I'm just coming out trying to do anything I can to help my team
win. I felt like I got some open looks there especially in the first half.
It's the same for me as it is for everybody else. If you get an open look,
you've just got to step in and knock it down. Just be aggressive and play
confident.  
  
Q. Rob, was this just an extension today of what you've been doing lately?
Also, you're real tight with Bruesewitz, was it good to see him hit a three
‑pointer for the first time in quite a long time?   
ROB WILSON: It's great to see him knock it down, because he can shoot the
ball. For any shooter when you're not seeing the ball go in, it can be
frustrating. To see him knock down that shot and see the smile on his face was
pretty cool.  
  
Q. Rob, and for your performance today, it looks like that was just an
extension of what you've been doing recently.  
ROB WILSON: I owe it to my teammates. The guys are penetrating and finding me.
I'm just knocking down the shots. They're screening for me and I'm getting
open. I owe it to my teammates for finding me consistently.  
  
Q. Jordan, having faced Will Cherry now, how does he compare to a Big Ten
guard?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: He's a really good player. I think everybody knew that.
Everybody in the Big Sky, and anybody who has played against him definitely
knows that. He's quick defensively, and offensively he can make things happen.
I know he struggled a little bit today from the field, but that's happened to
everybody.  
It was definitely fun playing against him. I like playing against a good
guard. It's a challenge. I'm just happy that we were able to get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the keys to stopping Will Cherry today and what you
were able to do defensively against him?  
COACH RYAN: Well, we break down a lot of film like everybody else, and we look
at tendencies, and we look at space that players need. Some players only need
a little sliver and they can get to the rim. Some guys use more counters. The
tough part about preparing for him was he can quickly get to the rim off of a
shot fake or a catch and a penetrate, plus he has counters in his game where
he can start out driving with his right, spin back to his left. He can come
off of screens and catch and shoot threes. So he's a complete player.  
We just made sure that we tried to run him off the three‑point line and tried
to get some help to him and squeeze the court. Make the driving line smaller.  
  
Q. You said you had a couple things to shore up, but I would think overall
you have to be thrilled with the complete effort today pretty much smart to
finish with what you saw from your guys?  
COACH RYAN: Well, it's in the left‑hand column, so you're always happy with
those. But there's more out there, and in order to get more, you have to play
better. So we'll try to improve a couple things and make sure that we're
trying to play to our max. I think in some areas today we were okay.  
But going from good to great takes a lot, and we're going to try to step it up
a little bit.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Jordan Taylor and his leadership role
with this team going forward?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I know I certainly wouldn't want to trade him with the
deadline today and all this other stuff that's been in the media. Like, who
cares? With a college guard, he's not going anywhere. This is a college game.
What he's done for us and his concentration on what he does for us, there are
very few players in the country that have ever had four years of what he's
done for a team, especially these last three.  
You get six assists and no turnovers, you shoot a decent percentage,
defensively you do a heck of a job. He's a player. That's why he's all Big
Ten. Who knows what else is out there for him. But he doesn't worry about that
stuff. But I know one thing, our guys believe in him and trust in him, and I
like the fact that he's on our side.  
  
Q. How much do you think Mike needed that three to fall in the second half,
that first one?  
COACH RYAN: I just told him he was due. People that have been around me long
enough. I'm not going to say, Mike, come on. You're shot. You're terrible. I
don't do that about shooting.  
I just told him the other day at practice, "Hey, Mike, you're due." He
laughed. I think it was a laugh. Yeah, it was a laugh. The fact that he went
out there and knocked down a couple, that's good stuff.  
  
Q. Jared focused more on what he didn't do in this game than the seven
blocks he did have. What did you see in his defensive performance today?  
COACH RYAN: He was okay. He didn't close out as quickly a couple times as we
thought, which, when I break the tape down, I'll be able to be a little more
point specific. I thought he moved his feet fairly well though considering how
would you like to be that size with that size shoe and try to move your feet
with a Cherry or a Steward or any of those other guys they had. So I thought
he did a pretty good job, but he can do better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO_  
  

Vanderbilt  79  
Harvard  70

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH AMAKER: Well, certainly they're an outstanding basketball team, and we
congratulate them on this victory. I think they have all the pieces to the
puzzle for an outstanding team, as we've seen, and certainly to make a deep
run here in this tournament.  
I thought the end of the first half, the run that they closed on was a big
plus for them. But I was really impressed with the effort that our kids gave
to make the game interesting toward the end. I can't say enough about the
fight that we had and the effort that we put forth to stay relevant in this
particular basketball game.  
Their ability to hit threes, did an outstanding job of getting to the foul
line and making the free throws, and certainly their size and strength and
athleticism is something to be reckoned with.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Oliver, if you think back to when it was 20 ‑17 and they closed very
strongly. What do you remember about what you guys were or weren't doing?   
OLIVER McNALLY: It's tough to look back. I've heard this from people who
played in the tournaments, it happens so fast, so it's tough to look back.  
I think we got sloppy with the ball offensively. We got a couple‑‑ you can't
give a shooter or a player like John Jenkins lay‑ups like that and easy
buckets. I think we put him on the line a couple times with a couple of stupid
fouls to get guys going.  
Also, I don't think we're doing a good job rebounding the ball defensively.
It's tough because our big guys had to square up some monsters down there. It
was really as a five‑person unit that we didn't focus enough on really helping
out. If you didn't have anybody to box out, go pick up some loose balls. And
they won a couple of 50‑50s and got up and down the court. Then we lost
Tinsley in transition, and we let him get off for another one at the end of
the buzzer. So I guess I do remember.  
  
Q. Oliver and Keith, there's been so much talk of Harvard getting into the
NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1946. Didn't get in last year.
Finally get in this year. What was it like?  
KEITH WRIGHT: It's just a dream come true. We've worked so hard, especially
Oliver and myself and Andrew Van Nest, another senior on the team. We've put a
lot of time, blood, sweat and tears into this basketball program. This is one
of the goals was to make it to the tournament.  
Unfortunately, we didn't come out with a victory, but this is something that
we're going to carry with us for the rest of our lives. It's a stage where not
many players get to play, and we are definitely grateful for that.  
OLIVER McNALLY: Keith's a lot more positive guy than I am sometimes. I think
down the line it's such an honor to be a part of a tournament like this. Just
like everybody else on the team, you get blown up with text messages and
Facebook messages and all that stuff.  
One thing that sticks with me is a kid who played high school basketball with
me and said you're living out a lot of people's dreams right now. Make sure
you enjoy it, and make sure you do a good job. That's probably the one that
stuck with me the most. That's totally true, but right now it's a lot of
disappointment.  
Cliche is we came here to win, but we were expecting to win. We came here to
win, and we didn't do enough things to do that.  
  
Q. From the perspective, how much do you appreciate what this meant to
Harvard?  
KEITH WRIGHT: This is a huge step for our program. To be able to be part of
the team that laid the foundation down, being Coach Amaker's first recruiting
class, and really taking the risk, you know, we're leaving our mark here on
the university and the basketball program itself.  
It just means a lot to me that I've had an effect on such a prestigious
institution as Harvard.  
OLIVER McNALLY: It's just really special. I'm just really glad to be a part of
it. I'm going to cherish the relationships I've made, not only through the
basketball program, but also at my time spent at Harvard. It's something that
I don't think happens very often. You're getting recruited by all kinds of
coaches.  
They sell you all kinds of dreams, and Coach Amaker laid a plan out, and this
is the plan that we've followed through as players, as a coaching staff,
getting in good kids. Not only good players, but just really good people. We
made the tournament. We wanted to advance. That was obviously the ultimate
goal.  
But for players coming in is a big deal and we get a lot of credit. But I
think Coach setting the foundation, laying out the plan for us. We weren't
coming in and winning 30 games freshman year. We were coming in to build a
program from the ground up, and that's exactly what we did.  
  
Q. Oliver, can you just talk about how Laurent stepped up and what the
feeling was during that run? Did you feel you were going to be able to pull it
off?  
OLIVER McNALLY: Yeah, I was ready to go. I thought we were going to come back.
Vandy's lost‑‑ it's well publicized that Vandy's lost in the first round the
last three out of four years. So we knew if we were hanging around, we'd put
that thought in their head and see what happened. And I thought we were doing
that. Credit to them for coming out really strong after that and being strong
with the ball and making free throws. But we made a great run.  
For Laurent, everybody talked about it. Laurent hasn't been practiced a lot.
He's hurt his ankle and for him to come up on a day or two of practice, and to
hit those big shots when some of the older guys on the team weren't doing
that, me included, it was huge for our team.  
It also speaks to what kind of team we are. We have two guys in double figures
and they're at like 10.2 points. You never know who you're going to get it
from. I think we played that way today. We just didn't do some of the other
things we needed to do well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Amaker.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the last five minutes? I think you held Vandy for
no field goals during that run that you had at the end of the game there?  
COACH AMAKER: Well, I'd like to think that we did something differently. We
tried hard not to bail them out. I thought that was one of the keys for us
that at times we weren't doing a good job of blocking out and giving them
extra opportunities to score the basketball and also fouling them. It was
important for us to see if we could do those two things.  
It makes it a lot easier to push up your pressure and dig in a little deeper
when you start to make a few shots on the offensive end. Certainly we were
able to knock a few down. It gave us some confidence and some energy to see if
we could kind of get back in the game.  
They're an experienced team. They handled the ball well. They inbounded it
where they needed to get to. They made their foul shots. They're an
outstanding basketball club, and as I said, I think a team that's built to
make a strong, deep run in this tournament.  
  
Q. I know you talked about it a lot, but now that the final game has
happened, can you talk about what the seniors meant to the program?  
COACH AMAKER: Yeah, it was mentioned in the locker room how special they are
and how grateful we all are for their belief and certainly their performance
on and off the court for us. They've been sensational to work with, to coach,
and to teach. I think the example they've set for this program is an enormous
footprint right now.  
I mentioned to our kids that we owe them a great deal of gratitude, but also
the fact that I was proud of our entire team for the effort we put forth to
kind of grind and scrap our way back into this game. But certainly our older
guys are the one that's lead the way when it comes to those kind of things.  
  
Q. Oliver alluded to the monsters that they had down low. Can you talk about
the difference that Festus Ezeli made? Especially he had three offensive
rebounds on one play.  
COACH AMAKER: Well, he's an outstanding player. I can't imagine he won't be
playing in the NBA if that's what he chooses to do. I don't know what his
aspirations are. But certainly with his ability and his size and his strength
and athleticism, it's very difficult for us to do anything with him when he
spreads out and posts that deep. Can't get around him.  
He's not the only one that has that kind of size and athleticism. I think you
had mentioned in our press conference the other day, yesterday, about their
size. You could just see the difference of the size and athleticism they can
put on the floor at every spot, every position. It's made it very difficult
for us.  
So to keep them off the backboard or do anything tricky or differently than we
ordinarily would do to try to offset some of those things. It was very, very
difficult for us to go against those big guys across the front line.  
  
Q. Jenkins, I'll let it go with that. Whatever you need to say about
Jenkins.  
COACH AMAKER: Yeah, he's the leading scorer the last two years in the SEC.
He's a marksman, there is no question about it. The way that they get him open
and how quickly he can get into his shot is amazing. I know there's been a lot
of talk about his quick release, but I think he's really incredibly ball quick
on the catch. To get to his shooting position is amazing.  
The other thing is sometimes you don't take into account, he's 6'4". He has
really good size. Sometimes you may overlook that. He's a legit 6'4" or maybe
a little more than that, and good size to go get a shot. He gets in the air
quickly. He's an outstanding player. Moves well without the ball. You can look
at his line. He's incredibly efficient.  
Certainly I'm sure he was surprised he missed as three free throws. He's
ordinarily an automatic free‑throw shooter. But nothing but outstanding things
to say as I said to him in line when we shook their hands. He's an outstanding
player, terrific, terrific player.
