_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

James Madison  68  
LIU Brooklyn  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Jack Perri as well as student‑athletes
Jamal Olasewere and C.J. Garner.  
COACH PERRI: At the beginning of the game, I was a little concerned with them
going small. I didn't like our matchups to start the game because Goins
couldn't play. I actually thought that would have helped us if he did play.  
So we started out, we struggled because with their switching. It took us a
while to get going really through most of the half.  
We kept our poise pretty well, got back in the game, and we had two big things
that happened. C.J. over here, he hurts his ankle, which, again, he wasn't the
same after that, sprained it pretty bad. And Jamal picks up his third foul.
So, again, he couldn't really be himself and play with the same aggressiveness
he's used to playing.  
I think those two things hurt us in the second half, especially we were up 8
on the glass at halftime. They ended up out rebounding us, and they bothered
our shots around the rim.  
Plain and simple, they really bothered our shots. Ten blocked shots; that was
something we weren't necessarily thinking was going to happen.  
Their guards did a great job. They have great length. So not the outcome we're
looking for.  
THE MODERATOR: Open the floor for questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jamal, how much did Andre Nation kind of limit you tonight in your
offensive production?  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: Like he said, he had five blocks as a guard. I think around
the rim, he was‑‑ it made me struggle trying to finish my layups and stuff.  
  
Q. For Jamal and C.J., for both of you guys, last couple of years you faced
a really high seed. Those are tough matchups. There's a little more optimism
going into this game. How disappointing is it this is the outcome especially
since you guys don't get another chance?  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: It sucks. What can we do? I felt we fought hard. Tonight they
were the better team, I guess.  
  
Q. You two played together four years of college, is that right?  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: Yes.  
  
Q. And how many in high school, two, three?  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: We were together four years, but we played three years
together.  
  
Q. And how many in high school together?  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: Two.  
  
Q. And you won three conference championships in college and two state
titles together in high school, is that right?  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: One.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about this being the last game that you two will ever
play together and what you feel like you've accomplished.  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: I mean, the kid is an amazing basketball player. He has a big
heart. To be led by somebody like that for so long, to move on, it hurts, and
it definitely‑‑ I'm thankful for every year I've had with the kid because he's
showed me so much. He's always been a big brother to me on and off the court.  
You can tell in the game I tried to mold my game after him. The kid is just
electrifying, and I'm thankful for every second I've had with him.  
C.J. GARNER: I have a lot of respect for Jamal. I've seen him work hard over
the years to become the great player he is now.  
The sky's the limit for him. We pushed each other to get to the level we're at
right now, which is to get back to the tournament, and to be here three
times‑‑ it sucks that we're not going to be able to play together anymore, but
I think we've taught each other a lot, and we've both grown from it.  
So I wish him the best. It's just been great.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering how you'll handle this. Will you watch James Madison
play against IU, or will you prefer to really not see it because it will be a
little bit painful?  
C.J. GARNER: If I'm around and I'm near a TV, I'll definitely watch the game.
I don't think it will be painful. I know a couple players on Indiana, so I'll
probably root for them. Other than that, I won't have any hard feelings about
that, James Madison beating us.  
  
Q. C.J., when exactly did you sprain your ankle, and how much did that limit
you?  
C.J. GARNER: I probably sprained my ankle after I got my first basket. I
didn't know if I was going to be able to go back out there, but of course I
did. I got it wrapped up.  
It was bothering me. I couldn't plant my foot the same way as I would
normally, and I wasn't able to be as explosive. It's no excuse, but it is what
it is. Injuries happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Jamal and C.J., thank you for your time. Congratulations on
your season.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Perri.  
  
Q. Can you put the season in perspective. You've been through a lot. There's
been a lot of drama, but you ended up winning a third straight conference
championship and getting to play in the tournament.  
COACH PERRI: Yeah, tough to talk about that right at this minute, but in
hindsight looking back, what an unbelievable accomplishment, unbelievable
accomplishment. All the things that happened, all the adversity that happened
throughout the year, September.  
And then in December when you lose Julian Boyd, who would have thought‑‑
nobody would have thought we'd have gotten to this point. Nobody talked about
it. Nobody talked about us.  
For what these two guys that were sitting next to me and the rest of the guys
in that locker room, what they did shows true character. The intestinal
fortitude that they showed through January, February, and into March was just
awesome. I was so proud of all of them, and I certainly love them all. They're
all going to be very successful because of it.  
  
Q. Jack, can you just talk a little bit about what C.J. and Jamal in
particular meant to this program?  
COACH PERRI: It's depressing thinking about the fact I'm not going to be able
to coach them again. They're both tremendous kids from tremendous families.
They had the one hiccup and made a mistake in September, but I think they
really grew from that mistake.  
As far as players, they just‑‑ they are the ultimate competitors, ultimate
competitors. When the stage was the brightest, you could count on them to give
everything they had, and nine times out of ten, they were going to get you
through it.  
They're special kids. They're special players. And they will be remembered
forever in our program. They're as good as they get.  
  
Q. Just the follow-up. Losing two guys like that, and I know you're losing
four starters, how do you ‑‑ you've had great success these last three years
with three NEC championships in a row. Is there any concern about being able
to maintain that once those guys are gone?   
COACH PERRI: Yeah, it's going to be difficult. Guys are going to have to step
into new roles. Hopefully, we get Julian Boyd back for a sixth year. That
would help. We still have one of the best point guards in the country.  
We'll keep recruiting and hopefully get good players, and hopefully we'll
continue with the success we've had. I think we've made unbelievable progress
the last few years, and hopefully we can continue that.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

La Salle  80  
Boise State  71

  
THE MODERATOR: We will start with an opening statement by Coach Giannini.
After that we'll open the floor for questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH GIANNINI: Obviously, we're ecstatic. We were able to beat a very good
team. 2 (Derrick Marks) and 3 (Anthony Drmic) were really a handful. They
played great. They were hard to stop. We couldn't put them away.  
I think the difference in the game was we had maybe four or five guards that
were playing at a high level, and certainly their whole roster played well,
but 2 and 3 played at a particularly high level.  
Again, we had four or five guys playing at a high level, and I think that was
the difference.  
  
Q. Ramon, can you just talk about what this win means to you personally.
You're a senior. And everything that has happened this year.  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It means a lot. It sums up the whole year. We worked hard to
get here. We're absolutely happy that we won because we're actually making a
statement.  
We just didn't get selected. We want to make a run, and we want to show
everybody that La Salle can play with the best teams in the country.  
  
Q. Tyrone, you had a pretty amazing game tonight. What was it like for you
out there? Seemed like most of your shots were going in.  
TYRONE GARLAND: It just was amazing, man. I just was feeding off my coach and
my teammates. They told me to be aggressive and keep shooting, and that's what
I was doing.  
Coach said to share the ball, and I was sharing the ball, and that's how we
got open shots.  
  
Q. Sam and Ramon, how easy is it for you guys to space the floor when Tyrone
is having the kind of game he is?  
SAM MILLS: We shared the ball, like Tyrone said. We shared the ball pretty
good. Coach G wants us to do that, and our guards were able to get open looks,
and we were hitting our shots today.  
  
Q. Ramon, could you please address the faith that you and Tyreek have in the
rest of your guard rotation? You guys have not only four good starting guards,
but you go Tyrone deep, and ordinarily he would start in a lot of programs. It
makes the difference tonight when those guys only missed four shots.  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It means a lot when you have Ty and Sam, Tyreek, and me,
because even the players on the bench, everybody plays a part. We're all a
team. Just having four guards that can go out for each other and play, it
makes the game a lot easier because you don't have to force a lot, and you
don't have to rush when you have players that can get you easy shots and you
can get your teammates easy shots.  
  
Q. After the first few minutes, you started to score, but it had been about
2 1/2 games almost before we saw the Ramon Galloway that led the team in
scoring, and these guys kind of picked up the slack. Can you address that?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: Coach G told me that I just have to be myself, don't force it.
The last two games, I felt as though I was forcing it because I wasn't getting
stuff going on offense.  
So Coach G, me and him had a meeting, and he just said relax and play your
game. Like you said, the beginning of the game, I wasn't forcing anything. I
was trying to get my teammates into the game. I was trying to help out the
game in other aspects, just not being the leading scorer because that's not
what it's about. It's about helping your team all around‑‑ assists, rebounds,
steals, and sometimes points.  
Eventually, it started to fall, and I was happy because I was in a slump. But
I just wanted my team to win, and I wanted to do it for my teammates and La
Salle.  
  
Q. Ramon, you guys have played small, three, four guards all year, but once
Steve went out, you had to play small for even longer stretches. Have you made
any adjustments since he went out, or is it kind of the same thing?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: The adjustment was that the guards have to get more rebounds.
Basically, you have a 7‑footer out, and you only have Jerrell down there, it's
going to be hard for him to grab every rebound.  
Boise State, that No.2, he crashes the boards, and No. 1‑‑ they just all play
hard. We just know that we have to help Jerrell rebound. It's not just on him,
and it's not just on Garvin. It's on the team when other teams grab rebounds.
They don't say Jerrell rebounded bad. They say La Salle.  
  
Q. Ramon, you guys shot 63 percent from the field. Considering the last two
games didn't go well, you weren't shooting well, do you think it's a little
bit of validation to show people what you guys can do?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It was a relief because we were kind of in a slump. We're at
our best when we can knock down shots and make shots and get up and down the
floor and play.  
Just for us to have this type of game and win, it relieves great pressure off
our chest because now we have even more confidence going into the next game.  
We know that every day is win or go home, and we want to be here. We want to
make a statement.  
  
Q. For Tyrone and Ramon, a lot of people are transferring college basketball
these days. It kind of stands out, this effort tonight, that you guys were
both transferred, and it seems to work out pretty much ideally. I mean, this
has to be the way that you imagined it when you decided to come to La Salle.
Is that accurate?  
TYRONE GARLAND: When I first transferred, Coach told me it could be like this
and we could do special things. So for me seeing it happen, and he's always
been a loyal guy, and I believe in his word, I wasn't even shocked when we
started winning games and making it to the tournament.  
This is what he told me was going to happen, and I just believe in this guy,
and I just thank him for giving me the opportunity to play.  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It was the same for me. The first day I was thinking about
transferring, I met Coach G, and he told me it's a two‑way street. All you got
to do is listen, and he's going to let you do what you do best.  
It's a blessing. I mean, I never thought that we'd be in the NCAA Tournament
playing and making a statement for La Salle, but here we are, and I'm happy as
can be because I've never been here. It's my last year. So it's every college
player's dream to be in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Ramon, as a Philadelphian and a La Salle guy now, can you address what
this means to the La Salle community, having not been in this position in more
than two decades and now not only having made the NCAA Tournament but having
won a game and looking to, like you said, make a run or make a statement?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It means a lot because it's going to bring our fans, and it's
going to bring our alumni back. When you're winning, alumnis and fans start to
feel good about the school.  
And when I seen that we had our own little section in there, it made us play
so much harder because we knew we had support. I probably didn't think it was
going to be that many people traveling to Ohio, but they were there, and they
proved me wrong.  
So we got to fight for them. We got to fight for the name on our chest.  
THE MODERATOR: Sam, Ramon, and Tyrone, thank you for your time. Good luck in
Kansas City.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Giannini.  
  
Q. John, what's your reaction to some of the things that Ty and Ramon have
just said?  
COACH GIANNINI: I'm just really proud of them, and I'm not surprised at all.
They're great kids. We don't have distractions. We have great chemistry. They
work hard. They listen.  
I'm emotional. Basketball's emotional. Sometimes they're emotional. And short
of a moment where we get a little excited, a moment later, we're on track and
trusting each other, and everyone doing their part.  
  
Q. John, Ramon mentioned the fans that traveled to the game tonight. I saw,
as you were walking off the court, you gave them a little wave. How was that
for you?  
COACH GIANNINI: It's great. It's great. I think everyone loves to be
appreciated, and our fans make us feel extremely appreciated. It's a great
feeling. We really do play for them as much as we play for ourselves.  
I know that sounds corny, but it's a great feeling. It's just a great feeling
to have people pull for you. It's a great feeling to see them excited and
happy and cheering. There's no better feeling in life than making other people
happy.  
To see our fans happy because of the effort that we put out is really
gratifying. It's a great thing. For any school, it's a great thing.  
  
Q. John, you've now made it to the NCAA Tournament as a head coach and won a
game as a head coach and had to sort of rebuild this program three times since
you've been there in a very short span of time. How satisfying is this moment
for you professionally and personally?  
COACH GIANNINI: It's really satisfying, but I don't want it to be satisfying
because satisfied competitors aren't as good as hungry ones.  
Again, the boardwalk on a fishing trip, I'll be probably more satisfied, but
right now we really want to get ready for Kansas State. Your point is well
taken. It's very important, but we're still playing. So it's not the time to
be satisfied. But at some point I definitely will.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how important Tyrone is to this team as the
sixth man off the bench?  
COACH GIANNINI: When you have guys off the bench that are good enough to start
at other places, you really have a chance to be really good. When you sub and
you don't drop off, you could be really good. And when you can bring a scorer
off the bench‑‑ so now one of your best scorers might be going against their
sub, and their sub might not be a starter‑level quality player.  
So it's huge. It's absolutely huge, yeah.  
  
Q. Can you, John, describe the way this team plays, in your own words, and
also for those of us who haven't seen them play and are used to seeing the Big
East style of basketball, do these guys seem to take a particular joy in the
way that they play the game?  
COACH GIANNINI: Yeah, we recruited to play this way, and, of course, we're
playing to our players' strengths. They're really quick. We played four guards
today that are outstanding, and 3 and 2 could play anywhere.  
We had a quickness advantage, and it was the difference in the game. Of
course, when you recruit quick kids, you want to keep the floor spread, and
you want to be aggressive off the dribble and teach them to space and share
the ball. And you want to work on their skill and make sure they can knock
down the open 3s that they're going to get. And that's how we play.  
  
Q. Program's first NCAA Tournament win since the heyday of the L ‑train.   
COACH GIANNINI: Who, by the way, Lionel Simmons was here. How awesome is that.
Third leading scorer in college basketball history, pretty cool. Pretty cool
to have him here.  
  
Q. Can you give some perspective on getting this win 23 years later, what it
means for the program, what it really dropped to and now back on the rise over
the last two decades?  
COACH GIANNINI: It's our anniversary of winning the National Championship, two
Final Fours, National Championship, NIT champions, three National Players of
the Year, second only to Duke and Ohio State. Pretty much NCAA or NIT
consistently '60s, '70s, '80s, early '90s. Many NBA players. I've gotten texts
from Tim Legler, Doug Overton, Rasual Butler.  
Unbelievable tradition here. I think people have tended to have forgotten what
a basketball power La Salle was for over four decades. So it's a big deal.
It's a big deal to re‑establish that. It's a big deal for people who attended
La Salle and love La Salle, who had great basketball, and certainly they've
longed for that.  
So it's big.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Giannini, thank you. Good luck in the second round.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

La Salle  80  
Boise State  71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by the head coach of Boise State, Leon
Rice, and also Anthony Drmic and Derrick Marks. We'll start with an opening
statement by Coach Rice before opening the floor for questions to our
student‑athletes.  
COACH RICE: When La Salle popped us for us to play them, we knew it was going
to be a huge challenge. We've played small all year and probably had an
advantage because of that. But with their guards and their quickness, they
play small too, and they were quicker than us.  
When they started making all those 3s, they became even quicker because you
got to close them out hard, and then they have the ability to go by. Garland's
the quickest player we've probably faced, I think, this year.  
They just created so many problems because, when they're shooting the ball
like that, they can drive a hard bargain at anybody.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Anthony, disappointed with the defensive effort, or was it maybe more so
because La Salle couldn't seem to miss much at all?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: I mean, you look at the stats, and offensively, we didn't shoot
the ball that bad. They had a hell of a night, credit to La Salle, but defense
is where it starts. I've always said that all year, and we didn't come to play
tonight defensively, I think.  
We just couldn't stop them driving and just weren't getting at the shooters.
So, yeah, not very happy with that effort today.  
  
Q. On the same token, Anthony, it did seem like one of your maybe better
games, at least offensively. In the second half, do you feel like maybe put a
little bit on your shoulders to try to get your team back into it?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: It doesn't matter when you don't play defense. If you're
scoring on one end and can't get stops on the other, it doesn't matter.  
I mean, I tried. We all tried. We just couldn't get it together defensively, I
feel.  
  
Q. Derrick, obviously, kind of a rough start for you. Just talk a little bit
about kind of what happened out there. Did seem like you were able to finally
put it together kind of late in the game.  
DERRICK MARKS: First half, we were just getting sped up, and then‑‑ and
myself, I fell into that as well.  
Then the second half I finally figured it out, I've got to slow down a little
bit, and I started to score a little bit more. So that's it.  
  
Q. Anthony, it seems like if you guys could just get to the locker room the
first half, you figured they'd have to cool down, but they just kind of kept
bringing it. Then you guys still found yourself at the free ‑throw line in a
6‑point game. It's kind of what happened last game, the games don't
necessarily go your way most of the game, but you guys still hang in there.
What is it about this team that allows you to do that?   
ANTHONY DRMIC: I mean, we just play hard and never give up. Like you said,
they shot incredible tonight. All credit to them. But, yeah, we always fight
and play hard till the very end no matter what. That's the trait of this team.  
  
Q. Maybe you shouldn't be surprised considering that, but were you maybe a
little surprised that you were looking at the scoreboard, and you guys are
down 6 and at the free ‑throw line, to be in that situation despite what they
were doing on the other end?   
ANTHONY DRMIC: No, I wasn't surprised. I knew we were going to come back at
the end because that's just what we do. We always play hard until the very
end. Unfortunately, we couldn't get enough key stops and enough shots to drop
at the end for us to come out with the win.  
We play hard. We play hard always. So credit to the boys.  
  
Q. Can you guys just sum up this season and what it's been like for you
guys. Ten underclassmen on this team, maybe some of us thought you were a year
ahead of schedule almost, but you still made the NCAA Tournament. You guys
don't really seem like sophomores anymore.  
ANTHONY DRMIC: Definitely. You can't use inexperience as an excuse. That only
goes so far. This year a lot of players have stepped up. We've been playing
well as a team and improving and getting all that experience that we need to
continue forward.  
We're going to lose a hell of a senior in Kenny Buckner, but we're just going
to keep fighting, keep improving, and next season bring it even harder.  
  
Q. Derrick, I'll kind of pose the same question to you. Obviously, as the
season continued to go on, it seemed like kind of more and more was put on
your shoulders as leaders, as scorers, as a distributor. How much do you feel
like you grew this season?  
DERRICK MARKS: Like Drmic said, we're not sophomores no more. We've just got
to come ready to play, and it's been a good season, and all we can do is work
hard this off‑season, and we're just going to come back here next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Anthony and Derrick, thank you for your time. Congratulations
on your season.  
Now we'll open the floor for questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. Coach, I know I posed this to Anthony a little bit, but your thoughts on
how you played defense tonight. I know it's tough to win when a team is able
to shoot as well as they were.  
COACH RICE: Like I said, when they started knocking those shots down and they
kind of gained their confidence. And then some possessions we even had some
pretty good‑‑ what I thought were good defensive possessions, and they hit
contested ones.  
They kind of just got on a roll, and it put way too much pressure on our
offense. No matter how good our offense was going to be, and it wasn't great,
but at times it was pretty decent, it just put way too much pressure on our
offense.  
Their quickness, like I said, when they get it going from 3 like that, their
quickness is really hard to guard. We don't really have a shot blocker in
there too to clean up the paint. So we have to come help and try to get charge
attempts, and those guys did a great job of finding the open guy, and then
they made their shots.  
A lot of credit goes to La Salle. Those guards in this tournament, like I said
before this game, the team that can get hot can really cause some people some
problems. If they play like that with their guards and the way they can spread
you, then if they're shooting it like that, boy, they're going to give some
people some trouble.  
  
Q. Coach, what you've seen of this team, of La Salle earlier this year, did
they shoot that well? Have you seen a team that shot that well?  
COACH RICE: Their numbers are good, and we knew they could shoot. They really
got it going. And then they just had that look of they were confident in their
shots.  
We didn't keep it close enough. It's easier to shoot when you've got a team at
arm's length, like they had us. If you could have tightened it down, maybe
those shots become a little harder to make. We just couldn't put enough
pressure on them to make it harder to make.  
We tried zoning them. We tried trapping them. We tried pressing them. They did
a nice job of just keeping their poise, and they kind of had an answer for
everything we did.  
  
Q. We've been talking about Galloway and Duren all week long, but the guys
that got it going early were ones you wouldn't really expect, in Mills and
Peterson got up there early too. How much more difficult does it make when
those guys get going as well?  
COACH RICE: When there's four of them out there‑‑ and, again, that's when
we're difficult to guard is when we're like that too. So I know their coach
said it a lot of times, how we're looking in the mirror a little bit.  
So whichever team could get it really rolling was the one that was going to
move on, and they did that. They had us a little bit flustered defensively. We
couldn't get a stop.  
But our guys kept battling, and that's what's great about them because you
look up, and you're right. You're at the free‑throw line down 6 after all of
that. So I was proud of them. We just couldn't make enough shots, couldn't
make enough free throws, and definitely did not get enough stops.  
  
Q. Coach, can you evaluate the season as a whole and what kind of stepping
stone it can be for this program.  
COACH RICE: That's a perfect question because really proud. I told the guys in
there, I'm really, really proud of them. The NCAA Tournament, one team can
stand on a win, and we know that. So it's always hard, and you're always going
to play a good team. We did tonight, no question. Well coached, really good
players, really hard to guard.  
So I told our guys this was a huge year for Boise State basketball. We were
really young, and they grew up in a hurry, and we competed in a great league,
finished fourth, tied for fourth with San Diego State, and accomplished so
many things, had so many great home wins, great road wins, did some amazing
things.  
So it's the start of our program. It's not‑‑ we lose the game tonight, it's
the not the end. We plan on doing everything we can to be back here. And these
experiences help you for the next time you're back here.  
So it's a huge stepping stone for us, and we know we've got to get better.
We've always known we're going to get better defensively. And that's a big
focus for us for next year.  
At times we've been really, really good offensively, but we have to keep
continuing to grow as a team, and where we can grow is our defense. And the
beauty of it is this will give these guys‑‑ they're competitors. They'll take
this in the off‑season, and they'll grow as players, they'll grow as
individuals, and as a team.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk just about the game that Anthony had. I know
obviously he was overshadowed a bit, but it did seem like he kind of took it
on himself to get you guys back in the game. I think 28 points.  
COACH RICE: You hit 28 points in an NCAA Tournament game, that's a great
effort. And 28 points on 17 shots, so that terrific.  
Like I said, he's one of the best competitors I've been around. He adjusted.
They were getting up into us, and he started taking it to the hole and getting
some and‑ones and getting to the free‑throw line, making some laps, and that
goes along with his five 3s that he made.  
So that's the thing you can hang your hat on, that Anthony Drmic is going to
compete for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe just kind of a question that we withheld until we found out
how far this ride would go. Talking with you earlier in the season, you talked
about building a program here. How much of a springboard can this whole entire
experience be? Maybe getting here a year earlier than we might have thought.  
COACH RICE: I think it's huge. Like I said, I'm so proud of our guys. The
season as a whole, what they had. It ends on a sour note a little bit. But
nobody's ever happy when they end the NCAA Tournament, no matter when it is.  
So over the course of the season, it was terrific. They were fun to watch.
They were great to coach. They were great to be around. They love each other.
And they're going to get better. I promise you that. They're going to continue
to get better.  
So it is. It's a huge springboard. We've got Taco Bell Arena is getting packed
now, great atmosphere. We know we're building a program.  
That's why we came here, and that's why these kids came here, and they're
really proud of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Rice, thank you for your time. Congratulations on your
season.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

James Madison  68  
LIU Brooklyn  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with on opening statement by Coach Brady. When he's
finished, we'll open the floor for questions for our student‑athletes.  
COACH BRADY: We are really excited to win a game in the NCAA Tournament. I'm
really proud of our kids' effort. There was a couple minute stretch there in
the second half where I thought we lost our poise and our composure just for a
small stretch and let them get the game right back to a one‑possession game.  
I thought the second half our kids played really strong. I said to our kids at
halftime that LIU, if you look at their box scores, they score about 30
percent more points in the second half almost every game this year than they
do in the first half. As I look at the box score, I'm pleased we held them to
50 percent less points in the second half.  
So it was a good defensive effort for our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. In the second half, C.J., he seemed to get a couple of buckets, and then
it seemed like your length frustrated him. How much of a factor did your size
play in the matchup?  
ANDRE NATION: I think it played a big factor. We knew he was stronger, so we
wanted to give him a little space and just beat him on length.  
  
Q. Andre, that team hadn't scored fewer than 58 points in a game all season.
They had 90 the last four games they played. What does this say about your
defense as a team and just the performance you guys have tonight?  
ANDRE NATION: Once we stick together, we're good defensively, we know that. So
just staying together as a team and playing team defense, we knew we were
going to get stops.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about Indiana, and what do you know about Friday's
matchup?  
ANDRE NATION: We know they got No. 1 seed. So we know we're about to play one
of the best teams in the country. They've got a big man, and they've got good
guards.  
They're Indiana. We know about them. We see them on the TV all the time. It's
not nothing new.  
A.J. DAVIS: We know they've got a good post and good wings. We've got to
contain them on defense. Coach has been stressing to us all year defense is
going to win games for us.  
He's going to draw up a game plan for us to get it done on defense.  
  
Q. A.J., did your role change at all tonight with Rayshawn out for the first
20 minutes? You picked up right where you left off, it seemed like, right
where you were in the last game?  
A.J. DAVIS: Coach said don't do anything outside of your character. Just be
humble and play your game. While Rayshawn was sitting out, a couple of guys
came off the bench and stepped up for us. So it was good until he came back in
for the second half.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, how important was it to set the tempo in the first
half? It seemed like at some points you almost aggravated them as a whole,
just passing the ball and stuff?  
A.J. DAVIS: Coach told us to be confident and take good shots on offense and
don't give out transition layups. That's what we did on offense, limit them to
one shot so they didn't run out on transition and get back on defense.  
ANDRE NATION: Like he said, Coach wants us to take good shots. I know I took a
couple of ill‑advised shots.  
We wanted to start on their tempo. We're a fast‑paced team too. They play
faster than us, so we knew if we could get them to play to our tempo, then we
were going to control the whole game, and I think we did a good job with that.  
  
Q. A.J., what was the key to slowing down Olasewere in the first half? I
know he ended up with 20, but the first half, turnovers and blocked shots
really held him down.  
A.J. DAVIS: It took all five guys on defense. We knew he was a good player.
Coach stressed it to us day in and day out, if we wanted to win this game, the
defensive game was going to do it for us. We had to be locked in.  
That's what it took for us, all five guys locked in on defense for us to win.  
  
Q. A.J., what's so different about the last 10, 11 games or so? Your numbers
are so different than basically the entire season?  
A.J. DAVIS: My teammates are finding me. Coach is drawing up good plays for
me. We're just playing confident within ourselves and playing within Coach's
system.  
THE MODERATOR: A.J. and Andre, thank you for your time. Good luck with
Indiana.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Brady.  
  
Q. Do you expect Andre to have the sort of impact as a freshman? I know he's
played on the biggest stage, and he contributed in all sorts of ways. Do you
expect this throughout the year?  
COACH BRADY: He's further along with his basketball IQ than I recognize, but
he's the athlete, and he's got the basketball ability that I recognize when we
started recruiting him. But his basketball intellect and his IQ is much higher
than I could have really speculated.  
He's becoming a really good teammate, and I think his shot selection is
improved. I think he can do more on offense, but he's willing to wait his turn
and just kind of be a role player. The defensive end, obviously, he's unique
for our team, and I think even for our league.  
  
Q. What is the psychology involved as a coach in preparing your team to face
a No. 1 seed like Indiana?  
COACH BRADY: We have some older guys. They're typically pretty unafraid of any
of the challenges we face. We played UCLA first game of the year on the road
in front of however many people. We played hard. They just seemed to make
every single shot, especially in the first half.  
So I think we can reference that game. We didn't play great. They played
great, I thought. They made a lot of shots. Now we have a neutral court.  
Obviously, I think Indiana is playing at an extraordinarily high level. I know
their team well. I know their personnel. I haven't looked at anything they do.
But for us, it's an opportunity to be in a game with the No. 1 seed in the
country, and we're excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, when Devon picked up his fourth with about eight minutes left, how
long were you going to go with him on the bench? How close were you going to
let it get?  
COACH BRADY: Devon Moore is a very cerebral defensive player. I was actually
surprised he picked up his fourth on the play that he picked it up. That was a
play where typically he'd let that guy‑‑ he'd challenge that shot in the air
with his length where he'd put his hands forward.  
We played games in his career with eight minutes to go and leave him in the
game, but we thought we had just enough cushion‑‑ we had a
three‑possession‑plus advantage at that point. We were going to leave him in
until it got to one or two possessions, and Ron Curry came in and did a nice
job.  
  
Q. With the kind of weird weekend you had of high and low, that might have
been traumatic for a lot of teams. Why wasn't it for your team?  
COACH BRADY: It's a great question. We've been through a lot of adversity in
my five years. We lost a lot of players. We lost‑‑ our best shooter is in
street clothes this year due to an injury. We didn't have him for the first
six games. We had him back for the next six. We went 5‑1, lost him for the
rest of the year.  
We've got two other guys, Andre Nation is playing with damage to his left
hand. Charles Cooke broke his hand. Gene Swindle, our backup center, is out
now. We've just played with a lot of adversity.  
I think at this level you can't really let it impact your team. You certainly
can't use it as an excuse. We've never done it. In my five years, we've had
five very different teams, and this is a very different team than last year.  
But this is a team that's playing well now, and we're not going to let them
use any excuses, no matter the course or circumstances.  
  
Q. With Rayshawn on the bench, what did you think of your team's performance
in the first half, and what was different in the second half?  
COACH BRADY: We played a lot without Rayshawn for a number of reasons. One, he
was injured. He missed a game and won a game without him and went small. We
certainly don't want to do that in two days' time. We're not going to be able
to play very small.  
We'll go with a different lineup probably the next game because we'll have to
have some size on the floor or we'll get crushed on the glass. Now we're going
to play some front‑court guys more than we did today.  
There are games we played without Rayshawn when we needed to go offense to
defense. I thought Rayshawn rushed a couple of shots on the rim today, but I'm
glad he got in the game.  
What I'll say about Rayshawn is he's as nice a young fella as I've ever
coached, and I've done this for 20 years. I think he feels remorseful and
feels he let his teammates down. He apologized to his teammates the other day,
and we all felt somber about the situation.  
He's a terrific kid from a very disadvantaged background. He made one mistake,
and we're trying to move on.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what this first NCAA win means to you.  
COACH BRADY: Well, it's significant. There's no escaping that. I think it's
great for all head coaches when they have an opportunity to do it and your
first chance. Some of the greats of the game have been in the NCAA Tournament
and have struck out for a few years at a time.  
That really says more about this team than it does me. I think these seniors
really wanted the opportunity to win a game for our program, and I feel great
for our kids.  
As I said to our kids before we went to CAA Tournament last weekend, this is
the experience of a lifetime we'll never forget, and Friday will be the most
significant experience that any of them will ever have. So we're going to hope
we play great.  
  
Q. You mentioned using size. Is Gene going to be available for Friday?  
COACH BRADY: No. Gene Swindle is out.  
  
Q. What's he out with?  
COACH BRADY: He has a partial torn meniscus, we think. He didn't practice
today.  
  
Q. The other thing is you guys being here since Monday, how much do you
think that helps you against Indiana? Do you feel like you need to play almost
a perfect game?  
COACH BRADY: I'm hoping they haven't arrived in town just yet and they get
here right before the game starts.  
I don't know that we have any advantages. I think the only advantage we have
is we just played a game in the NCAA Tournament. I was an assistant at St.
Joe's. We were the No. 1 seed in the country in 2004. Every basketball player
and every coach has jitters when the ball gets thrown up until it becomes a
game.  
We have to hope we can get past those jitters a little bit to make it
competitive and stay in the game for the duration.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Charles Cooke a little bit. Didn't score in three of
the last four games. Goes off for 15 tonight.  
COACH BRADY: He's a talented young guy. We knew when we recruited him he's a
guy with a lot of potential. He's got great confidence in his game. He had 15
in previous games this year on six shots.  
He's a long terrific kid who truly just learned how to play. There's times
when I think he's going to be the best freshman of the group. We play four a
lot. Charles comes from a great basketball program. He played against some of
the best players in the country in AAU basketball. He's obviously also not
scared out there.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

North Carolina A&T  73  
Liberty  72

  
THE MODERATOR: I'm joined by the head coach of Liberty, Dale Layer, as well as
student‑athletes, Davon Marshall, Tavares Speaks, and John Caleb Sanders.  
COACH LAYER: I thought it was an exciting game. Two teams play their hearts
out. I'm proud of my team. They could have quit several times. We kept
battling back. Just proud of these guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For John Caleb, last play, what did you see? What happened as you were
going coast to coast?  
JOHN CALEB SANDERS: We've had a lot of late‑game situations similar to that,
and Coach has always said take it to the rim. So they took away my right hand,
so I went left and tried to get to the basket, and it just didn't fall for me.  
  
Q. For John Caleb, was there contact on the play? Did you think you got hit
for a foul?  
JOHN CALEB SANDERS: I don't know. I mean, I thought the refs did a great job.
Obviously, didn't think the last one was. Hard to tell when you're in the
midst of a game. They didn't call it. So it wasn't a foul.  
  
Q. Davon, you and Jeremy butted heads pretty good in the second half. He
said he was just trying to alter your game. What were you trying to do to his
game?  
DAVON MARSHALL: I was trying to pressure to get the offense out of rhythm. He
did a great job of getting angles on me and getting to the basket and getting
some tough shots on me.  
  
Q. Just looking at it again, you guys have had kind of a great year. You
broke Seth Curry's 3 ‑point record tonight. I'm not sure if you knew that.
Just looking back at this evening‑‑ I know it didn't end the way you wanted it
to, but there were teams playing in the NIT tonight that wish they were in
your position. Just talk about the season, the ups, the downs.   
DAVON MARSHALL: The season started out bad for us, 0‑8\. We were struggling a
lot with injuries and everything. We overcame that. We kept fighting every day
in practice. We kept praying, kept working hard, kept believing in Coach, what
he was telling us.  
I'm just proud of my teammates that we made it this far and fought this hard.  
JOHN CALEB SANDERS: We came this far, and it hurts to go down like that. When
it comes down to the end of the year, one team is going to lose. Like Coach
said, I'm proud of Trap (Antwan Burrus) and Davon and all the guys in the
locker room. I'm sorry for Trap. I wanted to make that shot for him, prolong
his senior year so we can go down to Louisville, and that's tough.  
Again, I'm just so proud of Coach and how he handled this whole season with
all the adversity and all the players for sticking to it.  
  
Q. For Davon, when you guys are in the midst of a game like this, I think at
one time, the two teams ‑‑ you guys made nine straight shots at one point
there in the second half. It's just going back and forth. Are you just simply
in the moment, or do you realize how well both teams are playing at that time?
  
DAVON MARSHALL: I think it's just us being in the moment. We see them score,
so we come back down and score. It's just going back and forth, and we're
basically just feeding off of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Davon, Tavares, and John Caleb, thank you for your time.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Layer.  
  
Q. What can you take away from this?  
COACH LAYER: Just proud to be around these guys every day. A lot of grown men
would not have endured what they did. A lot of well‑meaning grown men would
not have handled what they handled.  
No regrets. Very proud of them. I've been around college basketball since
1976, as a player, as a coach, and I've never experienced a year like this.
The depths of this year were the most in those 37 years. And when guys
overcome what they have overcome as 18‑, 20‑year‑old kids, wow, I'll take
that. We were tested. We were tested.  
You don't know how you're tested until you're in a locker room with those
kids. They were tested. I was tested. But I think these guys' character has
come through like gold. I'm proud of them. Fight with them every day.  
  
Q. Davon hit the 3 ‑pointer with three minutes to go to bring it within 1.
Why did you decide to go with a time‑out at that time?   
COACH LAYER: We were wore out. We were wore out. I thought that we were worn
out. The conference tournament took a lot out of us, and I don't think we had
spring in our step defensively, and I think our guys tried to dig down and get
everything that they had, and I don't think there was a lot there.  
So I tried to use more‑‑ the first time‑out in the second half was an extended
time. I thought we could get three time‑outs there back to back to back. We
had not used the under 16 media. My 30 became a full, and we were going to get
an under 12 media. So I thought three straight 40‑second time‑outs would give
us more juice, because we were tired.  
  
Q. Can you speak to ‑‑ you're going to have four of these starters back.
You're going to have Burrus back. What are you going to take from this
experience going forward?   
COACH LAYER: It's a wonderful experience, not just because we're at the NCAA
Tournament. It's a big part of it. But the experience of what we did as people
together was awesome. Growth, maturity. Antwan Burrus had the best attitude of
anybody all year. Proud of him.  
You don't think that dude would have wanted to play in the NCAA Tournament and
been our best player? We missed him. He plays two out of three days now. He's
not 100 percent, but he's our best player now.  
We've got to‑‑ I think this certainly is a shot in the arm for our program,
but it's a shot in the arm for our people in this program, which is way more
important. Our men, who are growing up. It's just cool to be a part of, and
this was certainly something they've all dreamed about.  
When you come to these, as a media person or as a fan, you don't know what
these guys' hearts are like. This is a dream come true. This is what they
dream about every day when they're shooting shots and getting up extra lifts
and coming to the gym at midnight and asking a coach to rebound for them and
asking a girlfriend to rebound for them. This is for their moment. This is
what it's all about.  
To see these guys experience that, ain't nothing better than that as a coach,
and that's‑‑ so I think it has been seared in our hearts, me more than
anybody, but these guys to see this experience and know that it isn't somebody
telling them that it's cool to go to the NCAA Tournament. They know that now.  
And I think that will permeate through our team and probably their families
and people they touch the rest of their lives.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Congratulations on your season.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to be joined by the La Salle student‑athletes, Sam
Mills, Tyreek Duren, and Ramon Galloway.  
  
Q. Ramon, I'll start with you. Can you just talk about knowing that you're
not going to have Zack for these games this week, how much is that affecting
what you guys are doing? How worried are you about the rebounding with him not
out there?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: It means a lot not having Zack on the court. That means that
Jerrell has to play more minutes. It's good that he plays more minutes because
he's a good player.  
We've just got to bounce back and box out, and the guards got to pick up from
where Zack left off.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, what have you seen from Boise State as you prepare
for them? Is their style sort of similar to yours?  
TYREEK DUREN: We know that they play four guards sometimes, maybe five, just
like us, and pretty much they shoot a lot of 3s. That's all we've been really
talking about is it's probably going to come down to one‑on‑one battles.  
  
Q. This is being kind of billed as an offensive game, but, Sam, you've kind
of been a defensive stopper. Talk about that, your role this year, and kind of
how you enjoy that role.  
SAM MILLS: Each game you always want to come out with a defensive presence
because, as I'm bringing a defensive presence, that kind of like backfires for
our team as a whole.  
I think, as long as I bring that presence for our team, then our whole team
will bring the same.  
  
Q. Can you guys address what this appearance means for not just your program
but the people who have supported your program in this two ‑decade‑long
drought from the NCAA Tournament.   
RAMON GALLOWAY: It means a lot. I think it's 21 years since we made an NCAA
appearance, but as far as us, we've been working for a year, and we worked
hard. Since summertime, we've been in the gym working out.  
It's a blessing that we have great fans and we have good alumni that support
us. We just‑‑ getting to the NCAA shows our support back to our school and our
fans.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
TYREEK DUREN: I think it's a big thing also especially because it's been so
long since we've been to the tournament. Our biggest thing is to focus on this
year. We didn't want to look at the history of it, just focus on this year,
especially since we came up short last year. We just want to make sure we
didn't come up short of our goal this year.  
As far as the La Salle community, I think it's very big for them since they
finally get to see La Salle back in the tournament.  
  
Q. Last year you had a good season, went to the NIT. Why are you guys better
this year?  
SAM MILLS: I think this year, because the last year we weren't like pleased
with‑‑ like we weren't pleased with the NIT, but the main goal was to get into
the NCAA Tournament, and I think this year we worked even harder, and we had
to go since summer.  
Day in, day out, we've been working at it towards that goal. For my teammates
overall, we've been putting in hard work each day, day in, day out. So I think
that was the main thing.  
  
Q. Is there something you guys are doing this year that you didn't do last
year? Are you better at certain things?  
SAM MILLS: This year we're even hungrier on the defensive side. I think
offense is going to go in, and it's going to be off and on. So our defense, as
long as it stays consistent, I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Tyreek, Sunday was kind of tense. You guys had to wait until the end. You
all seemed pretty relieved. What's it been like since Sunday for you guys?
What was the reaction on campus, reaction for friends and family? What was it
like?  
TYREEK DUREN: It was a good reaction from everybody, especially when I walked
in class, they gave me a standing ovation. My teacher was happy. Every class I
went to they were saying how excited they were to finally have La Salle back
in the tournament.  
As far as our team, I think we celebrated on Sunday, then Monday it was right
back to work. Coach was going over the scouting report and preparing us very
well.  
I think we've got to come out Wednesday ready to play and continue to make a
run at the tournament.  
  
Q. What was the class?  
TYREEK DUREN: I had a business finance class.  
  
Q. Ramon, we just heard Tyreek talk about kind of getting the celebration
out of the way. What has you convinced this team is not just going to be
satisfied with getting into the tournament, after all that anxiety and all
that angst, and be able to focus on doing what needs to be done against Boise
State?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: The hunger. Like Sam said, last year we made it to the NIT,
and after that, we've been hungry to make a step forward. Making this
appearance in the NCAA Tournament is a big step.  
So just pushing ourselves. We're different from last year because we worked
harder. We have more confidence. Knowing that we went to the NIT and we can
play with teams that's being named in the country as big programs, and you
have us, La Salle, we're just trying to make a name for ourself. We grind
hard, and we came from the bottom.  
So just our work ethic.  
  
Q. Ramon, can you talk about what the guards have to do to help out without
Zack? Is John asking you guys to maybe hang around the rim a little bit more
to help with the rebound?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: Of course, but that's been Coach G's goal for the whole
season. He's always been telling us we had to gain the rebound.  
Being without Zack, we just have to gain the rebound even more. He just put
emphasis on that. We don't have our 7‑footer in the paint anymore. Ramon, you
got to get six rebounds. Tyreek, you probably got to get five. Sam, we just
got to get in there and bang.  
  
Q. Tyreek, two questions. One, were you even alive the last time La Salle
made the NCAA Tournament?  
TYREEK DUREN: No. I think that was the year I was born actually.  
  
Q. Also, you said you guys didn't try to focus on the history of it and
stuff like that, but maybe since you got that bid, have you been able to
reflect on it or have people tell you how long it had been and what it means
to some of the people around you?  
TYREEK DUREN: To be honest, people have been telling us how long it's been for
a while. I didn't really want to focus on it. Like I said, we wanted to take
it one game at a time. We didn't really want to look back at the history.  
Just the fact it was so long ago, you've got to feel good about that. You're
finally getting the program back to that stage, back to a spot where they
haven't been in so long.  
  
Q. Ramon, what are you seeing from Derrick Marks in your scouting reports, a
guy that can sort of take over games in the second half?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: I don't know his name. What number is he?  
  
Q. 2.  
RAMON GALLOWAY: I think that's the guard. We just know that he drives and
three of the shooters. All the guys shoot the ball well, but the kid from
Australia can really shoot the ball. And No. 2 drives the ball a lot. He's
such a strong guard.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to play is such a short turnaround, in terms of the
scouting report?  
RAMON GALLOWAY: Coach G don't really focus on the scouting report. As long as
we focus on the game and stay true to ourselves, it should be good.  
It falls into our hands with the quick turnaround because they play just like
us. It's not like we've got to play a Princeton that runs 30 plays. It's going
to be a game, like Tyreek said, of individual battles and kind of like running
them off the 3.  
  
Q. Tyreek, I don't know ‑‑ you look at Marks, No.2, and his last game
against San Diego State certainly wasn't the best. When you know a guy can
score and you look at their last game which maybe wasn't the best, do you
become more aware of a guy in thinking they're going to get back to that
level?   
TYREEK DUREN: I think you've got to prepare as if he can go off at any given
moment. You don't tend to focus on his bad games. You try to look at his good
games to find out what he can do, what he likes to do.  
So we're not really paying attention to the bad games. The game that he scores
30 is the game we're going to pay attention to so we can see his whole
arsenal, what he can do, if he likes to shoot, if he can go to the basket.
That's what we're going to focus on. We know that he can score, and we're just
going to try to shut that down.  
THE MODERATOR: Sam, Tyreek, and Ramon, thank you for your time.  
Right now we're being joined by the head coach of the La Salle Explorers, Dr.
John Giannini.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement.  
COACH GIANNINI: We're thrilled to be here. This is one of the greatest events
in all of sports. It's the goal of every team and player and coach to have a
chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. So we're thrilled with that.  
Our opponent is not only outstanding, but they're very similar to ourselves. I
can't remember another game I've coached in where I was surprised at the high
level of similarity. They play four guards. They can all dribble, pass, and
shoot. They're big guys but are tough and play down low and set screens. It's
the way we play.  
So I think you'll see two evenly matched teams, and it should be a great game.
Whoever does things better that night should get the win.  
  
Q. John, when you're preparing for a team that's sort of similar to you, is
that a benefit, or can it sometimes be detrimental because you're looking at a
mirror image?  
COACH GIANNINI: I think it's easier because you definitely are comfortable
with what you're seeing because you've gone against it in practice all the
time. So I think it's easier.  
Time will tell, in hindsight after the game, whether it was harder or not to
win the game. But the preparation, I think, is easier.  
  
Q. John, what concerns you the most about Boise State? What do you guys have
to do?  
COACH GIANNINI: Just I'm sure they feel the same way about us, their guards.
They have multiple guards. They have four guys out there that can shoot the 3.
And the thing about 3‑point shooting is it can change the game dramatically.  
For example, we're playing Butler in our last game and it's a 6‑point game,
and we're at the free‑throw line shooting 1 and 1 feeling good because we're a
good free‑throw shooting team. We're saying, okay, it's a 4‑point game with
5:30 left. Sure enough, we miss the front end of the 1 and 1, and they go down
and shoot a 3, and all of a sudden it's a 9‑point game.  
That 3‑point shot is a difference maker. I just watched one of their tapes.
They played UNLV in a great game on the road, and they made thirteen 3s and
had a great chance to win at the end. So when you're playing teams that are
perimeter oriented and guard oriented, of course you're worried about their
shooting.  
  
Q. You guys have sort of spread your scoring out this year, four guys
averaging 10 points a game. How important is that disparity when one guy has
an off night?  
COACH GIANNINI: I think it should minimize that factor because you do have a
number of scorers. I mean, Ramon didn't have a good game in the last game, and
simply because he tried too hard. But we don't feel like we rely on any one
person to score. We never talk about scoring. We talk about sharing the ball.
We talk about taking what the defense gives us.  
So we don't worry about one person scoring or not scoring for us.  
  
Q. John, you guys haven't had Zack for a couple of games now. Are you guys
‑‑ do you feel like they're starting to acclimate to not having him around?
How does it change the way you rotate your players without him?   
COACH GIANNINI: We're less‑‑ obviously, we're smaller, and we're less deep
without him. But the good news is that we already had one of the top big men
in the Atlantic 10 before Steve got hurt. We were already deep before Steve
got hurt.  
So we can still put a talented lineup out there. It just means that Jerrell
Wright has to play more, which frankly, if I was an opposing coach, I might be
more concerned about because Jerrell's really good.  
So it affects our depth. If Jerrell gets a couple of fouls, we'll probably
leave him in there. Jerrell Wright just has to play more. We'll be fine as
long as we can get the minutes we need out of Jerrell.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the styles of the teams are very similar. If you
look at the individuals, are there similarities between some of your guys and
some of the Boise State guys?  
COACH GIANNINI: Absolutely. Again, they're guards. Guards will have subtle
differences, for example. We talk about numbers more than we talk about names.
It's easier to look at the guy's number out there than worry about pronouncing
his name correctly. 2 is a little more physical than some of our guys. 3 is
obviously at 6'6" a little bit bigger.  
But at the end of the day, you're talking about guys that can dribble, pass,
and shoot, and you've got to defend those guys the same way. You can't say
that, okay, 2 posts up, but don't worry about his 3‑point shot, because he can
shoot it. And he can go by you. He's a complete player. And so is 3 and so are
their other guards. But so are our guys.  
Like I said, I've been really fortunate. I've coached in a lot of basketball
games. I only know this because my SID pointed out this year that I think our
Bucknell game was my 700th game, so now that's on my mind. Wow, that's a lot.
Through that span, I don't remember a team being as similar to mine as this
one is.  
  
Q. You mentioned Steve being out, the effect it has on your rebounding. I
know some of the guys talked about team rebounding being such a key for you
this year. How much of an effect does him not being there have on that aspect
of your game?  
COACH GIANNINI: We either play with two bigs or one big. And against bigger
teams, we play Steve and Jerrell together. I like our team much better with
Steve, and we're certainly a better rebounding game when we have two guys out
there.  
But we play with four guards a lot. We played our whole last season with four
guards and one big guy. In some ways it's almost more comfortable to us.  
Here's the thing. You could probably count on three fingers or less the number
of teams that are good at everything. Maybe no fingers. Okay, we're not a
super rebounding team, but we force turnovers. We're high in assists. We shoot
the ball well. We make our free throws.  
So there's a lot of positives. It's just hard to be good at everything. It's
hard to be big, skilled, pass, shoot. St. Louis might be a little bit like
that actually right now, but not many teams are.  
We know we're not a great rebounding team. We know we're a little small. But
we'll scrap. We'll fight. I think everything else this team does is at a high
level.  
  
Q. Just want to go back to when you took over the program. It was obviously
a really difficult time for the university, dealing with a scandal, trying to
piece the team back together. What was it like for you? How difficult was it?
What were the challenges? Was there ever a period where you thought maybe this
is tougher than I thought?  
COACH GIANNINI: My first thought at the University of Maine was a rebuilding
thing too, and it was unbelievably good preparation for me. So I'd been
through it before.  
I think building a program is underestimated wherever you are. I don't know
Boise State's recent history, but I'm sure that they had to build it up. It's
hard to tell people, to sell them on a vision that you could be good because
they can't see it. It's easier to say we are good.  
For example, right now in recruiting we could tell people, hey, if you come
here, we're one of the best teams in the A‑10\. We're as good as anyone in
Philadelphia. You can come here. We play through our guards. People can see
what you're talking about.  
But when you don't have that advantage, it's hard. You got to make‑‑ you got
to get players. You've got to make a lot of good decisions. You have to build
a culture. You have to eventually start to win against good teams.  
So what I'm getting at is, yes, it's hard, but I'm not sure it's harder than
it was anywhere else where they have to build.  
  
Q. John, as it relates to Ramon, is there a delicate balance between telling
him don't do too much and harnessing his aggressiveness?  
COACH GIANNINI: Absolutely, yeah. That's a great point. And what we're telling
him right now is you don't have to carry us. You don't have to win the game.
We have to win the game. You don't have to do it alone. You have to do what
you normally do, and let's just look at what Ramon normally does.  
His normal game puts him as a First Team All‑Atlantic 10 player. His normal
game puts him as a potential NBA prospect. His normal game fills up the stat
sheet. So we don't need him to have the game of his life. We just need him to
do what he normally does, which is awfully good.  
But it's natural when you're highly motivated and you're a senior. You want to
play your best. And that could lead to a little bit of pressure and a little
bit of forcing. And we just need Ramon to play the way he normally does, which
is awfully good.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, John. Thank you for your time. Good luck tomorrow
night.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by Boise State student‑athletes Anthony
Drmic, Jeff Elorriaga, and Derrick Marks.  
  
Q. Anthony, now that you guys are finally here, what's kind of the feeling
like? And what's kind of the last couple of hours been like for you guys?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: It's a little crazy. It's a little overwhelming, just coming in
here and just the experience of it all. I think the boys are ready to go, and
we're as excited to get out on the court tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Speaking of excited to get on the court, Derrick, obviously, you're kind
of looking back at your last game, and I'm sure you're fired up. How anxious
are you to get back out there tomorrow night?  
DERRICK MARKS: I'm always excited to play. It just feels like another game
except for it's on a bigger stage. So we just got to come ready to play.  
  
Q. Jeff, a question for you. Why is this team here this year? I mean as far
as you had a good season last year. Why is this team better last year?  
JEFF ELORRIAGA: Just guys kind of stepping up. Last year we didn't really
close any games out. Compared to this year, we started finishing some games.
We got a few good road wins and just took care of business at home. I think we
were 13‑1\. That helps your resume quite a bit.  
So just started playing good basketball towards the end of the year as well.  
  
Q. Jeff, can you talk about what you see out of La Salle, particularly
No.55, Ramon Galloway?  
JEFF ELORRIAGA: They're going to be tough to guard. From what we're told,
they're going to play tough basketball. They get in there and pressure you.
Offensively, they've got a lot of guys that can get in there and score.
Galloway seems like a heck of a player.  
We're going to have our hands full with them. They seem like a great team to
play.  
  
Q. Jeff, can you just talk about what something that the coach from La Salle
said, Dr. John Giannini, he said he thought you guys were a mirror image of
his team. How much do you see of yourselves in them and vice versa when you
look at film of them?  
JEFF ELORRIAGA: They play four guards. It seems like they want to get up and
down. They score quite a bit of points, and we score quite a few as well.  
I think they're a little more athletic, so we're going to have to deal with
that. They get up and down. A lot of guys can score. They're going to be tough
to guard, hopefully just as tough as we are. They play hard, just as hard as
we do.  
  
Q. Talking to you guys after that game on Wednesday, I know Derrick said
it's just another game, but how fired up are you guys? Maybe you can even
sense it from him, but just in terms of kind of thinking about that last game,
just thinking about how fired up you guys are.  
ANTHONY DRMIC: Definitely. But like Derrick said, it's just another game, but
on a bigger platform. As always we're going to come ready to play. Yeah, just
come ready to play.  
  
Q. Derrick, what does it mean for you guys to be able to be in this
situation, not just in the tournament, but as an at ‑large team? Boise State
five previous times had to do it as a conference champion, but to be in the
situation where you guys are recognized for what you did, not necessarily
having to win a tournament to get here.   
DERRICK MARKS: It's a big deal. It's the first time in school history that
it's happened. It's something special we've got going on. We've just got to do
whatever we got to do to just keep it going.  
  
Q. Derrick, do you guys feel a need to validate the Mountain West getting
five bids? Do you guys also ‑‑ you're playing La Salle, but you're also
representing your conference. Do you guys feel that way?   
DERRICK MARKS: The Mountain West is a very competitive conference, so I'm not
surprised that we got five teams in. Like I said, we've just got to keep it
going.  
  
Q. Anthony, I notice as a team you shoot 39 percent from 3. How big is the 3
‑pointer as part of your offensive arsenal? How important is it for this team?
  
ANTHONY DRMIC: We definitely have a lot of shooters, 1 through 4, 1 through 5
even. It's definitely one of the strengths we look to go to. When we get
offensive rebounds and kick it out for 3. It's definitely one of our
strengths, I'd say.  
  
Q. Derrick, what's going to be the most difficult thing about defending
them?  
DERRICK MARKS: They're a quick team, and they play similar to us. I mean, we
guard it every day in practice, but it's a different team. We haven't played
them before, so it's going to be tough to guard them.  
  
Q. Anthony, honest answer. How much did you know about La Salle before
Sunday?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: I actually did watch them play Butler one time. So I knew a
little bit, but it's all new teams now, you know what I mean.  
It's going to be just a great game to play and watch. It's going to be
exciting.  
  
Q. For anybody up there, in the preseason before conference, you know who
you're going to be playing, and you have some time to look at the schedule.
Conference, of course you know. How is it different going into playing a game
against a team that you have two, maybe three days to even know who you're
going to be playing?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: It's definitely a bit different. I mean, usually you have a lot
more time to scout teams and all that sort of thing. But it's basketball. You
just have to go out there and be ready to play whoever it is.  
Like I said, we're excited to get out there, and hopefully we can put up a
good game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anthony, Jeff, and Derrick, thank you for your time. Good luck
tomorrow night.  
We're now being joined by the head coach of Boise State, Leon Rice.  
COACH RICE: We're just really excited to be here. We played in the Mountain
West Conference Tournament and lost to San Diego State, and it was a long
drawn out bubble process to get here. So our guys couldn't be more thrilled to
be playing here in Dayton.  
We know it's going to be a great game. We've got two teams that really, really
match up in a unique way, where two teams are really, really similar.  
Like I said, we're extremely excited to be here.  
  
Q. In your previous coaching position, you had a lot of postseason success.
What are you telling the guys on your team about how to handle a big stage
like this?  
COACH RICE: That's a great question. The biggest thing is, the first and
foremost, I want them to be eyes wide open, enjoy it, enjoy the whole
situation of being in the NCAA Tournament. It's the greatest sporting event on
the planet, in my estimation.  
So I want them to come in and just play loose, play guns ablazing, just really
enjoy themselves and enjoy each other because they've earned this opportunity.  
They'll be focused on the game, obviously. They're excited to play, like I
said, but they have to understand where they are. I always tell them I want
them to see the forest for the trees. I want them to look around and feel the
whole thing and experience it.  
So when they do that, they'll really take it in and take it in together as a
team. Because we're a young team. And I want them to get used to playing in
this thing. We have ten freshmen and sophomores. The more you play in it, the
better off and more comfortable you are.  
  
Q. Coach, after last week's game, Derrick, you seemed pretty ‑‑ maybe a
little bit bothered by his performance. I know you tried not to let it show
too much. How have you seen him the last couple of days? I know he says
tomorrow night is just another game for him, but you think maybe he's a little
more fired up?   
COACH RICE: I think those guys, they're competitors. You talk about Derrick
and Anthony and our two leading scorers, they're competitors. That's probably
their best attribute. So it eats at those guys when they don't play as good as
they think they can play.  
When we lost to San Diego State, they wanted to hurry up and get back on the
court. I think that's another reason why this meant so much to be able to get
in and get this opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach Giannini was talking a little bit about how similar you were. I
know that's what you said in the opening statement too. What are some of the
similarities and parallels you see in them?  
COACH RICE: First, both teams are really, really reliant on all our guards. We
play a lot of guards. We play four at a time. In our last game, we played five
guards. They're very similar that way. They move the ball well. They shoot the
3.  
The thing that maybe they‑‑ they're probably a little more athletic than we
are. They get up into the ball pretty hard. They guard switch 1 through 4. So
a lot of the similar things that we do.  
In fact, there's not that many teams that play that small like both of us, and
both of us have had success with it.  
  
Q. Forgive me for not knowing a lot about your program. You have two players
from Australia, one from Serbia, one from Latvia. Can you talk about the
connections that allowed you to get those guys to come to Boise, Idaho.  
COACH RICE: I came from Gonzaga, and I was there for 11 years, and you look at
how maybe we broke through a little bit, getting some guys that were maybe a
little bit under the radar or undervalued, where they were off the beaten path
a little bit. And that was a big part of what we did at Gonzaga. We operated
with really great Northwest kids, and then we went out across the globe and
recruited some pieces to the puzzle, and it helped us break through
talent‑wise.  
If you look at what they're doing there still, now they've got a ton of
foreigners. So John Rillie, Jeff Linder, Dave Wojcik, they've done a great job
of scouring the world. When I got there, there was seven seniors. We brought
in 11 new guys that first year, so we had to look everywhere.  
We're in Boise, Idaho; we've got to go all over the place to find them. Which
is a credit to our football program in the fact that, when we did go places,
people knew who we were. We go into Chicago, and Derrick Marks knew who Boise
State was because of the football program and the national attention that
they've received. It wasn't like where is Boise? Who's that? I think it
really, really benefited us to have that national name.  
  
Q. Coach, when you get to these tournament games, so many times matchups are
contrasting styles and whoever gets their style of play usually benefits. When
you have two teams that are very, very similar, what's going to decide this
one?  
COACH RICE: I think with this one, it's maybe who can play to their strengths
and who can play the best on that night when you have two similar teams. They
are going to present some problems for us defensively, and hopefully we can
present some problems for them.  
So it's who can execute, who can kind of have their will to get it done over
40 minutes because, like you said, they're really similar in a lot of ways.  
But there are some subtle differences that we need to exploit and not let them
exploit the ones on us.  
  
Q. Coach, I think I've been getting more questions recently about your team
than the football team, and they're having spring practice. Just want to know
what that means to you to be in that situation, probably the first time that's
ever happened.  
COACH RICE: The football program was a big reason I took the job at Boise
State. When I was at Gonzaga, I had some opportunities. I was fortunate to be
in a great spot. But when Boise State opened up, I was really attracted to it
because of what they've done in football. The proof was in the pudding that
they knew how to do things there, and they've done it at a high, high national
level.  
A lot of people can talk about it and it‑‑ it never gets done if it's just the
commitment from the head coach or the staff. You have to have the
administration on board. You have to have the fans that are there. In our last
games, we've got over 10,000 fans every game. Now we have a home‑court
advantage. All those things have to be in place, the facilities.  
You can't just come in and wave a magic wand and get it done if you want to
build something. You might be able to build a team, but you can't build a
program if you don't have all that. And I saw that with this football program.
They've been awesome to us too. Coach Pete, from the moment I got there, one
of the things‑‑ he said, I'm so excited to get a Gonzaga guy down here. I've
been wanting to pick you guys' brains about some of the things you do. Whoa,
whoa, you're 51‑3\. You don't need to be picking my brain on anything.  
They've been just great. I've had him speak to our team. Visit with those guys
all the time on how they've done it, and learned a lot from them. So it's been
for me, professionally and personally‑‑ I've just enjoyed the heck out of it.
There's nothing better than a Saturday in Boise on college football when we're
not playing and I can enjoy them.  
  
Q. Have you heard from Pete?  
COACH RICE: Yeah, he sent a great text. Those guys have been so supportive of
us.  
  
Q. Coach, in your scouting, could I get your evaluation of La Salle's point
guard, No.3, Tyreek Duren?  
COACH RICE: He's a terrific, terrific on‑ball defender. He can create a lot of
problems for you if you're lazy with the ball, if you're not handling it. If
you get sloppy for a second, he'll make you play. He can really score.  
That's the thing about them. They've got so many weapons and so many ways to
score that you can't just dial into one thing and try to stop one guy. That's
what‑‑ it's probably their versatility that reminds me a little bit of us, but
it makes it difficult to guard them.  
I think it starts with his defense on the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, in what ways are the international players maybe more advanced
than their American counterparts? In what ways do they need more training?
Second question, if you don't mind, you mentioned the kids at Chicago know you
because of the football program. Why would a kid in Serbia know you?  
COACH RICE: That's a good question. First of all, the international kids‑‑ the
Aussies that we've got, they came from the Institute of Sport. They were
just‑‑ their basketball skill was really advanced. They know how to play in a
system that‑‑ kind of like what we're playing, where the ball moves really
easily and they make each other better.  
I think with Anthony‑‑ I think each kid's different in the fact when you say
what things do you have to work on with them, but when we got Anthony, what he
could do is shoot the 3. He didn't score in all these other ways that he's
scoring now.  
So that's something that we've really worked on developing in his game, is
being able to move without the ball, being able to attack the rim, being able
to get in the paint and score. That's why he's a scorer now and not just a
shooter.  
Why would a guy in Serbia know about us? I think it's not just a national name
now, it's an international name. Like I said, with our football program,
that's how Boise State University was known. There's probably not a lot of
places in the world that you can go and mention the Blue Turf and they don't
know what you're talking about. I think everybody knows about that. And with
the internet now, these kids, they follow everything.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Good luck tomorrow night.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Saint Marys  67  
Middle Tennessee  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the head coach of Middle Tennessee State
University, Kermit Davis, as well as student‑athletes Marcos Knight and Bruce
Massey Jr.  
We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Davis, then open the floor for
questions for our student‑athletes only.  
COACH DAVIS: I thought we got off to a good start. We went through a scoring
drought in the first half. About six or seven minutes, Marcos got in foul
trouble.  
Dellavedova has really been struggling shooting the ball. We thought two
things. He's 1 for 18 from 3 coming into the night. We got him going. We
missed a couple of assignments early and kind of got his head up, then he made
two or three really tough 3s in the first half.  
We thought we had to turn him over. We only turned him over seven times. We
had 14 assists, 9 turnovers. The whole stat was the free‑throw line. They shot
20 times, and we shot seven. That was kind of the difference in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Bruce, just talk about the game plan on trying to stop Dellavedova, and
it just seemed like you guys tried a lot of different things, but every time
he got loose, he was able to convert there.  
BRUCE MASSEY, JR.: We just wanted to slow him down, limit his possessions and
looks at the basket. Like Coach said, he was struggling shooting the ball
coming into the game, but he got going early.  
I think he hit the first 3 he took, and then he got another one, and then a
transition layup, and after that he started hitting tough shots and got going
early.  
  
Q. Marcos, it seemed like the first half you guys started slow, only 20
points. Was it nerves? What was it out there?  
MARCOS KNIGHT: I think we got a lot of good possessions. We've just got to
finish the ball at the rim. The second half we did finish better. Second half.
Early in the game, we just couldn't finish balls at the rim.  
We got great shots. I don't think it was nerves at all.  
  
Q. Marcos, let's talk about that late run there. They had a 10 ‑point lead,
I believe, and you guys kept going. Got a layup, cut it down to 3 there. Just
talk about how you seemed to have the momentum there, forcing him to call a
30‑second time‑out.   
MARCOS KNIGHT: It started with our defense. We play a great defense. We got
out in transition and cut it to three, and they called a time‑out. We ran a
set play, but we didn't execute it well.  
You know, our defense leads our offense. That's a great point that you made
about getting out in transition and how we had to make them call a 30‑second
time‑out.  
  
Q. Marcos, I think you were one of the guys that also defended Matthew
there. Just talk about how tough he is to defend because he doesn't ‑‑ he
seems to find ways to get shots off.   
MARCOS KNIGHT: He's a great player. Like Bruce and Coach Davis say, coming
into the game, he was struggling. He was 1 for 18 from the 3‑point line. But
we try a lot of combinations on him. At the end of the day, he just made great
plays.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you just talk about this two ‑year run that you guys did.
Obviously, to get here this year. Just talk about what it means to leave this
year.   
BRUCE MASSEY, JR.: It's been a great two years. I wouldn't trade it for
anything. I wish it ended differently, but we broke the drought for MTSU going
to the NCAA Tournament in 20‑plus years, so you hang your hat on that.  
After a tough loss like this, you don't forget what you did the last two years
for the program. We help MTSU get back on the rise, and hopefully it continues
to make further steps into the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Marcos and Bruce, thank you for your time. Congratulations on
your season.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Davis at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked the players about Dellavedova. Talk about some of the
things you tried to do to slow him down.  
COACH DAVIS: Well, we hard hedged ball screens. We trapped him at times. We
were going to 1‑3‑1 him and trap him and take the ball out of his hands.  
I thought in the second half we got him tired, and then he responded better.
So he just‑‑ he shoots the ball like that. He's big, strong, and he still can
run a team, but he hadn't made plays like that from the perimeter.  
When he does that, he may be the best point guard in college basketball. When
he shoots it like that‑‑ from 1 for 18 to 5 for 7 from 3 is a big difference.  
  
Q. Just further on Dellavedova, for a lot of the country that's not familiar
with him, can you just put into context what caliber a point guard you think
he is?  
COACH DAVIS: I just think there's no question he'll make some NBA team.
Wouldn't you love to have him as your 11th or 12th man on an NBA squad. He's
strong. He's physical.  
They'll pick apart some things he can't do. He's got quicker feet than you
think. The NBA is full of ball screens, and he uses his best judgment on ball
screens. The whole thing is can he shoot it? If he shoots it like he shot
tonight, he'll make a team.  
You just sit over there and watch him play. I know Randy's got to love that.
He just puts guys at different spots. He sees it as good as anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about that late run when you really needed a
spark there to get a little run there. Cut to the 3 on Marcos' layup there off
a steal from Tweety. Things are going well. Talk about that run there and just
couldn't keep it going.  
COACH DAVIS: We defended. We got in transition. We needed to get in
transition. That's where our team's at its strength. We turned them over,
rebound the ball.  
Then we had the ball up 3‑‑ excuse me. Down 3, and Trantell (Tweety Knight)
got on the side real close to the backboard and kind of forced up a shot, and
they went down and scored. After he got about 7, we could never get the game
back.  
I was proud of our guys. They competed hard, played their tail off. Saint
Mary's played good tonight, but like I said, you look at all the stats. 17 for
25. We were 6 for 7. That was kind of just they got to the line better than we
did.  
  
Q. Coach, last two years, something to remember, 27 wins last year, 20 this
year. Just put in context what it's meant to see what this team's done the
last two years.  
COACH DAVIS: It's just I'm so proud of our players. I'm happy for our fan
base, and Dr. McPhee, our president, Chris, our AD. It's just been fun to
watch. It's been fun to see Blue Raider basketball and the program grow.  
The national attention we've kind of gotten, the MT brand these past two years
is fantastic. Those six seniors will be sorely missed, but we've got a top 25
recruiting class coming in and a good number of players coming back. So we
feel really good about the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Congratulations.

DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the student‑athletes of LIU Brooklyn. We'll
open up the floor for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Could all of you perhaps address you guys have been here before. Your
opponent has not been here. Do you think that's a huge advantage for you?  
C.J. GARNER: I think it's an advantage, but at the same time, they're a pretty
good team, and at this time of the season, it really doesn't matter. You've
just got to come out and play real good basketball.  
JASON BRICKMAN: I think their experience is definitely an advantage for us,
being here for a third straight year. I think that we're going to be
comfortable in this environment and atmosphere and playing on national TV. So
I think it's definitely an advantage.  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: Like they said, experience is very key, especially in
situations where we may be down or the game might be hairy.  
  
Q. Jamal, can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Londell
Francis, how it came about, maybe a story or two from this year and how it's
had an effect on your life.  
JAMAL OLASEWERE: Londell has‑‑ it's sickle cell, right? ‑‑ sickle cell, and he
joined the team in the beginning of the year, and he's been a brother ever
since. We treat him like a little brother. He's a great guy, very joyful, even
though he's dealing with this strong threat.  
I remember specifically in Quinnipiac‑‑ actually on Quinnipiac Senior Night,
when me and C.J. had our big games, he congratulated me for my big game. He
was very happy for us.  
  
Q. C.J., for you in particular, these last three games in the MVC
Tournament, offensively, what have you been able to do so comfortably?  
C.J. GARNER: I've been able to knock down my midrange jump shots. Also
Brickman's been doing a good job finding me in transition, which he always
does. Basically just playing off my teammates and the confidence my coach
gives me.  
  
Q. By now you're probably aware James Madison's leading scorer and rebounder
has been suspended for the first half. You guys ‑‑ obviously during the season
you lose players too. Could you kind of address the fact what this could do to
a team when you're filling in for somebody that's not there, a key player.   
C.J. GARNER: When Julian went down, it took some time for us to adjust to find
our new identity. Them not having him in the first half very well could be a
problem for them. But I'm not sure about that. Just going to go out there and
play hard. Just see how things go.  
  
Q. Just for the three of you, after losing in the NCAA the last couple of
years, how much more ready do you guys feel to get a win this year?  
JASON BRICKMAN: I think a lot of seniors and myself, I think we're really
hungry to get our first win in the NCAA Tournament, just coming in the first
round the last two years, I think all of us want to get our first win and
hopefully use that momentum and take that into the game against the 1 seed,
Indiana.  
THE MODERATOR: C.J., Jason, and Jamal, thank you for your time. Good luck
tomorrow night.  
Right now being joined by the head coach of LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds, Jack
Perri.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement by you.  
COACH PERRI: We're excited to be here. We're embracing the First Four. Our
guys are excited. We got in here yesterday, got a practice in last night, and
we're looking forward to playing JMU tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How does Goins' first half suspension make it tougher for you today.  
COACH PERRI: It makes it bizarre in terms of how to prepare for them.
Obviously, we're preparing for him to play. That changes them quite a bit.
He's just a house down low.  
But they're unique. T.  
Hey have the ability to go really small also and very athletic. So it's going
to be dangerous one way or the other.  
  
Q. How much of an advantage is it the fact that your team has been here the
past two years and a lot of the guys have at least been under the glaring
light, I guess?  
COACH PERRI: Yeah, I was talking about that with somebody else before.
Obviously, it's a great positive to have all this experience, not just one
year, but two years in a row. I think last year against Michigan State our
guys didn't have that wow factor. And certainly I think this year, going up
against a like opponent, there's definitely more of a sense of urgency to try
to get a win here and compete against these guys.  
So it certainly is going to be a positive. It's certainly not going to be the
reason why we win, but I think that certainly helps.  
  
Q. You've got either six or seven guys from Texas on your roster. How did
that come about? Is there a connection down there? Just talk about that Texas
thing.  
COACH PERRI: Texas connection, yeah. We've done it for a while now. Probably
even before I got there. I've been here eight years, and we had an assistant
coach, Andy Johnston, who started that pipeline, I guess. He was originally an
assistant at West Point. So he knew about Texas.  
We just kind of started going there and getting a little bit better and better
talent each year. Once I got there, it was like, okay, I loved going down
there. I loved the events. They were well run, and there was a lot of talent
down there. Again, not highly recruited.  
So then you have New York City, which is the draw, and a lot of kids like to
go away from home, keeping the New York City kid is tough. There's so many
teams that you're competing with that are like levels, that it was like, okay,
let's go down to Texas, and we're getting kids probably better than what we
can get here.  
We get‑‑ Julian Boyd was probably the first one that really got things rolling
for us, and then Kenny Onyechi followed after that, and he was our next
highest rated recruit. Jason Brickman comes in, and we've really kind of‑‑
we've made a name for ourselves down here. Everybody knows us now when we go
down there. They're excited when they hear from LIU Brooklyn.  
We're going to keep it going because all the players that we've had from Texas
have had great careers, and to be honest, a lot of times kids that go away
from Texas, they end up transferring back home. Kids that come to LIU, they
don't transfer. They stay because they really enjoy it, enjoy New York City.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, I know you've been in this environment as an assistant
coach, but this is your first time as the head guy. Is that any different for
you at all?  
COACH PERRI: I'd say it's a little bit different, making the decisions on
everything.  
  
Q. I guess I meant as far as mentally going through the game.  
COACH PERRI: Hey, what's great is we have a senior‑led group. They help so
much, just the fact that they've been through it as well.  
So, yeah, we're prepared. We're ready to go. Obviously, again, you get a
chance to play against a like opponent. We're going in with our eyes wide
open, and we're ready to go.  
  
Q. Play ‑in game, First Round game, used to be a little bit of a stigma, now
it's really‑‑ after VCU's run a couple of years ago, it seems like it could be
a little bit of an advantage for teams to get out of the first round and kind
of whet their beak.   
COACH PERRI: Yeah, what's following after for our game is one of the best
teams in the country, so a little bit different that way. But we've really
embraced this. Our players have. I certainly have. We thought this might
happen. We've had a lot of adversity this year. To get to this point was a
major accomplishment for our group.  
So with that being said, we've embraced it. We're like, hey, we've never won a
tournament game before. We're 0‑5 going in. So we have an opportunity. It's an
opportunity, that's all it is, to beat a good team, and it's on a national
stage before the rest of this stuff gets going on Thursday.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the matchups, if you will. You've had time to watch
film. These are two pretty evenly matched ball clubs as far as I've seen.  
COACH PERRI: Yeah, evenly matched, but very different. Their guards are big
and long. They're tall and long. Our guards are short and fast. We're trying
to get the game in the 80s.  
It's kind of interesting watching their games. They do like to get out in
transition some, but not always. Once they get in the quarter court and the
half court, they slow it down. That's not to our benefit.  
I'm interested to see how our guards handle their length. If we can't get out
in transition in the half court‑‑ because they are a good defensive team.
We'll see how that goes. They do a lot of switching. So it will be
interesting.  
Again, I'm confident in our guys. We have some talented guys as well. How they
match up with Jamal Olasewere is going to be interesting too because he's a
unique player that a lot of teams have difficulty trying to match up with.  
  
Q. Can you tell us about a couple of guys that are kind of on the periphery
of your program, Richie Kurlander and Londell Francis. Tell us a little bit
about those guys.  
COACH PERRI: Londell Francis, he's an eight‑year‑old with Team Impact. Team
Impact is a program where kids have the ability to be a part of our program as
long as they want, and we've adopted him into the program. We set it up right
off the bat in September. He came in. We did this whole big party with him.  
This kid is just a wonderful kid. He's got a great personality. He's got
sickle cell anemia, so the kid goes through a lot of pain. He's got to go to
the hospital and have these blood transfusions, which is really difficult for
an eight‑year‑old.  
He's awesome. He's awesome. Our guys love him, and they embrace him. He comes
to practices after school. He'll do team meals with us. He spends a lot of
time around our guys.  
It's great. It's great to have him be a part of the program.  
  
Q. And Richie?  
COACH PERRI: And Richie, obviously, he just‑‑ he's been around for a long
time. He comes to all the games. He's a really good person, very into it. He's
a very enjoyable guy to have a conversation with. He's very knowledgeable
about the program and all the stuff that he obviously has to go through is
unique as well.  
So to have both of those guys be a part of us is tremendous.  
  
Q. Do you feel your players get any kind of inspiration at all, or am I
making too much of this?  
COACH PERRI: You know what, I think‑‑ especially with Londell because he's
more‑‑ he's there a lot more, and I think they see him and they see this face
that he just‑‑ he's got this great enthusiasm for life and all that he deals
with, and we talk to our guys about that.  
I think it humbles our guys, and they feel really good that they can have this
impact on an eight‑year‑old. It's great. We've never done it before, and this
is the first time we've done it, and I was excited about the opportunity to do
it. I think it's helped our guys quite a bit. It's great.  
  
Q. Just curious how much it's helped, if at all, to have Julian Boyd travel
with you guys and have him here with you guys. I know he can't play, but does
that leadership or that presence help you guys?  
COACH PERRI: It does. Julian is such a positive kid. Here's a kid that
couldn't play for a whole year because of his heart ailment, and then to tear
his ACL his senior year, where this was the year that, after two years going
to the NCAAs, we were going to have a chance to make some more noise with so
many upperclassmen.  
Him to go down, he could have went the other way and kind of went into a
shell, but he's not. He's there. He practices all the time. He's got a great
personality and positiveness to him. Everybody enjoys his company obviously,
and his leadership is tremendous for the younger guys.  
We have a lot of older guys too, but for the younger guys, for E.J. Reed, for
D.J. Griggs, you can't get better than Julian Boyd, just to see how he works,
how he's constantly going after this ACL injury, the next challenge, the next
bit of adversity for him. So they see that, and they're like, oh, wow, that's
how you're supposed to act.  
That's how you're supposed to do it. It's great. It's great having him around.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Good luck tomorrow night.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 19, 2013

  

### [Matt Brady](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25115)

### [A.J. Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25114)

### [Devon Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25113)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by James Madison student‑athletes Devon Moore
and A.J. Davis.  
  
Q. Kind of the 500 ‑pound gorilla obviously in the room is Rayshawn Goins.
How will that affect you not having him?   
DEVON MOORE: It's definitely going to affect us because we play through him.
So it's going to be hard for the first half not having him, but Coach has
drawn up a good game plan for us. We're definitely going to try to stick to
it.  
  
Q. Not having the experience of being in the tournament before, what is this
like for you guys? Do you expect that tomorrow night there will be some nerves
or more excitement? How do you feel about that?  
A.J. DAVIS: Of course we'll have nerves our first time here, but Coach is
telling us to be humble and just play within ourselves like we've been doing
all year. So we should be good.  
  
Q. How big a deal is it for two guys from Ohio to return to Ohio? I realize
you played here earlier this year, but just be an hour away from where you
grew up.  
A.J. DAVIS: It's a lot of emotion going into this game being back home. A lot
of family and friends going to be here.  
Once again, we're just going to be confident, do what we do and doing all
year, just playing confident within ourselves.  
DEVON MOORE: It's definitely going to be a blessing just to see family and
friends and then just being able to be close and trying to definitely win a
game.  
We definitely want to stay here. That's something that we're trying to do so
our family that can't drive six hours to Harrisonburg to see us could see a
couple of games.  
  
Q. Is losing a player ‑‑ you obviously lost players during the season to
injury or whatever. Is this somehow different because of how bright the lights
are that you're playing in?   
DEVON MOORE: Definitely. Not knowing if Ray can play or whatever, it's
definitely going to be hard. I think our young guys and the rest of our
supporting cast has been helping us get to this point, and I think they're
going to be nervous, but at the same time, we've been doing it all year.  
Injuries have definitely took a toll on us. So I think next guy, whoever is
ready to step up, is definitely going to do that, help us out.  
THE MODERATOR: Devon and A.J., thank you for your time.  
We are joined by James Madison head coach, Matt Brady.  
COACH BRADY: The NCAA Tournament, we're really excited to be here in Dayton,
Ohio, and we are eager to get started here with our First Round game.  
Hopefully we'll play great basketball, and I had the opportunity to move
forward. It's always the dream of a program‑‑ a coach of a program that you
could take the team to the NCAA Tournament, and I couldn't be prouder of the
group that we have that really faced a number of opportunities worth of
adversity, and we had a great weekend last weekend in Richmond, won the CAA
title, and now here we are in Dayton and glad to be here.  
  
Q. Matt, coming from the CAA where there were so many close games and not a
lot of difference between you and the teams you were playing against, you
played in so many games where, if you're lost, you're gone. How is that going
to help you going into this?  
COACH BRADY: We played in nothing but close games for the most part, really
from the middle of January on. I think, when you're in close games, it's
critical that you have good guard play, number one, and that you can make free
throws, and we did‑‑ I think we did both of those things well.  
We have a senior point guard in Devon Moore, who's had a great freshman year,
and really in the intervening three years, had a lot of injuries, and now as a
senior had his second season in five that he's been healthy. We always felt
that he could be our league's best point guard, and arguably he is, and he's
played really good basketball.  
So we have a senior leader point guard that's helped us, and I think we have a
team that can make free throws. I think the other part of it is that we've
gotten better defensively as a team, and we led our league in scoring defense
this year, and near the top in field goal percentage defense. Those kinds of
statistics, I think, help you win close games.  
  
Q. Matt, how important is pace in tomorrow night's game?  
COACH BRADY: I think it's the single biggest factor in this game, as I thought
it was in our championship game against Northeastern. We played William and
Mary and Delaware in the quarters and the semis, and it wasn't as critical as
I thought that the Northeastern game was.  
This is very similar to me as Northeastern, I think figuring out what the pace
is and making sure you make really good decisions. Obviously, LIU is one of
the leanest scoring teams in the country, and they would prefer to have this
game in the high 80s. We're not equipped to do that just yet. My young guys
are not as good of shooters as they will be a year from now, when they'll be
able to get in the gym in the off‑season. So we're playing against a team
that's really fast with really good athletes that can shoot.  
We think it's really important that our defense makes this game go deeper into
possessions than maybe they might be comfortable with.  
  
Q. How do you minimize the effect, obviously, of losing one of your top
players, at least for a half?  
COACH BRADY: We play a lot of basketball without Rayshawn. We've gone small an
awful lot this year. We had a really good player in Andrey Semenov, one of the
best pick‑and‑pop men in basketball. About the middle of January, we knew he
wasn't coming back. A.J. Davis kind of emerged as one of the league's best
talents. When A.J. emerged, we figured we would play small a lot. So we played
small a lot because we felt we needed to defensively match up with some teams
in our league, and a lot of those times we would take Rayshawn out of the
game.  
We won a game without Rayshawn playing small, due to an injury, and we played
a lot, including the Northeastern game, where we played small. We took Ray out
for a long stretch of the championship game, and we played really well without
him.  
  
Q. Just a follow ‑up. You just lose a player to injury, just because of
everything else that goes along with it?   
COACH BRADY: My take on that is we faced a lot of adversity. We had 14
different changing lineups, and I'm a guy that doesn't like to change the
starting lineup. So we had our share of adversity this season, let alone the
previous four.  
It's just a blip on the radar screen. We're not going to let it impact our
team, our performance, certainly our mindset. It will impact who's on the
court certainly the first 20 minutes. But no matter how we play, it's not
going to impact our team. We're going to try to play our best basketball.  
  
Q. Matt, are you worried at all that, when Goins comes in the game the
second half tomorrow night, that he kind of overextends himself, tries to do
too much to try to make up for the fact that he wasn't playing in the first
half?  
COACH BRADY: That seems to be a natural thought process, right? We thought
about it as a staff, and I already talked to Ray about it. We played three
games in the CAA Tournament, so six halves. He had two great halves, the other
four halves he was just okay. He's a very talented guy and didn't have a great
February.  
He was really terrific the first few months of the year, wasn't quite as
strong in the month of February, and that's one of the reasons why we went
small.  
And what my team knows is we're going to play the five guys, whether a
freshman‑‑ I've had a lineup out there where we played four freshmen and won
games doing that.  
So I've kind of shortened the rotation in terms of our freshmen playing that
many minutes, but I have already talked to Ray about just do what you do to
help us win. He knows that, should we win, he'll get another game in the NCAA
Tournament. I think the spotlight becomes bigger.  
It's certainly advantageous for James Madison and the community that we win
the game. I don't think he's going to try to put too much undue pressure on
himself. He's a very likable young guy. I think he's been very coachable. I
think he'll do what's right for his teammates.  
  
Q. Are you concerned at all that your players might be a little wide eyed
because they haven't been on this stage where LIU Brooklyn has?  
COACH BRADY: If there's a tangible and the intangible, I think we just covered
it. I think the tangible is tempo, and the intangible is we're playing a team
that's got great experience.  
Most of their players that are starting have been here for the third straight
year. I'm actually more concerned about the experience factor than I am the
tangible part of tempo and pace. I do think they have an advantage being here
on the stage.  
We do have seniors, and we have really good seniors. They're excited to be
here, both the message I've delivered all week, especially since Selection
Sunday, is we're not just here to play one game. We are here to represent the
CAA, our university, and really our basketball program. The best way to do
that is to win, to win with humility, and try and move on.  
  
Q. Do you have any questions about the suspension? Has it been a
distraction, taking away from ‑‑ or talking about that rather than your
players being able to come here and have this experience?   
COACH BRADY: This is what I'd say about that. We've gone through a number of
different changes. I mentioned a couple of them already. This is a team that
has been resilient. Our leader, Devon Moore, has been going through a
situation with his mother at home that has been a burdensome affair for him
and our team. He's missed a number of practices, and actually part of the CAA
Tournament.  
We lost a great player in Andrey Semenov. We had a number of guys getting
injured. Andre Nation hurt his hand just the other day. He has an issue with
his hand. Charles Cooke had a broken hand.  
Unfortunately, we're a program that's dealt with adversity. We deal with it
every single year. I've told our guys this will not impact our team. We just
won't let‑‑ we've been down this road where just about everybody on our team
had to deal with issues, health and otherwise. We're going to try our best to
play our best basketball in advance, and we're not making a bigger situation
out of this than it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach Brady?  
COACH BRADY: Thank you.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Saint Marys  67  
Middle Tennessee  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're being joined by head coach Randy Bennett as well as
student‑athletes Matthew Dellavedova, Stephen Holt, and Beau Levesque.  
We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Bennett.  
COACH BENNETT: We played a good team, Middle Tennessee. We expected them to be
a good team, and they were.  
So we're happy to get out of this first round with a win and looking forward
to moving on.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Matthew, directly, and Beau and Stephen, you can chime in, if you will.
When you hit those first two threes, on a scale of 1 to 10, how deep was your
sigh of relief?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: There was no sigh of relief. I didn't know‑‑ somebody had
told me that I was 1 for 18 on my last three. That didn't even enter my head.
I've always got confidence the next one's going down.  
Yeah, just get too many shots up for them not to go in.  
BEAU LEVESQUE: I know it felt good for us just to get a good start, jumping
onto an early lead, just having Dell on was definitely big for us.  
  
Q. Matthew, your top seven minute ‑getters have all played in the tournament
before. They have nobody that's played in the tournament. What sort of role do
you think the experience played?   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: I think the main thing that sort of helped our guys out
there was just like the travel and all the other stuff that kind of goes with
it. Get a shorter warm‑up, all those kinds of things.  
So it definitely helps, I think, that we've got a little bit of experience in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about their physicality on defense, particularly their
guards. They've got some strong, stocky guys. Was that a challenge for you, or
are you used to it by now?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Well, we knew they're a physical team with strong guards
that are all kind of like junior and seniors, and we knew they'd get after us.
It was a physical game, but it seems in the West Coast Conference players are
pretty physical as well. So I think that helped with us being ready for it.  
  
Q. Matthew, just talk about all the different defensive looks they gave you.
They put three or four different guys on you, tried some different defensive
sets. They seem to throw just about everything they had at you.  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Yeah, we knew they'd switch out their defenses a bit.
They've got the 1‑3‑1 half‑court. They went to the quick trap at the end. And
then saw different looks on the on low post there, switching, hard show a
trap.  
We've seen, I guess, most of the defenses‑‑ or pretty much all of the defenses
that teams could throw at us throughout the year. So I think we've got ourself
in place for each way they're going to guard us. So I think that helps.  
  
Q. Beau, your kind of the team's bracketologist. You kind of know what's
going on across the country. What do you know about Memphis?  
BEAU LEVESQUE: I've seen them play a couple of times. I know they're fast in
transition. We really have to get back. But we know if we play our game we'll
be able to make a good game.  
When it comes to the tournament, it doesn't matter what your seed is, 6 or 11.
We feel we can compete with anybody.  
THE MODERATOR: Steve, Matthew, and Beau, thank you for your time. Good luck in
the second round.  
We'll open the floor for questions from Coach Bennett.  
  
Q. How are you going to deal with the athleticism and speed of Memphis? A
lot of people say that they're super athletic. How are you going to deal with
that?  
COACH BENNETT: You know what, I really haven't had much time to think about
it. I think teams like that‑‑ I saw Memphis play the other day when they won
their conference championship. But the number one thing is you have to take
the transition away from them, see if you can do that, which is what I thought
we had to do tonight on Middle Tennessee.  
The keys on Middle Tennessee were taking away transition, don't give them
second shots, they're very good going to the boards, and then taking care of
the ball.  
We did a good job in all three of those areas except for about ten minutes in
the beginning of the second half. They were able to get transition, and the
game got tight again.  
So I think it's the same. I think it's‑‑ they're just‑‑ I don't know if
they're going to be any quicker or faster than Middle Tennessee. Those guys
have a nice team. Kermit does a great job with them, and a lot of guys keep
coming.  
So Memphis, pretty much same game plan.  
  
Q. Randy, it was brief, but two things we saw in the second half we don't
normally see from you. One, Matthew sitting for two minutes in a tight game,
and one possession of the zone. What was behind those two things?  
COACH BENNETT: Matt had cramps, so we had to take him out. Otherwise, we
wouldn't take him out.  
The zone, we had longer possessions and wanted to burn the clock. So I think,
when you go zone, it takes longer to get a shot, and that's it. I thought, if
they went man, kept going man, they're just driving it, and it's either going
to be a foul or‑‑ it was going to end up a situation where the clock was not
going to run very long.  
So those are the reasons we did those two things.  
  
Q. We asked the guys and Delle how it felt when he hit those first two 3s.
What was going through your mind when he hit those shots?  
COACH BENNETT: It felt good because he had been struggling for a while. We're
not going to win games like this if Matt doesn't shoot it well‑‑ or shoot it
decent.  
The thing I never question on Matt is how‑‑ his desire to win or whether he's
going to do the right things leadership‑wise and all that. He's going to play
whether he makes shots or not, but if he makes shots, it gives us a chance to
separate. If he didn't make shots, the game would have gone to the wire, but
he made them. It gives us a chance to separate.  
I thought he and Holt really played well.  
  
Q. Coach, they make the run there. You call like a 30 ‑second time‑out. What
did you tell them there? From there you guys extended up by 12, and from
there, it's pretty much game over.   
COACH BENNETT: I know exactly what I told them. I told them to get back on
defense. That's when they made the run. Came back and kicked out three,
penetrate, and one layup.  
So I really think they need that to score. They held them to 20 in the first
half, and then they got 18 in the first eight minutes of the second half. And
that's why. They got transition. Some of it's‑‑ we might have turned it over‑‑
we didn't turn it over much, though.  
I think most of it was our two guards weren't getting back deep enough, and
they were able to get isolations. If they get that, they're very good.  
  
Q. Best ‑case scenario for you guys, you're playing three games in basically
five days. Does that change your rotation at all? You've got Jorden Page out.
You're a little short already. How do you deal with that the next two days,
maybe four days?   
COACH BENNETT: We're going to have to play Eividas at the 3 spot some, and
Paul is going to have to play a little more. You can get away with it the
first game not playing your bench much. This next game, and hopefully there's
one after that, same deal, we're going to have to use our depth more.  
Those guys can play, they just haven't had a lot of experience this year, and
you're throwing them into a pretty big game, and there's a lot of pressure on
it. So they'll do it. We had to do the same thing when Beau Levesque was a
freshman. So he'll have to step up. They'll get it done.  
  
Q. Speaking of Page, what's the diagnosis on him? Is he going to be able to
rejoin you guys at some point? I know that was a possibility.  
COACH BENNETT: I don't know. He was supposed to see the doctor today, and they
were going to look at the MRI and figure out what they thought the injury was
and how long. So I have not heard yet. I doubt he will be playing with us
Thursday.  
I'll know more as soon as I call back and find out.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bennett, thank you for your time. Good luck in the second
round.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

North Carolina A&T  73  
Liberty  72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by the head coach of North Carolina A&T
Cy Alexander, as well as student‑athletes Austin Witter and Jeremy Underwood.  
We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Alexander and open the floor
for questions to our student‑athletes only.  
COACH ALEXANDER: I want to commend Liberty University for a very good game.
Either team could have won the game. I thought that John Sanders and Davon
Marshall and Speaks all played tremendously well on offense.  
On the other hand, I thought our young men showed a lot of resilience because
Liberty didn't back down, and we would go up a little bit, and they would keep
coming back. I thought our defense again got a couple of turnovers for us and
allowed us several breakaway opportunities.  
I was not pleased with our inability to make free throws down the stretch. I
think we could have iced the game about 30 seconds earlier had we made free
throws, but hopefully we'll make them on Thursday.  
I commend Austin Witter late in the game. He had a couple blocks, and he had
really just enough at the end to alter the shot just slightly, and we walk
away with the first NCAA Tournament victory for North Carolina A&T.  
So we're pleased to be moving on, survive and advance, and that's what this
whole deal is all about.  
  
Q. This is for Austin. Just seemed like John Caleb drove towards you on that
last play. What did you see on the last play, and what were you trying to do
to stop the drive?  
AUSTIN WITTER: I knew we were up 1 at the time. I knew he was going to go to
the rim, and I just wanted to play off of him. I seen him a couple times
during the game trying to jump into our players' body. So I just tried to jump
back, keep my hands back, and use my length to alter the shot.  
I believe I got a little piece of it, but I'm not really sure. I think I did
just enough to get it off.  
  
Q. This is for either player. After all the struggles the program's had in
the past 15 years, it's the first winning season since '95, how does it feel
to bring a first NCAA Tournament win after all the struggles that they've
had?  
JEREMY UNDERWOOD: It feels great. We worked very, very hard over the last
three years, since I've been here. We've worked very hard. We always believed
in ourselves. We never stopped believing in ourselves.  
We just kept working hard, and we pulled it out. It showed that hard work pays
off.  
  
Q. Jeremy, it seemed like in the second half Davon hit a couple of 3
‑pointers, and they put you in on Davon, and you kind of held him down for a
couple of minutes. What were you trying to do to get in his face or try to
make it more difficult for him to make the shots?   
JEREMY UNDERWOOD: I just know that he like to shoot 3s. So I just try to stay
very close to him, and I didn't let him get comfortable. Let him get his feet
set. I try to stay comfortable and disrupt him a little bit, stay close to him
and disrupt him, and it worked.  
  
Q. Were there any nerves at the start of the game? Or if there were, when
did they wear off? How were you guys feeling going into the game?  
JEREMY UNDERWOOD: We weren't nervous at all. We were more so happy. It's been
a long time. So we were more so happy to be on the floor and to have the
opportunity to play in front of this crowd on this stage.  
So it wasn't really any nervousness on my end.  
  
Q. Jeremy, for you again. It seemed like you were creating a lot of your own
offense in this game. Just what was your kind of mindset on offense? What were
you trying to do to create your own offense?  
JEREMY UNDERWOOD: The first half I seen that I had the hot hand. I didn't miss
the first half. So I seen that I had the hot hand, and I just kept going. My
teammates believed in me, and they kept letting me go.  
My coach believed in me. I told him I wanted to run certain plays, and I felt
like I could produce off of certain plays, and he had confidence in me. I just
went out there and made it happen.  
  
Q. For both of you, I was just wondering, it's a pretty good sized crowd,
wondering how it felt playing out there the opening tournament with everybody
watching you?  
JEREMY UNDERWOOD: It was very, very exciting. We have a nice crowd at A&T, but
nothing like this crowd. Very exciting for us, and we were just more so happy
to play, happy to have the opportunity to play on this stage.  
AUSTIN WITTER: I didn't really even notice how many people were in there until
around halftime when I looked up into the stands, and I seen the darker upper
area, and I seen all the people up there. I was excited.  
I knew it was going to be packed from before, when we started playing, and
that's the kind of stage you wish you could play on every day. That's what
you‑‑ as a Division I basketball player, that's what you wish, that's what you
dream of.  
  
Q. You guys, I'm sure, know that a 16 has never beaten a 1 in this
tournament. Not only do you get a 1, but you get the No. 1 1. Wondering if you
have any thoughts about this statistic and that you're playing, at least
according to the tournament seedings, the best team in the country.  
AUSTIN WITTER: That's just a statistic. We're still going to go out there and
play hard, play our game, and no matter what, we're going to try to get the
win.  
THE MODERATOR: Austin and Jeremy, thank you for your time. Good luck. Now
we'll open the floor for questions for Coach Alexander.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, this is your first year at A &T, but you are very
familiar with A&T, and I'm sure you've been made familiar with A&T's history
in this tournament over this year. What does it mean for you, what does it
mean for the alumni that you've talked to, for the former players and fans, to
finally break through and get this win?   
COACH ALEXANDER: I think the whole entire A&T community, the Greensboro
community, and the alumni of A&T are all very proud of what these young men
have done this past year.  
It's been a long time, and for a while, A&T was in this tournament for seven
consecutive years in a row, and all of a sudden it kind of went south for
whatever reason. I was the opposing coach at South Carolina State University,
and we had the opportunity to go to the tournament five times while I was
there as a head coach.  
So just the e‑mails and texts I've had over the last‑‑ since we beat Morgan
State on Saturday, just everybody just elated over the‑‑ where the program has
come in a one‑year period.  
When I got the job last May, we talked about trying to win a championship for
our seven seniors, and them understanding, and I told them, that they had to
play a heck of a lot harder than I saw them playing on film.  
They bought into my philosophy of playing hard, playing smart, playing
together, and playing with confidence, and defense. We're one of the better
defensive teams in the country. Tonight, fortunately for us, we shot some
amazing shots. We don't normally do this.  
So, again, I'm just very proud and pleased with how everyone has bought into
what I've been trying to sell to the university and to our team and whatnot.  
  
Q. What is it about the MEAC that's brought you so much success? You
mentioned your career at South Carolina State, and you struggled a little bit
at Tennessee State, and then you're back and in your first year you win a
tournament game. What is it about this conference?  
COACH ALEXANDER: I don't know. It's a good conference with good coaches. I've
been blessed to have a good group of players at South Carolina State, and I
have a good group of men who have grown this year.  
I think this run, two things it will do for our university. One, it's going to
be a tremendous boost for our recruiting, and, two, it's going to be a
tremendous boost as far as overall student applications, as far as the
student‑‑ we have about 11,000. This is a very good school academically,
engineering and technology. So hopefully everybody can benefit from the
success that the men's basketball program is having.  
  
Q. For those of us who are uneducated, haven't seen you guys play, haven't
seen you coach previously, are you always so ‑‑ your body language so
expressed like that?   
COACH ALEXANDER: Yeah.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were kind of willing a lot of that. Is that something
you just developed over the years?  
COACH ALEXANDER: I had to do that with this team. This team never won before.
When you get a team‑‑ and hopefully over the years I can kind of slow down,
and they'll understand. But when you're working with a group of guys that
never won, they don't know that every play is important, every defensive
possession is important, every offensive possession.  
And we still take plays off, and when we take plays off, I try to play the
play for them and let them know that I guarded a guy for them surreptitiously.  
But, no, having to help them understand how hard‑‑ I feel like if they see me
working hard, they'll understand how hard they have to work.  
  
Q. Cy, Jeremy said he wasn't nervous. What was your read on the players
before the game and as they took the court? What kind of vibe were you getting
from them?  
COACH ALEXANDER: I thought they were focused. The thing that we asked them to
do every game is be focused but try to be relaxed. I thought in this
particular game it's very, very important to be focused, but it's probably
even more important to be relaxed.  
We didn't change anything that we normally do, our normal routine, our normal
pregame talk, our normal pregame workout, and they seemed to be focused. We
had film today. We had shootaround. We tried to keep it as normal as possible.
To me, I didn't see any abnormalities as far as in their actions and whatnot.  
  
Q. You talk about your defense and how important it is to you. You might
have discussed this already in your opening statement, but what happened on
the last play, did you see how your defense reacted to Sanders as he went
coast to coast?  
COACH ALEXANDER: Well, we were just hoping that someone would cut him off, and
what I was probably more afraid of was nobody not fouling him because I knew
he was going to try to penetrate and try to draw some body contact, and I
thought that was a very smart play on Austin's part not to jump into him but
kind of give him a little space and then just jump and hopefully get a little
bit of the ball.  
I think he touched it a little bit. I'm not quite sure. But my biggest fear
was that he was going to create a foul because he's very good off the dribble
as well as his ability to shoot the 3‑point shot.  
  
Q. I'm sure you want to savor the victory for a little bit. How long do you
do that before you start worrying about Louisville? What do you tell your team
about playing a team like that?  
COACH ALEXANDER: We talked about it already in the locker room. And we as
coaches will go eat as a team, and then about 10:00 tonight, we'll work from
10:00 to about 12:30 on Louisville. With modern technology, we'll have film on
them in 30 minutes, with synergy and stuff like that.  
We'll watch the last‑‑ I think it was the championship game in the Big East
maybe. We'll watch that game tonight. We told the players don't worry about
Louisville tonight. Just relax and enjoy some basketball on TV. We'll let them
worry about Louisville when we get to Lexington tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned being displeased with the two missed free throws down the
stretch. What's going through your mind as Adrian misses and Lamont misses?  
COACH ALEXANDER: Here we go. That's what's going through my mind. I felt that
these two guys are two of our better offensive players. So Adrian came
through, and Lamont came through in the MEAC championship game. I'm hoping
they still got it in them to come through tonight.  
I looked up at the scoreboard, and we weren't in the double bonus, so I'm
saying, uh‑oh, we've got to make one of them, and he missed the first one. So
actually, I told him, when we got the ball in, don't be trying to get fouled.
Move the ball. And Lamont did just the opposite of what I asked him to do. He
holds the ball, and he gets fouled. I said, well, I hope he knows what he's
doing. Obviously, he didn't.  
But we did‑‑ it was just not enough time. Again, the key deal was us being
smart enough defensively not to allow Sanders to create contact and draw a
foul.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you weren't there all these years, but how close did A &T
ever get to a win in the NCAA Tournament? Do you know?   
COACH ALEXANDER: I'm not sure. I'll tell you who would know. One of my
assistants, he's the son of Don Corbett, the legendary coach at A&T, and he's
an A&T historian. I'll ask him, and you give me your e‑mail address, and I'll
e‑mail it to you. I don't know. Corbett would know.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck against Louisville.  
AUSTIN WITTER: Is John Caleb Sanders.  
AUSTIN WITTER: Is Tomasz Gielo. #38G is Davon Marshall.  
PLAYER 3: Is Davon Marshall.  
THE MODERATOR: I'm joined by the head coach of Liberty Dale Layer, as well as
student‑athletes, Davon Marshall, Tavares Speaks, and John Caleb Sanders.  
AUSTIN WITTER: Is Tavares Speaks. Sorry.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll be joined by head coach of Liberty, Dale Layer.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement by you.  
COACH LAYER: On 2 1/2 hours sleep, 8‑hour plane delay, it's great to be in
Dayton. What questions might you have?  
  
Q. Why was the plane delayed eight hours?  
COACH LAYER: Let's see. It was some kind of a skid light‑‑ I don't really
know. But it wouldn't let us take off. Dumb coaches don't really know. They're
probably a need‑to‑know basis, and I didn't need to know.  
They had to bring in another plane. Tried to fix it, couldn't fix it, brought
in another plane. We were up at 4:30 this morning, expecting to leave at 7:00,
ended up leaving about 2:30 or something.  
But glad to be here.  
  
Q. Did you get to sit in the plane all that time?  
COACH LAYER: No. We were in the‑‑ it's a double‑wide‑trailer‑type terminal,
but we were allowed to leave a little bit. It was fine. They treated us well,
just inconvenient, and we're running late. We're supposed to be here on time
for NCAA events. It kind of put some pressure to us. We've done our best.  
  
Q. There's a lot of people around the country that the burning question is
how did you get here? At 0 ‑8 and 10‑20, to win your last five, we know how
you got here to win your conference, but what happened? And how did you turn
things around?   
COACH LAYER: Good question. 0‑8 to begin the year. My best player, Antwan
Burrus, never played a minute. He was my best returning player from last year.
Had two starters out, one for nine games, one for six. Had two players in the
rotation quit in December. Other than that, things were going really well.  
I'm very, very thankful that I've got players who have great character. And if
you go through stretches like that, your character's tested and it's revealed,
and I think the character was revealed on our guys in a tremendous way. They
held on to the hope that at some point we could be a good team.  
But when you're 0‑8, a lot of people quit. Men quit. Grown‑ups quit.  
But our guys just kept coming back every day saying let's get better today. I
told them in January, I said, There's going to be a story in March of
somebody‑‑ there is every year‑‑ of the Cinderella story or the feel‑good
story of March. And I said, Why couldn't it be us? Just think if it was us
after losing eight games in a row to start the year, and we're in the Dance.  
They kind of embraced that and started saying, well, why not us? Slogans don't
do much for you, but work does, and I think that we worked every day, we
improved. I think God blessed our work. I thought in January we were playing
December basketball. That's not what you want to do, but that's kind of where
we were. In February, we were playing probably two weeks behind where we
should have.  
I told our athletics director, Jeff Barber, I wish we had another month with
this group. And he looked at me like I was crazy, for good reason, because we
were struggling, but I kept sensing this team was bridging the gap and closing
the gap.  
We hit our stride‑‑ we lost our last game at home, our 20th game, on Senior
Night. That's not really what you want to do on Senior Night. As a head coach,
the 20 is not what you want to do on the loss column. That's maybe the worst
feeling that you can have as a coach. First time I've ever experienced that.  
Won our last game on the road at Radford, got a little energy from that,
looked at the conference tournament bracket. We had to play the home team in
the first round, Coastal Carolina, the No. 1 seed in the North who had beaten
us twice. High Point, the second round, the hottest team in the tournament.
The third round, Gardner Webb, who had won eight straight games. And then
arguably the best team from day one to the second to last day in our league,
Charleston Southern.  
So we did not have an easy draw. It was the hardest. I think the odds have
been stacked up against us from day one. But I think, when you have the odds
stacked against you, it can turn into the best story, and I think that's
probably what we experienced.  
  
Q. Paul Daugherty, sportsillustrated.com ‑‑  
COACH LAYER: Cincinnati Enquirer?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH LAYER: I read you every morning. I'm a big Reds fan.  
  
Q. Oh, good. Because of the religious emphasis of the university, do you
attract a different type of player, and can you describe that type of
player?  
COACH LAYER: That's a good question. I think that the mission of the
university is biblical world view. It is‑‑ it probably permeates every class,
to some respect. We've got medical school being built. We've got a law school.
You can major in anything.  
A player has to embrace who we are, not necessarily every belief, but the
culture. So our team is built upon the culture of Liberty, not that every
player carries a bible everywhere they go, although some do. Their head coach
does. So it's part of who we are as the fabric of our university. Liberty is
the largest Christian university in the world, 13,000 students, 100 online
students. They're spending literally millions and millions of dollars on the
infrastructure as we speak. It's a special place.  
Athletics is very important at Liberty. It's not the most important thing, but
it's‑‑ we want this to be at some point a BYU type for evangelicals, a Notre
Dame type school for evangelicals. We're not there yet, but that's kind of
where we're heading, and any player who comes in has to embrace the culture.  
Fortunately, I think God has worked the work in these guys' lives and my life
during the year that the odds were stacked against us. The adversity was hard,
strong, tough every day. The negativity from fans, from friends, from family
was consistent. And it's hard to come to work every day like that for an 18‑
to 22‑year‑old kid.  
I'm so proud of them. I think God used this in their lives and in my life. It
will be a story and a testimony for the rest of their lives that, hey, we can
do something when it's all stacked against us, no matter what it is‑‑ being a
dad, being a worker, being a businessman, being a husband. I think this will
be a story that will resonate in their hearts for the rest of their lives. I
think we'll all be changed because of it.  
  
Q. A lot of America thinks that the tournament really doesn't start until
Thursday. What would it mean for your program, particularly after all you've
been through this year, to win the tournament?  
COACH LAYER: I'm just happy to have a good day. That's been our mantra all
day. If you have a good day today and wake up early and have a good day
tomorrow, good things can happen to you. We've had the hope that, if we did
things the right way, it can turn into a good story.  
I think the tournament starts today. We've got hats. We've got trophies. We've
got banners. It gives us a right to play tomorrow. There are a lot of good
teams who won't be playing tomorrow, but I don't think you can marginalize
what we did in the face of what we had to experience and overcome. If anybody
wants to disregard that or marginalize it, I would say, well, what have you
overcome?  
  
Q. Coach, I just want to play off that. How did you become a Reds fan?  
COACH LAYER: My dad was born in Cincinnati. I've got a hundred relatives right
outside of Louisville. I came to visit my grandparents every summer in
Louisville. We would make the trek up‑‑ what is it, '81 or whatever it is‑‑ to
Crosley Field. I lost my first baseball glove on July the 4th‑‑ I would say
it's probably 1966, the fireworks show. And my dad said, Don't bring your
glove, pal. Don't do it. You're going to lose it. I said, I want to catch a
fly ball or a foul ball. And during the fireworks show, I lost it.  
Saw Pete Rose hit a double that was above the‑‑ is it the yellow line? But the
umpire said it was below the yellow line at Crosley. Big Red Machine. It's
kind of part of how I grew up listening to Marty Brennaman and Joe Nuxhal.
Great memories. Baseball is great over the radio. That's kind of how I was
brought up from my dad.  
  
Q. I don't mean to overemphasize this religious aspect, Coach, but do you
get ‑‑ have you gotten players there that you might normally not have gotten
because they prefer that aspect of it and they're comfortable with it?   
COACH LAYER: I think it narrows the field of people that would be interested
in Liberty, but the people who are interested would be overly interested. It
runs the whole gamut. Tomasz Gielo is from Poland. He came because we
recruited him the hardest, and he wanted to come to America. He's 6'9",
sophomore, started most of the last two years.  
I asked Tomasz after his first year, I said, Tomasz, how do you like it? He
said, Coach, you guys are great. My teammates are awesome. You all have
accepted me from day one. He said, But the thing I didn't understand is the
religious aspect of it, and I've grown closer to God in the past six months,
and that's maybe the best thing that has happened to me.  
He didn't choose Liberty for that reason, but it was kind of an added benefit.
There are guys who want to go to a Christian university, and if you want to go
to a Christian university and you want to play Division I athletics and you
want to have a support system athletically that's‑‑ our facilities are
literally high major, becoming high major. So if you want a Division I
athletic experience that is not a compromise just because it's a Christian
school, Liberty is the place.  
So the word is not out there yet, but when people come to our campus, they go,
I can't believe what's going on here. You guys are spending money on football,
and our baseball stadium is SEC quality. Our basketball facility, we've got a
brand‑new practice facility that just opened up. Our arena seats 8,000, NBA
scoreboard. No one knows those kinds of things.  
If you want a Christian education and you want a high Division I experience,
not that we are there yet, but that's our aspiration. It's an itch, and it's a
good thing, and it's a good match for a lot of people.  
  
Q. One last thing, Coach. Marshall couldn't go to ‑‑ he did transfer in, but
he had options of some pretty good programs, right?   
COACH LAYER: John Caleb Sanders had low‑end Big 12 offers. Davon had several
offers from higher institutions. Tavares had a couple that were higher level.
They all chose Liberty for different reasons.  
I don't want to speak for them, but I think the Christian aspect was part of
it. If you have a Christian school with poor academics, you don't want to go
there. If you want to play high Division I or Division I experience and it's a
compromise in facilities and how you're treated, well, you don't want to do
that.  
But Liberty has that unique blend of Christian education and a high level of
athletic experience. Not that our league is that yet, our league is getting
there, but what we're trying to do athletically is moving forward very, very
quickly, and I think ten years from now it very likely could be on par with a
BYU and a Notre Dame‑‑ not in tradition, but on that type of a trajectory.
It's what we're hoping, anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.  
We're joined by Liberty student‑athlete Joel Vander Pol. Open up the floor for
questions for Joel.  
  
Q. Were there moments during the season that you doubted, obviously, that
you can get here, but that you could even have a representative season?  
JOEL VANDER POL: I think it's easy to have doubts like that during the season.
But when your leader and head coach every single day instills confidence in
the players and shows faith in us, that goes a long way.  
Every single day he was our biggest cheerleader, our biggest fan, and that was
a really big deal for us and a great reminder for us.  
  
Q. Davon, can you talk a little bit about your options, your choices behind
Liberty and why you chose Liberty.  
DAVON MARSHALL: I had a couple schools, Wichita State, UNLV. Oregon showed me
interest too. LIU Brooklyn, North Carolina Central, but I chose Liberty
because I came from a Christian background. When I came on my visit, they
welcomed me with warm hands‑‑ the coaching staff, the players, and everything.
It just felt right for me.  
  
Q. For Davon and also Tavares, could you kind of ‑‑ what was the low point
of the season? Not to dwell on that, but could you compare it with what it was
like to win your conference tournament and knowing you were coming to the
NCAAs after everything you've been through?   
DAVON MARSHALL: Low point was probably beginning of the year when we were
0‑8\. Guys started to quit. It was a lot of long days at practice. Guys are
just down on themselves. We're thinking about next year, not looking forward
to really finishing up this year strong.  
But towards the end of the year, we started buying into everything the coaches
were saying. The chemistry started building, continued to work hard at
practice, and it paid off for us.  
TAVARES SPEAKS: I think for me the low point was coming off, I think, a win
and then headed into Senior Night, my last game at the Vines Center, and to
lose in the way we did, it was just kind of a devastating loss.  
Trying to keep a clear head going into the conference tournament and coming
off a loss like we did, it definitely discouraged our team as a whole. So just
keeping each other on the right path and giving each other that confidence
back was a difficult task.  
  
Q. Coach was in here earlier and said that ‑‑ I guess it was in December
when he pulled you all together and said every March there is that one team.
You know what I'm talking about, I guess. That Cinderella team. It might have
been when you were 0‑8\. I forget. Give us a little bit of that story, and if
you were 0‑8, if it was the lowest point of the season to that point, how much
did you believe in what he was saying?   
JOEL VANDER POL: We definitely believed him because he's been coaching for 30
years, and every single year we definitely hear a team that's‑‑ Greg Gumbel is
doing a story on someone special every single year that was 0‑10 or something
like that.  
So just looking back now, it kind of made Coach look like a prophet, and we're
really excited to be that team so far.  
THE MODERATOR: Joel, Davon, and Tavares, thanks for your time. Good luck
tomorrow night.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

### [Kermit Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25105)

### [Marcos Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25107)

### [Bruce Massey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25106)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by MTSU student‑athletes Marcos Knight
and Bruce Massey, Jr.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Marcos and Bruce.  
  
Q. After last season, you guys set a school record. This year you had to
sweat it out on Selection Sunday, and you're finally here. I just want to know
how you feel right now.  
BRUCE MASSEY: Being here has been great. Finding out we've been selected to
make the tournament on an at‑large bid was a great tournament on Sunday. We're
really excited just because we know we lost in the Sunbelt Tournament. It
wasn't a 100 percent chance we were here, it was 50‑50\.  
So just getting in and us being an 11 seed, playing a game, shows us respect
for our resume and schedule earlier in the season. So it's a real good
feeling.  
  
Q. For Bruce, you haven't been here, obviously, in a long, long time, the
program hasn't. Do you have to kind of guard against resting on your laurels,
to be satisfied just getting here and not trying to win?  
BRUCE MASSEY: You're happy to be here, but, like any other team in the
tournament, just getting here is not what you want to do. You want to win a
game in the NCAA Tournament. That's what it's all about basically.  
Every team comes in here with the mindset they want to win. Nobody is
satisfied with just getting here and playing the first game and just losing, I
don't think. That's not our goal. We're happy to be here, but we're trying to
win the game also.  
  
Q. Marcos, 24 hours ago, if somebody had mentioned Saint Mary's to you, what
would your reaction have been? What would you have known about Saint Mary's
before the last 24 hours?  
MARCOS KNIGHT: I know they have a really great point guard. He's one of the
top point guards in the nation. I know they're a really hard playing team.
They lost three times against Gonzaga, which Gonzaga is ranked No. 1 in the
nation all year.  
They're a great team. We know they're going to play hard tomorrow night. So
we've got to match their intensity.  
  
Q. Marcos, 13 upperclassmen for you guys. How important is that for you to
actually have a lot of experience heading into tomorrow's game?  
MARCOS KNIGHT: Having a lot of experience is also great for us also. A lot of
our guys play a lot of minutes. We've been with each other a lot, and we know
each other like the back of our hands. We've been through a lot with each
other. We've been through the good and bad with each other.  
That's something we hang our hats on, sticking together with each other. But
having a lot of experience is great also.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you talk about the last 24 hours, what it's been for you,
getting stuff packed? Did you have laundry ready? What's it been like?  
BRUCE MASSEY: It's been hectic. I had to wash last night. I went to bed late.
It's just been a crazy turn of events, especially we met together last night
as a team about 9:30. Our plans, we had to fly out, meet at the school at
7:00, get to the airport about 7:30, 8:00, fly out at 9:00.  
We had to do a lot of stuff and watch a little bit of film on Saint Mary's
because we didn't know much about them.  
Like Marcos said, they have a really good point guard. They play tough.
They're really good in their conference. They couldn't get past Gonzaga, but
Gonzaga's been good all year. So you really can't be mad at them about that.  
It's just been a hectic last 24 hours.  
  
Q. Bruce, I'll ask you, that five minutes after you guys got the bid for
Saint Mary's, and you already knew about Dellavedova, the point guard. Is that
because he was one of the best in the country or you've seen him on TV?  
BRUCE MASSEY: It's both. He's one of the best in the country, and you hear a
lot about him, and he gets a lot of TV time just because he is one of the best
in the country.  
You know he's a good point guard. He gets a lot of exposure. I saw him play
against the USA team on the Australia national team. You heard a lot about
him, so I knew about him coming in.  
  
Q. The head of the selection committee said that what you guys did on the
road was the deciding factor to get you guys in. Can you talk about playing on
the road this year. Was there a game or a particular moment that you guys have
been able to build off on from on the road?  
BRUCE MASSEY: We had a lot of road wins this season, but I know people was
talking about we didn't get necessary road wins, like we lost at Belmont,
which could have helped us if we'd have won there. We lost at Akron, which
could have helped if we'd have won there. They're both two solid teams and won
their conference.  
Road games this year helped us out, and the committee rewarded us for playing
in the road games even though we didn't win them.  
  
Q. Bruce, Kermit and Randy Bennett worked together at Idaho about 25 years
ago. Those in the Bay Area know a lot about Randy Bennett. We don't know a lot
about Kermit Davis. If you were to give us the one ‑minute, half‑minute
capsule on Kermit Davis, what would it be?   
BRUCE MASSEY: Coach Davis is a real live competitor. He's a hard worker. He's
tough. Basically, the way you see us play is the way Kermit Davis is. He's
tough. He's unselfish. He's really into the team. And that just sums him up.  
He's a tough guy. He doesn't like losing. So he gave that to us. So losing
comes with it, but you've got to handle it the right way. Coach Davis is a
really good person. He's really tough, and that's what we respect most about
him.  
  
Q. Marcos, you talked a second ago about how much experience this team has.
Saint Mary's also has a lot of experience, but they've been here before, the
NCAA Tournament. Are you guys ready for this stage? Do you know kind of what
to expect here?  
MARCOS KNIGHT: I know it's going to be a really hard‑‑ we're going to have to
play really well in order to beat Saint Mary's. They have a lot of guys that
have been to the tournament before, and their coaches have been here before
also.  
Like Coach Davis always says, if we play to our identity and share the
basketball and rebound, we can beat anybody in the country. Whenever our team
is right‑‑ because Coach Davis believes that, and we believe it also. That's
something we hang our hats on also, is being tough and defending and
rebounding.  
  
Q. Bruce, a lot of people have questioned ‑‑ I know you guys were one of the
last four in. A lot of people have questioned if you guys deserve in this
tournament. What do you say about that, and do you need to win to show people
that, yes, you deserve in this tournament?   
BRUCE MASSEY: There's going to be a lot of questions in the NCAA Tournament no
matter who gets in, who's out. Every year it's a question about did that team
deserve to get in over another team.  
We feel like we deserve to get in. I think with 28 wins you deserve to get in
the NCAA Tournament. You can't flukily win 28 games no matter who you play
against in Division I basketball. So I think we deserve to get in.  
As far as tomorrow night's game, yeah, you want to win to put a stamp on there
like, yeah, they deserve it, they won their first game in the tournament.  
  
Q. Bruce, Coach was kind of on the hot seat a couple of years ago, and now
does it feel extra good that you're able to get to finally an NCAA Tournament
for him as well?  
BRUCE MASSEY: Oh, yeah, it feels really good, especially to get Coach Davis to
the NCAA Tournament. He's been working hard his 11 years at Middle Tennessee.
He recruited us, and we talked about it when we first got in that that was the
whole goal, winning games and mainly getting to the NCAA Tournament.  
That's what playing Division I basketball is all about. We was able to help
him these two years get over 55, 56 wins and get an at‑large bid this year
without winning the Sunbelt Tournament.  
  
Q. Marcos, you and Bruce are both junior college transfers. Just what was
the lure here, and was this the ‑‑ in the back of your mind, was this what you
guys were thinking about when you signed up for MTSU?   
MARCOS KNIGHT: Like Bruce just said, before we even got here, we talked about
going to NCAA Tournament, and last year we fell a little bit short. Coming to
our senior year, me and him did a lot of talking outside of practice about
being leaders and being tough again to get Middle Tennessee into a tournament
appearance.  
They haven't been in over 30 years. It wouldn't be a greater feeling for me
and Bruce and the seniors to go out this way. So the whole time this summer we
were working, and preseason, get up at 6:00 in the morning and working out,
that was something we kept in the back of our minds, getting to the NCAA
Tournament, and we're just happy to be here.  
  
Q. This is for either of you. Last time the team was in the NCAA Tournament
you weren't born yet. Have you thought about that at all?  
MARCOS KNIGHT: We thought about it. We talked about that before we left also.
I don't think I even thought about it before the last time they were here. I
think it was '89, I think. Yeah.  
It was a long time ago, but it feels great to be here. We don't want to be
here just to be here. We want to be here to win games. That's something we
practiced for all week. The way we played this week has really got us prepared
to be able to compete at a high level.  
THE MODERATOR: Marcos and Bruce, thank you for your time. Good luck tomorrow
night.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement by you, and then we'll open the
floor up for questions.  
COACH DAVIS: It's been a‑‑ it was a great day for Middle Tennessee yesterday,
exceptionally good for our players and our fan base, and it's been very well
documented. I told Dr. McPhee, our president, sitting right here, yesterday: I
don't know if Middle Tennessee could have gotten more publicity in a week.  
I don't know if we would want to do it that way, but it happened that way. Get
in the large bubble and get in on Sunday, and your brand, the MT brand will go
across the nation in a lot of different ways.  
It was a great day for our players. We're excited, number one, and it was well
deserved. Our team exactly thought they'd be in the NCAA Tournament. There's
been a lot of‑‑ I've been on so many talk shows and talked about it, and I'll
say it. You have 28 wins, and when you think you have an NCAA Tournament team,
you schedule that way. And we had the sixth best nonconference schedule in the
country and the second most road wins. When you have all those things and
everybody says, well, you're supposed to be playing well at the end. We got
beat in the conference tournament, and we had the nation's longest winning
streak. Our team definitely needs to be here and playing against a very good
Saint Mary's team tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, a minute ago Randy Bennett talked about the difference between
experience, which both teams have, and NCAA Tournament experience. Is there a
difference, and are your guys ready for this type stage?  
COACH DAVIS: Last year, when we got left out of the NCAA Tournament, we beat a
really good Marshall team at home. We won an out game at Tennessee, a rival
game, and played really well and won at Tennessee. The Minnesota game at our
place was as good a college game as I've been in in 30 years of coaching, and
we got beat kind of right at the end. So I think that's great experience.  
We'll find out tomorrow night. I know Randy's team has been to the tournament,
and they've got a point guard who's very well tested in this tournament. But I
think you saw two very experienced guys that will play well tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Randy was talking a little bit about your guys' relationship when he was
a graduate assistant. He basically said that nobody knew his name and that you
kind of looked out for him. What did you see in him 25, 30 years ago that led
you to believe he'd have the success that he's had at Saint Mary's?  
COACH DAVIS: I'll tell you the first story about Randy's first game. And
Randy‑‑ I was young too. Tim Floyd, and he hired Larry Eustachy, and Larry
convinced him to hire me. Tim had known Randy's dad, Tom Bennett, who's a
great man.  
So our first game, we go‑‑ and I was trying to help Randy as far as his
dressing. He was a bad dresser back then. And I said, Randy, you've got to get
some better slacks now. This is not very good. He comes to the first game, and
he bought some slacks. He went to some store and bought them, but he didn't
have them hemmed. I looked down, and he had stapled the bottom of his pants. I
said, Randy, that doesn't work right there. You can't do that.  
He's come a long way. I'm sure his suits are probably a lot more expensive
than mine. But we all knew right then. We all knew Randy Bennett was going to
be a great coach. We just knew. He was beyond his years because he grew up in
a coaching household. I did. So I appreciated coach's sons. He was smart,
bright, no task was ever beneath him.  
What he's done at Saint Mary's doesn't surprise Tim or Larry or myself at all.  
  
Q. I know you guys were selected last night. Was there a different feeling
for you when you actually got in the building and walked out there?  
COACH DAVIS: In this building today? It is. In the NCAA Tournaments that I've
been to, and I've been to two as a head coach at the University of Idaho, it's
something how you go practice at Wright State, and that's good. But when you
walk into there, you really feel like it's an NCAA Tournament.  
I'll tell you, as we've all known for years, how good of a job Dayton does.
You walk in the hotel, and our players had a great sense this is an NCAA
Tournament experience. They're just so experienced at hosting these types of
tournaments throughout the year that, when our guys go out and shoot for the
first time, I think it will really hit them that this is the stage they've
watched for all their lives.  
  
Q. Coach, Mike Bobinski said on the Selection show yesterday that your road
performance was one of the things that got you in here. Can you just talk
about what have been the factors that allowed you to play on the road so well
all year.  
COACH DAVIS: I appreciate that because we had the second most road wins in
college basketball over the last two years and the second most this year. In
11 years that we've been there, we have the most road wins in the Sunbelt.  
I think it's just what Marcos and those guys, we kind of hang our hat on,
defending and rebound, try to play with toughness, take care of the ball. And
I think we had the second or third most experienced basketball team in college
basketball, and that kind of helps that you can go on the road and win at
tough places.  
  
Q. Coach, Bruce has had a really good year, especially defensively, but his
last game, FIU, he didn't play very well, admittedly so. What's the difference
between Deric Hill at FIU, that small quick point guard, and what he'll see
tomorrow?  
COACH DAVIS: I like Deric, and he played well against us, but this guy
tomorrow night is the best in college basketball off ball screens. He's the
most experienced guard in college basketball, his position. Randy puts him in
great situations.  
And I don't say this because we're playing them, but it's just fact. In
watching the last six games, there's no doubt he's the most impactful player
on his college team than anybody in college basketball. Nobody dominates the
ball more. He shares it. He's tough. He's an Australian‑‑ he played on the
Olympic team for a reason, and he's really, really good.  
So it's really no comparison because they're totally different players.  
  
Q. Coach, you were kind of on the hot seat a couple of years ago ‑‑  
COACH DAVIS: Ask my president. Dr. McPhee, was I on the hot seat? You just
gave me a new contract. That was all the media people, wasn't it, Doc? You ask
my president about the hot seat. I didn't feel too hot, but maybe I was.  
  
Q. A bit of a relief, though, to finally be here?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, it is. I wanted it for our players so bad. And I wanted it
for our fans. I wanted it for Dr. McPhee and Chris because we'd done so many
good things at Middle Tennessee basketball, but it's the one thing we hadn't
done.  
At conference tournament, we hadn't had a lot of success in it. We'd been to
two or three finals and couldn't get over the hump. So it is. It's a good
feeling. I guess it's a relief, you know, but I guess it's more proud that
this is where we are and that we're putting the brand out there for Middle
Tennessee.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett a minute ago, we asked him about familiarity for your team,
and he said it's kind of hard to scout a team in this short of time. His
players didn't necessarily mention specifically your guys. Is he playing
opossum at all, or is there enough time? Seems like your guys know their
personnel pretty well. Which way is it?  
COACH DAVIS: I think there's enough time to find out. We started the media
part of it now‑‑ the first time we went to the NCAA Tournament in Idaho in
1989, you're calling a friend, and he's got to mail the tapes by airplane.
This is a quick turnaround.  
But I'm sure Randy's team trying to get from Moraga to here is a lot more
difficult than we were. A big part of that is travel. We met last night about
their team. We watched tape on them last night as a team. We watched it today.
And we'll be better at it tomorrow.  
I think probably they've been on national TV more than we have, and the point
guard has a lot of good name recognition. So that's probably the reason.  
  
Q. Coach, to go back to your road performance, is there a game on the road
this season or maybe last season that you've been able to use as a reference
point as a coach or draw back upon it certain other times?  
COACH DAVIS: I'm trying to think. We went to Ole Miss‑‑ we went to UCLA early
last year, and we were 3‑0\. We knew we had a good team. And we won by 20. We
just kind of dominated the game. And I think that just really set our guys
apart that we were a good team, and it convinced them that we were a good team
and gave them the confidence that we could go anywhere in the country and win
on the road.  
  
Q. Coach, real tough question. We've seen your name as Middle Tennessee and
Middle Tennessee State. Which do you guys prefer?  
COACH DAVIS: Our president likes Middle Tennessee State University. I'm in
disagreement. I like Middle Tennessee. But he's the president of MTSU. It's
Middle Tennessee State, right, Dr. McPhee?  
We discussed it with our fans. They wanted to change Middle Tennessee
University. Our president gets asked that question a lot more than we do, but
it's Middle Tennessee State University.  
  
Q. Coach, stats and numbers aside, is there any one thing about these guys'
intangibles that's going to get you through this first game when you really
need it?  
COACH DAVIS: About our team? Like Marcos said, I sit in the back. Just playing
to our identity. The physicalness. What their strength is is guard play. Our
strength is defensive guard play. We've got big college guards, and it's
allowed us to win SEC games. And they're a big physical team.  
What they are is they're a great offensive rebounding team. I think the
rebounding stat will be huge in this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. And last thing from me. Your players, none of them were born last time
this school went to the tournament. Any thoughts on that?  
COACH DAVIS: No, that's probably a good thing. They're excited about being
here, and I just think that I heard Marcos' answer, and Kerry Hammonds, one of
our player's dad, played on the NCAA Tournament team in 1989. It's a
father‑son. That's a pretty cool story line.  
Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 18, 2013

  

### [Randy Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18282)

### [Matt Dellavedova](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20823)

### [Stephen Holt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25104)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're being joined by Saint Mary's student‑athletes Stephen
Holt and Matthew Dellavedova.  
  
Q. Matthew, can you kind of talk about the last 24 hours and just kind of
the crazy ‑‑ having to travel halfway across the country and just what the
last 24 hours have been like for you guys.   
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Well, we just found out who we were playing and then just
met as a team. We weren't sure if we were going to leave that night or in the
morning, so we just went home and packed and then had another meeting and then
just left this morning.  
  
Q. Matthew, you guys have been here before, so you kind of know what to
expect. Can you be satisfied just getting here? How much is the hunger there
to win and to advance?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: We're definitely not just happy to be here. We've been
working all year to keep getting better, firstly to make the tournament, but
once we got here, we want to win some games.  
Last year we lost to Purdue when we were up and probably should have won that
game. So we're definitely not just happy to be here. We know each game is
going to be tough, it's knockout, but, yeah, we're extremely hungry to win
this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Randy talked yesterday about the previous three practices you guys had
had was working on things to improve what you had done. What's one specific
thing that you guys needed to work on to improve coming off of what you did in
Vegas?  
STEPHEN HOLT: I thought we had a solid practice leading up to this moment
today, and it's mainly just focusing on us. We play a lot on getting up and
down as far as scrimmaging. Just trying to get our offensive touch back since
we didn't shoot the ball too well in our conference tournament in Vegas.  
We're very confident coming into our game tomorrow versus Middle Tennessee. So
we're just excited to be here, but at the same time, know we're focused and
ready to compete.  
  
Q. Stephen, can you talk about you guys were here last year in the
tournament and three or four years now for Saint Mary's, how much does the
experience play and how important is it for you guys knowing what to expect
here?  
STEPHEN HOLT: Expectation is very key. Since we've been down this road before,
we know the process and what to expect. For me, this is my second time going
to the round, and this is Delle's (Dellavedova) third time. We're very
experienced, and overall us having pretty much the bulk of the team from last
year back coming in for this game, we're having our goals a lot higher than
last year, seeing how many games we can win, and we're just really excited to
get back on the floor and compete.  
Last time we went out, we lost to Gonzaga. So just to get the rust out and go
out and compete with our brothers and stuff, that's the main thing we're
excited about.  
  
Q. Given your relatively high RPI and the success that you've had,
especially in the last 2 1/2 months, are you at all surprised that you're
here?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Don't really look at all that bracketology stuff. That's
more Levesque's job on our team. He just gives me the updates, so I don't know
too much about that.  
But we're here now, and we're going to be ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Matt, you talked a lot the last couple of weeks about this senior class,
wanting to keep the season going as long as you can. Up until this time, you
knew you had another game to play no matter what you did. After tomorrow, you
don't really have another game. Does that affect anything in terms of
preparation, in terms of how you feel when you go out there?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: I don't think so. I mean, we've been playing‑‑ I think
we've been playing as hard as any Saint Mary's team I've played on, and we've
been leaving it all out there each game. We definitely want to keep playing
together for as long as we can.  
So, yeah, we're going to be excited to play, but at the same time, we know
you've got to win, or it's all over.  
  
Q. Matthew, Middle Tennessee's best defender is Bruce Massey, their point
guard. I don't know how familiar you guys are with him yet, but do you see
that as a challenge him going head to head with you?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Well, I hadn't seen him too much before last night, but I
watched a bit of the conference tournament game and got the semifinal to watch
now. But, yeah, they're a physical team, and they play hard.  
The first three minutes of the game, there were three or four loose balls, and
they were all diving on the ground for that. So, yeah, it's going to be a
tough matchup, but they crash the boards hard as well. I expect it to be a
pretty physical game.  
  
Q. Stephen, three years at Saint Mary's, have you ever had bagpipers greet
you when you got off the bus?  
STEPHEN HOLT: No, that was the first time that's ever happened. It was a
unique experience. The hotel staff was great at welcoming us in and making us
feel at home. That was pretty funny when we got off the bus, I would have to
say.  
  
Q. Stephen, can you just talk about the last 24 hours, what it's been like
for you. Is this such a whirlwind of finding out when you're playing and how
quickly you've got to get around and how long is the flight? Just talk about
how long this last 24 hours has been.  
STEPHEN HOLT: It kind of went kind of as I predicted. It's kind of a whirlwind
right when we got announced to come here and out to Dayton. We weren't sure
pretty much if we were coming out that night or leaving the next morning.  
Once we found out we were leaving the next morning, it was all about game mode
and preparation, getting my stuff packed, hopping on the plane, making sure I
got my rest. Lo and behold, we're here now about ready to practice and game
tomorrow. So it went pretty fast pretty much.  
  
Q. Granted you haven't seen a lot of Middle Tennessee, but of what you have
seen, is there anybody in the WCC to which you compare them?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: I saw that they throw out a bit of 1‑3‑1 sometimes, like
half‑court press. USF does a little bit of that. I mean, it's a bit of a
different style. There's probably not one team you'd compare them to.  
THE MODERATOR: Stephen and Matthew, thank you for your time. Good luck
tomorrow night.  
We're joined by the head coach of Saint Mary's Gaels, Randy Bennett.  
COACH BENNETT: I was just asked on the radio interview, Does it seem right
that you're playing in this play‑in game against Middle Tennessee with the
years‑‑ the kind of season we've had? And the answer was pretty easy. We're
excited to be in the tournament, and it's so hard to get in the tournament.  
Whatever you play nowadays in the tournament, you're going to have a tough
opponent, and we do. It's a little different in that the turnaround time is so
short, I think your preparation is definitely different. It's almost all
logistics, when you're flying out, where you're staying, when is your
shootaround time, when is your media time, what gym are you doing your
walk‑through in.  
I think the focus is more on getting your team ready to play and not as much
about the opponent you're playing. You just don't have much time to prepare
for the other opponent with 48 hours' notice.  
It's just as exciting. It's a little bit more exciting because it happens so
quick. You don't have time to dwell on it.  
As I said, we're excited to be in the NCAA Tournament. What a great event.
Probably the best sporting event in the country.  
  
Q. Can you fill us in a little bit, Coach, on the logistics, kind of the
timeline of what you guys went through from the time you found out you were
making the tournament until the time you found out you had to come here.  
COACH BENNETT: I'll tell you this, I didn't see the rest of the show. We were
in the first bracket, and once I saw our name called and we were playing
Tuesday, it was a mad scramble. Are we getting out on a plane tonight? Because
we had a text that said there's a plane waiting for you and we could fly out
tonight.  
We tried to do that, but that didn't work out. Had trouble getting a crew to
fly the plane, which is kind of important. So we just came out early this
morning and just got here about an hour and a half ago. I think we left our
school at 6:15 a.m. and flew out and checked in the hotel and came over here.  
So we're just getting adjusted to being out here on a little time change and a
little geographical change. So we're here, and we're going to try and get some
things done tonight practice‑wise and get ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you've got the history with Kermit back at Idaho. Was there ever a
conversation there: One day we're both going to be head coaches and we're
going to make the NCAAs and we're going to play each other? Any other
conversations back years back like that?  
COACH BENNETT: I don't know if they even remember my name back then. I was low
man on the totem pole. I know I was doing all the gofer work and running
around. I was pretty naive to the whole deal back then. I was just trying to
do the grad school thing and learn as much as I could.  
At that time, you don't know. You don't know Tim Floyd is going to be Tim
Floyd. You don't know Larry Eustachy is going to be Larry Eustachy. You don't
know Kermit Davis is going to be Kermit Davis.  
I do know this. I was the one learning a lot, and I was the one‑‑ I'm sure
they were too, but they knew so much more about college basketball than I did
at that time. I was just trying to soak it all up. I didn't even know what I
didn't know. I was‑‑ yeah, I was learning all the way.  
Kermit was great to me. They all were. All three of those guys. Kermit was
kind of‑‑ he was like the second assistant, so he kind of looked after me, and
he was the guy that I would usually go to with the questions. I thought back
then‑‑ I thought he was a really sharp basketball mind. I thought he had a
good feel for the game and understood things.  
So I learned a lot those two years. Like I said, I'm not sure they knew my
name back then, but I'm glad they helped me along the way.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to his question, have you kept in touch with Kermit much
over the years? Have you talked to him recently?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I talk to him probably once or twice a year, whenever I
see him or something comes up where we need to talk. I follow his team. I
follow his program. They've been good for a while. He's done a great job at
Middle Tennessee State. And all the way along, when he was an assistant at LSU
and before that, Texas A&M. I wouldn't say we stay in touch like on a regular
basis, but we do touch base probably once or twice a year.  
  
Q. You say you obviously know Kermit. I don't know how much you've studied
Middle Tennessee in the past 24 hours. Is there any team in the WCC to which
you compare Middle Tennessee, if there's a comparison?  
COACH BENNETT: I was thinking about that before I came over here because I
thought I'd get that question, and they‑‑ you know what they're like? A San
Diego team, not now, but a few years back when they were very athletic and
strong and played very good half‑court man defense.  
That's what they are. They're an athletic, strong, physically gifted team.
They're not‑‑ I mean, I haven't seen them in person, but they're not super
tall or‑‑ I mean, we have teams in our league that are bigger, but I don't
know if we have any teams that are more athletic and stronger.  
They remind me of the old Southern Illinois teams that we used to battle the
first time we played in the NCAA Tournament, and we played them a couple of
years after that, and those teams were sticky defensively, they're grindy.
They played the ball hard, and they're physically strong.  
  
Q. Coach, both of these teams have plenty of experience coming back from
last year's team. Your team has NCAA Tournament experience, Middle's doesn't.
Is there a value to having that type of experience at the tournament?  
COACH BENNETT: I think so. I think there's a value just to have been in the
NCAA Tournament. There's some things that happen in the NCAA Tournament that
are a little different than a regular season game. Whether it's the media
press conferences, whether it's the 40 minutes on the main court, whether it's
the pressure of‑‑ or the excitement of being in the NCAA Tournament, all those
things are‑‑ just like anything else, I think experience is valuable.  
It's helped our programs over the years that we've‑‑ the last six years we've
been in the postseason. Four of those have been in the NCAA Tournament. So we
have players that are going through the process a second and a third time. So
I think that helps.  
But it doesn't‑‑ I know it helps us. I know it makes me feel more comfortable
as a coach, and I think our players are a little more comfortable with the
whole process. I don't know if it means anything as far as winning the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how not having Jorden Page tomorrow
affects you guys and who you might have starting in his place.  
COACH BENNETT: We'll start Jordan Giusti in his place. We started Jordan
Giusti the second half in some games. So he's probably been playing as much or
more than Jorde Page. We'll miss Jorde. He's a guy that's a play maker
offensively.  
He's a guy that's been in the NCAA Tournament‑‑ this is his third year his
team has made it to the NCAA Tournament out of three. The one year he
redshirted, we didn't make it. We were in the NIT. So he's experienced. He's
scoring, and he's play making. He's solid in some other areas too.  
Those are the areas I'm concerned with missing, especially play making.  
  
Q. We haven't seen James Walker in a little bit. Is he going to see some
action?  
COACH BENNETT: I'm not sure James will play or not. Giusti's come on for us
and really played well. McCoy's been coming on. So those guys have kind of
made a little late season surge. I'm not sure what would happen with James.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start our first press conference. We'll open the
floor for questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. This is for anyone, but if you could go over just the last few hours,
finding out where you were going to be playing, the trip to Dayton, how the
ride's been so far for you?  
AUSTIN WITTER: It's been very exciting. After winning the championship game,
we were excited to come here and play.  
We had our Selection Sunday. Our whole campus did a pep rally for us. We had
the campus come out. We all had a big screen on us. There was cameras. News
crew came out. The papers and everything. It was exciting.  
We're just looking forward to getting ready to play now.  
  
Q. I just wondered, is it difficult for you guys ‑‑ you're in a basketball
mad state with a lot of great teams that people know on a national basis, but
you're kind of like in the shadows behind Carolina and Duke and everybody
else.   
LAMONT MIDDLETON: Well, even though we're in the shadows, we still feel pretty
good about our chances. We came to this tournament very confident. We had a
good streak at the end of the season. We beat a couple good teams in the
conference.  
So we feel very comfortable and very confident about our chances.  
  
Q. Does it ever ‑‑ I mean, this is something you accept when you come to A&T
that it's not Carolina, obviously, it's not NC State. But you kind of realize
that how much is going to be made of these other guys but not you.   
ADRIAN POWELL: Could you repeat that?  
  
Q. When you come to A &T, that's something you're going to accept, that you
know you're not going to get the acclaim of Carolina or Duke.   
ADRIAN POWELL: A&T is still a great environment, the fans and alumni support
us. Even though it's not a North Carolina or Duke, for me personally, I like
the small school better than the big school. This put us on the map and
shocked the world.  
If anything happens as far as us moving on, we say we were the team to do it,
small school. So I don't look at it as that.  
  
Q. I know you really just got here, but what's the experience been like so
far? You flew here and getting into Dayton. How have you been treated so
far?  
ADRIAN POWELL: It's been great, like I say. A little tired, but it's all worth
it. I never thought we would make it this far honestly from when I first got
here.  
The program's been turned around a lot. And everybody's been showing us love,
the cameras, pictures, just a great experience. I've been dreaming this for a
long time to play in the NCAA Tournament, and I finally got a chance to do it
with these guys right here.  
  
Q. You guys are playing a team that was 0 ‑8 to start the season and was
10‑20 at one point. They are in the same championship as you guys. Could you
talk a little bit about what Liberty did and what you think of what they did.
  
AUSTIN WITTER: We've talked a little bit about Liberty previously in our team
meetings and seen the scouting report and everything. We've seen the teams‑‑
they played a couple teams that we've played, and we've just got to approach
them like we approach every team.  
We've got to play them hard and play them tough, and just play them to the
best of our abilities and go out to get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Austin, Adrian, Lamont, thank you for your time. Good luck
tomorrow night.  
We're now joined by the head coach of North Carolina A&T, Cy Alexander. Coach,
we'll let you start with an opening statement if you like.  
COACH ALEXANDER: First of all, we're certainly pleased to be playing in the
NCAA Tournament. It's the first time since 1995 that NC A&T has participated
in the tournament.  
I thought our young people came together in the MEAC Tournament. We hadn't won
more than two games in a row all year. We won two games in a row about four
times. But every time we got to that third one, we would find a way to blow
it. Fortunately, the guys waited until the right time to win three plus one
more.  
I think we're playing right now with a lot of confidence. If you look
statistically, we're ranked among the top 20 defensive teams, field goal
defensive teams in the country, holding teams to about 38 percent field goal.  
That's what we have to hang our hat on is our ability to play defense. We've
been very inconsistent all year offensively, but we feel like, if we could do
the job defensively, we'll have a chance to put ourselves in every contest.  
We recognize that the short turnaround‑‑ that Liberty has two excellent guards
in Davon Marshall and John Sanders. And they also have a very good small
forward in a kid named Speaks.  
We've got to figure out a defensive game plan in this short period of time to
contain those three young men and keep the bigs off the glass, guard the
3‑point line, and don't get them many second shots. Offensively, for us to be
successful, three guys have got to shoot the ball fairly well.  
Adrian Powell, who was the Mid‑Eastern Athletic Conference MVP of the
tournament, Lamont Middleton, who made All‑Tournament team, and Jean Louisme,
when those three guys are going offensively, you've got a good chance
offensively to do well. If two out of three going good, it's going to be a
close game. If one out of three are going, we're going to lose. That's just a
fact.  
Austin Witter was named the Mid‑Eastern Athletic Conference Defensive Player
of the Year. He broke a school record this year with over 86 blocks in one
season. He has a great ability to block shots. He's got great timing, and he's
got great length. You've got a freshman who starts for us at center, Bruce
Beckford, 6'7". Bruce is one of the best midrange shooters probably in our
league. He's got a bright, bright future. Our role player, DaMetrius Upchurch,
comes off the defense on the front court. And Jeremy Underwood, backup point
guard, and we'll move Middleton over to the 2.  
So this is my first year, and this is my sixth tournament, NCAA Tournament
appearance, first time with North Carolina A&T. I came here to the tournament
five times as a head coach at South Carolina State University.  
So the thing that I was trying to sell to a program that hadn't won is we've
got to do four things every day. We've got to play exceptionally hard. We've
got to play really, really smart, play as a team, play together, and then play
with confidence.  
To our young people's credit, they bought into this, and the results are that
we're sitting here after 15 years of not having a winning record more any MEAC
championships. We've got a winning record and the first championship since
1995.  
  
Q. How have you presented this opportunity, or how will you present this
opportunity to your team? Will there be mentioned of George Mason and VCU and
Butler? How do you plan on selling this opportunity?  
COACH ALEXANDER: If we're fortunate enough to‑‑ I think that comes in you get
past this game. I think this game is about us continuing to do what we've
done, and that's to play defense.  
We're 2‑0 against Big South schools this year. We beat Radford, we beat
Campbell. In talking to several coaches in the Big South, they felt like we‑‑
our talent level is about the same, but that Liberty is playing really well
right now.  
So the key is the two guards, Marshall and Sanders. We've got to do everything
we can to disrupt them, take them out of their rhythm, and try to get‑‑ keep
them out of transition and allow no second‑shot opportunities.  
Their bigs go to boards extremely well. If we can do that and just kind of get
two out of three of those young men‑‑ Louisme, Middleton, or Powell‑‑ going
offensively, I think we'll be right in there when it's all said and done.  
  
Q. Is it ‑‑ you've been to the NCAA before. Is it a concern with your
players? Are you worried at all that they might be a little wide eyed once
they get into the game?   
COACH ALEXANDER: I'm very concerned about that. We're trying to keep things as
normal as we would during the season as far as the road game is concerned, you
know, film, practice for 45 minutes to an hour, team meal, film again tonight,
walk through in the hotel, same routine, shootaround in the morning, and be as
businesslike as we possibly can.  
I told them yesterday all the hoopla that we had on campus was great and it's
a great national exposure for our university, and it's certainly going to help
out our recruiting, but once we got out here, it's back to business. I told
them to enjoy it, but I've been very hard on them all day since we've been
here so they can understand it's now time to get ready to play a basketball
game, whether it be the NCAA Tournament or just a regular season game or a
MEAC Tournament.  
There's a way we approach things, and it's in a businesslike manner, and
hopefully they will get that and transfer it onto the court tomorrow.  
  
Q. A lot of people discount the First Four and they think the tournament
really begins later in the week. If you were to win this game, what would it
mean for NC A &T and your program?   
COACH ALEXANDER: It would be huge because it's counted as an NCAA Tournament
win, and it gives us an opportunity to get ready to play probably the nation's
number one team at this point. So it would be huge. It would be great for the
program, and obviously we're looking forward to seeing if we can make that
happen.  
  
Q. Could you describe, if there is a typical MEAC or NC A &T recruit, what
kind of guy do you get? Do you get kids that had ACC dreams or for whatever
reason didn't get there? Do you get kids that always wanted to play there?
What kind of kids come there?   
COACH ALEXANDER: We look for guys that can play in the A‑10, Sunbelt, guys
that are upper mid‑major‑type basketball players, who are good students. A&T
is a very good school academically with engineering and science and
technology, math.  
Being in North Carolina, stuck between Duke and North Carolina and North
Carolina State, obviously, the ACC is a dream for every high school kid, but
we have to really go out and look at that next line of guys that would be in
the A‑10 or the Colonial or some league like that, Ohio Valley, which I was in
that league for five years, and sell them on the fact that you can come here
and make an immediate mark.  
We had a heck of a recruiting year so far, and this is not getting here to the
NCAA Tournament is not going to do anything but enhance it. So we look for
kids with character, and then we recruit the lower level ACC guy that just in
case he decides to go to North Carolina State or UNC, that if he doesn't make
it there and he falls out of grace and wants to play more, then we're right
down the road.  
So we recruit nationally. We've got commitments from several people all over
the country‑‑ again, we've had a tremendous recruiting year, and this
opportunity being in the NCAA Tournament is just going to enhance it, and I
think you're going to see NC A&T‑‑ because back in the mid‑'80s, A&T went to
the NCAA Tournament out of the MEAC seven years in a row, from '82 to '88,
which is phenomenal.  
And how the program dropped, I'm not quite sure. Well, they dropped, one,
because I was the coach of South Carolina State, and we used to beat them all
the time.  
But on a serious note, it's a great institution in a great city, about 11,000
students, got a great academic reputation. There's absolutely no reason why we
can't become again one of the top mid‑major programs in the country.  
  
Q. You're playing a team that started the year 0 ‑8 and was 10‑20 at one
point. When you looked at video of them, did you see them before this
five‑game winning streak and now, and what‑‑ could you draw a comparison what
they're doing right versus what they weren't doing right before, I guess?   
COACH ALEXANDER: I think the ball is going in the basket a lot more now, and
that's a big key. I think they're playing with a lot of confidence. Maybe they
weren't quite getting the system early on because they run a lot of ball
screens. I think they were not allowing the system to help them.  
As they move forward, you look at them in December, and you look at them in
the Big South Tournament, you see that they will now execute the system, and
that's what scares me about them. They're executing their system very well,
and what we have to do defensively is try to disrupt their rhythm. That's the
best way we can to defend them.  
But the two guards are really shooting the ball. The kid Marshall shot 65
percent from the 3‑point line in the Big South Tournament. So that's shooting
at a pretty high pace. So they're letting the system help them and then making
shots, and I think that's the biggest‑‑ and they play, and they were playing
hard even when they were losing, but now they're playing hard and making
shots, and that's a big key.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Good luck tomorrow night.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan State  70  
Memphis  48

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Pastner.  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, a few things.  
First of all, I'm very proud of our young men. They had a tremendous year.
Obviously it's not the way we wanted to end, but you got to give Michigan
State full credit. It's a great basketball team. They've got a lot of good
players. They're big. They're physical. I mean, they're a very, very good
basketball team. So got to give full credit to Michigan State and Coach Izzo
and his staff.  
We just had a stretch there in that second half where we just couldn't score.
Just couldn't put the ball in the basket. Like I told everybody in Friday's
press conference, if you're making shots, we're going to be in great shape,
and if we're not, it's going to make the game that much harder.  
And, again, they really got us on the glass. That was the big thing.  
But I'm very, very proud of these young men. We had a great season, 31 wins.
In the final regular season polls, finished No. 15 in the coach's poll. Again,
won the conference -- regular season in-conference tournament championship.
But obviously, you know, our expectations are to compete for more than just
getting even to the round of 32. So we'll get back and get back to the drawing
board and look at this and clean some things up and ready to go for, you know
next year.  
MODERATOR: The floor is open for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about the first half. Talk about the fight in the first half and
getting back in the game.  
JOE JACKSON: Well, I mean, we expected them to come out and play hard. You
know, they're well coached.  
I knew they were going to be prepared to play us. I mean, we just tried to
continue to play hard. We didn't think they was going to come out like that
and make all those shots and get and ones and all that stuff. All our problems
came on the offensive rebounding. They just killed us on the boards. I mean,
every time that we had a chance to cut the lead, they got offensive rebound
and they scored. I mean, that's what killed us.  
GERON JOHNSTON: First half shots were falling. First half we had three
turnovers. That's very limited. That's good turnover -- that's a good turnover
to have.  
Second half we came out with, I think, eight of them. That's unacceptable.
Coach Pastner preaches no turnovers. Try to keep them limited, under ten as a
game, and they beat us on the rebound like Joe Jackson said.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the inside/outside game they had with Payne and Nix
and Gary Harris especially in the first half?  
GERON JOHNSON: Joe Jackson had seven rebounds. So he did his job.  
I had four. I didn't do my job. Need to be somewhere around eight or nine. So
I tip my hat to Joe Jackson. He was in there banging with the guys that was
down there in the post.  
I wasn't. I would hold myself accountable, but next year we'll be ready and
get back to the drawing board like Coach Pastner said and try to do better.  
  
Q. Talk a little about next year.  
COACH PASTNER: Well, Corey, I think we just -- obviously this one hurts. So
you're going to -- I know you're going to have some pain from the loss. We'll
have to get back.  
Our four seniors and D.J. Stephens, Ferrakohn Hall, Stan Simpson, and Charles
Holt who gave everything for their program. We're going to obviously miss
them.  
But we'll get back. We got to get regrouped. Get organized. I'll meet with the
guys and give them some time off, and then we will refocus in and look at the
offseason, what we need to do and get back to workouts and gearing up for the
13-14 season.  
GERON JOHNSON: Coach Pastner did his job. He told us what we had to do when we
came into this game. He told us if they beat us on rebounding and turnovers,
we not going to leave out of here with a W. So this blame going to go on the
players. He did his job. He coached us the right way, and we didn't finish it.  
So I'm going to take this one, and we can't dwell on this loss. Got to keep
thriving and try to be successful next year.  
  
Q. Joe, what about next season?  
JOE JACKSON: Just back to the basics, man. You know, continue to work hard.  
I mean, this loss hurts so much because I know, you know, type of hard work we
put in, you know, the whole summer. You know, to win games like these.  
But, I mean, I don't really know how to speak on it. Just continue to work
hard and, you know -- and just help prepare the right way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the struggles with the offensive execution in the
second half? Was that more about you guys not executing it or was there
something Michigan was doing defensively?  
GERON JOHNSON: Set them up for jump shots. Wasn't getting the ball in there to
our bigs and making them work. That's what it was, setting them up for jump
shots.  
COACH PASTNER: And we've got to be able to -- you know, I've said it many
times. If you're making shots, it opens everything up, and we've been a very,
very good three-point shooting team. I think we're around 37, 38 percent
shooting threes on the year, shot 21 percent. Part of our game is the way we
space the floor, make threes, and we got good shooters, but unfortunately
today we didn't shoot the ball well and that makes it that much tougher.  
  
Q. Joe, how tough was it to overcome some of those momentum swings?  
JOE JACKSON: Well, it goes back to the offensive rebounding. Everything that
they did was offensive rebound. He got four or five open threes, you know,
just strictly off of -- I mean, just playing harder. Adreian Payne did a great
job on his game keeping balls alive and they just found him.  
I mean, he probably one of the best shooters in the country. So that was the
perfect time to help the team. They the best shots to get when you get
offensive rebound.  
  
Q. You guys talk about the season. Can you talk about that a little bit for
us?  
GERON JOHNSON: I wouldn't say we had a great season. We got 31 wins. Our goal
before the season was to win a regular season championship, and we did that.
Win a conference championship, we did that, then win a national championship.
It's one thing at a time.  
We didn't do all three of those. We failed. So, I mean, it's not over now, you
know what I'm saying? You got to keep working hard, keep your head up, don't
dwell on losses, and stay together, you know what I'm saying? That's why you
got four years in college.  
JOE JACKSON: Well, we played well throughout the season, but we were more
focused on this time of the year. We wanted the win more than ever this year
because we feel like we got an older team and more mature team.  
I mean, we've been doing some good things, you know, the whole season, but the
whole focus was to win those games to get a better seed to play the NCAA
tournament.  
To come in and lose in the second round, that still sucks.  
COACH PASTNER: And, again, the whole thing is you got to make shots. The
game's about making shots.  
You know, I watched the VCU-Michigan game beforehand. VCU is a very good
three-point shooting team, didn't make shots. We didn't make shots. You got to
make shots in the NCAA tournament. It's the whole equalizer. You have to make
the whole three-point shot, and we didn't make them.  
MODERATOR: That's, guys. Floor is open for questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first half? Talk about what happened during that
stretch where you got back into the game and what was your message to the team
at halftime?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, they got that lead. We called timeout. We went to a
triangle and two. I thought that maybe gave them a little, you know, just
threw them off rhythm.  
You know, I told the guys there's a lot of time left. We're going to make a
run, and we went into the half down three and I liked where we were at and I
thought they had trouble guarding our would he have been actions, as we like
to call it.  
But we kept going at it and at it and we just missed some open shots. We
missed shots in the second half. We just had some opportunities we could not
score the ball.  
We missed short shots. We missed some layups, missed some wide-open jump
shots. We just didn't convert, and got to give Michigan State credit. That's a
very good basketball team and, again, we were on that momentum swing, and then
a couple times we had some opportunities and they just got second chance.  
I mean, they got a plus 46 in two games in the NCAA tournament on rebounding,
plus 46. That's their game. I mean, they're terrific at that. They're probably
the best in the country at offensive boards  
Q.Did you put in that triangle and two for this?  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, we worked on the triangle yesterday, and we did it. It
worked for us and actually worked for us in the second half. The problem was
we couldn't score.  
And, again, I believe in offensive, too. I believe in it, and I know that was
the thing that we talked about, we got to be able to score the ball, but we
just -- and, again, you know, I thought defensively for the most part, again,
we were fouling at the end and some things like that, but I thought the
triangle was good for us. We put that in yesterday. It worked for us. We just
didn't score. We did not score the ball. We had some opportunities. We just
didn't make the open shot. And our key shooters, you know, we got good looks.  
  
Q. There were times where you were trying to get your guys to go to
transition or a secondary transition game going but it didn't happen. How key
was that?  
COACH PASTNER: We didn't do a good job in this game on pushing the ball. Where
that's where you're strength and throwing it ahead and speed dribbling it up
and we walked it up a lot of times.  
Our best guy to push it up the floor was Geron Johnson when we got going, but
we didn't have a lot of -- you know, we walked if up too many times, and can't
do that against a team like Michigan State, especially when our strength, our
team strength is speed and quickness.  
But, again, you got to give Michigan State credit, Coach Izzo, his staff and
his players. I mean, their offensive rebounding, I mean, that's -- you just
can't -- you know, they were plus 20 on us on the glass, and we missed -- I'm
telling you, we had some big momentum changes where we turned the ball over
and we missed some open jump shots and some layups that just were back
breakers.  
  
Q. Coach, you've talked a lot about missing shots. How much was the MSU
defense and how much was it you guys not having a good game?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, I want to give all credit to Michigan State, and they
deserved to win the basketball game. They're good enough to win the whole
national championship.  
I mean, I think any coach will tell you, I mean shall Michigan State did a
great job defensively.  
But, again, as I said it yesterday, and I'm a big believer in this, if we make
shots, it looks like I ran a good offense. If we don't make shots, then the
other team ran a good defense. It's pretty simple in that. And I believe in
that. It's just as simple as can be. So we missed shots, so you got to give
Michigan State's defense the credit.  
  
Q. How much was Adreian Payne hurting you guys on both ends of the floor?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, I thought he was an X factor. I told our guys, and I told
our staff, he was an X factor.  
He's a pro. There's no question he's a pro. I mean, he's really good, I don't
know I saw him in high school a bunch playing in AAU ball. I knew he was good
then, but, man, I mean, he's good. He's a pro prospect.  
If he plays like that every night, they're going to be hard to -- they're
going to the Final Four if he plays like that. I think he's their whole key
for them to get to the Final Four. If he plays like that, they're hard to
beat. Very, very hard to beat.  
And by the way, Oakland University, the hospitality here was A plus. You got
good people all throughout. So if anyone's writing here locally, make sure you
give a great shot out to the Oakland University. They have really people,
tremendous hospitality.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan State  70  
Memphis  48

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Izzo.  
COACH IZZO: I heard some of Josh's comments, and I will say this, that team
worried me as much as any team we played. I think they're tough, they're
strong. They did a hell of a job the first half on the offensive boards. They
turned us over.  
For a guy that's just, you know, been grinding his teeth coming through a
program where the level it was at, I think he's done an incredible job, and a
lovefest where he's supposed to give me credit, I'm supposed to give him
credit. I appreciate how hard it is to take over a job at that point and I
appreciate the job he's done. He does it with energy. He's a good recruiter,
and they run some good stuff.  
So we did a hell of a job in about a 12-minute stretch defensively, and for
some reason, we rebounded the ball awfully well. I told Adreian he only had
three the first half and he just dominated between blocks and rebounds the
second half, and we did a better job of getting it inside. And we could keep
Gary on the court after a monstrous first half, you know, it would have been a
little easier for us, but it's never easy for us. It's just the way our team
is, and I'm just happy to get away with a win against a good team.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Adreian, first talk about your defense and then after Gary picked up his
fourth foul you scored six of the next eight points, was that a coincidence or
did something click?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: You know, I think it was a coincidence. I didn't really know
that was going to happen. I was just trying to play hard, you know, let my
offense come.  
  
Q. What about defense?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: You know, my defense is credited to, you know, coach,
basically, because he put me in the right positions and I just made it happen.  
  
Q. AP, getting to the round of 16 is not the goal of this program,
obviously, but now you guys are there five out of six times. Can you enjoy
this accomplishment for the night or a day or not at all?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, we can enjoy it on the bus, the ride home, and once we
get back to East Lansing, it's going to be time to work.  
GARY HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely -- it's part of the goal because we
need to get to the Sweet 16 to get to the Final Four and eventually a
championship. I mean, we just happy with this win right now. Like A.P said,
we're going to enjoy it on the way back, but then once we get to East Lansing,
it's time to get back to work.  
  
Q. Adreian, can you talk about the inside-out play that you had? Is that as
effective as you've been against a team of that caliber?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, I think Nix did a great job of, you know, passing the
ball and for us playing through Nix getting the ball into the post, and he
made some great plays, you know, kicking the ball out and scoring the ball
down low and finishing around the basket.  
  
Q. We heard that you said something after the Valpo game where you kind of
stepped up and said you'd have better focused, something like that. Can you
tell us what you said? How eager were you to get back out there? Gary, did you
sense that something was coming from Adreian today?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, you know, after the Valpo game I felt that I didn't play
as well as I should have, and so at the end of the game I came in and I
apologized to the team about, you know, my play. And I told them that I
couldn't have had many turnovers for us to advance in the tournament, and I
told them wouldn't let that happen again. So I tried to work on that and watch
film and get better.  
GARY HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, he didn't have a typical AP type of game that he
usually has. So I mean he's the type of guy, you know, he's going to bounce
back. He went back, watched film, saw the mistakes he made, saw how he could
do things differently, and he showed it today and had a great game today.  
  
Q. A.P., Coach Pastner just said if you play like this, you can lead this
team to a Final Four. Do you realize that you can lead this team and has that
hit your shoulders yet?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: You know, that's a great question.  
(Laughter) You know, my goal is to try to be as consistent as I can throughout
this tournament, and if that happens, then, you know, it's going to happen.  
  
Q. Gary and for Adreian, can you both talk about in the first half for you
Gary, the second half for you Adreian what it feels like to be in the zone
like that when you're just clicking?  
GARY HARRIS: I mean, it always feels good to see shots going in.  
I mean, I just got to give credit to my teammates. They were able to find me
when I was open and had confidence in me and I was able to knock down the
shot.  
ADREIAN PAYNE: You know, what he just said was right.  
It's always good, and we played at home. Well, you know, we had a good crowd,
great crowd.  
You know, we feed off of the crowd, and they was -- you know, they was great.
And, you know, Gary was making a lot of shots so we tried to go back to him.
You know, I missed one time and shot a three.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. The floor is open for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. Will you comment on Coach Pastner's thoughts about Adreian can lead this
team to a Final Four? Second you're famous for the saying you love player
coach teams. There was a lot of player coaching on today. Would you talk about
both those, please?  
COACH IZZO: Well, the first one, Adreian is -- you know, he was disappointed
in himself, the Valpo game. He just didn't play the same way. And we knew --
you know, we had to have our athletes today. That's what hurt us against
Louisville last year. We didn't have B. J.  
And I told Gary and I told Adreian and I told Branden Dawson that you three
got to play because you're the closest thing we have to what they have, and we
have to win that battle, which will be on the boards and defensively and
things.  
I thought all three guys did, especially Adreian.  
If you're talking about Nix in the huddle, you know, let's blame the Palace. I
blame the Palace a little bit if you're not talking about, you know, Nix got
after Keith Appling in the huddle, but 13 years ago, you know, one of the most
famous things that ever happened to me was walking down that hallway and
listening to Mateen Cleaves get on his best friend in the world, Morris
Peterson, and I had to go in there and almost -- you know, so some things
happen in public, some things happen in private. I got asked by the TV people,
you know, Nix threw a towel at his roommate, his best friend, his guy. You
know, we have a tendency to do that. (Laughter)  
But that's what I meant about a player coached team, you know. I need players
to get on players sometimes. Sometimes, though, you know, Nix doesn't know
exactly how. You know, he's trying to please me and he doesn't know exactly
how. But trust me, you know, it was fun. Players were a lot more vocal today.
I mean, I just loved that. You know, this has been the greatest weekend we've
had of the year, because I begged those phones a little bit and I listen to
guys talk like magpies on the bus. I listen to them in the film sessions. I
told them today I'm really proud of them. I really enjoyed it, and it was fun.  
So it culminated tonight by -- we did a lot of good things, but, you know, we
made some mistakes. That's kind of who we are, and that's the only problem
with the leaderless kind of real guy. Everybody's looking on who can be the
guy. So there's a good answer. I just shot myself in the foot. (Laughter)  
Q.Can you talk about the inside-out play that you seem to really have working
maybe at a level you haven't had in a little while?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think one of them is Nix gets deep. You know, he sometimes
gets forced out.  
When he gets in deep and with A.P. shooting the ball like he can shoot it,
it's hard. You know, you got a spacing four like we had back in the day with
A.J. Granger. It opens up things.  
You know, Keith, when he's penetrating and getting the ball in and out to
Gary, you know, if you double Nix they're going to kick it out and you don't
he can score in there, and I just thought we did a really good job of that
today. The only thing that held us back the first half I thought was, number
one, they are a good team. I mean, they really are. You know, you have trouble
watching them on film and sometimes saying, okay, who they playing against,
what's going on. They got athletes. They got shooters. They got size. They got
a very good point guard. That's a very good basketball team. So that gave us
some trouble just because we were good.  
But we turned the ball over. We made some -- you know, we had 18 for the game,
and just inexcusable, and some of them were foolish turnovers. We took some
chances. I said we're playing harder. Now we got to take one more step, play
harder, tougher, and smarter. And we're taking chances on balls. Guys hitting
a three. We're taking chances on passes. You know, if anybody's got -- thinks
that the Adreian Payne to Derrick Nix fast break is in my play book, then
you're on dial a clue. (Laughter) You know, it's not. So those things got to
go, you know.  
Because you're going to get to the point where games -- and this is what I'm
trying to impress upon my team, because I do know what it takes to get there,
you got to have less mistakes, less mistakes, less mistakes, because you're
going to play better teams, and better teams, and better teams.  
  
Q. Tom, how is Keith doing shoulder-wise? Secondly, can you talk about the
job that both Travis and Denzel did today?  
COACH IZZO: Well, those two guys had a tough job. You know, Trav, I think you
saw the one time where his weight or lack thereof because of the summer he
went through, you know, hurt him. But those are some strong, physical guards,
those big guys, and they were like linebackers.  
You know, I thought Denzel, you know, he hung in there too and handled it. You
know, we just -- sometimes I think we got guys that want to do a little bit
too much for what they're ready for, and yet those two guys did a hell of a
job under the circumstances they were placed in, no Gary and no Keith for a
long time. And Gary had been playing so well. So now you don't have to guard a
Gary Harris and that makes it even more difficult. So I thought they did a
hell of a job.  
  
Q. And Keith?  
COACH IZZO: No idea. He said he could have gone back in. I think he could have
gone back in on guts alone, which worries me a little bit because he wasn't.
Coach, you know, put me in. I mean, Cleaves threatened me, so I just said go
ahead. He didn't threaten me, you know, he just kind of, I can go, Coach, you
know, and I just didn't think it was the right time.  
  
Q. Gary had been kind of struggling a little bit the last couple weeks. What
does that say about him that he stepped up so much in that first half?  
COACH IZZO: Big heart. Big heart. A lot of guts. He's a tough kid.  
I think he shines -- you know, he wants to play in the big games, I think the
big stage. You know, he's had his moments when I think he had the deer in the
headlights, but I addressed it, I told him what I thought of it, and he was
honest about it, you know. And I think that's what's been great about him. He
accepts things. He tries to change them. You know there's no question, boy,
and, yet, he was right. Give our guys credit. They gave him some step-in
three-point shots. I mean, just about every shot he took was a great assist
usually from inside somewhere, whether it be Keith, whether it be Trav. B. J.
gave him one. A.P. gave him one. Nix gave him two. You know, that was big for
us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difficulty of getting these first two wins?  
COACH IZZO: No. Sometimes these are the hardest.  
I mean, especially that first one is really hard, and then you come, and the
way it's changed since 2000 is a high seed used to get you out of the first
weekend, you know, now it barely gets you out of the first game, as we're all
seeing. So it's changed.  
And you still have that problem of convincing your team that this team that's
not one of the power six teams is good enough, whether it be Valpo, whether it
be them. I mean, I think we all have that problem. And it would be easy for
probably you guys to sit there and say, well, just tell them, you know. Try
telling your six-year-old something or your twelve-year-old or your 18-year-
old, you know, you're sometimes the dumbest person on the block. You know, so
we do tell them, but there is a reality to it, and that's what makes it hard,
I think.  
But I thought our focus today was pretty good from the start. I really do.  
  
Q. Tom, you've built this program on defense and rebounding. Can you talk
about it today?  
COACH IZZO: I thought we did a great job of that. I couldn't believe at
halftime, you know, they had eight offensive rebounds but we were rebounding
them. Man, but the second half, we dominated the boards. A.P. with his blocked
shots. We didn't give them any of those crazy dunks, you know, that Stephens
can have, and he's really good at that. I thought we handled the screen and
rolls about as well as we could. We had a little bit of a miscue there late in
the first half, but I thought we did a good job. And it was our defense and
our rebounding. It did lead to our fast breaks, which we got some.  
But the transition defense was pretty good too. We got tired a couple times
because we were out of subs. You know, we had a bad situation there when we
got Gary in foul trouble and Keith hurt and Trav struggling. So, you know,
there was a couple of times that they got them, but for the most part, I
thought we did a great job of that.  
  
Q. Tom, when you think back to when you first recruited Adreian and thought
about the potential that he had, how close was that second half to what you
thought he was capable of doing, and how critical was that with Gary, you
know, out of the game in foul trouble?  
COACH IZZO: Well, Adreian, I mean, we did want to go to him. I think they
answered to the question wrong. They probably weren't listening in the huddle.
But we did want to go to him. We wanted to go to him in the post a little bit
more. He still struggles a little bit. You know, another 10 pounds and a
little more muscle. Because they move them around in there a little bit more,
but we did want to go to him in there and we wanted to get him involved.  
What he was doing was he was putting the ball on the floor too much instead of
just moving it side to side, getting it to a ball screen where he can pick and
pop and be open. And I thought he struggled with that.  
You know, he was being guarded more or less by a guard. You know, whether it
-- no matter who it was. I think for a while they had Thomas on him a lot of
it, and that kid is strong, tough, athletic. So I think once he got in the
second half and he got over that -- at halftime we had a little talk and I
think that helped, and he was very, very good. Very good. Better than even I
thought he could be.  
  
Q. Three-point game at the half. How pleasing was it to see that you guys
had the killer instinct to put away a 30-win team like that?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, the second half, my assistants -- because I wasn't
happy with the way we were turning it over and that, and we made some very
not-smart plays. You know, we went for some steals. They hit a three. We tried
to dribble up loose balls. We turned it over. You know, things like that that
you can't do.  
So I was upset about them and they keep telling me, you know, Hey, Coach, they
only scored eight points, you know, they only scored nine points. And I think
our defense was great. I thought they missed some shots that I think they
could hit.  
I thought inside, we either played awfully well or they just missed some
shots, one of the two. So I have to look in the film and see that.  
  
Q. They went to, it looked like, a triangle and two. When did you pick up on
that and what was the adjustment?  
COACH IZZO: Well, our players did right away. We started running our man stuff
against it, to be honest with you, but it was -- I didn't think we handled it
great. We just made some plays and we got a couple breakout baskets.  
That's when we started turning the ball over. You know, we were up, I think,
13 in the first half. Is that the most we were up? You know, we made a couple
of turnovers more than -- we didn't get a chance to attack it. I think we made
three turnovers in a row on some goofy plays.  
Players talked about it in the huddle. It was harder to see that from the
bench. Gary mentioned it when he was out there. Probably a smart move by Josh.
Probably a really good move under the circumstances they were in, and yet then
we figured it out. Second half we operated against it a little bit better when
they did run it.  
  
Q. Your bigs give you advantages. There was a time where you couldn't play
those two together that much. Them being able to do this, how critical is that
to everything you want to do here?  
COACH IZZO: This team has really grown together. You know, I'm not kidding
you. A.P. and Nix have gotten to be a lot closer. They understand that one
needs the other one. If you have two posts, then one of them can't shoot. It's
easy to defend.  
A.P. being able to spread the floor has been really good.  
Nix's unselfishness, that get it in, get it out has been really good. He's
learned from last year to finish some of those instead of always kicking it
out. Remember he used to kick out layups? You know, the guy would get a layup
and he'd kick the ball out. You know, now he's found a happy medium.  
And they are playing better together, but you're right, earlier in the year it
was a big question mark. You know, what do we do with B.J.? What do we do
there?  
B.J. was more active today. Was slashing, was rebounding up under the rim. I
thought he had a couple dunks earlier that he didn't dunk. I really do mean
this, it still just shows he's not back to where he was, but I think he's
making some big progress, and he was absolutely great again as far as his
energy level. That's been fun.  
  
Q. First time Michigan and Michigan State have been in the Sweet 16 in the
same year. What are your thoughts on that?  
COACH IZZO: I was surprised today. I said to you yesterday when everybody
asked and, you know, probably shocked my media, but I'm pulling for all the
Big Ten teams. That means I was pulling for Michigan. I was pulling for
everybody today, and I didn't think that the fans would either way, but I felt
like it was almost that way. I don't know about the first game because I
wasn't out there, but it is pretty neat for our state to have two teams in one
of the greatest basketball facilities in the country and have it here in
Detroit. I thought that was pretty awesome.  
It sounds like they played pretty well, and thank God they're going to a
different region so we don't have to worry about facing another Big Ten team
right away  
But I think it was great for the fans. Great for the state of Michigan, great
for both schools.  
  
Q. Keith went about 30 minutes before he scored his first point. Is there
any limit to how this team can get the job done?  
COACH IZZO: That's what I say, we're a hard scout because the head coach
doesn't know who to expect it from all the time. So I don't know why the
opponent would.  
You know, and Keith, I thought he let the game come to him. I was pleased with
Keith's play. You know, he was getting dogged. They were double teaming him so
he couldn't get the ball early.  
Like I say, Josh did some nice things on that, I felt, but -- as he did in the
last game, but, you know, thank God we had enough other guys that rose to the
occasion. And this team is now to the point where I do think we have some
other guys. You know, we still -- Trav didn't have his best game today. Get
him a little better. You know, I think we need a little more off our bench,
but Costello gave us something and that helped.  
Yeah, we got a lot of different guys that contributed at different times.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan  78  
Virginia Commonwealth  53

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement by Coach Shaka Smart.  
COACH SMART: I thought Michigan was terrific today and they played great every
facet of the game, the guards, their big guys. You know, they obviously were
the much better team today. And if they continue playing the way they did
today, they got a chance to go a long way in this tournament.  
As for us, just was not our best game. We didn't have quite the spirit or
energy that we've had when we've been at our best. I'm not sure why. You know,
we'll certainly watch the tape and analyze it. But, again, a lot of it had to
do with Michigan. They were terrific.  
I do want to say I'm really proud of all of our guys, but particularly our
three seniors. They're the winningest class in VCU history. They won more NCAA
tournament games than anyone in the history of the program, and they're a
huge, huge reason why we're even in a position to play today. So proud of
those guys. It's too bad that their career had to end today the way that it
did, but a lot of credit goes to Michigan.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Juvonte, can you talk about Mitch McGary?  
JUVONTE REDDIC: He was a great player, you know, he was very strong in the
post, and, you know, he just outworked me tonight.  
He got the better end of the game, the top, and, you know, I expected him, you
know, to be physical like he was tonight. You know, but, yeah.  
  
Q. Rob, were you surprised at how easily Michigan appeared to be able to
break your full-court press?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: I wasn't surprised.  
I think, you know, it started with us. Like coach said earlier, we didn't have
that same energy, that same spirit we needed to get the job done.  
They took advantage of that and got open threes.  
  
Q. Rob, it was tough to make threes, but it seemed like it was really tough
to get threes. Were they long enough and quick enough to get out and make it
tough to get shots?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: You know, the shots that we -- you know, that were open, we
didn't make.  
I mean, sometimes it happens like that. You just got to shoot the ball the
same way.  
They did a good job defending, you know, me, defending Troy. But at the end of
the day, we didn't defend. So that's what it really comes down to.  
  
Q. What kind of presence did Michigan have deep under the basket and why was
rebounding or lack of it for your team critical in this game?  
JUVONTE REDDIC: It was very critical. You know, they got a lot of second
chance points off of rebounds. You know, the entire night, they just
controlled the boards. There was no point in the game where we really
controlled the boards.  
So it played a really critical point in the game tonight and, you know, that's
not going to -- if you get destroyed on the rebounds, on the boards, you know,
you're not going to win the game.  
  
Q. Rob, can you describe what your career's been, what it's meant to you to
play here at VCU?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: Can you say that again?  
  
Q. Can you describe what it's been like for your three years here and what
you think of what it's been like for the seniors here and what they've
contributed to the program?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: You know, Darius, Troy, and David, you know, provided for
this program, you know, it's going to be forever remembered. You know, they
did a great job, you know, leaving their mark.  
Right now it's all about them. You know, it's kind of tough right now, but,
you know, they're always going to be remembered here.  
  
Q. Rob, is there a point where you guys will be able to sit and sort of
reflect on what you guys were able to accomplish this year?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: You know, later on in the future, but right now, you know, I
can't do that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, student-athletes.  
We'll take questions for Coach Smart.  
  
Q. So much was made of Trey Burke and pressuring him but some other guys
handled the press pretty well, it seemed. Talk about their alternate means and
methods.  
COACH SMART: They have a lot of players and a lot of good ball handlers. I
think Burke is the best of them, but, you know, Hardaway did a nice job
against the pressure. Stauskas did a nice job. Robinson helped out.  
You know, I thought that as a team they did a good job.  
We had stretches where we bothered them. We were able to turn Burke over seven
times, which, you know s. a great number for someone that's that good of a
player, but overall, we only forced twelve turnovers, which is much lower than
what we normally do.  
They were able to, when they did break the press, really make us pay, and I'm
sure that was their game plan. We didn't fix it well enough out of the press.
So that was one of the big differences in the game.  
  
Q. Was there anything you saw in film with Mitch that would leave you to
believe he would have that kind of impact?  
COACH SMART: Well, I saw Mitch McGary quite a bit in AAU basketball. There's a
reason -- I think at one point in the year, at one point in his senior year he
was in the top two or three players in the nation. You know, he came in here
as a very talented kid, and then the coaching staff at Michigan's done an
unbelievable job molding him and teaching him how to be successful at this
level.  
He's had that motor since high school, but they've given him great guidance.
You know, he outworked us tonight or today. He was terrific. He went down and
chased all the loose balls. He was very good on the defensive end, physical
presence. You know, I knew he was really good. I certainly didn't know he was
going to have 21 and 14 against us, but, you know, that's what good players do
at this time of year; they step up and play their best.  
  
Q. You said yesterday this was -- as usual it's a risk/reward for you guys
and you knew it would be a challenge if they broke it. Talk about when they
did. They went to the basket and dunked it. Does that always happen or is that
just something that was part of their game plan?  
COACH SMART: No. They did a nice job and, you know, we did not do a very good
job fixing -- we say fixing it out of our press. You know, again, it is a
risk/reward situation, but when we've been at our best, we've been able to
press people, and even when they do break the press, we've been able to get
matched up and then make them run their half court offense.  
We did that at times tonight, but way too often Burke was able to get in the
lane, other guys were able to get in the lane. Then our big guys had to help
up, and they dropped it off to McGary or kick it out for three. And Michigan
did a tremendous job of capitalizing on those opportunities. Sometimes when
you force those type of situations, it ends up actually being good for you
because the other team takes a hurried shot and misses. But Michigan
capitalized almost every time.  
  
Q. Coach, you had to sit Darius within the first three or four machines with
foul trouble in the first half. How much did that hurt both offense and
defense?  
COACH SMART: Well, we had to sit him. We also had to sit Juvonte Reddic. Those
two are arguably our best two players.  
You know, we've dealt with foul trouble this year. It was a little
frustrating. I think the officials were kind of letting the game go a little
bit, which is good this time of year, but, you know, unfortunately Darius and
Juvonte were called for those two quick fouls.  
I think it does affect you, but the reality is you have to have other guys
come in the game and step up and play well, you know, and I don't think that's
the only reason we lost. But not having two of our best players in there
certainly affected us.  
You got to give credit to Michigan for making sure that they were on the
offensive and very aggressive the whole day.  
When we're not the most aggressive team on the floor, then that typically
doesn't bode well for us, and today we certainly were not.  
  
Q. You guys always think you're in a game obviously no matter what the score
because of your style, but was there a point in the second half when you
realized that it was just going to be too much to overcome?  
COACH SMART: Well, we never give up, if that's what you're saying. You know,
we're always going to keep playing, we're always going to keep attacking, but
they did a great job of -- once they had that lead in the second half and they
were able to break pressure, their guards kind of dribbled around, Burke and
some of their other guys. I thought the kid Albrecht did a nice job coming in
and contributing for them and playing under control.  
And then, you know, they were able to really eat a lot of clock that way. So
the game went -- the clock went faster. So certainly when that was happening,
then, you know, you don't really feel good about the way it's going.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about matchups. Was this not a good matchup for you guys
today? Second, you've got the program to the point where your goal is not to
win one game in the NCAA and go home. Can you put into words your
disappointment with this outcome?  
COACH SMART: Well, the first question is about the matchup. I think, you know,
certainly in retrospect it wasn't a very good matchup, but again the credit
for that goes to Michigan.  
I don't think that we, for whatever reason, had great bounce today and energy.
You know, our guys tried. They always do, but I think what Michigan was able
to do to us early on and us missing some easy shots around the basket and
maybe some outside looks we'd normally make that, may have contributed to our
spirit not being quite where it needed to be. So in terms of a matchup, yeah,
I think Michigan's a tough matchup. That doesn't mean that, you know, we
couldn't have won the game if we hadn't have played better. And maybe they
hadn't have played as well. But, yeah, I think it was a tough matchup for us.
That's certainly not an excuse. Excuses get you beat in the NCAA tournament.  
They just were the better team today. That's really all I can say in terms of
that.  
In terms of my disappointment, yeah, I mean, any time you lose, it's
disappointing. Any time you lose by the margin we lost by, that's even more
disappointing. And then in the NCAA tournament format, it's win or go home. So
now that we lost, we have to go home instead of, you know, moving on to the
Sweet 16, which that's a tough pill to swallow.  
I think you're trying to get at the expectation that we have to go further.  
You know, on one hand, Paul, I'm proud. I'm really proud of our guys who --
somebody told me earlier, I think we're one of seven programs in the whole
country that's won an NCAA tournament game each of the last three years. I
think that says a lot about what our guys have done and the progress we've
made as a program. But obviously today, not good enough. We need to be better.
We need to get better, and that's across the board. That's all of us. That's
what we'll set out to do.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan  78  
Virginia Commonwealth  53

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement by Coach Beilein.  
COACH BEILEIN: We're so pleased with this W today because we knew we were
playing a team -- you look at the scores, you see who they've played. They're
very efficient team and they have a unique style that, you know, one-day prep
concerned us.  
However, these guys -- this is a very high IQ team that can pick up things
very quickly, and really responded. I mean, responded -- you know, for
everybody that played in the game, even the guys that did not play, just
responded beautifully in the way we want Michigan to respond in these
situations.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Trey, can you talk about the job your teammates did in dealing with the
havoc?  
TREY BURKE: They did a really good job.  
Like Coach said, we responded to the one-day prep and we knew that VCU was a
really good team and that they were going to give us everything they had.  
They just came to the ball. Once I hit them, they attacked it, and we had
numbers and they did a really good of finishing and hitting the open jump
shot.  
  
Q. Trey, I want you to describe that pick that Mitch set for you in that
first half when you knocked the guy to the floor. Also how much you fed off
his energy today?  
TREY BURKE: That's Mitch McGary. That's what he does.  
You know, when we're in transition, sometimes he stops and sets screens, and I
seen him stopping, so I'm used it. I heard the crowd say oh and I didn't know
what happened really. But I see my man on the floor and I had the 7-foot jump
shot, so I just shot it and knocked it down.  
Like I said, that's Mitch McGary. He brings intensity to this game and he's
kind of like our X factor. He's the guy that gives us the spark and makes our
engine run in the front court.  
  
Q. Mitch, at what point or was there a point in the first half where you
realized that they really didn't have an answer for you?  
MITCH MCGARY: I mean, it didn't really happen. I was just able to get open
looks when they would attack the ball they would double team the ball. Trey
and Tim would find the open man and we would attack the basket.  
  
Q. Mitch, can you describe that screen for us? Was that the way it was
designed and did the guy say anything to you afterward?  
MITCH MCGARY: I mean, Coach usually wants us to set drag screens in
transition, and I seen Trey coming off. So I set him a good, hard screen, and
the man happened to run into my chest. (Laughter).  
It was a legal screen. I didn't mean intentionally for him to fall down, but
it happened like that.  
  
Q. How much of that is feel and how much of that -- because you had been
running to the rim, running to the rim, and then that time you stopped?  
MITCH MCGARY: Usually I look and see where Trey is. If he's pushing the ball,
maybe go set him a drag screen. If not, maybe a slip screen and slip to the
basket. Usually just run to the front of the rim.  
But if I see him, make eye contact with him, I'll go set a drag screen for
him.  
  
Q. Glenn, how long did it take you to realize that your jersey had been
torn?  
GLENN ROBINSON: I actually didn't notice it. I guess when I passed the ball to
Trey and he knocked down a three and I'm running back down the court. He
actually told me my jersey was ripped and he told the ref and I looked down
and it looked like a cutoff shirt. (Laughter)  
I'm just like wow. So I went back to the bench and had to change jerseys.  
  
Q. There was so much of a focus on turnovers coming into this game with the
havoc defense. Rebounding was a big factor in this game. Was this emphasized
during prep?  
TREY BURKE: Yeah, defensively. I think, like you said, their havoc defense is,
you know, a defense that we haven't really seen this year.  
I think Arkansas was familiar to that, but they did a really good job of
making us work and making us get the ball up the court and, you know, forcing
us to turn the ball over at different times.  
But like you said, rebounding was definitely the game plan. You know, trying
to hold them to one-and-done shots. You know, trying to get extra possessions
on offense, and I think we did a really good job and it all started with
Mitch.  
  
Q. Mitch, you had career highs in points and rebounds. Can you talk, one,
about the shots and the points you made? Talk about starting and how it makes
-- it changes the flow your game or your feel for being in the game?  
MITCH MCGARY: Mainly the shots around the basket and I was just getting open
looks. Trey and Tim and Glenn, they were all feeding me and everybody was just
feeding off the energy. So it built.  
And starting, I'm honored to be starting, but at the same time I know I have
to start -- or come off the bench and bring the same energy.  
  
Q. Tim and Glenn, just curious how you feel now unleashed, so to speak, from
the Big Ten, and we talked about how you guys maybe would find a new energy
with that. Was that found here this weekend?  
GLENN ROBINSON: You know, I believe new energy was found within our play, and
I think that we experienced some new things with this team.  
And we still run the floor and we did all the little things to help us win and
I thought that we had a great team effort from everybody today and we brought
energy from the tip and I think that's something that we need to continue to
do.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Just like Glenn said, if it wasn't for our fan base here, a
lot of the energy wouldn't have been possible. We were feeding off of them
probably the whole entire game and it just felt good to just go out there
playing as hard as you can knowing that you had a crowd behind you.  
  
Q. Tim, talk about these two games and starting to gain some momentum. After
finishing the regular season that way in the Big Ten tournament, now you have
a lot of momentum going into the next round of the tournament. Talk about what
that feels like.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: It feels great, especially when you have a group of guys
out here that are playing -- just playing mindless basketball and just going
out there and having fun.  
We know we got to be poised and we got to make smart plays while we're out
there, but Coach Beilein always trusts us to just go out there and have fun,
and if you keep doing that, then we go a long way.  
  
Q. Trey, a lot of people talked about VCU as a matchup problem for you, but
when you saw them, were you pretty excited about the matchup for you guys?  
TREY BURKE: Yeah, I was excited. You know, VCU's, they're a heck of a team.
They're coached by a really good coach.  
And I knew that they were going to bring it. I knew that they were going to
run and jump and turn me over. I knew it wasn't going to be a perfect game for
any of us. So I just tried to find different ways to attack it, find different
ways to get the ball in the middle, you know, get out of transitions to try to
get numbers.  
  
Q. Trey, what did you think of Spike's contributions today? Second, Tim, on
that transition dunk that you had, walk us through that?  
TREY BURKE: Spike is, you know, a guy that comes off the bench and, you know,
we have so much faith in him because we see him every day in practice. You
know, we know what he's really capable of doing out there. Once he gets his
shot, he gets it done. He comes out and, you know, he penetrates really well.
He can knock down the open shot and.  
One thing that he's really special -- that's really special about him is he
finds the open man. He sees things that, you know, some players won't see,
most players won't see. And I definitely think he's a guy that can come in,
you know, spell me time or even play the off guard with me. You know, as long
as he can come in and do what he did today, then Spike's going to be fine.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: On that dunk, I think Glenn got the rebound and pitched it
up to Nik -- I mean to Trey and then Trey pitched it up to Nik, and I knew I
was ahead of Nik. So, I mean, Coach Beilein always said if you're going to do
something flashy, it better work.  
(Laughter) You know, I just tried to do the easiest dunk that I knew how to do
or how to do it, so it ended up being that.  
  
Q. Trey, talk about the feeling of getting to a Sweet 16, how big is that
for you? Mitch, talk about having such a big game at such a big time during
the tournament?  
TREY BURKE: It feels really good. We're definitely proud, honored to be able
to play in the Sweet 16.  
At the same time, we still know that we have work to do. It feels so good just
because last year, it was so devastating, you know, how bad the locker room
was after we lost in the first game to Ohio. So just to have the opportunity
to go to Dallas and to play in the Sweet 16, in this tournament, that's filled
with the best teams in the country is definitely an honor.  
MITCH MCGARY: Going off the good game, I mean, everybody's capable on our team
to have any game -- a good game at any time, and I think the guys are just
finding me in transition and easy baskets.  
I think going off of that, that our team realizes that anybody can score any
time. So some people don't really -- we don't have to rely on Trey always to
score whenever we're down or something.  
  
Q. Trey, how would you compare this crowd to Thursday, and how much of an
importance was that and how much will it be missed as you move on to the Sweet
16?  
TREY BURKE: Oh, it was very similar to Thursday. The crowd was behind us on
Thursday and they were behind us tonight.  
Like Tim said, I definitely think that was a boost.  
As far as the crowd being missed, I'm not sure if it will be missed. I know we
have a lot of alumni around the world. I'm sure that we'll have a pretty nice
fan base in Texas. So I'm looking forward to it. We're all looking forward to
it.  
  
Q. Mitch, when somebody asks you about that pick, you got a big grin on your
face. Are you kind of a football player at heart? And after two months of
physical play in the big at the point, what was it like to be the biggest guy
out on the floor today?  
MITCH MCGARY: I mean, I feel like, I guess it was easy to grab rebounds. I
just wanted it more, and I felt like just going after loose balls, it was easy
for me to grab them and throw them up to Trey for transition.  
I think the screen, I guess I kind of have a football mentality. I played it
growing up, but that's just my mentality, just hard-nosed, blue collar guy who
likes to do the nitty-gritty stuff.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, student-athletes.  
Coach Beilein will now be available for questions to the general media.  
  
Q. I asked you earlier in the week -- I don't think you liked it, but what
getting through this first weekend would mean for your program. Now that it's
happened, how big of a step really was this or was it at all?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, our philosophy is always going to be we're just
trying to get better every day. We're just trying to do the right things, and
there's going to be times that we will play this well as we did today and
we'll advance.  
You know, with this, given the -- as I said that day, given the makeup of this
roster, you don't know what to expect. And the way they played today, that was
terrific. I mean, there wasn't this scientific game plan to get things done.
They reacted and played against pressure like they've worked so hard to be
able to do.  
So it's great for the program. At the University of Michigan, right, we want
to be champions, and we're trying for Big Ten championships. And when you get
in the NCAA tournament, you're trying to do the exact same thing. At the same
time, it wasn't going to make or break us knowing the new facilities, the
recruits, the guys coming back, I feel were really in a good place.  
  
Q. Coach, is it safe to say Mitch has locked up a starting position going
forward in the Sweet 16? How do you keep a freshman bring that same intensity
every game?  
COACH BEILEIN: With the CBS games and the extra timeout, we could give him
more time, but he has been -- you know, we've watched his growth. He's at his
lowest of his weight all year long. This is his lowest body weight that he's
had. So he can play longer than he was earlier.  
What I love is he's got -- he did a couple things yesterday or two days ago in
a game that -- reads that only really bright players can figure out. And he
has all those things, but the processing through it, like every freshman, it
takes him time. He's doing a wonderful job right now. So it's not just, you
know, he's big and he's got talent. Figuring out the college game takes some
time too, and every day he gets closer to it.  
  
Q. Coach, you still smile every time somebody says Spike's name. Can you
talk about the job he did?  
COACH BEILEIN: That was the one outlier we knew we had in here against the
press. With the one day's rest, with the attention, I mean, those guards are
really good at turning people over, and just stealing the ball from you. So we
knew that Trey could not handle that the whole day. Sometimes we kept -- I
think he played all 39 minutes, but just if he plays off the ball, he can
stand there for a second. Anybody's who's ever played basketball, when you're
dribbling and people are doubling you and people are doing all kinds of
things, it is tiring. So that was huge for Spike to be able to come in and
just give him some rest, and he was standing on the chair singing the Victors
because our team loves him. They love playing with him, and he did a wonderful
job.  
  
Q. Coach, how important has Tim Hardaway, Jr. been in this tournament run
for you?  
COACH BEILEIN: Tim Hardaway has not only been important in this game; he's
been important for all three years.  
You remember when he decided to come here, we were coming off a disappointing
year. He started, you know, as a freshman he was coming in at 170 pounds and
he started every game since then. So when he has had opportunities like he's
had the last couple days to pass, to bring the ball up against the pressure,
that wouldn't have happened last year, right. So make the right -- the smart
plays, to defend.  
I just watched this young man's game, and it grows every day. Others may not
see it that way. I see it just growing. I think his ceiling is very high, and
today he played to that.  
  
Q. How long did you really have to prepare for this type of -- were you
doing it all week before?  
COACH BEILEIN: No.  
  
Q. You just had this one day basically?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, I would think that people probably think that we can
do all those things. You know, I thought South Dakota State gave us challenges
we needed to win this one. And knowing that our team is -- I consider them to
have a very high IQ, that they could handle whatever we saw from either Akron
or VCU.  
I will admit I did watch -- I did not watch Akron on video. I did watch one
VCU game thinking they would be the favorite because Akron had some losses
through attrition.  
So it was one day, but Mitch, what we try and do, I mean, every day we are
practicing ball possession. Don't turn the ball over. Flow it to the outside
hand. Boring stuff that would put you all to sleep. To catch it on two feet,
pivot strong. So when we do see it we don't have to talk about it. It's
somewhat natural to them.  
  
Q. Did you figure and plan that Mitch would be an option because he's not
likely to be dribbling the ball up or get swung that way? Did he surprise you
with his production today?  
COACH BEILEIN: No. What we're trying to do is really make sure that he can
play both in the high post and the low post, and he can do some things out on
the perimeter that guards can do. Channeling it to do it the right way, we see
this huge spike in him understanding why -- to make a whole lot of good plays
and don't focus on great plays. Just make good plays. Finish.  
Because he might have brought the ball down and tried to dunk three of those
today, right, and he's just learning what winners and champions do.  
He's got a great family. He's really worked very hard to get to where he is
right now, and we love coaching him, because he's a team guy through and
through.  
  
Q. You've obviously emphasized defense, but talk about the way you guys have
played in these first games and the emphasis on that?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think we've played two of the best -- let's talk about Nik
Stauskas for a second playing. We played two of the best three-point shooters,
shooting teams that we've played, and with volume.  
VCU shoots more threes than us. So we had to shut that down on the perimeter,
and they all did a good job on it. And then defensively we did not give up the
offensive rebound that has plagued us at times this year.  
They're not as big as some of the teams they've played, but they could still
go -- I was very concerned about that, that they'd have the quickness to just
get the loose ones. We really kept them off from getting second opportunities
through two ways: Offensive rebounds and then turning the ball over. With 12
turnovers against this team, I think that was as big a factor as our
rebounding difference.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Beilein.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS: AUBURN
HILLS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUBURN+HILLS)

  

## March 22, 2013

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

### [Darius Theus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23532)

  
_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll open up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Darius, we'll start with you. Big matchup here. Can you talk about what
you've seen of them and specifically Trey Burke and what you need to do to
defend him?  
DARIUS THEUS: He's their leader. And we just going to come out and just
playing VCU basketball, you know. Pressure the ball, deny the wings. Do what
we do.  
As long as they're about it, it's just doing what Coach Smart has for us, and
then we should be fine. They got some real good players, though.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk maybe specifically about why they're so good with the
ball, protecting the ball?  
DARIUS THEUS: We just got to cause havoc, I guess, be aggressive on the
defensive end. Try to speed them up.  
They do a real good job of taking care of the ball, so we just can speed them
up and just do havoc. Then I think we can have pretty good success.  
  
Q. Are there things that Burke does that are different from other guards
you've seen on film?  
DARIUS THEUS: No, I mean he's a good point guard. Probably the best point
guard in the country, some say.  
We just got to do what we do. You know, we can't make it a big deal about Trey
Burke. We just got to be VCU and just do the best we can to speed him up and
play our type of basketball.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll begin with an opening statement by Coach Smart.  
COACH SMART: Thanks.  
We're excited about the game tomorrow. Great challenge in University of
Michigan. Coach Beilein is someone I've looked up to for a long, long time.
When I got my first opportunity at the Division I level, I was coordinator of
basketball operations at University of Dayton under Oliver Purnell. And at
that time Coach Beilein was at Richmond. They had just joined the Atlantic
Ten.  
Just gained a ton of respect for him and what he does back then, and followed
him over the years, and just really impressed with the programs that he's
built. You know, now here at Michigan, he's got tremendous talent and, you
know, guys that make a lot of plays. So it will be a heck of a challenge for
us tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what makes Michigan so good at taking care of
the basketball? They turn it over less than anybody in the country.  
COACH SMART: Well, I think their system is one that emphasizes spacing. So
they always have terrific spacing on the floor.  
But more so than that, it's about their personnel. They've got great guards.
Trey Burke is, you know, a lot of people's pick for National Player of the
Year. I haven't seen a guard better than him. But not only do they have Trey
Burke, but they've got several other guards that are very savvy, very poised
with the basketball, and they're guys that don't make a lot of mistakes and
are hard to speed up.  
  
Q. Is there a worry that if you press too much that you're leaving lanes?
You're vulnerable on the backside for them to finish at the rim?  
COACH SMART: Well, it's always a risk/reward situation. If you press, you're
extending your defense past half court. That's why most people don't press,
because they want to get back and pack it in.  
But that's not what we do. You know, we press. We extend our defense. We try
to make teams uncomfortable. So in answer to your question, there's no doubt
that, you know, you're putting yourself at risk sometimes for teams to break
the press and get opportunities on the other end.  
But, you know, with what we do, hopefully the reward outweighs the risk.  
  
Q. You were very complimentary of Coach Beilein last night and obviously a
moment ago. Would you mind talking about some of the specific things that you
like about his coaching philosophy and methods?  
COACH SMART: Well, we had a guy on our staff, Mike Jones, for two years, my
first two years of VCU, who worked for Coach Beilein. So he let us in on some
of the stuff on the inside that maybe people wouldn't know about if they
hadn't been around him.  
And then I've kind of watched him from the outside. I think, first of all, he
has a unique system and a unique way of doing things that -- most coaches just
kind of follow each other. There's kind of a herd mentality, whatever's
working for other people, they're going to do. But he's very unique. He's
different.  
The way that his offense has worked over the years -- there's actually a
screen that we call a Michigan screen because it's a specific type of action
that he used way back when he was at Richmond. He used it at West Virginia,
and now they're very good at it now at Michigan.  
Again, great spacing. They're not so based on specific position. This is our
one, this is our two, this is our three, this is our four. They've got a lot
of interchangeable guys. I think he's done a great job in recruiting over the
years. Certainly he has some very, very recognizable names now. But he's won
in previous years with some guys that, you know, most recruiting experts, you
know, would never have said were high-level players.  
He's someone who has a great eye for talent and a great eye for what's going
to work in his system.  
  
Q. Kind of the book on Trey, since he got to Michigan was he was a poised
guard, and your system is to shake somebody up. Is this one of those really
big tests to see if you could shake up a guy that hasn't been shook up by
anybody to this point?  
COACH SMART: It certainly is. Yes, I think it's a great test for our guys. And
you know, we've played against some terrific guards over the course of this
year, but Trey Burke is as good or better than any of them.  
It's a great challenge. As my college coach once told me, it's too late to
cancel. You know, we're going to play the game and we're going to do
everything we can to win the game, and we're looking forward to it.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with the student-athletes for Memphis.  
  
Q. D.J., can you talk a little bit about how far you've come in your career?
Coach talked about it yesterday, sort of an unheralded recruit to a guy who's
had a dramatic impact on the program.  
D.J. STEPHENS: Yes, sir.  
I've definitely come a long way. If you'd have looked at me my freshman year
and you look at me now, you'd think I'm a completely different person. I've
grown as a basketball player and as a person myself. I've worked on a lot of
things. I've overcome a lot of barriers, and I just say I'm blessed to be
where I am today.  
  
Q. Tarik and Joe, D.J. only averaged like eight minutes last season. Did you
see anything at the beginning of the year that allowed him to get to where he
is now?  
TARIK BLACK: For D.J., it's always been a confidence thing. We've always told
him he has the talent and ability to do anything he wants to on the court. It
was just a matter of him locking in and mentally being prepared and focusing
on the season and knowing what it is that he's capable of and understanding
what he's capable of. And now he understands it and he's produced so well for
us this year.  
JOE JACKSON: Over the past couple years, D.J. didn't get a lot of playing
time, but you always could see from the spurts in the game that he can do some
amazing things.  
He's been doing amazing things since I've been playing for Memphis. D.J.
Stephens, he worked hard this summer individually with Coach Collins and some
of the guard coaches, and it's just shown, you know, people that when you work
hard, you know, things can happen for you good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about last year, the mistakes that you guys -- what you did
in the NCAA Tournament that you learned from and also playing a team that is
seasoned in this environment?  
TARIK BLACK: Yes, sir.  
Last season we were very anxious to play, more so nervous, and when you come
to a tournament like this, you have to understand, the anxiety's going to be a
part of it. If you care about the game, you're going to be anxious to play.
But you shouldn't be nervous. You should be confident of your team, confident
of your scheme.  
That's what we came in this season, this tournament right here, we understand
we're a great team. We understand what we're capable of and we appreciate our
value. In the past, we hadn't done that. Going into tournaments we thinking
that, okay, we could win this game but we weren't set in stone that yes
Memphis is a legit team and a legit threat.  
Going against a team like Michigan State and Tom Izzo, they're a great team.
Needless to say, they were top ten in the country, but at the same time we're
a powerful threat and everybody knows that. So we're going to go out there and
play a hard game and we're going to see who comes out with the win.  
JOE JACKSON: Playing against Michigan State, I mean, they're going to play
hard, play physical.  
It's other teams in the country we've played against like Louisville, they
play the same type of game, but, you know, they're more of a slow down team
and try to get it into the post. We just got to play great defense for 40
minutes. That's what it's going to come down to, I mean, because the coaches
are not out there playing basketball. It's still the players.  
The guys that's on the floor, we just got to come to play and leave everything
out there. Play harder than the next team. That's the only way you can win a
game in the NCAA tournament anyway.  
D.J. STEPHENS: I just feel coming into this tournament, we're a more seasoned
team. We have a lot more experience under our belt.  
We've in a lot of tough situations this season that we've been able to
overcome. I think this team understands what it takes to win games, even in
tight situations. And I just feel like we're a lot more prepared for this
tournament. I mean, we understand that we're going to get everybody's best
shot. We understand it's going to be a tough game night in, night out. We
understand that we're a great basketball club. And when you have that and you
understand all that stuff, you just have the confidence night in, night out to
just play your best basketball.  
  
Q. Talk about you guys getting the first win in NCAA, in the last three
seasons, how does it feel?  
D.J. STEPHENS: I mean, it was a good win for us, but we're a great basketball
team. We didn't expect just to win that one game and then pack it up and go
home. We definitely want to try to win a national championship and we want to
win as many games as we possibly can.  
I mean, we're happy we won it, but we're not done with yet. I mean, we still
have basketball to play. So you can't really focus on that one win too much.  
JOE JACKSON: Well, you know, it was a great win for our program to come out
and get that victory, that first victory because with the group of guys that
we have in our locker room, we haven't won a tournament game. So to get that
winning feeling back that we can win in a tournament, that's going to help us
a lot, more than we even can imagine.  
I mean, we didn't come here to win one game.  
Hopefully we can leave here with two wins and we've been practicing and
working so hard all year. We've been against the walls the whole year up and
down, but we got so much talent in the locker room, if we just -- we put it
all together, we can beat anybody.  
TARIK BLACK: I know we talking a lot about getting more wins and this first
one, but needless to say, we appreciate the win. We don't take it for granted
at all.  
A lot of teams don't get to win in an NCAA tournament, period. So we
appreciate the win, but at the same time, like we're always saying, my eyes
are set way further down the road than the first win. You have to get the
first win in order to advance, so, yeah, we like, but at the same time,
there's much more in store for us.  
  
Q. D.J., what have the last 24 hours been like for you. Are friends blowing
you up? Anything overwhelming?  
D.J. STEPHENS: I mean, all that stuff is amazing, but I can't really focus too
much on all that. I mean, I still have basketball to play on my teammates.  
I can't really worry about what people are saying good or bad. I just have to
focus on the goal ahead and that's helping my team win games.  
  
Q. Talk about this experience, getting this first NCAA tournament win behind
you.  
TARIK BLACK: This is a great experience for us, especially for the university
and for our city.  
Being raised in the city, you understand how big and detrimental Memphis
basketball is to the city. Like you understand how big of an issue it is.  
Me personally, I wasn't even a basketball fan. Never watched the NCAA game
before. The first game I ever watched was Memphis in a national title game. So
that goes how to show you how big and how heavy it is for Memphis and for us
to get a win on the first one and then try to continue our season and try to
do something special for the city, it just means that much more for us.  
JOE JACKSON: Well, this is great to, you know, uplift the city. The city has
been down for a couple years, but we're known for, you know, great basketball
players winning in the NCAA tournament, going to the Final Four and stuff. So
we just doing what we supposed to do. Winning in the tournament, I mean, we
just so blessed to continue the tradition, continue to get another chance to,
you know, go further in the tournament. We just trying to make Memphis proud
and make our fans proud. That's really all we trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach Izzo, when he was speaking with us, said that he thought maybe
you've played your best game that he's seen this year. Talk about the game you
had and also talk about the bigs for Michigan State.  
TARIK BLACK: Like we talked with yesterday, Joe put the ball in my hands
early. He put the ball in my hands and that shows the trust that he had in me
to do something positive with the ball, because he can easily pull it out and
run another play, do anything with it, but he passed me the ball and he told
me, he was like Tarik, you need to do what you have to do. Be productive for
us. That's what I plan on being. I plan on being aggressive and productive.  
As far as Michigan State goes with their bigs, they have good bigs in Nix and
Adreian Payne. But at the same time I'm -- I consider myself a prominent
threat. So as much as we could talk to them about how their bigs play, they
have to worry about us on the other end as well with me and Shaq and D.J. and
Ferrakohn.  
  
Q. Joe, can you give us your perspective of what happened with you in the
Bahamas and what you learned from that? Also assess your matchup with Keith
Appling?  
JOE JACKSON: It was so long ago, but, I mean, I just learned a valuable
lesson, just to continue to work.  
It was still only one game where I just -- I was kind of disappointed, but I
just bounced back. Man, you know, like anybody else. Work hard, just bounce
back and get your confidence back up and just play basketball.  
You know, I really wasn't stressed out like that like I was my freshman and
sophomore year after that game because I knew it could be rocky. Nobody said
it was going to be perfect because I'm junior. I just have to continue to
work. And with Keith Appling, I played against him before and I mean none of
the guys on the court are not NBA allstars. I mean, he laces his shoes up just
like me. So just go out there and play ball.  
  
Q. Everyone sort of raves about your ability, your leaping ability, but how
have you honed your skills to be so effective as a shot blocker?  
D.J. STEPHENS: Well, my advantage on the court is my athleticism, but it's
also a curse as well. I'm only six-five, and I don't weigh that much but I'm
athletic. It has its positives and negatives.  
I mean, if a guy outweighs me, if he gets his body into me, I can't use my
special abilities, but I just try to keep space in between me and a defender
and try to block the shot once it goes in the air, or better for me if I come
from weakside and I'm able to block shots. I mean, that's where I'm better at.  
Or on the offensive end where my teammates put the ball where the majority of
the population can't get it, but luckily I can. I mean, I just feel blessed to
be able to do things like that.  
  
Q. Tarik and Joe, can you give us a little insight into how Coach Pastner
works?  
JOE JACKSON: Okay.  
Coach Pastner, he's a very energetic guy. He's a great person. He's a good
coach. He understands strategies.  
He's all about two things, and that's defensive rebound and 50/50 balls.  
He's not one of these big-time offensive trying to set up plays type of coach,
but as long as you play defense and you rebound, I mean, anybody can play for
him, and that's really what you get from Coach Pastner.  
He's always upbeat no matter if we lost five games in a row, he's always
positive. That's all you can ask for him from a coach, you know, somebody from
a leadership position, is to be positive all the time and trying to get us to
play better and better.  
TARIK BLACK: Buying into the system is very easy for us because, like Joe
said, he's a simple guy. He's not a guy of many -- he's not very complicated.
He's not saying do this, do that, do this, do that. Like he said, he just
wants you to basically play with energy. You know, 50/50 balls, defensive
rebound is a definite. Get on the offense glass and just play hard. If you do
that you're in good graces in Coach Pastner's eyes. So it's not really hard to
play for him, because if you play hard, you're okay.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Gentlemen.  
Questions for Coach Pastner.  
COACH PASTNER: This is a good man right here by the way if you haven't
noticed. Really good man. Does a great job.  
Opening remarks, we're playing a great Michigan State team. There's no
question that Coach Izzo is one of the great coaches in all of sport, doesn't
matter if even just basketball.  
I said it yesterday, he should be in the hall of fame. I mean, he's going to
be so we might as well just put him in. There's no reason to wait on it,
because it's going to be. So let's just, you know, let's not even wait and get
him in, and he's tremendous.  
Michigan State's a great basketball team. This will be a road game for us.
We're excited and ready for the challenge. You know, we're a good team too.
You know, we've won 31 games. We got a lot of speed, quickness, and
athleticism. And I think Saturday's going to be a high-level game, just a very
high level game against two good teams. So we're excited to play.  
We have great respect for Michigan State. You know, they're an elite
rebounding team. Elite. Not great, but elite. And everybody nose in the
profession Coach Izzo's, you know, his reputation as a rebounding coach. Heck,
I've watched five of his championship video products this offseason, and
actually, our rebounding has been the best this year based on Coach Izzo's
drills. So if we outrebound him somehow tomorrow, it's a credit to Coach Izzo
because I stole all those drills from championship video products in April.  
  
Q. What concerns you most about this Michigan State team? How do you prepare
for them?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, Valpo gave up 20 offensive rebound. You're not going to
be a great team giving up 20 offensive rebounds.  
I mean, look, it's very simple. This is a players' game. If we make shots,
that's great, and we don't give up offensive rebound, we probably have a good
chance to win. If they make shots and they tell a bunch of offensive rebound,
they got a better chance to win. I mean, it's really simple.  
You know, Doc, I've always believed simple is powerful. You know, just, hey,
here's what it is. We can overthink, overanalyze, paralysis through analysis,
but it comes down to who's making shots, who's going to rebound the ball.
Players make plays and whichever players are going to make the most plays,
that team's going to win the game.  
That coach will look like he knows what he's doing. If that's me -- Coach
Izzo's already in the hall of fame, so it doesn't matter whether they win or
lose.  
  
Q. Everything you just said about obviously players, it's a players' game.
There's a lot of comparisons about the athleticism on both sides. How would
you analyze the coaching match up?  
COACH PASTNER: I said yesterday in the press conference that he knows that I'm
a filibuster. So I can go on and on, but I did say that I need to win some
more games. If I'm going to run for senator or congress, I need to win a lot
more games. Coach Izzo could run for governor in the state of Michigan and win
today. That's the big difference. And on top of that, he's going to the hall
of fame. I mean, he's a legend. He's one of the great coaches in all of sport.
I mean, he's great for our game. He's been tremendous for coaches. He's a down
to earth guy and, you know, so for me it's an honor to coach against him. Like
I said, there's no need to even wait. Why we're waiting to put him in the hall
of fame, the guy should already be in.  
And if the school hasn't given him a lifetime contract, I think they should
give him a lifetime contract too.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about D.J.'s development. How gratifying is it to
you as a coach to see that?  
COACH PASNTER: Yeah, I mean, look, D.J. was a zero star recruit. And like I
said, I took him sight unseen seven days before school started because I just
needed players and I got the job, we just needed to sign some guys. We had
like five or six scholarship players. We had to take somebody. I got a mass
e-mail that he wanted to play Division I. Nobody thought he was good enough.
He had some Division II offers. I said what can he do. He said he can jump. I
took him. Like I said, he was crying when I called him. I told this story
yesterday, when I saw him that first day, I started crying because he couldn't
play. He stunk, and he couldn't dribble and everything. I was like I made a
major mistake.  
Well, that first year he got a little better and during that first year, he
helped us win a lot of games making energy winning plays. I mean, that was big
for him. And then he did the same his sophomore year, did the same his junior
year. And this year he's just been fantastic. I mean, he's turned himself into
a pro prospect. He's going to be a second round draft pick because he makes
winning energy plays. I believe in energy, if you haven't already said that,
if you haven't known me, but I do. Not only does he make energy plays, he
makes winning energy plays, positive winning energy plays.  
He's been phenomenal.  
Let me just say this: He wanted to be in our Memphis Madness, he wanted to do
in the dunk contest, you know, he wanted to do some props. He wanted to jump
over a convertible, dunk the ball, land in the convertible, and drive off, and
I wouldn't let him. If he's on the NBA roster next year, which he'll be in the
NBA roster and Commissioner Stern allows him to be in the dunk contest, I'm
telling you right now, he will win the dunk contest if they allow him in it.
He's that good of a leaper.  
Now, let me say this: I can't put up a million dollars like Magic Johnson did
like with LeBron, but if somebody's willing to put up a million dollars for
D.J. Stephens for the dunk contest, I guarantee he's going to win the dunk
contest.  
His dunks that he does even behind the scenes is surreal, and he's not just an
athlete, he makes basketball plays. That's what's special about him.  
  
Q. Coach, can you tell us what led to Joe Jackson's benching, if you will,
in the Bahamas and how much it has helped you that he's bounced back. And also
assess the point guard matchup?  
COACH PASNTER: Yeah, I mean, Joe has been terrific. I mean, the guy's -- I
mean, think about, first of all, he's been back-to-back MVP of the conference
tournament. His first two years, he's MVP player of the year for the
conference this year.  
You know, I'm an intense guy, but I don't curse. And so, you know, I believe
that the best motivating factor is the bench. If somebody's not producing, I
believe in production, and if someone's not getting the job done, the best way
to do it to make a point is instead of screaming and yelling at them is to sit
them.  
And Joe didn't play well in the Bahamas his first two games, so I sat him.
That third game when we played Northern Iowa, he was terrific. He was
terrific. And from that point to where we are now, he's been absolutely
awesome with a capital A. I'm very, very proud of Joe. He's been a great
energy guy for us by not just scoring but I'm talking by coming up with 50/50
balls, by sticking his nose in and being a really good guard rebounder. I
think yesterday he had seven boards. That was big. And I'm big about guard
rebounding.  
And you look at his numbers, the way he shoots the ball, I mean, he's been
just at a high level with his shooting.  
  
Q. And the point guard matchup?  
COACH PASNTER: Keith Appling is really, really good.  
They both know each other from their days in USA basketball. They're both
juniors. It's hard -- I'm not as much big on individual matchups because this
isn't tennis or golf. It's a team game, and it's got to be -- for us to win
the game, it's not going to be one matchup, it's got to be the team. We're
going to have to rebound the basket, and that's including our guard
rebounding, but I think Keith Appling's really good. I think he's a really
good player.  
I mean, look, they got pro -- multiple pros in their starting lineup. They got
McDonald's All Americans in their starting lineup. I mean, this is a great
team that we're playing, great team.  
  
Q. Talk about what this means for the City of Memphis, for you guys to
advance, and not only that, talk about the streak that Memphis owns against
Michigan State?  
COACH PASNTER: Well, I would like to say that I could get credit for that
streak, but I think that goes back to John Calipari. So we have not -- I
personally have not coached against Coach Izzo as a head coach.  
You know, I coached against him as an assistant when I was at the University
of Arizona a couple times but never as a head coach. So this streak and that
stuff, that goes back with Coach Calipari.  
You know, what this means to the City, you know how important this is to the
City, the Memphis Tiger basketball. It's everything. This city is so
passionate. They're so emotionally invested. It's their team. It's not my
team; it's their team, and I'm just happy -- for this win yesterday was for
our young men, our student-athletes, but also for the city, for Tiger Nation.
I know how much they wanted to win. So that was important.  
Really, the burning desire inside is for them to be happy, and I know for them
to be happy is when you got great student-athletes and also you can win too.
So we wanted to try to do both for them.  
  
Q. Coach, on D.J., was he just in the gym all summer or was there a moment
where you saw that everything sort of clicked that allowed him to become the
player that he is?  
COACH PASNTER: Well, I mean, I don't know if it's any -- he's been doing that
his four years with us. It's just this year he had surgery in the off season
that allowed him to clear up -- he had an asthma issue his first three years,
and he had surgery in the off season that allowed him to be able to clear up
his asthma issue. That's why he's able to play such long minutes. So this
isn't new. He's been doing this his entire time. He has won us so many games
through his career here, his freshman, sophomore, and junior now. It's just
people are taking notice now and he's obviously done it this year. He's made
so many plays throughout his career. I can think of games where he saved us.  
It's not even just the stats. Affecting shots at the last second or making a
heroic save out of bounds to keep ball alive. I mean, he makes so many winning
energy plays.  
  
Q. What did you learn from last year's NCAA tournament experience? Also,
Coach Izzo's known for his one-day preps. As an opposing coach, is it daunting
to go against somebody who's a master at that? Lastly, he talked about you
sending him letters. Can you talk about what was in those letters and that
communication?  
COACH PASNTER: Well, the first thing is -- your first question was learned
from last year; that's right.  
The biggest thing I learned from last year was we spent five, six days
preparing for St. Louis and we had paralysis through analysis. We
overanalyzed, overcoached, thought we should do this. It was just too much St.
Louis. And St. Louis is a good team, obviously. They deserved to beat us. You
know, they played great. But we overanalyzed, and paralysis through analysis.  
I said this year, man, we're not doing that. We're focusing on Memphis. I
thought it was a blessing in disguise that we didn't have to know our opponent
until late Tuesday night. So it was just a simple, quick turnaround and just
go play, less time to prepare, which means less time to overthink,
overanalyze, overcoach, over game plan, and I thought that was good for us. So
we'll do the same thing. We'll have a quick turnaround here and just go play.
So that's what I have learned from last year.  
Regarding Coach Izzo, I mean, it's not daunting because, like I said, this is
a players' game. I mean, I can assure you, we've won, you know, whatever,
100-and-some-odd games in my four years here and I've never thrown an assist,
I've never shot a shot or grabbed a rebound. So, I mean, this is a players'
game. Players make shots, we grab some rebounds, you know, coach looks like he
knows what he's doing. So I understand it's a players' game.  
Like I said, I think it's an honor to coach against Coach Izzo. I mean, the
guy is -- he should be in the hall of fame. And I'm not just saying that to
say that he should be in the hall of fame; he's going to be in. So what's the
holdup?  
Second thing is, is he's one of the great coaches regardless of sport. This
just isn't in basketball. I mean, this is regardless of sport. He's one of the
great coaches of all time. I mean, just of all time. And he's a good guy.  
You know, those letters I wrote, you know, I was reaching out to coaches and
this and that, and I'm sure he had some open assistant spots, and so I was
applying for them probably. But, fortunately, you know, things kind of worked
out as it was. I got great opportunities with Coach Olson in Arizona, then got
a great opportunity with Coach Calipari as Memphis and been very fortunate
where I've been to be able to have been under some great coaches.  
But like I said, I got all of his championship rebounding videos, and we were
plus seven I think during the year. Our best rebounding year is this year,
which is through my four years, which is a credit to his championship videos,
about four of them.  
  
Q. On the topic of rebounding, could you talk about Shaq and Tarik and how
they've developed this season and what their challenges are with Payne and
Nix?  
COACH PASNTER: Yeah, we need Shaq and Tarik to play really at a high level for
us. There's no doubt about that. Those guys have got to be really good for us.
They got to stay on the floor. They can't get in foul trouble, and we need
them to be solid. We just need them to be sound and solid, and we're a very,
very good team when we keep it simple.  
I mean, look, we're the first Memphis Tiger team in the history of Tiger
basketball to have three guys with a hundred assists or more. We're a very
unselfish team. We move the ball. We make the extra pass. We make the hockey
assist. We're good at that. So we just need to be simple. We don't need to go
for home runs or triples. We just need to hit singles, and that includes the
bigs. They just need to be simple, sound, and solid, and if we do that, that
helps our chances to have an opportunity to win the game.  
In fact, I was talking to Dwayne Stephens, the assistant at Michigan State in
April in Minnesota, at a tournament in Minnesota, picking his brain about what
Michigan State does on rebounding this past April. I did that too. So if we're
at any chance to have any rebounding margin, I got everything from Michigan
State, and they did help us. Honestly, it was -- we've been our best
rebounding team this year since I've been there.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 22, 2013

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Trey Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22847)

### [Tim Hardaway, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21925)

  
_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you could tell me what type of coach John Beilein is. If
you could, please, elaborate and tell me does he push your buttons by yelling
and screaming? Is he analytical? Is he patient? What does he do to get the
best out of you guys?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Coach Beilein's very patient with the team, and one thing
that makes Coach Beilein really special is he's a teacher of the game. He
really takes film very seriously when you're not having practice that much.  
And he really wants his guys to really learn the fundamentals of the game and
just try to make the game easier for yourself while you're being coached by
him. So that's one aspect of Coach Beilein that's really important to know
about him.  
TREY BURKE: Oh, I would say Coach Beilein, like he said, is definitely
patient.  
He's one of the coaches -- the few coaches that I've played with my whole life
that takes the, you know, game -- I wouldn't say seriously, but, you know, he
prepares us so well by just having us come in for film and just making sure
we're going into the game prepared.  
He feels like, you know, he failed if he feels like we didn't watch enough
film or prepare enough for the next team.  
And another thing about Coach Beilein, he's a player's coach. He definitely
lets his players play free and, you know, he lets you play with freedom out
there. You know, anybody would love to play for him.  
  
Q. Trey, what is the challenge of playing against this havoc defense?  
TREY BURKE: The challenge is just playing patient, really. You know, we
haven't played a lot of teams in the Big Ten that press the way that they do.
Well, we haven't played anyone.  
So we just have to play patient, play smart, and limit turnovers. They score
off of turnovers really well, and you know, they call their defense havoc. So
we just have to try not to allow them to force havoc and just play patient,
play at our own pace.  
  
Q. You didn't play against a lot of teams that play like this in the Big
Ten. Is there anybody you played in nonconference you can compare them to?  
TREY BURKE: Arkansas was a team that plays similar to VCU. Arkansas doesn't
press as much as they do, but they pressed pretty much the whole game.  
You know, I think we watched -- if we go back and watch film on Arkansas, you
know, it would kind of give us a sense or a feeling of how VCU's defense is
going to be tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is it a big deal to have this game Saturday essentially in your own
backyard against VCU?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Well, I mean, I'll be lying if I said it wouldn't be, but,
yeah, it's good to have our fan base behind us while we're playing here.  
We know they're going to bring energy, just like we're going to try to bring
energy. So it's going to be a tough matchup for us, and both teams are really
going to bring it.  
  
Q. One hallmark of Coach Beilein's teams, I know at least when he was at
Richmond, is he values the basketball, he values possessions. What does he do
to stress that with you guys?  
TREY BURKE: Just prepare us. Like I said, you know, he's went back to watching
film against Arkansas and showing us the way that we, you know, beat their
press and, you know, he's thrown in some press-breaker sets from the beginning
of the year.  
And I think we'll be prepared for it. He does a good job of showing us
different options and different ways to attack full court pressure. So we
should be ready tomorrow.  
  
Q. Trey, you seem to not really buy into the Wolters verses you matchup.
Does it excite you more to go against a press like this, something that is
challenging for ball handlers? Tim, are you expecting to have to handle the
ball a little more because you're facing this full court press?  
TREY BURKE: I definitely think it's -- you know, it's exciting for me. It's
exciting for everyone. Playing in this game, a chance to go to the Sweet 16,
we're all excited.  
They're going to challenge us. They going to give us everything that they
have. You know, they have the same goal in mind as we do. Like I said, I just
have to play poised out there. You know, it's my job to set the token, set the
table, and make the right passes.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: For that havoc defense, I think they're going to stress a
lot to try to get the ball out of Trey Burke's hands and just try to do the
best they can to make myself, Nik Stauskas, and even Caris LeVert bring the
ball up the court. So we're definitely going to stress us bringing the ball up
the court with confidence and just try to get ourselves into offense.  
  
Q. Tim, talk about how the freshman took playing in that first NCAA game
yesterday, not from a performance standpoint, but just emotionally and
psychologically?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Well, I think a plus for them was just playing in Michigan,
playing Auburn Hills, playing close to campus and having the fan base we did.
I think they felt very comfortable with their surroundings and I think that
really helped them out with their first NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Tim, we've followed a lot of these games and throughout your career, what
do you remember when you were growing up when you first started playing? What
was that like having a father who'd accomplished so much in the game?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: It was hard just to try to follow his footsteps, and you
try not to worry about it. You try to leave a legacy of your own.  
It takes a long time to do that, so, I mean, he just tells me to go out there,
have fun, just play my hardest, and he's behind me a hundred percent.  
  
Q. Trey, two questions. First, how do you feel today? Second, pretend for a
moment you're not playing VCU, and if you could just describe to me what Coach
Beilein does to stress safe ball handling?  
TREY BURKE: Well, I feel pretty good. Obviously my back is a little sore.  
I did a lot of treatment and recovery for it today, but for the most part I
feel okay.  
As far as if we weren't playing VCU, you know, Coach Beilein, like I said, he
does a really good job of showing us different ways and different options to
attack different teams.  
If it's taking back dribbles and retreat dribbles and finding the next open
man or, you know, hitting the next man on the outside hand so the defender
can't shoot the lane to get a steal. You know, backdoor cuts, just different
options and different ways to, you know, hit the open man.  
That just depends on what, you know, the defensive tendency of the team we're
playing is.  
  
Q. On paper, it's VCU's guards. They're a bunch of fast guards against your
guards. You guys turn it over less than anyone in the country. How big of a
deal is that for you guys in terms of mind-set going into a game like this?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: I think we just -- you know, playing against Aaron Craft,
Victor Oladipo, and, you know, West Virginia guards, Arkansas guards, I think
we kind of know what to expect from them.  
Like we said, Coach Beilein just going to do a great job of just preparing us
and we're just going to have to watch a lot of film from here on out before
the game starts in order to see what we have to do in order to win.  
For either one of you, do you think this is getting overplayed and that
everybody's focused on you guys breaking the press and no one seems to be
paying any attention to when they have the ball and the rest of the game?  
TREY BURKE: Well, you know, not necessarily. That's one of their tendencies
that they're really good at. So we're obviously going to have to be ready for
it.  
But at the end of the day, it's going to be times where it's going to be half
court offense, half court defense for both teams. So it may be getting a
little overtalked about, but, you know, like I said, they do a really good job
of turning teams over. We got to be prepared for that.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: I mean, it is what they do. I mean, that's VCU's whole
mind-set, is to turn you over. They're going to play that havoc defense and
they're going to do a great job of it.  
We just have to go out there and contain it and just try to make sure we don't
get scared, don't get nervous when they're in it.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
Opening statement with Coach Beilein.  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, obviously pleased to get the win yesterday, but the
challenges keep getting bigger.  
I watched about ten minutes of the VCU game live, then watched a lot of video
starting early this morning, last night, and a really talented team that plays
a very different style than most teams that we see, and making that adjustment
of in one day is difficult.  
At the same time, we're thankful for this opportunity to be able to play, and
we're going to be as ready as we can be in the short turnaround.  
  
Q. You've never been an assistant coach, and I wondered about the advantages
and disadvantages of that and how that's shaped your coaching philosophy?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, the disadvantage is you learn the hard way, because you
don't really know everything you're doing when you're a head coach, whether
it's junior college, NAIA, Division III, Division II, wherever I was.  
The advantage is that when you learn something, you don't forget it, and
you're able to put things into action right away and you find out what works
and what doesn't work, much quicker than if you were the assistant. Where the
assistant might have said to somebody, why don't you try this and he does it
or not, you actually get to try it. And sometimes it's really painful when
you're really a dumb coach. At other times it's very rewarding because you
learn from that.  
  
Q. Coach, you see defenses like this come through the tournament over the
years, 40 minutes of hell with Arkansas. Can you just kind of talk about what
that does in a setting like this?  
COACH BEILEIN: Basically, the way I see the evolution of the press, when John
Wooden and these people were so successful, was before the three-point shot.
Because it will give up open threes. So people that were playing presses
earlier would pay for it.  
VCU's found a way to be able to press and still not give out open looks. You
have to have superior quickness to do that. They do. You have to have a great
plan and a changing scheme, which they do. But it's something that we don't
see.  
It reminds me of when we were playing the one-three-one a lot. That used to be
a very common. And when he we started running it, it was very uncommon, and I
think it's still uncommon again, but people really didn't have that plan in
place. So I think that's so unique. It makes it so difficult for every team.  
I think teams in the A10 or NCAA got a little bit used to it and they at least
had a couple days, but this, I think it really shows why they can be
successful this time of the year, as they were last night.  
  
Q. Your 7 and 3 lifetime versus VCU. One, what do you remember about the
battles with VCU. Two, comment on where they were and where they are now?  
COACH BEILEIN: The first games were against Sonny Smith, and we might have
split them. We might have won those first two because we had a really good
team my first year with those five seniors.  
I remember playing in the old Richmond coliseum against them, and actually, we
lost in the tournament to them I think the second year.  
And then playing at their new place, where we really played well at their new
place. And then my last year there, we were playing as good as we could play
and they were having a tough time and they came to our place and they just
smoked us. So there was always good rivalries.  
You know, when Richmond plays VCU, I'm still a Spider fan during those times,
but those were really -- between Mack McCarthy and Sonny and the CA tournament
the way it was selling out, and I'm sure they still get good crowds, that was
a very special experience for our family and for Richmond.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fact about the difficulty to prepare for their style of
defense basically in a day. How much of it is an advantage to have this game
essentially so close to home where you have the home crowd behind you?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, I don't know. We'll find out about that. You look at -- I
think they're 8 and 3 on the road with people having -- you know, their game
travels. Some teams' games don't travel. When you do this, you have a bad
shooting night but you get layups forcing 18 to 20 turnovers, that game
travels.  
That's why the home advantage, while it's nice for us to have the fan base we
had here last night, and we'll probably have again tomorrow. Michigan State
fans may be going with VCU, who knows, and Michigan fans may be going with
Memphis. I don't know, but it will be a good atmosphere.  
As I said before, the way they play, if doesn't make a difference where they
are. They're very good at it.  
  
Q. John, as you mentioned just a moment ago, you've coached at about every
level possible, and I wondered how does that help you prepare for the stage
you're on now?  
COACH BEILEIN: Paul, I think one of the strengths of having -- not having any
assistant coaches and driving advance and not having warmup times and, you
know, waiting for the women's game to finish before you could get out there is
you become very versatile and very adaptable at conditions that come along.  
For us, this is the occupation I chose, and all of a sudden you're playing a
team last night that will play very containing defense, very good defense, but
they'll let you make every pass and then contain you. We just got done playing
Wisconsin like that. That will force five to six turnovers a game and still
beat you. And now you turn around, you're playing a team that won't let you
make a pass.  
So you just -- as a coach, that's what you learn, that's the way it was. You
just learn.  
Back in the day, we didn't even have -- we didn't have videotape. We had a
videotape in the '70s and '80s. It was like incredible, espionage, to have a
videotape of another team.  
(Laughter). Now we have synergy on everything they do. So I've learned to be
very adaptable and hopefully it's helped me, helped our staffs.  
  
Q. A lot is being made of your offense verse their defense. What about your
defense verses their offense?  
COACH BEILEIN: That's going to be difficult -- their quickness is incredible,
how quick they can get to the rim.  
Once again, we're going to see a very experienced team. They have one
sophomore in the starting lineup, two juniors, two seniors that have
experienced a lot of success at VCU in a very short time. It's going to be
difficult. They get downhill as good as any team that we've seen. They do have
a nice compliment of inside/outside game, and I think I've had one -- with all
the shooters we've had at Richmond, Canisius, West Virginia here, I've only
had one player ever have 100 threes in a year, and that young man, No. 30,
with 119 threes, that's like astronomical to have that, unless you're like the
only good player on that team.  
There's some really big challenge for us defensively. And because of our
roster makeup, frankly that's been every game. If you could picture if VCU had
three or four freshman out there a lot, last night we had two guys -- Jordan
Morgan played one minute, we had two guys that ever played in an NCAA game. So
this is great stuff for us right now to learn what it's like to play at this
level.  
  
Q. A lot talk about VCU being able to turn opponents over. You guys turn it
over at a lower rate than anybody in the country. What has allowed you guys to
be so good with the ball this year?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, we really preach it like VCU is trying to touch the ball,
they're trying to get deflections, they're trying to wreak havoc, I guess is
the word they like to use.  
We love to be able to get a shot every time up the floor. You can shoot a
lower percentage and have a bad night, but if you get a shot every time, it's
really a game of possessions. So we recruit kids that usually have a high
skill level, but we also preach it every day. People don't want to turn the
ball over in our practice, and people don't want to turn the ball over in
games, because they know valuing possessions is a huge philosophy that we
have.  
  
Q. What do you tell Trey Burke when he's facing this and your other guards
as well?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, you know, he's got to keep his head up tomorrow because
people will come at him from all different angles.  
He'll have opportunities where two people will be on him. They'll put him in
no catch situations. They may show that they're not going to guard him and
jump him very quickly with double teams. So he's got to have his head on a
swivel all day long to see everybody.  
Thank goodness we have a ball handling team that's pretty good at several
positions because you need that. But we have not seen very many times, maybe
with Arkansas earlier in the year, and a little bit -- I don't know if we've
seen any -- in the Big Ten, we have not seen this type of defense since back
in December. So it does take a minute and that's why it can be so effective.
In a minute, you can be down 10-0. So adjusting is hard.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you watched some of the game last night. When a team wins
by 46, do you have to do anything extra to get your players' attention?  
COACH BEILEIN: No, we rely a lot on the amount of video we already have. That
game -- I think Akron, especially with missing their point guard, they
wouldn't have won last night with him maybe. It probably would have been a
closer game.  
But they played so well, I mean, VCU. But we look at a volume of games as
opposed to that game. So it was better for me just to -- I wanted to see it
live in action. Mostly I rely on just video because we're not allowed to tape
otherwise. I just wanted to see it live yesterday. I was really impressed.  
  
Q. John, Tim Hardaway and Trey Burke described you as a players' coach, so I
wondered if you have an idea of why you're a players' coach. Second part of
the question is you said players don't want to turn the ball over in practice.
What happens when they do turn the ball over in practice?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, I'm glad they would say I'm a players' coach. I think I'd
like to be known that way, but I also -- you know, we're not soft either in
practice as far as how much we demand of our players, but I don't think if you
come into our practice you're going to hear a lot of cursing and a lot of --
we want them to see a coach that's really -- coaches that are really in
control and that are teachers and people who encourage their players to reach
their potential.  
There's different things that will happen. We have stairs that go all the way
to the top of 12,000 seat arena. It takes a little bit to get up there. It
takes about a minute to get up there and back, but it's not a fun minute. Just
a quick sprint on the sideline or just to be critiqued and criticized a bit in
practice, to tell them, you know, that is not the way Michigan plays
basketball, and there's different ways, but it's not -- I wouldn't say it's
medieval punishment or anything like that, but we will get some things -- the
point will come across.  
  
Q. Shaka uses a lot of players and they push that very fast pace. Do you
sense you're going to need more minutes out of your bench?  
COACH BEILEIN: With the CBS game and the longer times, you do have some extra
timeouts.  
In this time of the year, you know, we probably wouldn't go past seven or
eight. And that's their style and they've done more than that. We may do that
just little spots here and there, but we'll probably pretty much stay the
same.  
  
Q. A question about Nik Stauskas. I was wondering your thoughts on how he
played in his first game in the tournament ever yesterday and also how he
might be able to help you tomorrow beat the press at all and what you're
looking for him to improve on tomorrow?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, as I said earlier before, I don't want to beat it up,
but if I had all those five guys who have never played in an NCAA game
yesterday play in it yesterday was huge for us. Nik performed at a very high
level. I thought his defense at times was outstanding. He has grown so much in
that area during this year, and he always seems to be guarding the guy that
can really shoot the ball.  
It has been good for him to see this experience. As he would say to you, you
know, the Big Ten is no joke, and I just told him, hey, the NCAA tournament is
no joke. He understands how physical both of these tournaments are and how
well he has to play. So just we love what Nik has brought to our team, not
just his ability on offense, his defense is growing, but his attitude and his
work habits are excellent.  
  
Q. Trey, yesterday a lot of people made a big deal about him going against
Nate Wolters. Do you sense he relishes going against a press like this more
than an individual battle like that?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, we haven't talked that much about what he personally is
feeling right now, but I know he's had some -- he's like a couple of our other
guys. They live for opportunities to play on in the NCAA tournament. We have a
lot of respect for VCU and what they're doing as a team. I mean, this is
really good what they have going there. Selling out every game, playing at a
very high level, playing against anybody in the country, and he has a great
deal of respect with that.  
At the same time, he loves this, the opportunities he would have to play in
the NCAA tournament, and the opponent is a very worthy for sure.  
  
Q. When you were driving vans and washing uniforms as a juco coach, did you
have a plan? Was the plan one day to be at Michigan on this stage?  
COACH BEILEIN: I was crazy enough to think that this could happen.  
(Laughter) I actually was. Any future coaches out there, I wouldn't suggest
this is the path, because it just -- there's not anybody that's going to hire
a Division II coach anymore, it seems like. And there's many worthy ones out
there.  
But, no, this was exactly the plan that I felt if you were -- if I was a good
enough high school coach, I could -- I probably thought I could go from
Newfane High School to, you know, UCLA in two steps at that time. And I
realized that I had a lot of learning to do. And really what it was, the whole
process was -- when I got my first Division I job at Canisius, I felt I was
ready. I didn't have a couple opportunities earlier in my career at Le Moyne,
and I didn't get those jobs and it was heartbreaking.  
But now I look back and I probably wasn't ready at that time to make the most
of the opportunity like we did at Canisius because that helped me get ready
for Richmond, which helped me get ready for West Virginia, et cetera.  
  
Q. With that in mind, what did you think of Shaka after the 2011 Final Four
run and he stayed?  
COACH BEILEIN: I love those things.  
As you know, there was never a time that -- there was only one time at
Nazareth College that I didn't stay at least five years, and there were some
opportunities, great opportunities, but that's -- people hired me to be the
coach there and they had a lot of people that were -- that they could have
hired during that time, and they hired me. And I respected that so much.  
When Shaka did that, that sent a great message to what a lot of coaches should
consider, is when you do have an opportunity -- and I'm a coaching nomad. I
mean, I've been to so many different places, but every time it's been five
years at least, and I've always had a lot of respect for Shaka. I've known him
as both an assistant and then as a head coach. But him staying like that, when
Brad Stevens did as well, those were good things for college basketball that
sometimes is your best situation.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Keith, wondered about your knee. How is that feeling? When did it first
start bothering you?  
KEITH APPLING: Late in the first half when we were in a live play.  
But it's nothing serious. I'll be all right. I'll be able to play as much as
coach needs me to play tomorrow. It's not serious. I'll be fine. I feel like
I'm a pretty tough person. I can fight through a little bit of pain.  
  
Q. Keith, can you talk about your point guard matchup that you have here in
Memphis?  
KEITH APPLING: No. I've known Joe Jackson a long time. He's obviously a pretty
good player.  
But at the end of the day, basketball, it's a team sport, and I really try not
to get into one-on-one matchups. At the end of the day, I'm going to need my
teammates to help us with the game. So I'm not really into one-on-one
matchups.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Keith and how he makes you guys go?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, you know, Keith is, I know that type of player where he
can make plays and get his team going, especially when he's playing defense
and up in his man. So we just looking forward to him, you know, leading us to
win.  
GARY HARRIS: Keith, he's the quarterback of this team. We just follow his lead
and he does a pretty good job of it. That's why we win so many games.  
  
Q. Can you talk about going from playing a team where you had athletic
advantages to one where all of a sudden the guys you were playing are more
athletic equals?  
KEITH APPLING: I mean, you know, I feel like whenever we go up against a
different opponent, everybody has advantages.  
We feel like one of ours is our low post presses. So going into tomorrow's
game, we're probably going to try to pound the ball inside and let our bigs
make something happen for us.  
GARY HARRIS: Yeah. Their strength is definitely athleticism. They like to get
out and use to their advantage and we just got to play smart and not put it
into their hands.  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Both of what they said is right.  
We did play some athletic teams in the Big Ten and some athletic people.  
I think we'll be ready. We be ready.  
  
Q. Adreian, you guys do have a size advantage tomorrow. How do you guys
account for that in the game tomorrow?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Just box out. That's the main thing. We got to box out our
rebounds. That will take care of everything.  
  
Q. Does this team remind of you anybody that you've seen in the
conference?  
KEITH APPLING: No, not really, but, I mean, you could somewhat compare them a
little bit to Miami, with all the athleticism and the different weapons they
have on the perimeter.  
I feel like this team is different from all those we played. They are a very
fast paced team. They want to get up and down, try to turn the game into a
track meet. We just got to try not to play in their hands, and like Gary said,
be smart.  
  
Q. Keith, can you talk about how Izzo and the coaching staff prepare you
guys for the second game?  
KEITH APPLING: Of course.  
I mean, Coach Izzo has been doing this for a long time. He has a lot of
experience with this tournament. Going into each week, he prepares for two
teams for the simple fact because he has faith that his team is going to make
it to the next round. You know, at the end of the day, he has a lot of
experience in the tournament. We just follow his lead.  
  
Q. Gary, you got your favorite question. How's the shoulder and how do you
feel your body's held up?  
GARY HARRIS: Oh, I mean it feels pretty good right now. My body's probably
feeling the best it's felt since I've been up here these last few weeks. I
mean, just making progress. That's all I can ask for.  
  
Q. Turnovers were an issue early in the season. Yesterday, against a team
not known for turning teams over, you guys had a bunch. Now you're going to
play against a team where turnovers could be a major issue. How do you address
that?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: I can take that blame for the turnovers yesterday. I had six of
them.  
I got to, you know, be smarter and make sure that don't happen.  
I watched a lot of film yesterday, seen what made me turn the ball over, and,
you know, I learned from it. So that shouldn't be a problem.  
GARY HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, like AP said, we just got to make the easy play and
just be smart, not try to go for the home run every time.  
You know, Memphis is definitely going to be trying to get turnovers again on
the fast break. So we need to use that to our advantage and not let them get
out there by turning the ball over.  
  
Q. Looking at what they can do, what is it that jumps out at you most? Is it
their relentlessness or tell me what it is about Memphis that catches your
eye?  
KEITH APPLING: Just the number of athletes they have and the amount of guys on
the perimeter they have that can get it going in any given position.  
We just going to have to stay focused and prepare to play defense as solid as
we can for 40 minutes.  
MODERATOR: Student-athletes, good luck.  
Coach Izzo is up next.  
COACH IZZO: Well, after studying Memphis, I feel just like I thought before. I
think they're a well coached team, I think a team that plays hard and is maybe
the most athletic team we faced all year. We faced a lot of good teams.
Everybody's going to make a big deal. Our conference was the best conference.
I don't think there's any question about that, but every team and every
conference has it pluses and minuses, and even though our conference was so
good and I thought we had, you know, great diversity as far as different
offenses that were run, different defenses that were run, in our conference
we've never faced a team as athletic as they are in just about every position.
So that will be the challenge for us, transition defense, the turnovers that
lead to dunks, keeping Stephens from -- you know, I think anywhere they throw
the ball, he's capable of dunking it. Those are all things that are different
and we're looking forward to the challenge.  
So questions?  
  
Q. Coach, so you're not at all concerned or don't feel Memphis is underrated
by the conference they played in at all?  
COACH IZZO: I don't.  
I think what I've learned about these different conferences, it comes up to
the matchups that you play in this tournament. I mean, if you can win, you
know, 18 straight games or 21, whatever they won in their conference with
their conference tournament and everything, that's incredible. You still got
to go on the road. You got to do the same things. You got to play different
people. That takes some focus for a long time and, you know, I listen to the
Gonzaga thing and this and that. I mean, sure, do I think we beat ourselves up
in our conference? Yeah, do I think we've been tested? Yeah, I do, but you
don't survive that many games in a row unless you've been tested there too.  
So I'm not buying into that. I think Josh would probably be the first to tell
you that we -- yeah, we've played probably more ranked people, but that's
going to come down to, in this game, how we match up with them, how they match
up with us, and that's the way it will work.  
  
Q. Because you've been so used to playing Big Ten-type teams over the last
couple of months, is it more on you guys like really earning your check, the
coaches, because in such a short turnaround time you've got to be prepared for
a team that is so unlike a team you've faced in awhile.  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I think that's the challenge.  
I also think that, you know, some teams you're looking at different sets. Some
teams have different defenses. This is a team that you got to look at that to
a certain extent, but you got to really look at personnel a little bit more.
What can this guy do? Where does he go better, right or left? Is he a slasher?
Is he a cutter? How are they handling -- how well does he use ball screens.  
I think this has been more of a personal and a personnel scout than even the
X's and O's part of it. And that's the way it gets at this time of year. I
mean, a lot of us, we all steal from each other. We run similar things, but
for the most part now you get into personnel and trying to get your team to
understand this guy's better off his right shoulder, his left shoulder,
whatever things that you can do.  
  
Q. Tom, can you talk a little bit about matching up with D.J. Stephens and
what he brings to the game?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I mean, you know, I had a kid Jason Richardson who I thought
was the best athlete, you know, since the Jordan era, in my -- that I had
seen.  
You know, this kid, he just -- he's got incredible hops. I mean, I've never
seen a guy -- he's dunking the ball coming down way more often than on his way
up, you know, and that -- and he's smooth about it. He's a great offensive
rebounder.  
You got to keep a body on him. He's good in the pick and rolls because when he
rolls, it's never a bounce pass; it's always for a dunk.  
I think, you know, it is different than most guys we've had in our league and
he's different than most guys around the country. I mean, he is -- I don't
know of anybody that's quite like him, and that's the neat part of these
tournaments, is you get to see people like him.  
  
Q. The last time you all played the Tigers, does that come up in discussions
in pregame talk at all with this team?  
COACH IZZO: No. We burned that tape. We burned the copy of any press book that
had that score in it, Doc. We got rid of that thing.  
I mean, I told John after that game, you know, we were so far down at halftime
that if I carried a hankie in my jacket, I would have definitely waved the
thing. You know, it was almost worthy of the clock keep running. You know, we
were down 50 to 20, and I think it was worse than that. Thank God, though, as
good as they are now and as good of players they had, that Rose kid they had,
you know, that little point guard, they don't got him, and neither do the rest
of us. He was special, and I think because of that, you know, not that they
didn't have good players, but he stirred that drink.  
In fact, if you remember in that game, we laughed about it after, he got the
gash above his eye and missed six minutes, and I think we went on about a 14
to 0 run. I think we cut it down to 40 at that point.  
(Laughter) But it was a little bit of a difference with him in there and him
not. If he shows up, I'm definitely going to be upset, I'll tell you that.  
(Laughter) I don't want even want him watching this game.  
(Laughter) That's how much respect I have for Rose  
  
Q. Tom, the Big Ten season, you talked about whether it would prepare you
for this run here. You're playing a team that played in a league where they
were able to go 16 and 0. When you look for separation, it was not there as
maybe it was against Valpo. Is the pedigree of what you guys went through, is
that important in payoff for meetings like this?  
COACH IZZO: I always believe that competition helps you, you know, when you're
in tough games all the time, it helps you.  
When you're in a conference, everything kind of -- it means the same. I mean,
you got to go on the road in the conference. It's hard to win in a conference.  
Gonzaga has had tough games over the years and they might have been head and
shoulders above teams.  
So I put a little value that we have played. I mean, we can look at it and say
we've played the toughest teams in the country, and we have, and a couple of
them on more than one occasion. But at the same time, there is pressure on
going undefeated in your conference, then bouncing back and winning your
conference tournament. You don't do that unless you're well coached, and you
can keep guys focused and you got very, very good players.  
Now, I know the recruiting wars, so I know what kind of players they have, and
I think Josh has grown as a coach and has definitely done a good job. He was
under a bigtime guy in Lute. So, I mean, I know that he knows what he's doing,
but when you get in this tournament, players play the game. And they've got
good enough players to play the game with just about anybody in the country,
if you ask me, as they did with Louisville and what that score was and things
like that.  
  
Q. Can you assess the point guard matchups and how pivotal it may be?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think whenever you got two good quarterbacks, it's
pivotal, and ours is playing better and theirs has been playing well and
they're both kind of alike. You know, they're both jitterbug guards, both the
same size. They can really push the ball, use ball screens.  
Keith has been shooting the ball better and better. So I think him and Joe
ought to be -- that's worth the price of admission right there. And it's going
to be an interesting matchup and we just got to make sure that we use that in
the right way.  
  
Q. You talk about the athleticism of Memphis and you've got a pretty set
rotation. In this game do you substitute a little more frequently to keep the
fresh people?  
COACH IZZO: You know, the one thing about the tournament, the TV timeouts and
the length of them kind of changes a little bit the fatigue factor. You know,
they don't play as many guys sometimes. They played nine and they've played
seven a lot lately, you know, and because of that, I don't think it's any big
advantage.  
Where the advantage comes in is if somebody gets in foul trouble. So I don't
think we're going to be subbing much different than we -- I don't think
they'll be subbing much different when you get to this point and you've won 25
or six games, whatever we've won, and 30, 31 games, whatever they've won, you
kind of do -- whoever you brought to the dance, that's who you're dancing
with. So that's probably the way we're going to do it and I think the way
they're going to do. The athletes, yes, we want to stay fresh, but we have
good athletes too. It's not like we got racehorses against plow horses, but
that is their -- they have exceptional athletes at certain positions, and it's
going to be interesting to see how both teams match up.  
  
Q. With their athleticism, do you think that could neutralize your size
advantage at all?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, they're six-nine, 262, and six-nine, 250 inside
too.  
I mean, at times they've got a big team and they do play a little smaller at
times, but I don't know what will neutralize what. It just depends on how each
team attacks the other and how each team defends the other. You know, it will
be interesting to see if they come out and trap us all over. I know they do
some of that, but I thought they did even more of it against Saint Mary's. You
know, what do you do in different situations, you know. They got to worry
about some things we do running the ball too.  
That's where the chess match comes in, and it will be fun to see how it works
out.  
  
Q. What do you think about their bigs?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think they're both -- I thought Black played the best I
seen him play yesterday. Would you agree? You've seen him more than I did. I
don't know if that's lucky or bad news for us, you know, but I thought he
played very well.  
I think they're both, you know effective because they're big, they're
athletic, they got post moves. They can do some things down there, but they
have size and athleticism. You know, our guys have size and he has quick feet,
but not the same athleticism. Payne's got that but not the same strength. So I
think that's going to balance out.  
You know, in our league, we've played against a lot of teams that are one big
and some small and they go with four sort of guards at times. So I think we
are going to be able to handle that, and I'm sure they'll be able to handle
us, just like teams in our league do. It's going to come down to who plays the
best, who makes the least mistakes, things like that.  
  
Q. Tom, you talked about Josh Pastner's growth. Can you expound on where
you've noticed that. Also, how much do coach matchups play a role in these
games?  
COACH IZZO: I don't think as much as people make it.  
I only say that because players play the game. You know, it really does come
down to that, especially in a one-day prep and things like that.  
But I think Josh has used what he learned from John, you know, what he's
learned now on his own. It's a hard time to take over when you go from how
Memphis was to what they are now. That's not an easy job, and I think
everybody always wants it to be a little better than it is. Same at our place.  
I think he's handled that. I think he's matured. I think he's been able to
deal with it. I see a confidence in himself, you know, that maybe wasn't there
his first year and why would it have been? You know, I was still a GA when I
was his age when he started. So I have great respect for Josh. I remember him
writing me letters when he was a GA slash player at Arizona, and the guy was
born to be a coach. You know, he puts his whole heart and soul into it. He's
kind of came up the same way I did, GA on up, Tom Crean, GA on up. You know,
it's kind of a good way to come up, and I think he's going to end up being a
great coach before it's over.  
  
Q. You're going to have a lot of your fans here and Michigan's going to have
a lot of their fans. How many of your fans are going to turn into VCU fans in
that first game?  
COACH IZZO: You know, it's kind of -- that's an interesting question.  
I've said all year that you can't like your arrival, but when -- first of all,
I have great respect for John Beilein, I mean a good guy and he's done it the
right way there.  
I am 100 percent pulling for the conference, totally. I'm pulling for every
team in this conference. I think sometimes in recruiting, it helps when the
conference does well, believe it or not. You know, you look at SEC football
and they just talk about it being the best conference.  
And even if you don't go to Alabama, you go to somewhere else. The conference
recruits sometimes.  
I think right now we have so many good coaches in our league and we have so
little recruiting issues like some conferences do that it will be interesting.
I'm not sure it will be like Illinois and us in the Final Four in St. Louis
when both teams 200 percent pulled for each other.  
But then again, if we both advance, we're in different brackets. I think this
is one time it would be great. It's been great for the state of Michigan. You
know, I think the governor should put Beilein and I on the economic package
and maybe we get paid for this. That would be a good deal. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Can you tell us what was in those letters from Josh? Was he asking for a
job or was he asking for advice?  
COACH IZZO: Oh, a job. You know, a job. He was looking to move up there.  
You know, I get a lot of letters like that from kids, but, you know, I
followed him. I knew when Kevin O'Neill was there and when I started out at
Tulsa, you know, Kevin went there and worked for Lute. Of course, Lute, we
played them some. I always had great respect for their program. So he's been
under great tutelage, you know, which I think helps all of us when we get
mentored by the right people. I think he was and I think I have been, too.  
I'm sure in some ways I saw a little bit of myself in him. The difference is
he got about an eight-year head start on me as far as getting a head job at a
prestigious place, and he's run with it.  
You know, after this is over, I'm going to be proud of him for what he's
accomplished. I'm hoping to be playing next weekend and so is he, but either
way, I will be.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Virginia Commonwealth  88  
Akron  42

  
MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Keith Dambrot.  
COACH DAMBROT: Well, I think first off, hats off to Shaka. He really got them
ready to play.  
Obviously he knew what we were dealing with and came right at us, and
weakness, he knew our weaknesses.  
But the thing I'm most proud of is we hit adversity after adversity after
adversity all season long, and I would challenge -- most teams around the
country didn't hit the haymakers we hit. It started with Quincy Diggs, we lost
him at the beginning of the year, the sixth man of the year. Then we lost
Treadwell and Harney to suspensions, compliance error, early in the season.
And Chauncey Gilliam tore his meniscus. Then Brian Walsh sprains his ankle,
missed a couple games. On then obviously the Abreu thing. Then we come tonight
and we've got Deji Ibitayo who can't play with a bad back. We got Brian Walsh
who had to be rushed to the emergency room last night, and Pat Forsythe who
can't play. All of a sudden we go from playing eleven guys over ten minutes of
game to having really a depleted team.  
So unfortunately, they're too good to be able to handle that. You know, you
give Carmelo Betancourt a lot of credit. We put him in a tough position. He
probably would have played five, six minutes in a game like that and then
Harney would have never played at the point.  
So it's just a tough draw for us and they're good. They're too good.  
We use so much energy trying to get the ball up the court, we couldn't guard
them. It was just a miserable experience, but there's nothing we can do about
it and it's going to make us better in the future. Nothing to be embarrassed
about. We had a hell of a year and they're good and they exploited our
weakness better than anybody in the country could.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. It was 21 to 9. Coach preached all week about forgetting the last mistake
and going on. Why couldn't you guys recover at that point?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: I wouldn't say we couldn't recover. It was more the fact that
we just didn't -- in the circumstances, didn't know how to do that. I mean, we
were playing as hard as we could.  
I honestly believe we played as hard as we could, but we couldn't get the ball
-- we turned the ball over. We didn't know what play to run. We were throwing
it in. They were, you know, double teaming or we were losing the ball. Things
just wasn't going our way and it just kept snowballing but we had be positive
and keep on pushing and that's what we kept on doing.  
  
Q. Demetrius, you guys watched VCU on film. Your thoughts on that press?  
DEMETRIUS TREADWELL: That might be one of the toughest things in college
basketball to face. They are like bulldogs out there on defense. They real
tough and hats off to them. They played a great game.  
  
Q. Could either one of you guys comment on the adversity that never seemed
to stop?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: Well, I can't sit here and act like know how tough it is. I
mean, it is tough but we have -- as I said before, we had a goal that we
wanted to win and we had to find some way to do it. It just didn't work out
tonight.  
Despite all the adversity we hit, we had to find a way to push forward. We
just couldn't do it tonight.  
  
Q. Is that the fastest team you guys have seen all year?  
DEMETRIUS TREADWELL: Yeah, I believe that's the fastest.  
Every position, I mean, they just -- they big, strong, skilled, fast,
everything. They got a pretty balanced team.  
  
Q. Zeke, what was so difficult about guarding Juvonte Reddic tonight?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: Well, it was more the fact that I was trying to get our team
going by firstly making shots, then, you know, I tried to help, you know, he
would run the floor hard.  
As Coach said in the locker room, we got our legs taken out trying to get the
ball up the floor, and he's willing to run that floor so he was getting
layups. I was helping, he was getting layups. It was just more of the game
honestly. He might have got his points, but, you know, I just felt like we
could have tried to play a collective defensively. So even though he got his
points, we could stop everybody else. So even if he had 16, we could stop
everybody else, you know, we would still be able to come out for a win.  
That was a hard question.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.  
Coach is now available for questions.  
  
Q. You I'm sure you weren't looking for sympathy, but didn't seem like your
friend showed any mercy there. Up 40 with the starters full court press and
doing his thing?  
COACH DAMBROT: He got a job to do. I mean, his job is to get them ready to win
the next game.  
I don't take any offense to it. I mean, he did what he had to do.  
Our misfortune was his gain. So, I mean, this is a big boy's game. You got to
put your pants on, take your butt whipping sometimes. Won't be the last.  
  
Q. There was a sense you guys really had a sense of we can do this coming
in. A lot of the adversity was already there. Talk about that.  
COACH DAMBROT: I think every game's a mutually exclusive event. You know, they
had a good night. We weren't very good.  
I watched the tape three times from last year, and if you'd watch that tape,
you'd say the Zips could play with Virginia Commonwealth easily. I mean, we
just didn't have a very good night.  
As much as we struggled in the full court, we struggled more in the half
court. We couldn't get into anything really. And I think finally at that point
you got to be able to drive the ball. They're like playing Duke, you know, if
you don't drive it on them, you can't score it on them. We really don't have
those capabilities with the people we had out there. So it was unfair.  
Listen, we put our kids in an unfair position really, right? So normally under
normal circumstances, Betancourt probably plays five minutes in that game. So
he's your primary ball handler and Harney's never played point guard in his
career in our plays. I'm not disappointed. I mean, I'm obviously not happy to
get beat up, but they went for it. We struggled. They continued to -- we cut
it back one time and then we fell apart again and, you know, we went down in
for about a three-minute stretch and cut it back to about 11, and then we
didn't guard again. You know, they're too athletic to give up baskets as
easily as we did, really.  
Did I misanalyze it? Hey, look, my job's to think we're good. I mean, any
athlete, any coach that does not think their team is good, they shouldn't be
sitting up here. So we've overcome it all year long. So I had no reason to
think we wouldn't overcome it again tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Walsh and Forsythe's willingness to play even though
they were sick?  
COACH DAMBROT: Typical. You know, those guys are winning guys. They wanted to
try to give it a go.  
Walsh had a miserable night. He didn't go to sleep till 7:00 in the morning,
and Forsythe and him are roommates. So he got sick about, I think, 8:00 or
9:00 in the morning.  
And then Ibitayo couldn't play either with a bad back. All of a sudden, you
know, we're just a little snake bit, I guess. But it wouldn't have mattered.
We didn't handle the ball well enough to offset that, you know what I mean?
You have to handle the ball against them, and you got to be able to break them
down a little bit, which we really couldn't do.  
So then our big people became a nonfactor, really.  
  
Q. You said you put your kids in an unfair position, but you didn't really
do that yourself?  
COACH DAMBROT: Well, I mean, you got to do what you got to do. You got to
figure out a way to win.  
The circumstances put them in an unfair position, evidently. So, you know, if
we played a Wisconsin or somebody like that that doesn't force tempo, that
doesn't force pressure, then we'd probably have a much better chance in
retrospect to be able to compete. I just think they got at us and got at us
and got at us and they acted like Shaka, you know, and flexed their muscles
and came at us again and again and again and again and never let up and never
let us get off the mat, really.  
But the good thing about it is it's a good life lesson for everybody. You
know, you can be on top on one day and the next day because of circumstances
you can get smacked in the mouth and you better figure out how to pick
yourself up. So from that perspective our program will recover and be better
than ever, right? We'll come back like we always have and hopefully we won't
have as many circumstances the next time we get here.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Scott Nagy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23525)

### [Nate Wolters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23522)

  
_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan  71  
South Dakota State  56

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement by Coach Nagy, South Dakota
State.  
COACH NAGY: We can't shoot the ball like we shot and beat Michigan. We have to
shoot a lot better than that. We have to be around ten threes instead of four.
We got good looks, we just didn't shoot the ball well tonight.  
I looked at every other stat. We tied them in rebounding. We had 13 assists,
12 turnovers. So we have more assists than turnovers, and we would have had
more assists if we could have made shots but we just didn't shoot the ball
well.  
Some of it had to do with Michigan, their length, their athleticism is not
what we see every day, but that's what it came down to for us, we just did not
shoot the ball well.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nate, if you would have been told before the game that Burke would have
six or whatever he finished with, would you have thought we had a good shot to
win this game?  
NATE WOLTERS: Yeah, defensively. We kind of held him in check, but I mean
other guys stepped up and they're a really talented team.  
They're really tough to stop and like coach said we couldn't buy a bucket. We
had open looks and some of them looked good but didn't fall down.  
  
Q. Nate, it seemed like you were deferring at times, other guys were getting
good shots. You weren't forcing your shot. Were you making that decision at
times?  
NATE WOLTERS: Yeah, I mean it was just difficult to get in the lane and I mean
they did a good job on pick and rolls just kind of staying with me and
trapping me a little bit. Brayden really got us going first half. He was our
only source of offense.  
We got open looks, like I said, and just couldn't hit them.  
  
Q. Obviously you were hitting some shots, but in general what coach was
talking about with the poor shooting, is that frustrating two years in a row
to reach the NCAA tournament and walk away saying if we had shot the ball
better we could have beat these guys?  
BRAYDEN CARLSON: Yeah, we feel like two years in a row we've kind of let one
go a little bit.  
We play from the first half, and then the second half we haven't played as
well. But it's not the big stage I don't think that causes bad shooting. Just
an off night.  
  
Q. Brayden, how surprised were you at what Mitch McGary was able to do?  
BRAYDEN CARLSON: We knew he'd be a good player and a productive player during
our game just because of his size.  
The guards, myself and Nate and Chad needed to do a better job of just helping
out the bigs, but he played a good game.  
  
Q. You guys have become accustomed to kind of having the home court
advantage. Turning the tables a little bit here, the crowd made its presence
felt. Was that a factor?  
NATE WOLTERS: I don't think it was too much of a factor. I mean we got off to
a good start and, yeah, I mean they had the majority of the fans obviously.  
But I don't think that was had a difference in the game really.  
  
Q. Talk about your play tonight and what was there for you, what was working
and it seemed like you were just very confident in taking what was there?  
BRAYDEN CARLSON: Yeah, like Nate said, they did a good job of just staying
with him and causing him to defer to other guys. And thankfully none of the
shots were going in.  
  
Q. Nate, I know it's tough when the game has just ended to ponder your
college career. Is there any way to put into words what it means to have
played your last college game?  
NATE WOLTERS: Yeah, I don't think it really sank in yet but, I mean, yeah, it
was an unbelievable experience playing for coach and having these group of
guys. It's been a blessing for me.  
I wouldn't trade it for anything.  
  
Q. For Brayden again, could you just reflect on kind of two things. One, on
these last two years and then looking ahead?  
BRAYDEN CARLSON: We've had an incredibly successful last two years.  
Part of that's due to our seniors, Tony and Nate.  
But looking forward, we have four guys coming back there. So they're going to
be seniors, a lot of experience on our team.  
And then Jake Bittle is probably play point guard and do a great job next
year.  
MODERATOR: Thank you student-athletes.  
Floor is open for questions for Coach Nagy.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job that Michigan did on Nate, and specifically
did you expect him to rotate as many guys on him as they did?  
COACH NAGY: Yeah, I mean I thought that if we screened with Chad White that
they would switch that, and we got some of that.  
You know, what it was mainly, and we knew we'd get him in some of these
rotations, we knew what they were going to show what their five and stay with
him until they got rid of the basketball, and I mean, we got great shots off
the rotations. We just didn't make them.  
We knew that they would switch. We knew that they were long and would use
their athleticism on them and try to wear him down. I'm sure that was the
plan. I mean, that's what everybody tries to do with Nate.  
A team like Michigan who has a little bigger stronger athletes it's a little
easier for them to do than people at our level.  
  
Q. Touching on that earlier theme about not responding well, not shooting
the ball well, is that just bad luck, or are there outside factors?  
COACH NAGY: I mean, I really don't know. I guess I don't believe in luck.  
I don't have the answers to it. There are other games that we haven't shot
well this year, but this was one we needed to if we were going to win. We
could have gotten away with it with some other teams but not with Michigan.  
I don't know. People can think that it was the stage, the kids' nerves, those
kinds of things. I mean, I was frustrated at halftime and we were only down
four. We just were playing so poorly offensively. I thought defensively we
were doing what we wanted to do, but, you know, I was frustrated with our team
at half just because it just felt like we were soft offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you only went six deep. Do you think that contributed to running
out of gas.  
COACH NAGY: No. With two and a half minute timeouts and a lot of our guys
playing a lot of minutes. I think with the timeouts they were okay and I don't
think that that had much to do with it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job you guys did defensively on Trey Burke and
then also what he did in terms of just being a facilitator when things weren't
going his way?  
COACH NAGY: We knew he was frustrated. I could see it in his body language in
the first half.  
You know, Nate's a tremendous defender and he doesn't get much credit for it,
but he did a good job.  
And, also, Tony. I think those two guys, because of the ball screens with
their five man and how we guarded them, I thought Nate and Tony did a great
job on him. He's a tremendous player. It's really hard to get him to give his
dribble up. It's hard to know when he's going to keep it, when he's going to
pass it, when he's going to shoot it. He's very good at that and he's very
tricky with the basketball. Seven assists tonight, he obviously played well.  
  
Q. Talk about Brayden's night and the importance for him.  
COACH NAGY: Well, you know, going into the season I thought Brayden would be
an All Conference player for us and he just didn't have that kind of season.
He really struggled with his shot.  
I was pleased to see it show up tonight, and you know, I expect to see that as
we go into next season. This is a good finish for him, and he'll work hard in
the summer as well the other guys. But we're going to need him to make more
plays for us next year and I was proud of him.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched upon yesterday. It's hard to get to this tournament
and you don't take it for granted. Now you got a star guard who's moving on.
Do you need to sort of redouble your efforts and try to make this a more
regular occurrence?  
COACH NAGY: Well, I don't know if we can double the efforts. I think we're
doing everything we can do and, you know, I don't want to take it for granted
that we've gotten here, because you don't know when you'll get back.  
I know how difficult it is to get here. Particularly out of a one-bed league.
It's very difficult. But there is a part of me too, and this may sound
strange, but I'm excited for our team next year to develop -- I mean, there's
been such a focus on Nate, as there should have been because he's the best
player to ever play South Dakota State. But I'm excited for the players coming
back, for them to develop different identities and step into different roles
and see what they can do. I'm very excited. We've got a great recruiting class
coming in. We'll be a lot deeper next year. A bit younger, but very excited
for the guys that are coming back to see how they develop.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on this two-year run and the success you've had?  
COACH NAGY: Just our kids. I mean, they're just tremendous kids.  
And I've said this before, I think, you know, it's my belief in Division I
basketball, I have the best job in the country because we had great players
and unbelievable kids. Kid that I don't worry about. Good students. Great
citizens. Kids that care about each other, and so it's just a very -- people
don't understand where we are, what we've done the past years winning more
than 25 games and having the RPI we have, just how very difficult that is to
do, but as a coach I understand it, and the kids understand it.  
That's obviously a standard that we want to set and keep. So we have some work
to do to stay there, and I'm excited, that's what I said I'm excited for the
guys coming back to see how they develop and the new roles that they'll step
into with Tony and Nate gone.  
MODERATOR: Thanks very much, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan State  65  
Valparaiso  54

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with opening statements by Valparaiso Coach Drew.  
COACH DREW: A special group of guys, special group of seniors. I'm sorry, a
couple of minutes getting late.  
We have six. I think these two, you know, I told them I was most proud the
last five minutes of the game. There was no way I was going to take them off
the floor when they were playing with that much character, that much heart.
They wanted to play to the final buzzer and they deserve that, that right to.  
Michigan State, excellent team. Very physical. We knew coming in we were going
to have to rebound. We knew we were going to have to get back in transition,
and we knew our margin was going to be small, that we were going to shoot the
ball exceptionally well.  
I was very pleased as a coach with the looks that we got. I thought we got
quality looks. And like we told our guys, sometimes we can't control shots
going in.  
We can control our effort, we can control our character, and I thought over
the 40 minutes our effort and character made their coach proud today.  
MODERATOR: The student-athletes are available for questions.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you talk about trying to get free with Branden Dawson on you?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: He's a fantastic athlete. So, you know, he's long and athletic
and quick. Was getting through screens very well. I was able to shake free a
few times. With his length I kind of rushed my shot a little bit in the end.  
He did a tremendous job guarding me.  
  
Q. Ryan, does this amplify the hurt because the shots were there and they
just weren't going down?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: A little bit.  
Like coach said, we did get good looks from three and inside the paint as well
I missed, you know, too many layups. But it's just the game of basketball.
Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn't.  
I think what really struck us is to the end of four year -- five years for him
and that special group that, you know, we have in the locker room.  
  
Q. Eric, first half, difficult to get to the basket. What was different
about the second half?  
ERIK BUGGS: I mean, the first half, I just rushed a lot of my finishes, and
half time, coach calmed us down.  
Told us that if we get to the rim, just concentrate on finishing, and having
shooters -- being surrounded by shooters made it a little bit easier to get
there. And second half, just concentrate on finishing a little bit more.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you talk about Derrick Nix?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: Yeah, he's definitely a big guy down low.  
He just sealed us, you know, a little bit too low, too close to the rim. And
with his side and his skill level around the hoop, it's almost impossible to
guard him.  
I thought we did a good job at times. I pushed him out and then we'd trap him
and try to get the ball out of his hands.  
Over the course of 40 minutes, he found his spots and was able to convert.  
  
Q. The first eight minutes of the game, you seemed to really rattle them.
What kind of in-game adjustments did they make?  
ERIK BUGGS: I mean, they just got a little bit more physical and they were a
little bit quicker to the ball.  
We just, you know, turned the ball over a little bit and when they started
making shots. We kind of got a little bit tight, but after that, we kind of
loosened back up. We cut into the lead a little bit and went into half time,
you know, making a couple threes.  
MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and take questions for Coach
Drew.  
  
Q. Coach, going from a 27-point deficit down to 11, can you take a moral
anything out of that?  
COACH DREW: You know, I think what I said earlier, just the character and the
heart.  
We met those last few timeouts, especially the last one and we told them that
we're going to win this last segment. Guys worked too hard. You know, kind of
boiled down to our character and I was really proud of the guys that they dug
deep and finished the game out strong.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Nix, especially in the first half and at one
point he knocked one of your players on his back.  
COACH DREW: You know, we knew he was a load coming in, and again you got to
credit Michigan State. When he came in as a freshman to what he is now, you
know, he's a totally different player.  
You know, and Kevin van Wijk's defense, he hasn't practiced since last
Tuesday's championship game with a bad ankle, and I feel bad he didn't get to
play his best. The country didn't get to see how good he's been for us.  
Nix gets great low post position, but I thought he really did a good job
passing the ball tonight. We doubled him a couple times and he was able to get
it out and hurt us for some shots. That kind of made us readjust our defense
where if he wasn't doing that then maybe we could have clashed on him a little
bit more.  
But the nine offensive rebounds, I think you got to credit him for getting
great position and then having nice good hands to grab the ball and lay it
back in.  
  
Q. Coach what did you share with them in the locker room?  
COACH DREW: Told them we were proud of them. Personally wouldn't want to trade
this team for any one in the country.  
They're such a joy to be around not only on the floor but every day at
practice our coaching staff enjoys coming to be with them every day.  
And they have a lot to be proud of, a school record, 26 wins, two straight
conference championships, and then, you know, kind of pretty much showing
their character today. And we told them this will help them in life, what they
did in the last five minutes, when things are bad in life and down, you can
remember this and you fight through to the end.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Virginia Commonwealth  88  
Akron  42

  
MODERATOR: We'll open up with a statement from Coach Smart.  
COACH SMART: Our guys did a nice job tonight executing the plan.  
I got a ton of respect for Keith and his kids and their program. They got a
great program. They had a phenomenal season. This was just a better matchup
for us tonight, and that's why we were able to win.  
But the guys did a nice job. Juvonte, Rob, Troy and all their teammates really
executed the things that we talked about over the last few days, and we were
able to get the win.  
Now we're shifting our attention to the next game.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Troy, you guys were up big. Coach came over, kind of put his hands in
your face and got up in your face. What was that message?  
TROY DANIELS: He was telling me to box out, you know, so they couldn't get a
second chance playing.  
That's what you look for in a coach. No matter what the score is you want to
coach it regardless really hard and that's what he did.  
I didn't take it any way, but I just said, Okay Coach, I got you.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about guys went in early and often and sort of
established that despite their bigger front line, can you talk about what the
message was pre game?  
JUVONTE REDDIC: Yes, coach, you know and everybody else knew that they had a
size advantage over us, but like Coach was telling us, even though they're
bigger, doesn't mean we have to switch up the way we play.  
We just kept doing what we always do, you know, god in, play inside out and I
think we did a good job of doing that tonight.  
  
Q. Troy or Rob or both of you, in the first half it seemed like you guys
couldn't really miss. How much did that help your press and put them on their
heels?  
TROY DANIELS: It helped a lot. I was making shots. We were getting to the
press. That's great.  
We have, you know, a press where if we're missing shots we still can get in
there, but it was just to our advantage when we were making shots we were able
to get in our press and start defense.  
ROB BRANDENBERG: Basically the same thing Troy said.  
You know, we want to force our pressure, but when we're making shots it's, you
know, easier to get in press and easier to set up our full court pressure.  
In the first half, I think guys were shot ready and we made some shots and it
went to our advantage and we were able to get in the press and force some
turnovers.  
  
Q. Rob and Troy, I know you want to enjoy this one for a little bit, but
you've got Michigan coming up Saturday. I wonder what your thoughts are on
playing them?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: It's win or go home right now, so we can enjoy this win
tonight but we've got to realize it's a quick turnaround.  
Michigan, they got a great team, so we've got our work cut out on Saturday
but, you know, I'm confident I know all my teammates are confidence in
themselves and Coach Smart, he's going to have us ready to play.  
  
Q. Rob, you guys knew that they had lost their point guard recently. How
much did you talk about that?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: We defensively, you know, felt that we could use that to our
advantage and really get after him in the press.  
I think we did a good job really, you know, trying to exploit that.  
I'm proud of the way that we battled in the first half and the second half. I
think we did a good job, you know, using that to our advantage and, you know,
got the win.  
  
Q. Any of the players that want to answer, can you talk about how important
the 24 to 7 run was early on?  
JUVONTE REDDIC: I think any time a team makes a run, it's great.  
Like they said, we did a good job, you know, forcing a lot of turnovers and
playing good team defense. I think tonight was one of the best defensive plays
we ever did as a team.  
In the first half we did a great job, also in the second half. You know, in
the past we had trouble. We either played in the first half good defense and
not so well in the second half and I think we all did a good job playing the
defense in the first and second half, entire 40 minutes.  
ROB BRANDENBERG: I didn't even know that we were on a run like that.  
You know, we were just in the zone. It all starts on the defensive end, and,
you know, our defense could lead to easy shots.  
Troy, he made a lot of threes in the first half and that was due to our
defense and them scrambling and we were able to find open shooters.  
That's the way we play. We try to, you know, use that to our advantage every
time we step on the court.  
TROY DANIELS: Same thing those guys said. I didn't know that we were on a 24
to 7 run. We all bought into what Coach Smart wants us to do on the defensive
end.  
We never know what the score is; we just out there playing.  
  
Q. That was the biggest win by a No. 5 against a No. 12. Does that do
anything for you or the team?  
TROY DANIELS: It doesn't.  
I mean, it's a great accomplishment. You know, we'll take it, but we just got
to be ready to play Saturday.  
  
Q. Guys, you have now been in the NCAA tournament three years in a row. How
big of a factor was that in terms of coming into the game and being
comfortable, your nerves compared to maybe past years?  
TROY DANIELS: I feel like we have an advantage.  
A lot of guys, they played in the tournament and we used that tonight. You
know, we'll use it for the rest of the tournament, and we just have to be
ready to play no matter who we play. As long as we're all bought into the
plan, we'll do great.  
ROB BRANDENBERG: Yeah, it's definitely, you know, nothing we can use to our
advantage. I know Troy, myself, Juvonte felt pretty comfortable on the court.  
We just got to try to help the younger guys with that. So we could get them
accustomed faster. I just think with that experience, you know, that's going
to definitely pay off in the long run.  
JUVONTE REDDIC: Pretty much what they said.  
Any team that have players that had a lot of experience in a tournament,
that's going to be a great advantage for anybody.  
MODERATOR: Thanks to the student-athletes.  
Questions for Coach Smart.  
  
Q. You've got the tournament experience, but this year you're coming off
playing in the Atlantic Ten for the first time. How do you think that's
strengthened your guys?  
COACH SMART: No, similar attitude. The Atlantic Ten's a great league. We
played against some terrific teams.  
I think your preparation is based on the schedule you've played, both
nonconference and conference, and we played as tough a schedule as VCU has
ever played, and I think that that went a long way towards allowing us to get
a five seed in the NCAA tournament and, you know, went a long way in having us
ready to play tonight. But that by itself doesn't win you the game; you still
go to go out and execute the plan.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Treveon and his development and how important he is
to your press specifically?  
COACH SMART: He's been great. He's come a long, long way.  
You know, he's went from as a freshman being a guy that got off to a slow
start and wasn't the most confident and kind of came on near the end of the
year but was a bench player to a guy who started every game, who's leading us
in scoring.  
And the great thing is, you know, he can be so much better and he can make so
much more progress.  
As it relates to our press, all of our guys are important to the press. You
know, Trey, he usually guards the other team's power forward. So what that
means is if they're going to use that guy to inbound the ball, then Trey's
going to be a trapper a lot of the times. If they're going to use that guy to
bring the ball up the floor, then Trey needs to do a good job defending that
guy coming up the floor.  
He's gotten better. His first year, his freshman year, he was like a chicken
with his head cut off in the press, but he's certainly not Gary Payton out
there yet, but he's getting better.  
  
Q. In the second half keeping your foot on the gas, is that just a matter of
you don't want your guys to get relaxed?  
COACH SMART: I mean, there's a lot of time on the clock. So we're not just
going to fall back and play zone. It's just really not what we do.  
We stopped pressing -- well, first we stopped trapping in the press with about
nine, ten minutes left. And then with about six or seven minutes left, we
stopped pressing altogether. So it's not like we stayed in the press the whole
game.  
But our guys are going to play aggressive on the defensive end even if we're
just playing half court defense, and, you know, we got some deflections even
in the final minutes of the game. It's just how we play. You know, you can't
turn a guy off, and we're not going to just pack it in.  
I mean, the last thing I would ever want to do to any coach, particularly one
of my best friends, is run up the score. That's just not what we do, and you
can look back at our games. We don't do that.  
You know, we had guys in the game that typically don't play very much, and
they did a good job. It was just a tough matchup tonight for Akron. You know,
I think I heard Keith say earlier, if they come out tonight and they're
playing a different team that plays a different way, you know, they got a
chance to advance in this tournament. They have a very good team, but just
tonight without their point guard and just because of the matchup, it was
going to be tough.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the decision to go inside at their bigger front
line right away?  
COACH SMART: This is what we do every game. We want to get in the paint. We
want to throw the ball to Juvonte Reddic. He's a good player. So we want to
take advantage of him.  
Zeke Marshall's a great shot blocker, but the last thing you want to do when a
team has size or shot blocking ability is over-respect them. You want to go at
them. If they block some shots, they block some shots. It's not the end of the
world. But you want to make sure you get in the paint. You put pressure on
their defense.  
One thing I was pleased with in the first half is when we only shot five
threes, and we typically shoot a lot of threes. But what that showed me is we
were really getting in the lane and getting a lot done around the basket. And
the guy that needed to shoot threes was shooting threes. That was Troy. And
then the rest of our guys were really attacking.  
Second half, we got a few more up, but for us to only shoot 16 threes, that's
not very many, and certainly to make eight of them, we'll take that.  
But to get in the paint, to get a lot of shots around the basket was huge for
us tonight.  
  
Q. What are your immediate thoughts on Michigan Saturday?  
COACH SMART: We're not going to really -- I'm not going to enjoy this one at
all.  
I mean, this is what we wanted to do. We won, but we're turning the page, man,
because that's what we do this time of year.  
Then after the season, when the season gets done, maybe we can watch some of
our games or we play it better and feel great about them, but now it's all
about Michigan.  
That's what we live for. We don't live for the afterglow of a win. We live for
the process and the journey and the opportunity to play a team that, you know,
all year long has been in or near the top ten in the country, and that's what
we'll have. And it will be a road game. We love that. So we're fired up about
that opportunity.  
Michigan's got a phenomenal coach in John Beilein. They got some terrific
players. They got some NBA-level guys. Great opportunity for the Rams.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Memphis  54  
St. Marys  52

  
MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Pastner.  
COACH PASTNER: Great win. We beat a very good basketball team in Saint Mary's.
Very well-coached basketball team.  
I thought our guys defensively were terrific, absolutely terrific, and it was
a heck of a ballgame. That was a great one. Personally I wanted that one so
much for our young men, for our student-athletes to experience it. Just for
Tiger Nation, for the city. It's important to me personally that our young men
get experience all the great things due to their work ethic and obviously to
the city.  
I was very happy because when our athletic director, my boss, Tom Bowen, his
first year on the job with us, he got to experience it.  
And Courtney Morrison Archer from the league office back there who are the
biggest for holding the sword for how great Conference USA, so that's a great
one for USA, Courtney.  
Other than that, this one's for the players. It was a great win, like I said,
against a very good basketball team.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I know you're thrilled to get the win. Are there some lessons to be
learned?  
TARIK BLACK: We watch NCAA games each year as student-athletes, and we watch
teams go down because of free throws. We watch teams go down because of
rebounding, and that's something that we're really going to focus on in,
because free throws win the game.  
We pulled one out, but we missed a lot of free throws and on the offensive
glass, they got some offensive rebound. There was some detrimental
opportunities for them to get extra baskets and put this game and really have
us upset in this game.  
COACH PASTNER: And just -- I mean look in the NCAA tournament, every game is a
game of runs. Everyone's good, and you know we missed some free throws, they
hit a couple great threes. Our goal defensively, we're a very good defensive
team. We've been a good defensive team through my time here and our whole
identity is 50/50 balls on the defensive end.  
We were top ten in the country last year defensively. We were the best in the
Conference USA defensively. So us holding all our goal is to hold them 40 from
the field and 30 percent from the three, which we did.  
They did a great job on the glass, and they made -- you know, and we missed
some free throws, but in the end all I know is when you wake up the next
morning it's a W, and at this time of the year it's win, babe, win, survive
and advance.  
  
Q. The game plan, the strategy with Dellavedova, Coach Bennett just talked
about double teaming and making it hard for him. Can you talk about that?  
D.J. STEPHENS: Well, going into this game, we knew that Dellavedova was the
floor general for this team. So Coach, the plan for the game was to pretty
much keep the ball out of his hand as much as we could. Make somebody else
have to initiate the offense.  
And we were pressing, making sure he couldn't get the ball and bring it up the
floor, and it kind of threw them out of rhythm a little bit. And that was
pretty much our game plan. Just pressure them, play our style of basketball,
get out there, play good defense and come away with the win.  
JOE JACKSON: Well, it was just all in the game plan. He makes over 90 percent
of their plays for them. He keep the ball in his hands a lot. So we just want
to, you know, make it hard for him because you can't just let a player like
that that can see the floor so well just go one-on-one all the time, play pick
and roll basketball, because things just start to open up.  
And we just tried to do, you know, just make it hard for him, because he do so
much for that team. He get everybody open shots. He get everybody involved.
So, I mean, by double teaming, it kind of threw him off.  
TARIK BLACK: Like the first two said, he's the floor general for them.  
With him seeing the floor, for him it's kind of a slow game, but when he sees
the floor, he sees players, he makes the perfect pass and the right decisions.
So like I said, when we try to double team him, it was just so that he
couldn't see the floor as well. So we had to use high hands, keep our hands
up.  
Every time he put our hands down, especially in the beginning of the game,
they were definitely getting a lot of points on the backside because of the
passing. So that was our plan to keep our hands high, try to frustrate him a
little bit, try to tire him out some, and try to make sure he couldn't see the
floor as well so he could make the passes.  
  
Q. Question for Joe and for coach. How do you guys feel with all of the
pressure in Memphis, how does it finally feel to get the win?  
JOE JACKSON: It just feels great to win. It's not about the pressure. It feels
good because we put in a lot of work this whole summer as a team.  
And just to win and see ourselves successful as a team, that's really what
it's about this time of the year.  
We went through some downfalls as underclassmen, but we're getting older and
mature. So we expect to go in there and win games and just do it in a good
fashion.  
COACH PASTNER: You know, like I said, I think a lot of the people talked about
the monkey and the pressure and this and that. I still say let's not forget
all the wins we've had for -- you know, I mean I was obviously the head coach
before these guys came in their freshman year, but these guys have won a lot
of games.  
Through our time here, in my four years, we've won over 100 games, which is
more than anyone ever in the history of Memphis Tiger basketball, and that's
because we've had good players.  
In these last three years, these guys have won, you know, they won 25, 26, and
31 and had an opportunity to move that up. So that's a lot of wins.  
And that's because we have good players who get the job done. This is a
player's game. Players make plays, and tonight players made plays. So I'm
really happy for these young men and I'm happy for Tiger Nation. Because I
know how important it is for Tiger Nation.  
And I want to say one thing on the question about the game plan. The guys
executed the game plan because the players make plays, and our staff, not me,
the assistant coaches, prepared the game. Damon Stoudamire was responsible for
the scouting, but everybody was involved, Coach Collins, Coach Williams,
everybody. Those staff members, those assistant coaches did an amazing job. It
wasn't me. So it was the assistant coaches and the players that put it all in
and then these guys executed it.  
  
Q. Joe, you were able to knock down some pretty big shots today. Can you
talk a little bit about what was working for you today, particularly about the
pass that you had to D. J. for the dunk in the first half?  
JOE JACKSON: In a game like this I was just trying to come out and be
aggressive, not play on my heels and just trying to get my teammates involved.
I was telling Ferrakohn just come out in the first four or five minutes and
big men the ball so they can got their game going.  
Things just start opening up, and I was just trying to deliver passes and be
precise with decision making. I knew shots were going to come if other guys
was getting points.  
  
Q. D. J., first of all, what happened with your hand there at the end?
Secondly, how much do you guys know about Michigan State going into
Saturday?  
D.J. STEPHENS: Well, what happened in the game was I had an awkward fall and I
put my hand down to try to brace myself, and I landed funny and my hand went
numb. I just told coach my hand was numb, but he had confidence in me to still
shoot the free throws. I made the first one, missed the second one.  
Michigan State, they're a great basketball team. We know they're great at
rebounding the basketball. So we know we'll have our handful, but I'm pretty
sure our coaches are going to scout them and we'll be ready for the game on
Saturday.  
  
Q. Joe, what do you know about Keith Appling and Gary Harris? What do you
like about your chances in that matchup?  
JOE JACKSON: Well, I don't know much about Gary. That's the freshman you're
talking about, right?  
I expect both of them to play hard. They play for a great coach; they play for
Tom Izzo. They just got a lot of tradition at the school, so I expect them to
play hard. But Keith, I'm real cool with Keith Appling. We played together in
the USA games overseas. I mean, I kind of know what he can do good and what he
can do bad.  
It's going to be a good game and he's going to play hard. He's going to try to
help his team win. I'm going to try to help mine.  
  
Q. Tarik, you're about as aggressive offensively than we've seen in a long,
long time. Was there something that you saw that you can exploit in their
defense?  
TARIK BLACK: Coming into the game, coach told me I was going to have a major
tournament. He told me that as soon as we got on the plane, as soon as we
boarded. Coming into this game, I really -- it's not just something that I saw
them doing that I was like where I can just exploit it, but it was just the
fact that my teammates sitting right behind me, and like I said, Coach told me
and everybody's been telling me, Tarik, you are going to have a great
tournament. Just play with the confidence you've had in the past, play like
the Tarik you've always been and everything will turn out all right. That's
what I came out and did there today and that's what I plan to do for the rest
tournament.  
  
Q. DJ, eight blocks today. That's a career high for you. What made you rise
above?  
D.J. STEPHENS: Just a lot of the time my teammates, they know I jump high, but
a lot of times I like to help my teammates out. If they get beat, I like to
come from the weak side and block shots.  
Usually that's where I get my blocked shots from, I come from the weak side,
but from time to time I get caught behind when I'm trying to front a bigger
guy, but I just try to keep a hand in between, keep a little bit of space and
as soon as he puts the ball in there, I try to block it.  
I mean, for me to be able to block eight shots, that's amazing. That's a
blessing, but I'm just out there trying to help my teammates win games.  
  
Q. Joe, just talk about getting your big guy going.  
JOE JACKSON: I've been playing with Tarik for a while. I know how good he is.
Tarik went through a little adversity earlier in the year, but I still know
that he's a force down there.  
Guys, they have the respect of him in the paint because he's so big and he can
finish around the rim, and Tarik's, like, a 60 percent field goal shooter, so
I just wanted to get him the ball in the situations where he can just put it
in basically. And I mean, I've got incredible teammates. They really can play
and I just try to go out and get everybody involved.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Coach Pastner is now available by himself.  
COACH PASTNER: I got cut off because I told them I might want to go for senate
or Congress one day and I'd be a heck of a filibuster guy.  
(Laughter) we could be running mates together.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the end there, the inbounds play and I guess the
Dellavedova three, and what was going through your mind?  
COACH PASTNER: I was at peace with everything. You know what, the way I looked
at it, you know what, we missed some free throws. They hit some great shots.  
Shots that hit off the backboard. So I was at peace about it all, and he came
off and I knew once it left it was long. So it was good and it was just a good
win, and it's the NCAA tournament. Things like that happen. But we just missed
some free throws down the stretch and they made some great threes.  
But I was totally at peace. You might not believe me, but I was. I really was
at peace. I really was at peace.  
  
Q. I know you're going to run for office one day?  
COACH PASTNER: If I want to get a higher office in the Tennessee, I got to win
some more games though.  
  
Q. You had a huge weight on your shoulder with this program. Don't you feel
at ease, relieved, it's over?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, you know, everyone keeps bringing that up.  
How about when I took over the program and we had about five scholarship
players and the expectation -- I'm replacing a guy that it was the greatest
run in the history of college basketball. Think about that. The four years
that I came in, the prior four years is the greatest run in the history of
college basketball. John Wooden never did. Dean Smith, Bobby, no one's ever
done that and here I am at 31 years of age and they say, here, here's the head
coaching job, just go. And you're having about five scholarship guys and you
got to keep the program together. The responsibility of that, to try to keep
the ticket sales to make sure that -- because we are the most important thing
to making sure financially, for the athletic department, to keep that going. I
mean, there was a lot. Talk about pressure and responsibility.  
And it easily could have tumbled the other direction. Easily. And we could
have taken five, six, seven years to kind of get it back and maybe make the
one tournament. It's not that easy. So I was fortunate because the reason,
able to have that happen is because I hire great coaches and the fans got us
through the tough stretch. It was the fans. Tiger Nation, their support.  
That's why these guys up here, they came to play at Memphis, because of the
fans. The fans got us through the tough stretch, and that's why I always say
we've got the best fan base in the country. So the way I look at this, this is
more for the fans because I want to keep winning for the fans. Because they
helped us -- you know, we were drowning. When I took over, I usually want to
stay above water and just hope you get to a buoy to stay above. That's all you
wanted to do. And the reason we were able to get through that and stay above
water and not drown is because of the fan base and what the fans did to help
us push us through that. So God bless the Tiger Nation fan base. We're very,
very thankful and grateful for them.  
  
Q. What is this about your team's toughness? They had to tough out this game
today as well?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, we get tested every time we step on the floor, Doc. I
mean, Saturday, double overtime win. Come here and we had to tough it out.  
I told our guys when we came to that huddle after regulation and Southern Miss
hit that shot, I said, Guys, this is great for us.  
Now, everyone here knows I believe in positive energy. I can't stand negative
energy. I believe in positive energy. I believe the whole life is about
positive energy. Our guys were a little down and I said, Guys, this is going
to be great for us this. This is so important. This is going to help us next
week. We don't have to play another five minutes. We get to play another five
minutes. We get to.  
On top of that, it's going to be great for TV ratings, and they kind of smiled
and laughed, but I did say in that first thing, We're going to have to get
through this with the NCAA tournament and this is actually going to help us in
the long run, and it did.  
  
Q. Talk about Black. Talk about the talk you had with him.  
COACH PASTNER: Tarik's been -- he started the year -- mid point of the year he
was really good. Maybe not -- a little up and down as of late, but I told him
again, I wanted him to have positive energy.  
I know people are telling him this or that or trying to say negative things. I
said, Hey, man, think positive, have confidence. I want you to have great
positive energy. Believe in yourself. I believe in you. It's all a matter of
attitude. It's all a matter of energy.  
As you know -- as I told Tarik all year long, to be on the caravan, you got to
be positive. If you're not positive, the caravan's moving forward. I said,
You're on the caravan and we're surrounding you and radiating positive energy
your way. So it's contagious. Soak it in and play with a smile and enjoy
yourself and have fun.  
  
Q. How do you think D.J.'s performance tonight, weakside help defense can
help you neutralize Michigan State's big men and what did you think of his
performance?  
COACH PASTNER: I have no idea why Tom Izzo isn't in the hall of fame right
now, and I'm being serious. He should be in the hall of fame. He's not only
one of the great coaches of all time; he's one of the great guys of all time.
And Coach Izzo is one of the great guys of all time. He's been good to coaches
all throughout and he should be in the hall of fame already.  
Michigan State's a great basketball team. They've got a lot of good players.
They do a great job, and we're going to need all of our guys to play well on
Saturday.  
As I told our team, let's not forget, we are the 15th ranked team in the poll.
We have won 31 games. I mean, this isn't a Cinderella story. I mean, we are a
good basketball team, and, you know, we want to advance. So we know we got to
play great on Saturday and we know it's going to be a home game for Michigan
State.  
But at one time this year, we had the nation's longest true road win streak in
the country, and we're a very good road team. I know we'll be ready to go. We
know we're playing a great basketball team, and I think it's going to be a
great game on Saturday.  
  
Q. What about D.J.?  
COACH PASTNER: D.J., look, the guy was a zero star recruit. Nobody recruited
him. I took him sight unseen because I had five scholarship players, I needed
to get a player, and I got an e-mail. Somebody e-mailed me on a mass e-mail
chain saying, Hey, he's only got Division II offers. Does anyone want him?
Seven days before school started. I said I'll take him. What can he do? He
said he can jump. I said great. He came to the campus first day. When I told
D.J. he had a scholarship, he started crying because he was so happy that he
got a chance to play Division I basketball.  
Well, when I watched him play the first day of workouts, I started crying
because he couldn't dribble up the court. I was like, What did I do?
(Laughter) He stinks. And then luckily through time, through that first year,
he helped us win games because he made winning energy plays, second year
winning energy plays, third year and fourth year.  
And there's no question in my mind he's an NBA prospect. Should be picked in
the second round somewhere, because, you know what, he doesn't just make
energy plays; he makes winning energy plays, and that's how you win games. God
bless D.J. Stephens, and he's a phenomenal young man too graduating in the
spring.  
  
Q. After last season's NCAA tournament appearance, you said I thought I
talked to them too much about St. Louis. If I had to do it over, I wouldn't
have done it. So this year you were going to take a different tactic. Explain
how that affected your team.  
COACH PASTNER: Great memory. Great memory, because did I say that. And I
really look back at our loss for St. Louis. We had five or six days to
prepare, and I felt I overanalyzed. Paralysis through analysis. You know, we
just heard -- I just had the team hear about St. Louis for five, six straight
days. And, again, you got to give St. Louis credit. They're a great team. They
beat us, and everyone sees how good they are, especially for this year. So not
taking anything away from St. Louis because they're a great team.  
I looked at that. I went into this year and, you know what, again, anyone that
knows me, I look at the glass as overflowing. When everyone came out and we
had to play a game where there's the winner, I said, man, that's awesome.
Absolutely awesome. Because it's less time to prepare, less time to
overanalyze, less time to paralysis for analysis. And we got to focus on
Memphis on Monday, Tuesday. Had a quick -- put in a little quick game plan on
Wednesday and went and played Thursday. I actually thought it worked to our
advantage.  
If I could do it over again in the future, I'll do the same thing. Let's focus
on us. We got to play how we play. Yeah, you're going to have some adjustments
here and there, but you got to do what's got us to this point.  
  
Q. Coach, the last inbound play was at a timeout. They sort of got a free
one because the officials went over to check the monitor. Was that frustrating
for you or does it actually give you guys a chance to reset your defense?  
COACH PASTNER: No. You know, it was part of the game.  
I thought the officials did a great job. Thought it was an extremely well-
called game. So you got to give the officials credit. And you know what, they
wanted to make -- they didn't check the time; they checked to see if the shot
the kid hit was a three or a two. So I can understand that. They wanted to
check that, and that's okay and that happens.  
You know, anyone that knows Roger Ayers, the referee, you know, he was a
fireman who was in a building, a burning building, put his life on the line
and there was a fire and he was trapped and he barely got out alive. And he
was so thankful and grateful for the extra breath that he got to live. So, you
know, he's a true hero, first responder, true hero.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Memphis  54  
St. Marys  52

  
MODERATOR: Now we'll hear from Coach Bennett.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, just left the locker room. It's probably the toughest
locker room I've ever had to be in.  
Our guys, couldn't be more proud of a team. They put everything they had into
that game. Played a good Memphis team. We thought it would be a dog fight and
it was.  
So that's all you can do. We didn't shoot the ball great. Some of that has to
do with their defense, but I couldn't be more proud of a team.  
MODERATOR: Thank you Coach. Any questions for Brad Waldow, student-athlete.  
  
Q. Brad, for the last two years, a lot of your scoring has come from passes
from Matthew. Now that you realize you're not going to be with him, what has
he meant to you for the last two season?  
BRAD WALDOW: He's just a great person like all around. He taught me how to be
like a winner on and off the court and a great role model, great person.  
  
Q. Brad, can you talk about your mind-set going down into the waning
seconds?  
BRAD WALDOW: There was a lot of excitement, and as soon as Delli got the ball
in the corner, we all thought it was going to go in. We knew it was going to
go in, but it just didn't fall. That's it.  
  
Q. Brad, how tough did D. J. Stephens make it out there for you?  
BRAD WALDOW: It was pretty tough. He's a pretty big guy.  
Yeah, he's a shot blocker. Coming from the weak side, it's tough like when you
can't see the guy coming, but he's really athletic and a really good player.  
MODERATOR: Coach Bennett is open for questions now.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think contributed to Matthew's off night?  
COACH BENNETT: I'm not sure he had an off night. He shoulders so much of the
load for us. I mean, we play off of him, and they had to put such a defensive
effort into stopping him.  
He didn't make all his shots. It's hard for him to get a good look the way
they're playing him. They double team him on the ball -- in the on-ball, and
no catch him when he doesn't get the ball.  
He's not going to have -- if they play in L.A, he's not going to have great
numbers but I think our other guys will usually benefit from that.  
Our other guys did not shoot the ball well either. We had some good looks. I'm
really not down at all. Our guys played the game the right way. Could have
made some shots. I mean, Beau had a couple. Holt needed to hit some shots.  
It comes down to that. If they are going to play you that way, some other guys
got to make the shot. No way Matt is going to score when he's got two guys
guarding him, which is exactly what they do, then they no catch him to try to
get it back.  
For him to do what he did is remarkable. Wish he would have hit that last
shot, and so does he. And there's a reason he's not here right now and that's
how hard he's taking it.  
Matt wasn't the problem at all. Matt was the solution. Matt was why we had a
chance at the end.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the final play that you guys set up?  
COACH BENNETT: It was a scramble situation over there, to say the least.  
We didn't have a timeout. Thank goodness they stopped the clock. There was a
break so we could kind of huddle up, but our guys executed about as well as
you could on that, and we had a decent look. Matt had a decent look. With that
much time, they're not going to leave him open, but he had a shot that he
could make, and that's all you can ask for in that situation.  
For our guys to keep -- Eividas hit a big shot banking that shot in, and to
give us a chance. Our guys were good. They picked up press. Giusti forced them
into a turnover. Then we executed then.  
Sometimes they just don't go in, and we didn't have enough shots go in tonight
to win that game, but it was not lack of effort.  
  
Q. What did you tell the team in that tough locker room? You've been saying
for weeks, maybe months that you don't know how good of coach you are until
Matthew's gone. Now he's gone. How does that hit you?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, I say it a little bit tongue in cheek on that. I think
I'm solid.  
Yeah, I mean, it's -- he's like a coach on the floor. I don't think on the
floor does him justice. I mean, he has set the blueprint for our program, and
he's been in it for these four years, but I think he'll even help us win as he
leaves because he's -- his leadership has been so strong.  
So I think that's where we'll be tested, is how do we replace that leadership.
And coaches can do that, but it's best when it's the players. So I've been
counting the days with him, like since he was a freshman. Hey, this one's
special. So we'll find out. I think we'll be good. We have some really good --
I think Beau Levesque and Stephen Holt will be really good leaders.  
And they couldn't totally develop as leaders until these guys left. I mean,
Mitch Young did a super job too and Kyle Rowley and Paul McCoy's going to be
back, but even Tim Williams. That group of five guys, I told them, I've never
been more proud of a team, and I've never seen better leadership out of
seniors.  
We have some good ones coming, and they'll have a chance to blossom and grow
and try and leave their fingerprints on our program. But these guys, and
especially Matt, have done as well as you can do it.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team?  
COACH BENNETT: Not much. There wasn't -- there was a lot of tears in there.
Like I said, it was the toughest locker room I've been in.  
And that's the way it should be; I told them that. This is the way it should
be. You guys should care this much, and they did. So I just told them how
proud I was of them.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan  71  
South Dakota State  56

  
MODERATOR: Coach Beilein will make an opening statement and following that the
floor will be open for questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BEILEIN: I want to congratulate South Dakota State, first of all.  
Being a former mid-major coach and Division II coach and to get to this level
right now where they are in this tournament back to back years, I hope the
people from South Dakota understand how difficult that is to do.  
So they had a great year. They really had a good team. We had a heck of a time
preparing for them because all the challenge that they give you with so many
guys that can shoot it.  
But really proud of our guys the way we defended them. Tried to shut down the
three ball and give them some tough twos. And I think they were 4 for 19 for
threes and it was a key for the game.  
We had some guys step up today that we're very proud of and we look forward to
practicing tomorrow and playing whoever we play on Saturday.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Floor's open for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Trey, you were struggling a little earlier with your shot. Can you talk
about how big it was for Tim to come out the way he did shooting the ball?  
TREY BURKE: It was really big. You know, that's why I trust my teammates.  
Not just Tim but Glenn and Mitch, everyone played a really well game and like
he said shots just weren't falling tonight. South Dakota State, they did a
good job of not allowing us to get into the paint as much as possible. I just
tried to pick and choose when I could get in there and hit the open net.  
  
Q. Trey, we could hear the thud when you hit the ground over on press row.
What exactly happened?  
TREY BURKE: I hit my back and my elbow and a piece of my head, but I'm fine.  
My elbow's just a little sore, and my tailbone is a little sore, but besides
that, I'm fine.  
  
Q. Mitch, talk about the energy coming out your first start?  
MITCH MCGARY: I think early this week Coach LaVall told me I'm going to start
so I just need to come out with the energy and I like to bring every game and
pick the team up.  
  
Q. Troy and Tim, can you talk about what Mitch brought tonight?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Mitch said it, he brought energy, he brought toughness, he
brought poise, and that's what we need out of our bigs, every last one of
them, not only Mitch but Jon Horford came in got his big minutes, got big
rebounds and they all just played with a lot of energy and a lot of confidence
out there.  
  
Q. Tim, it seemed like when Trey went out even though it was briefly, you
guys extended the lead. What was the message in the huddle when Trey went
out?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: You know, this happened before during the season our first
game.  
We all know how valuable Trey is to our team, but it's a team game and we all
knew that we all had to step up when he went down.  
We all just did a great job of going out there, executing the plays and just
trying to play team ball.  
  
Q. Trey or Tim, can you talk about Glenn start to the second half that
little run that he had with a couple three pointers?  
TREY BURKE: Critical. He did a very phenomenal job of picking and choosing
when the shots were there and he knocked down the open shots for us. He played
his tail off tonight. He crashed the boards when we missed and he got us a
couple second opportunities to score.  
That's Glenn Robinson at his best. If he can play like that, which we know he
can, then this team would be that much better.  
  
Q. Tim, can you talk about your shooting tonight?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Yeah, just coming in earlier today when myself, Nik
Stauskas, and Caris LeVert and some of our bigs just come in here and get
extra reps out and just getting a feel of the court and just feel for the
environment. We played here before last year. So we kind of know what to
expect out of the court and out of the rim. So it was good. It felt good.  
  
Q. Trey, what was your frustration level like tonight?  
TREY BURKE: I wasn't frustrated at all.  
I knew that my shot wasn't falling, and I just tried to contribute in
different ways, and, you know, we had different hot hands tonight: Tim, Nick,
Glenn, Mitch, you know, every -- those guys were going.  
As a point guard, it's my job to go to those guys so we have success on the
offensive end.  
MODERATOR: Floor is open for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. You guys started five of six deep shooting to start the game. How did you
feel the quality of shot was at that point?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think our guys -- South Dakota State played really good
defense in the beginning, particularly in the beginning of the game, and I
think our guys didn't see the gaps that we usually would see.  
We missed a couple easy ones. We missed some foul shots, but it was a -- they
really played good defense. They really keyed. They weren't giving help off
Tim at all. We couldn't get Tim open. And when Trey missed a few shots, we
didn't have many answers at first. Tim came back and hit two huge threes, deep
guarded threes, and it seemed to turn everything at that point.  
  
Q. Even though you probably didn't want to see the Burke that you saw
tonight and the injury, are you hurting to have seen what happened out of
it?  
COACH BEILEIN: We see this in practice more than we see it in games, and Tim's
always played with a lot of confidence, looking for scoring opportunities.  
What level we saw from Glenn and Mitch as well, that they -- Mitch gives us
the energy and just the dropoffs. When we drop-off to Mitch, he knows what to
do with it, but Glenn's presence was huge today because he was at a difficult
matchup. You know, they do a lot of one-four pick and pop. So he had also to
guard No. 3 as well as No. 42 back and forth. So he'd post up man and got a
terrific point guard. So wasn't just his offense. It was his defense as well.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the decision to go with Mitch.  
COACH BEILEIN: We've watched this very carefully and we're very loyal to it.
Jordan's giving to us a lot, but we thought in practice the last couple days,
let's just bring Jordan off the bench as needed and let's get him a lot of
reps in practice and see where he is.  
But John had to earn those minutes in the last couple games. Jordan's injury
still has him in a bit of a funk. So we just said, we're going to go with
Mitch as number one, Jon as No. 2, and really I think it's obvious to everyone
what Mitch can bring to us at times, but don't count Jordan out. He'll be
back.  
  
Q. You've talked in the past about Glenn needing to be a consistent scorer
for the team to be successful. Did you say anything to him prior to the game
or at halftime?  
COACH BEILEIN: No. There was -- you know, we say it to him every day in
practice where he's got to look at the basket, but within the structure of our
offense, there's all kinds of opportunities for him. He's got to learn where
they are.  
And I like what he's doing sometimes. He's showing some drives. He's doing
some things, but when he came off, you know, in the corner, hit the two jump
shots, but when he came off and hit two other jump shots, that's something he
does for us, not even enough in practice.  
So I love when we get that from him, as long as he compliments that with
enough times that he drives to the basket. We don't want him to just be a jump
shooter. He's got to get 2 feet in the paint because he can go by a lot of
people, especially some of the forwards that he faces.  
  
Q. John, do you think with all the attention he's gotten that Burke has
pressed a little bit, and if he has, how much does it help him?  
COACH BEILEIN: I didn't see that. I saw him looking for opportunities, and
they played really good defense.  
He still had seven assists and two turnovers. So probably there's a couple of
shots, but I think Burke, Tim, and he, they have that type of -- I have that
type of confidence in them to be able to survive a shot that they usually tell
me, Coach, I know that was a bad one.  
But he had some other good shots that didn't go down. It's really good to have
those other guys there, and that's really something that we haven't always had
in these situations, is more answers than if one of our other guys was off.  
So we just played through this right now, and someone asked me when he was 0
for 7 at halftime I said that means he'll probably be 7 for 7 at the second
half because the odds are he's going to start making them.  
Now, he still didn't do that. Still wouldn't trade him. Want him out there
every minute we can have him out there.  
  
Q. How excited are you to get away from the Big Ten for a minute?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think every Big Ten team right now is glad that they weren't
playing a Big 10 team. Now, we're all playing quality opponents, but the Big
Ten has a certain style to it that it makes it difficult to score points, to
stop people, to do everything.  
But each team that we're going to play here along the line will be more like
the Big Ten teams, including our next opponent. So it is good to get away from
that.  
We all know each other very well, let's put it this way, and your angst is
prepare for a new team you don't know much about. At the same time, it is
different for us, and probably a good different.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your strategy going into defend Wolters and the job
you did?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, we had a couple of things. We wanted to quick hedge the
ball screen a little quicker than we normally do to get back to the shooter,
and then we also wanted to put Tim on him to get some length on him, and if we
did switch any ball screens, then he could also be on No. 42.  
Trey did a good job on him. He's a heck of a player. A lot will be said about,
you know, that Trey -- that maybe Wolters guarded Trey very well. Well, so did
Trey guard Nate.  
  
Q. Coach, what's the first thing that goes through your head when you see
Trey hit the floor as hard as he did?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, that was a scary moment for us.  
One thing I know, the kid is tough as nails. I mean, whether he's in the
weight room, whether he's in practice -- avoids the training room like the
plague unless he has to. He's actually -- he's not a guy that shows any sign
of weakness as far as physical injury. So he needs a lot of ice, but that was
not a good feeling.  
But you could tell -- I saw him sort of move quickly right away. Felt he was
going to be fine, and then I went about my business of arguing with the
officials. (Laughter) But he -- apparently it was our own player that knocked
him off balance, but the video may say that.  
  
Q. You talk about the balance between hitting singles and going for home
runs. Were you pleased overall with the balance?  
COACH BEILEIN: The value and the possessions, we had Spike and Trey both throw
some long, long passes that, actually, we've gotten to be much better at that
than we were earlier in the year. So we have a rule on that, if you throw
that, it better work. And it's the only rule. But it didn't work twice, and I
think after that we pulled that back a little bit. But it is important.  
We had a lot of good assists. We had very low turnovers again. That means
people weren't trying to do too much.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  

Michigan State  65  
Valparaiso  54

  
MODERATOR: We'll start with opening statements from Coach Izzo.  
COACH IZZO: Well, thanks.  
I guess I was really pleased with about 33, 34 minutes of that game, first
couple were a little sluggish and the last five were a little disgusting, to
be honest. We didn't do a very good job of some things, but in between I
thought we guarded. I thought Keith ran it, we got the ball inside.  
B. J. did a good job of slashing and working on the backside of that zone at
times, but I do got to give Bryce and his crew credit. I mean, watching them
on film number of threes, I thought they had some open looks the first half
that they didn't make. He did, you know, a very good job. I just thought we
were a little overpowering inside. We were worried about their perimeter
shooting outside.  
We took advantage of our stuff inside, and they missed some shots outside.  
But, God, he's got a nice team. Good guys and good shooters. So I don't have
enough good things to say about them and yet I feel pretty proud that we found
a way to do what we said in the game plan, get the ball inside. Derrick got it
in, got it out, and when he did get it back in, he scored in there and we did
hit the offensive boards and that was the difference in the game.  
So thanks.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Derrick, can you talk for yourself about how big of a motivator it is
that this will be the final run for you.  
For BJ and Keith, how big of a motivator that is for you when you see
Derrick playing like that?  
DERRICK NIX: Well, you know, it's my last go-around and I'm not ready to be
done yet.  
Coach told me every day just make sure I'm having the guys ready in the hotel
and the locker room.  
The game plan was go inside. I don't know we did that when they doubled I was
able to hit my shooters, but they just kept feeding so I just kept taking it
to them.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I'd say the same thing Nix said.  
When the ball go into Nix, he does great thing in. There he's a very good
passer and the double team came he kicked it out.  
For him, being this is his last go-around, we feed off him and we look up to
him like he's our big brother.  
He tell us, you know what to do, what not to do off the court. That's what
motivate us.  
KEITH APPLING: I feel like it's very important that he comes out and play the
way he did each and every night because you know, he's our only senior and
he's one of the leaders on this team.  
His play really dictates how we go as a team.  
I feel like that's one of the motivating factors.  
  
Q. Derrick, I read that you quoted the other day saying the cleaner your
hotel is the better you play. How spotless was your room today?  
DERRICK NIX: It was real spotless. I'm a superstitious guy. Once I get to the
hotel, I lay all my game stuff out the first night. And tournament time I call
the people and make sure they clean the rooms when we leave for our walk-
through in the lobby.  
(Laughter)  
That's just how I am. It's rubbed off on Costello. Now when he gets in there
he lays all the stuff out. We make sure our bathroom's clean before we leave
and make our beds and throw away all your trash.  
  
Q. Keith, early when things were sluggish, can you talk about the three
pointers that Gary Harris made?  
KEITH APPLING: Those were very important.  
I mean, one of the game plans was to go inside and let the bigs make something
happen, but each and every time they dove, they made the right play and kicked
it out to myself or Gary.  
Not only me but he was able to make shots and those were big for us because at
the time things were a little rugged, but it kind of gave us a little
momentum.  
  
Q. Branden, I want to ask you about the defense you played on Broekhoff.  
Keith, if you could also comment?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, Broekhoff, he's a very versatile guy. I know we were
watching for him.  
He plays the floor, but we look at him as a big guard. He was coming off pick
and rolls and he was bringing the ball up the court. It was sometimes when he
came up the court and we didn't communicate on the ball screen that he came
up.  
But we play defense on him I say me and myself and Adrien Payne, we played
solid and we just -- Coach just kept telling stay solid and don't gamble.  
KEITH APPLING: Personally I think Coach gives myself and Gary a lot of credit
for being two of the better defensive players on the team, but I think Branden
is just as good as we are when he wants to be.  
He did a great job on Broekhoff. Every time he was able to score, it was off
one of our mistakes. So throughout the course of the game, I feel like he did
a pretty good job trailing and contesting the shots.  
  
Q. I had two questions, one for Keith and one for Derrick. First one to
Keith. Did it seem a little bit like the game at Pershing when you guys played
there? To Derrick, talk about the patience that you have to have when people
are double teaming you?  
DERRICK NIX: Sometimes coaches don't understand being double teamed is
frustrating when you got two big guys coming at you.  
You got to just take your time. They taught us how to crabs over here. So now
I just crabs and want to hurry up and get it out. He just said if I get it
out, it's going to come back in. So don't try to force shots I don't practice
on in practice.  
KEITH APPLING: Could you repeat your question for me, please?  
  
Q. The question was did it seem like the game at Pershing?  
COACH IZZO: You think their gym at Pershing was like this one? (Laughter)
You'd get a lot of money if that's going to happen. I'll tell you that.  
KEITH APPLING: No, I don't think it felt like the game at Pershing.  
We just followed the game plan, did things that we were supposed to do. Things
worked out for us.  
DERRICK NIX: Maybe BJ gambling was more of a Pershing style of play when we
were going for those steals.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: One time (Laughter).  
MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.  
Coach Izzo opened up for questions.  
  
Q. Isn't this what really good, dare I say, great teams do? They step on a
team like that that you're better than?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, I think we are a little better than them, but I
think you didn't see their best either.  
And I think we had something to do with it, but it's a very well coached --
they run some great stuff. In fact, I'm going to steal a few thing from them.  
They had a lot of shooters. But we did do -- what they did well, we guarded.
And what we do well, they struggled with, the guards especially when they got
in foul trouble. And I think that's the beauty of this team. There aren't a
lot of things, but one of them is we have versatility to play different teams.
We can bring different guys in like Branden who can cover. You know it's a
hard job for AP to cover a four that really plays like a guard but Branden can
cover them a little different. We can switch a little bit more.  
We do have some versatility and when Keith's playing well, you know. Gary was
okay today, but I think he's got a ceiling yet that we can get to.  
I don't know if it's stepping on anybody, but I thought we played awfully
well.  
They got us in one of our best games. I think we got one of them in their poor
shooting games.  
  
Q. What did you think was the big key where you guys pulled away in the
first half?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it was Nix. And he made, I think, one basket in that one
run, but I think Gary hit two threes in a row, both on kickouts.  
They have to guard a little different. They doubled. I thought they did a
great job doubling the post early, and then we just -- we did something we
haven't been very good at. We kept going back in there.  
Sometimes when teams doubled us, we got away from it. We pretty much stayed
with that same plan the whole game, and I thought that was good on our part.  
  
Q. Tom, for a game that you were up 20 points a lot of, you looked like you
were going to kill somebody about five or six times in the course of the game.
Is that part of the thing that when you're playing a team that might not be up
to you that you got to stay on your guys that you've got to stay on your
team?  
COACH IZZO: You know, when you don't have a player coach team and it's been
widely publicized -- I mean they're doing a better job, but that it's not the
strength of this team, it's harder to stay focused. And you know, you come out
of huddles and somebody -- Day-Day's got to grab somebody and tell them on the
court.  
You know, I just decided after watching some games and listening to some
coaches' interviews, if there's anybody that's gotten a little soft, it's been
me, and I'm not going to tolerate anything but their best.  
You know what, if people don't like the way I do it or how I do it, I really
don't care anymore. I'm getting back old schoolish a little bit.  
And I told them, 40 minutes, we're playing. If you don't want to play 40
minutes, you're going to have a problem. So guys that didn't play 40 minutes
and didn't get back are going to have a problem, and that's the way it used to
be.  
So, you know, you're right, I didn't want mistakes when we were telling a guy
who he's got and all of a sudden they hit two threes in a row before halftime
because we didn't listen, inexcusable, and they're going to pay the price for
that, and the price is you're either going to sit, or I'm going to tell you.  
So, yeah, I worry a little bit about this team keeping them focused, and yet I
got to give them credit that they did a lot of the way, and I think they --
some guys in the locker room took blame for not being as focused as they
needed to be. So that's good. It's all good.  
  
Q. Tom, can you talk about Branden Dawson?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it gives us a big advantage.  
He looked like he was a little bit back. He got some big rebounds. His spin
move, he hasn't done that. The balance I thought made a couple good kickouts
in there, one to Trav early in the game that was part of that. And Branden
felt more comfortable, but I think he played harder. He was really engaged. I
bet you the first half he was my favorite guy in the huddles. He was really
engaged in there and really after a lot of people, and that was good.  
Nix is actually sicker than a dog, if you can believe that. He was really -- I
don't know if it was nerves or what, but he was throwing up and everything
early. So he didn't have the energy even though he played well.  
But I thought Dawson did the best job of that, and he can guard a lot of
people, you know, as he gets better back to normal, moving laterally and that
could be a big plus for us, especially when we -- who knows who we'll play. I
mean, the two completely different teams, you know. If it's Memphis, it's more
of an athletic team like Louisville. We really felt we were trouble last year
in that Louisville game. We didn't have an athlete that can match theirs.  
Brendan Dawson's the athlete that can match most.  
  
Q. You've talked a lot throughout the season about Derrick's growth and
maturation throughout his time here, but he seems a little bit different the
last two and a half, three weeks. Have you noticed that?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, you know, he's -- it's kind of funny, because he's like all
of us were.  
The end is here and he doesn't have an answer where he's going next -- two
months from now. When you're in a junior high, you know when you're going to
high school. When you're in high school, you're already signed with a college,
you know where you're going. All of a sudden, you don't know what you're
doing, and I found a sincere -- he's almost scared sometimes like a big teddy
bear, like what am I going to do. Well, play well and maybe that will help
determine what you're going to do.  
So he has been a little bit more that way. At times I can just see it in him
and yet at times it drives him and that's good too.  
It has worked both ways. There's some times you see him out there he almost
looks sad and he said to me with five minutes left and I took him out and he
says, Coach, you know, this is one of the last times I'm playing. You know, so
I put him back in because I thought, you know what, that was -- that's kind of
why I want him. I want him hungry to do that and that's not always his
personality. So I did put him back in for a couple minutes, and that's the way
it went.  
  
Q. You talked about how Valpo got some open shots. What is it about good
teams where they seem to kind of figure it out defensively?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, after the first four or five minutes, I thought they had a
couple good ones, and then I think we clamped down. I think that's what good
defensive teams do, we clamp down. You're rushing the shot a little bit,
you're getting it off a little higher over an arm.  
I did think we played better, and just like at the end, I thought we played
sloppier, you know, when we let them ball screen and drive off his kickout for
threes. That's what they're very, very good at.  
So we are a good defensive team. We've been a good defensive program. We sure
played everybody and their uncle this year, and so, you know, a couple of
those early timeouts, it was about, hey, we got to get after it. We're missing
shots. We better get long rebounds and push the ball and get some on our fast
break, and we did that too.  
  
Q. The obligatory crowd question, were you guys feeling that?  
COACH IZZO: I did. I always feel bad at these NCAA tournaments because
sometimes, you know, the way we will get so few tickets, and I know that's the
fair way to do it, but you never know who's going to come and what's going to
happen, but it was -- you could definitely tell it was a more pro Michigan
State crowd.  
I think that helps us, but at the same time I think that's the advantage of
playing in the Big Ten. You got to learn to play on the road. People are
booing at you. People are hugging you. People are yelling at. You got to learn
how to do it. Definitely feels better and it's great to be back in the Palace.  
  
Q. When Nix came out early in the game and you talked to him, was it to
check on his health or was it an adjustment? How did he show patience?  
COACH IZZO: I told him I'm going to be checking on my health the way he was
playing. He wasn't doing anything. He missed a layup. He just -- to me, he
wasn't playing very good. I'm trying to figure out guys still at the end of
the year, and so I took him out. I said, you know, I'm going to put you back
in, but I'm going to take you back out too.  
I mean, he gets it. I thought my team was a lot more in tune today for 90
percent of it, and he did miss some -- he missed those two layups right off
the bat, and then he just wasn't guarding like we wanted him to. Once we put
him back in, I thought he really turned a corner, so give him credit.  
  
Q. Did he show patience?  
COACH IZZO: He showed some great patience. We talked about their double teams.  
This is a very well coached team, I'm telling you, they do some nice things
even defensively. They tried to do what they could to take us out of our
stuff, and that little matchup zone they played at the end I thought was
impressive. We didn't do a very good job in tacking it but he did a pretty
good job staying in it.  
Nix needed patience because they doubled. The only thing we messed up on, we
thought we had B.J. on some slashing cuts and sometimes Nix gets off balance
and so we try to talk about that.  
But, yeah, I thought the way they doubled, because it was -- they came at him.
They didn't just, you know, dance around, and I thought he did a pretty good
job in there.  
  
Q. You can't teach Derrick size but you can teach his ball handling and
decisions. How does that develop over the years and how important is that?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I got to give him credit. He had a good high school coach
that taught him. He is a great passer. I mean, he's a Zach Randolph kind of
passer where that ball goes in. If you remember last year he was almost
passing too much. You'd have a layup and he'd pass it out. And now he's kind
of finding the happy medium but he's learning to keep the ball lower.  
I think that's one thing we've helped him with. That ball was always up. He
calls it crab dribble. Whatever you want to call it, but when you got the ball
low and you're getting doubled, you get the ball in your hands quicker and you
can do stuff with it.  
But he sees the court very well. He's a very cerebral -- he's one of my more
intelligent basketball players. He has a great understanding of the game and a
great feel for the game. Once in a while he gets a little sloppy, but for the
most part he's really good at that.  
  
Q. Tom, when you had a guess the other night of who was the guy who grabbed
the ball return machine out of the corner and put up shots, you guessed Gary
Harris and it was him. When you've got a guy that talented, how much does that
help you in those shots tonight that he made?  
COACH IZZO: Gary Harris and Keith Appling -- now, Harris, he drags all those
freshman in with him, but him and Appling, Appling's been in there every day
at 8:00 o'clock in the morning shooting. He's worked his way out of his slump.
He's done it the way you're supposed to do it, you know.  
Instead of -- everybody was down on him, including me some, and I told him,
you know, he starts working harder at it, he's got to spend more time. He's
always been a hard worker in practice, but it's the extra time.  
Both those guys do it, and Harris is going to be, you know, a special player.
I mean, he guarded pretty well today too, and he can really make some shots.
And we just got to -- you know, he was off a little bit that first half. I
think he was, what, two for seven or eight or whatever, six, and then we just
-- we need both those guys to play well. If our guards play well -- and we'll
get Payne playing better. He's been our most consistent player. Struggled a
little bit today. I didn't think he was -- you know, guys get frustrated easy,
I think, and I got to get him out of that.  
  
Q. How much of a relief was it to come out of Chicago and the Big Ten
tournament and begin this tournament?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it wasn't a relief from the standpoint of when you play the
same teams. You know, you play Ohio state three times, they know what you do,
you know what they do. Things get a little tough in that situation.  
I thought, you know, all in all, it helped prepare us, and I think it was
good, but I bet you -- I talked to John Beilein yesterday. I think everybody
agrees that it's going to be fun to move out of the conference for a while. If
we meet again, let's make it down the road, and that would be awesome for a
lot of us. But we had enough of each other for that two-and-a-half month
stretch when we just beat the daylights out of each other.  
Yet, I said to my team at halftime, you know, look, they're going to throw
some zone at us, they're going to throw some different things, they might
throw some matchup, but we faced everything. When you look at Northwest and
how they play and this team, how they play, that's the beauty of our
conference. I think that helps us make our team that way, that we can adjust
to different styles.  
  
Q. You seemed to get a good laugh when Derrick said coaches don't understand
what it is when you get the double times on them. Is that part of the give-
and-take that you guys were having?  
A.Yeah.  
There's going to be a lot more giving on my part than taking, but if he can
get a kick out of my size and his size once in a while, I'm cool with that.
It's when he's not listening to what I'm telling him to do that I'm not cool
with.  
You know, it's part of the relationship we've grown to have. You can't be a
demanding coach if you don't have a relationship with your players. It's just
not right. It just doesn't work. Maybe it did work when Vince Lombardi said,
Do it my way or the highway, you know.  
Now, guys take the highway, and so you got to give and take a little bit. You
got to make them understand, you know, that when they know how much you care,
then I think they adjust. And sometimes we just try to do it in a dictatorship
manner, you know, Do what I say, Boy. You know, it's not working. It's not
working. It's just the way it is.  
But what's the bottom line is, you get them to do what you say. So you got to
go around it. And then, you know, I've grown with Derrick. Derrick's grown
with me. And I like the fact he can have a little fun up here because it's
been a grinding year for us, but it's been a good year and we get to live
another day.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: Coach Pastner, opening statement.  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, a few things.  
No. 1, just we're very grateful to be here. Obviously it's not a birthright to
be in the NCAA tournament. So for us it's our third straight year. You don't
take it for granted. It's a very, very special, special opportunity to do so.
We're very grateful for that.  
Secondly, I want to give a lot of credit that I think it's just terrific that
if you saw the Journal of Higher Education, we actually should have a banner
hanging up in Memphis due to the Final Four that we achieved based on our
academics because the Journal of Higher Education did a thing based on APR
scores and graduation rates on of all the 68 teams in the tournament who would
advance, and the four teams that advanced to the Final Four were Memphis,
Belmont, and Kansas Butler. So Memphis to the Final Four academically.  
We have a perfect APR score. One of the top 10 percent in all sports, men's
and women's. We have a possibility of nine guys graduating this spring and
summer, four seniors, five juniors graduating early. So not only have had
great success on the court; we've got tremendous success academically, and
that's because we have fine young men.  
So really proud of our guys academically on top of the athletic
accomplishments.  
So with that being said, we're again, like I said, we're very privileged to be
here. We're playing a very, very good St. Mary's team, a well coached team.
They've got very good basketball players, and we know that, you know, we're
going to play great, but I know our guys will be ready to go.  
We're in a great mindset right now. Of all the great teams in Tiger history,
we're the first Tiger team ever to have three guys with 100 or more assists in
one season, and we really do a good job of making the extra pass. Our whole
motto is the open man's a go-to man. We do a good job not only making the
extra pass but making the hocket assist. That's important to us. And over like
the last 15, 16, 17 games, about 70 percent of our made field goals had been
assisted, about 70 percent. That's ridiculous when you think about that
number. That's so high. That's unselfish basketball. And we've done a really
good job being a 50/50 ball team. That's why we're fortunate to -- that's why
we're at 30 wins, because a lot of those games in all 30 wins we've won the
50/50 battle. That's very, very important for us, the identity of our team as
a 50/50 ball team.  
So any way, that's that. I'll leave it up to questions for the players and we
have a great, great -- not a good, but a great group of young men on this team
academically, character-wise, and athletically.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, this is your third time. What do learn from the
first two that you think helps you in this game tomorrow?  
D.J. STEPHENS: Just we got to get past the first one, of course. Everybody's
looking for us to get this first tournament win.  
But pretty much going into this tournament, we'll have a lot more experience
going into the tournament. We have a lot of veteran guys on the team.  
We've been in a lot of tough situations all year long and we weathered the
storm. We've overcame many odds and done a lot of great things this year. So
we just got to play our style of basketball. We can't let the team try to
dictate the tempo. We have to take control of the game and just be aggressive
from the tip.  
  
Q. Do you worry at all about tightness? You guys have said it yourselves, do
you worry at all about coming out tight tomorrow?  
ADONIS THOMAS: I don't think so. I think everybody's excited and ready to
play.  
We got a nice group of guys here. We prepared very hard. We watched films. So
I mean we know the type of team we going up against. So it's going to be --
this first win will be a great win for us even though we haven't won the
previous two years. So this first win will be something good for this program.  
  
Q. Is there any pressure of trying to complete another great season of being
undefeated in the conference and getting a major win outside of the
conference?  
JOE JACKSON: Well, it's a good opportunity for our team to come in this
tournament and do well. We got another opportunity. A lot of teams around the
country don't get this opportunity. So we just got to go out there and play,
play hard, and play aggressive. And, you know, every game is a big game from
here on out. So just leave it out on the floor.  
  
Q. You guys watched the game together last night, and if you did, what do
you think of Dellavedova?  
JOE JACKSON: He's a very smart guard. It seems like he's been playing the game
for awhile. He's the master of a hockey assist. He know how to draw two people
on the ball and he just do a great job and get his teammates involved and
people don't talk about it but he really can shoot the ball too so you really
got to play them honest. He's not the fastest guy, but he's one of the smarter
guys in the country.  
  
Q. What do you guys think about St. Mary's coming in here battle tested,
fighting for their lives going against Gonzaga in the first round? You guys
haven't really seemed like you've been tested much since UTEP.  
COACH PASTNER: Can I answer that?  
To say that we haven't been battle tested is ridiculous.  
Do you recognize that every single time we step on the floor that we get
everyone's best shot? We've won 26 straight conference USA games.  
Every time we step on the floor, we get everyone's best shot. That means if
we're playing East Carolina, they have a gold out. If we're playing Marshall
they have a green out. If we're playing Southern Miss, they have their biggest
miss and get a blackout. If we play our B game during conference game, we take
an L. We have no option but to play an A game every night.  
So for anyone to say we're not battle tested, think to go -- to be able to get
to 30 wins before the NCAA tournament and to go undefeated and have a 26
streak, conference winning streak knowing that every single night if you bring
your B game you take an L. So for anyone to say that we're not battle tested
is absolutely ridiculous.  
  
Q. Do you guys want to add to that?  
D.J. STEPHENS: I mean, just to add on to what Coach said, we play many tough
teams. We went in a lot of hostile environments all season long. We've been
tested. We've been in many tough situations, close games with teams on their
home court and we've come out with wins. So I wouldn't say we haven't been
battle tested.  
You might say we haven't been battle tested because we haven't played big name
schools or whatever, but night in and night out, you can tell by the way the
season's been going, how team's have been going up and down the Top 25, it's a
great year of basketball. All teams are good. So any team could lose on any
given night. So like Coach was saying, if you come in, you're not ready to
play, you can lose to whoever on whatever night.  
So I just feel that going into tomorrow's game, they're a great basketball
team, we have to stay focused and stay poised.  
  
Q. You guys take offense to the battle test. Are you going to try to prove
the naysayers wrong in this thing?  
JOE JACKSON: I think our biggest test come in practice, because we play
against each other and I think we got the best first and second string in the
country. I mean, we got a guy like Chris Crawford coming off the bench and got
Antonio Barton and you got Geron Johnson, you got Adonis, you know, just
playing against each other in practice, that's what makes us better. We've
been battle tested from practice. It's not necessarily the teams out there.
It's just sometimes we may get in a situation, we may lay an egg and lose, but
I feel like we really got a good team and we going to do well.  
  
Q. Talk about the support, to the folks that are traveling up, what it means
to you guys.  
COACH PASTNER: I'll answer that.  
Let me just tell you this: I think our fan base is the best fan base in the
entire country, hands down, and that's just not a coach's speak. Our fan base
is as emotionally invested and as passionate, as intense for their program,
because it's their program, as anywhere in the country. There's nothing like
it.  
And we travel great, whether it's away or obviously at home. I mean, year in
year out, we're top ten in attendance. You know, I'm here -- we've got our
associate athletic directer Wren Baker right there. So if you want to ask him,
obviously our boss man Tom Bowen and his son as well too, you can interview
him if you want, he'll tell you. He'll tell you how passionate the fan base
is.  
So we've got great fans, and Bob Winn, our associate AD back there as well
too. We've got great fans, and we're very fortunate to have the support that
we get.  
That is another thing we don't take for granted. We do not take our media
coverage, nor our fan support for granted.  
  
Q. Speaking to that issue a little bit, you're going to need the fans maybe
because of the dynamic with the home team here. Do you expect the state fans
to be rooting against you?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, our only focus is Thursday because we're playing a really
good basketball team in St. Mary's. Very well-coached team, and Randy Bennett,
who's done a great job there, won a lot of games. They've got very good
players. So that's a good basketball team. So that's our focus.  
But for us, you know, one time this year we had the longest true road win
streak dating back to last year of any team in the country. So, you know,
we've been a pretty good road team even through my four years. Not only this
year but through my four years here, we've been a pretty darn good road team.
And one of the reasons, as you know, with the selection committee, it's one of
their key criteria this year, was what you did on the road.  
You know, whether it's neutral road, we know we got to play. Our only focus
obviously is Thursday, focused on St. Mary's, and we can't look past that.
That's our only focus. We know they're really good and we're going to have to
play a great game.  
  
Q. Adonis and Joe, why do you guys think you guys are so good on the road?  
ADONIS THOMAS: I think when we're on the road we become more a family, more of
brothers. It's all about us. It's one unit, and I think everybody become more
leaders. Our leaders like our seniors pull us together and the guys who have
been here, the veteran guys, the experienced guys, they know what it takes to
win on the road. So we all usually come together on the road. You know, it's
more of us as a family, us against the fans that's there supporting the
opposite team.  
JOE JACKSON: I think just playing on the road with a team like us, it just
give us an edge because we know we going against the fans and we going
against, you know, everybody that's in the stands. So it just makes us play
harder and I guess we don't have room for mistakes on the road. That makes us
just make the right decisions and be more precise just playing the game.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, student-athletes.  
COACH PASTNER: D.J. Stephens is going to graduate in the spring. Joe Jackson's
going to graduate in the summer. He's a junior. Adonis Thomas is a sophomore
and tried to graduate as a junior.  
We're really in tremendous shape academically.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Just following up on the battle tested since you seemed a little animated
about that?  
COACH PASTNER: Not animated. I was just speaking from the heart.  
  
Q. But it doesn't seem any different than the last two years. You've had
great success over the seasons and fallen flat. What's the difference this
year?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, let me say this: Two years ago we played Arizona. They
were a five seed. We were a twelve seed. I mean, we missed a shot at the
buzzer to win the game, and then they ended up being a shot away from winning
the Final Four. You know, I don't know as much on that.  
And last year we played a very, very good St. Louis team, and we didn't get
the job done. So, look, I recognize people are going to be on me if we don't,
you know, advance in the tournament. I recognize that, but I'm okay with that.
Because I know if you ask anyone in our business, in our profession -- in
fact, Tom Izzo said it on CBS when they were playing Ohio State, they said a
true measure of a team is what you do during your conference play. That's a
tremendous measure if you've had a successful season or not because it's over
a two-and-a-half, three-month period.  
So when you look at what we've done in these past years, we've had tremendous
success over the long haul, over the body of work. So I'm not going to let one
game just diminish, you know, a season of 35 games, 34 games of tremendous
success. Whether it's this year, last year, year before, doesn't matter.  
But I also recognize that you and anyone here, fans, they're going to --
individually we're going to be judged on what we do in March, because that's
where the most premium is put on it. So you got to accept that. Can't hide
from it. You just deal with it, and the best thing we can do is to try to win
games.  
  
Q. Talk about the way your team's handled adversity this year.  
COACH PASTNER: Another quote from Tom Izzo, he said it when they were playing
on ESPN verses Indiana. He said for a team to have really good success, you
have to go through some adversity, whether it's internally or externally. And
I say that because Coach Izzo, I'm sure he'll be in the hall of fame probably.
The guy should already be in there.  
You know, we've had some adversity. Nothing serious. Just little team stuff. I
mean, we're with each other -- I'm with those guys more than I'm with my own
family, my own immediate family, and they're with us more than they're with
anybody else. So that's going to happen. You're with each other, but we're
talking very, very minor stuff, adversity. We're talking a little thing here,
a little thing here. Let's keep it in perspective.  
There's been zero off-the-court issue with the law, anything academically,
anything that would embarrass -- we're just talking the little things that are
just little things that have happened within a family, nothing more than that.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you say to Tiger nation and the fans that want the win?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, I assure you they don't want to win as much as I do.
Nobody wants to win more than the head coach, I can assure you that. Nobody.  
I want to go 40 and 0. We've lost four times. I was sick after all four
losses. I can't stand losing, and so I want us -- you know, I want us to go
undefeated every single year, never lose a game, but I also recognize that the
other team we play is good, they want to win too. So, you know, a lot of times
it comes down if you make some shots you're probably going to win; if you
don't make some shots, probably going to take an L.  
I recognize, look, at this level of a program, we want to advance. We are
expected to advance, and we got no problem with that. And it's our job to
advance and it's our job to win games, but in order to do that, we've got to
beat a very, very good St. Mary's team on Thursday and tomorrow.  
  
Q. It sounds like what you're saying is that you place more importance on
the conference body of work throughout the season than you do on one game in
the NCAA tournament?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, it's not that -- I mean, look, we have goals as a team,
and one of our goals is to win a regular season conference championship.
That's a goal.  
One of your goals is to win the conference tournament championship. I mean,
that's a goal that you set as a team. And we've done that. We've done that in
these last couple years.  
And your goal is to advance -- you know, you want to compete and try to win a
national championship. Again, remember there's only one champion. There's only
four teams that are getting into the Final Four. Eight in the Elite 8, 16, so
on, so on. I think people in the profession, coaches in the profession, people
that understand, they see the whole body of work, they recognize -- like I've
had so many people text message and call me, head coaches in the profession, I
mean, high, high-level head coaches say, What you did to go undefeated in
league play in this day and age and to win on the road is an amazing
accomplishment.  
And when you look all throughout college basketball, the gap is closed,
everyone's good. So look, we put a lot of emphasis and importance on the NCAA
tournament. There's no question we do, but you can't, one, get there unless
you do your job during the five months prior, and secondly, I mean, being in a
conference, I mean, whether it's a 16, 18, 20-game season, you're battling the
teams that know you better than anyone, your true road games, but what I'm
saying, though, is also that I recognize, totally recognize from media, fans
that what the most thing they look at is what you do in March. So I'm okay
with that, but I'm not ever going to allow it to shorten or take away from the
great stuff we've done in the five months prior to that.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Dellavedova and the matchups with St. Mary's?  
COACH PASTNER: I think Dellavedova is a really good player. He's a pro. I
mean, look, the guy was a starting guard for the Australian Olympic team. In
fact, the Dream Team had to change their pick-and-roll coverage against him
because he was hurting them.  
He's good. He's really, really good. He's a pro. I mean, he's a pro. He's 24
years old. He's a pro. He's a pro basketball player that's playing college.
When I say that pro, you know, not in a lack of amateur status, just of a pro
basketball player playing college. So, you know, we've got to do a great job
on him.  
But here's my other thing: He's not the only good player they have on their
team. The Holt kid, he's really good too. Waldow can play. I mean, they've got
multiple guys that can play. They've got guys coming off the bench second
play. You don't win -- what do they win? 26, 27 games. You don't do that -- 28
games, however many they won without being really good. And I've known Randy
for a long time back in my days at Arizona. He's a very, very good basketball
coach. They run a great system and they're good. They're flat out good.  
MODERATOR: Thanks very much, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: Let's start off with Coach Nagy.  
COACH NAGY: Good morning. Obviously we're thrilled to be here. It's our second
time. I think this time it's a little less overwhelming for us.  
The stage is big and we know that. It's bigger than what we're generally used
to, but I think last year having made it through the transition from Division
II to Division I was very emotional for me and for some of our players and
staff.  
This year it's less emotion. Feels a little bit more like business, and less
overwhelming more us. So we're thrilled to be here. We know we're playing a
great basketball team.  
But I know that our players are excited. We've had good practices this week
and we're just ready to go.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you expand on what coach was talking about this being the second time
around?  
TONY FIEGEN: Yeah, last year was a first time for all of us. You know, we'd
just experienced the NCAA tournament by watching it on TV. Then last year, you
know, it was our first year.  
Kind of the bright lights, the big stage, it was kind of new for all of us.  
Like Coach touched on this year, it does feel a little bit like a business
trip, you know, because we're coming here to play well.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on Trey Burke from what you've seen on him on
film?  
NATE WOLTERS: He's a great player. Probably the national player of the year.  
They're a really talented team. They ranked No. 1 earlier in the season. So I
mean it will be a good challenge for us and we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk a little bit about coming back this year?  
JORDAN DYKSTRA: I mean, I don't think that really has a whole lot to do with
it. I think like Coach and Tony touched on already that we were here last year
in this situation and we've been through this already. So this year is more
business.  
  
Q. Nate, we've got Valparaiso here in Auburn Hills as well. I was just
wondering how many times have you seen that Bryce Drew shot and do you have
any recollection of it?  
NATE WOLTERS: Yeah, I mean I think that's every kid's dream to hit a shot like
that. I remember as a little kid just being a huge upset story and he was a
great player. So yeah I think that's what kind of all these mid-majors dream
about.  
  
Q. Tony, you were one of the earlier Division I recruits that Scott had. Can
you talk about the process of making that decision to go to SDSU, and then
also what that's been like?  
TONY FIEGEN: Well, coming in I don't know if I really had any expectations.
You know, they were going through a transition and times were tough.  
I'm just glad to be a part of kind of getting South Dakota State back to the
winning experience.  
You know, Coach Nagy held tough through the hard times. And just to be a part
of that with these guys and with the alumni that have since graduated, it's
just really special and definitely a blessing.  
  
Q. Nate, obviously it's about the team and trying to pull off the upset. How
do you reconcile that with a lot of the individual stuff that you've been
getting?  
NATE WOLTERS: Not really. I mean, it's a team game. We're just focused on
trying to win.  
But, yeah, Michigan's a really talented team. We're going to have to play
really well to stay in the game, and we'll see what happens.  
  
Q. Nate, you talked about Michigan's talent, but now that you've seen him on
film, what jumps out to you?  
NATE WOLTERS: Oh, yeah, offensively they're really tough to stop. A lot of
talented offensive players.  
So I mean, they have a great point guard who makes a ton of plays and we'll
have to try to keep him in check, but I mean it's going to be a tough task. We
probably haven't played an offensive team as good as they are.  
  
Q. All year you've talked about how you're kind of a quiet team. Does that
help you when you're talking about this big stage?  
TONY FIEGEN: I think it can play to our advantage. You know, we don't play
this game up more than we should.  
Obviously it's a big stage, it's a very good team. We're just coming in here
confident, and we're just going to have to, you know, talk on the floor more
than we would talk otherwise, I guess.  
But, yeah, it's going to be really important that we just go in there and play
confidently tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tony, you talked about having the experience from last year. How much is
that going to help you this year? And then Michigan's a pretty young team. You
guys have a lot of seniors?  
TONY FIEGEN: I think our experience will play to our advantage here. Last year
it was kind of -- we got off to a quick start last year that really helped us.
I think it will be important for us to get off to a quick start again this
year especially definitely. Us three, and we've got more experience back in
the locker room that will definitely play to our advantage.  
  
Q. Some of you guys came here last year and didn't play your best games.
Does that motivate you at all going into this year?  
JORDAN DYKSTRA: I think it does just knowing we can play well against the good
teams.  
I know for myself it's really fueled my fire this year playing really poorly
at the end of last year, and I think for some of the others it has too.  
So hopefully we come out with another win.  
  
Q. Tony, can you talk about a little bit about the match up down low with
Jordan Morgan and the other Michigan big guys? What are you seeing on film and
what things do you have that could maybe neutralize them?  
TONY FIEGEN: Well, what we've seen on film is that they really crash the
glass. They're good at finishing around the rim and they're obviously bigger
than I am. It's going to be important for me just to keep a body on them at
all times when the shot goes up.  
Outside of that, I think maybe just using my quickness and just -- yeah, just
stepping away from the basket a little bit.  
  
Q. Nate, do you see any similarities between the way you play and Michigan's
Trey Burke?  
TONY FIEGEN: Yeah, I mean, I watch him on TV multiple times this year. I mean,
he's a great player, probably the best point guard in the country.  
So we try to learn things from him and, I mean, he's really good with pick and
roll and good shooter.  
He's going to be tough to guard.  
  
Q. Tony, obviously a South Dakota kid from Madison, and you've observed this
program even before you were a part of it. How amazing is it to see how far
they've come from a Division II program going through the transition and now
making a second consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament? What are some of your
observations on how far South Dakota State has come?  
TONY FIEGEN: It's really cool from seeing the success that they had at the
Division II level. You know, coaching AU was always -- they were a powerhouse
at the Division II level in the NCC.  
That was really fun and just to be a part of South Dakota State reemerging at
the new level, it's just really special and, you know, for these guys, they
probably didn't hear much about South Dakota State until they started getting
recruited.  
So I think for me it's a little more special now that I've -- since I've been
familiar with the program.  
  
Q. For Tony and Jordan, can you guys talk a little bit about the type of
teammate that Nate has been and how he's helped bring your program and your
team to the place you are today?  
JORDAN DYKSTRA: I mean, Nate's the best. I mean, there's -- simple. He gets
people open. He creates for himself. You just can't put words to describe how
good of a player Nate is.  
TONY FIEGEN: To add to that, just I really admire how he handles himself on
and off the court. You know, he receives so much press, but he remains humble.
And, you know, as a teammate I really appreciate that because, you know, a lot
of our success is attributed to him and he's just a special -- it just speaks
about his character.  
MODERATOR: Thank you student-athletes.  
Now we have Coach Nagy available for questions.  
  
Q. Coach, how much do you think the experience factor plays a role, whether
it's tournament experience or just the veteran nature of your players?  
COACH NAGY: You know, I think it's important, you know, how big a percentage
of the role it is, I don't know. I mean, we're -- you know, talent, I think
supersedes experience. I love experience, but, you know, I think as -- I can't
believe how much freshmen Michigan plays and how good they've been.  
So I think that we can talk about experience, and they were here last -- many
of their players weren't here last year because they played so many freshmen,
but all year those kids have played a lot of minutes.  
So I don't think you can call them freshmen anymore.  
And they played in, you know, what would be considered -- people call huge
games, huge venues. The stage has been big for them all year, and so I think
they have the experience to come into these games and play.  
The fact that we play mostly juniors and seniors and they play a lot of
freshmen, I think that they have very experienced players at this point.  
  
Q. Scott, looking back ten years, you said that this team could be
competitive at this level. It got to that level. Did the time frame match up
to what you thought it would be?  
COACH NAGY: Well, I've kind of blocked a lot of that out, Chris, to be honest
with you.  
I mean, it was -- the transition was difficult for us for a lot of reasons.
When we went, we didn't have a conference. We weren't eligible for any
postseason play for five years. You know, we weren't fully staffed at the
time. I mean, there were just so many things working against us. And we were
able to keep players for a couple years. Then we would lose them because it
got tough. It got tough. And I began to recruit. When I would recruit, I would
tell kids, look, this is going to be tough, and we need you to stick it out no
matter how tough it gets. We need you to stick it out. I need guys that are
committed. And if you're going to come here and when it gets tough you're
going to leave, then please don't come here because we don't want that
anymore.  
And we got a group of kids to stick around and they helped us recruit this
group of kids.  
As far as a timeline, you know, I didn't really have one. I mean, you can't --
I don't think, you know, right now here we are the second time going into the
NCAA tournament. I think some of the people at South Dakota think this may be
a yearly occurrence. This is a really difficult thing to do. It just is,
playing at this level and being here.  
So we feel very blessed, very fortunate that we've gotten here twice. So we
don't assume that we'll be back here. We know that we're going to have to do
the hard work.  
So I don't know what the time -- I didn't really have a timeline. I've just
been really proud of these kids and how they've handled this.  
  
Q. Coach, Michigan as a team, they don't turn the ball over much. As you've
been scouting them, have you noticed a lot of similarities between their style
of play and yours?  
COACH NAGY: In terms of their offense, we're different, because they have more
reads; we're just more emotion.  
When you look at how much they depend on their point guard, as we do, and how
much he has the ball in his hands as Nate does, they don't turnover a lot, we
don't turnover a lot. They don't foul, we don't foul. There are a lot of
similarities.  
So I think it will be interesting. It's going to be important for us not to
turn the ball over because they're tremendous in transition. We have to take
care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked on the similarities. Do you envision trying to run with
them, or does that make defense more important? Nate and Burke, do you think
they'll end up going one and one or probably guard them with somebody else?  
COACH NAGY: Well, we'll put Nate on Trey. I don't know what they'll do. I
can't answer for that.  
And I've said this before, Nate is a tremendous defender, but we've relied on
him so much to play 40 minutes and to handle a basketball that I think
sometimes people don't get to see how good a defender he is.  
In terms of the other question, are we going to try to run with them, we're
going to play the way that we play.  
Now, that means that in transition we're going to try to get good shots. We
need to push the basketball. I don't want to spend every one of our offensive
possessions playing them five on five. We need to get the ball and go when we
can. I mean, we've always done that and I know that's what they're going to do
do.  
The most important thing for us is transition defense, and it's hard against
them. You can talk about transition defense all you want and then you see the
kind of speed. What makes them dangerous is not just Trey Burke that can
handle the ball. Robinson can get the ball off the glass and go. Hardaway
Junior can get the ball off the glass and go. Stauskus can do it.  
They have a lot of guys that can handle the ball on the break, and I think
that's what makes them so dangerous.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got a lot of good players, but I think Nate has become
somewhat symbolic in the tournament run. How much of a turning point was that
to convince him that South Dakota was the place for him to be?  
COACH NAGY: Well, I mean, he's a huge reason why our program was able to get
turned around. I mean, we have certainly surrounded him with very good
players, and I think he would be the first to tell you that that has a lot to
do with his success, is that we can put good shooters around him, open up the
floor, let him do what he does.  
When we tried to sign him early, in the early period in his senior year, he
wanted to wait because we were still not a great basketball team. We hadn't
proven that we could make that transition. And I don't blame him for waiting
and for wanting to see more from us. I think that we showed enough in that
year that we're moving the right direction that he wanted to come here.  
I think the other thing about recruiting him is we wanted him to be a point
guard at South Dakota State. That's all we wanted him to do, where other
people were recruiting him to be a combo, to play the two, play the one. We
said, no, we want you to be our point guard, we want you to handle the
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you learn from last year's tournament experience and how
has that impacted the way you've prepared for this game?  
COACH NAGY: You know, we prepare for every game the same way.  
I just think last year, personally, was emotionally overwhelming because of
what we had been through. I mean, even though I had been with the University
of Illinois, we went to the Final Four as a graduate assistant. I didn't have
to deal with all this. I'm just behind the scenes and do what I do.  
As a head coach, you have to deal with all this, the media attention, the
radio interviews. So I think emotionally it was overwhelming for me, all of
the attention was overwhelming, and it's less of that this year. Like I
haven't had the emotions that I had this year. I've been much more calm, and I
think that the players have seen that too.  
  
Q. Scott, given the amount of recognition nationally Nate's got, can you
talk a little bit about his ability to handle this moment since there's going
to be so much attention focused on him both on the court and people watching
in the stands?  
COACH NAGY: He's used to it at this point, and I think what Tony said, you
know, it has been an amazing thing to watch him. It would be very easy I think
on some teams for players to be jealous of the attention he's gotten and so
many people thinking that he's just the only reason we got here and talk like
that. I think, again, Nate would be the first to say that's not the case.  
But the media attention, you know, I just listen to him even answer these
questions. Even as a coach I'm like, I want you to be more detailed. He just
-- he's a little uncomfortable with it and he's a quiet guy. And the players
know that. The players can laugh about it because they know that he doesn't --
you know, it's just not really what he wants. All he wants is to play
basketball. He's handled the pressure incredibly, you know, at every turn.  
And I don't expect it will be any different tomorrow when he gets on the floor
and he gets that ball in his hands, because he's spent so much time playing
basketball, it just comes natural to him. And he is in the biggest moments --
in the four years that I've coached the biggest moments is when he shows up,
and I don't expect any different tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking of Nate's demeanor, he's very calm. Are there times when
you'd prefer that you'd want him to show more emotion?  
COACH NAGY: Yeah, I would say sometimes, yes, I wish he was more verbal in his
leadership, but we've gotten used to it too and we've adjusted and we've found
other ways to do things.  
He does show some emotion on occasion, but I think it serves him well. The
fact that he's low key I think serves him very well, and there's no perfect
player, perfect personality.  
I would love for him to show some more emotion sometimes, but I tell you when
he does, then we know, because he is so low key. But when we do see the
emotion from him, our kids really respond to it.  
  
Q. Your team in its second conference championship game, so much more
relaxed and loose. Have you gotten some examples of that since you've gotten
here or during the travel where you feel like that trend is continuing?  
COACH NAGY: You know, I don't know Terry. I guess I don't want to make
something up.  
The only difference traveling here was we get to take the bus and jump right
on the plane and get off a plane and jump on a bus verses sitting in the
airports and traveling like we do commercially.  
But other than that, you know, I haven't seen really any difference in our
team in terms of how we're handling this versus last year or versus any other
game that we've played this year.  
  
Q. Coach, being from a one-bid conference, do you feel anymore pressure to
carry the flag for the conference?  
COACH NAGY: No, I mean there's enough pressure not to be adding things to it
and trying to figure those things out.  
I don't think -- again, these aren't even things I even look at, but I don't
think our league has ever won a game in an NCAA tournament. I could be wrong
in terms of the summit league. I'm not talking about the mid-con, but in terms
of as it's being Summit league I don't think we've won one. It would be nice
to do that, but I mean that's certainly not going to be the driving force as
to why we want to play well.  
We all know that any of our teams that get here it would be great for the
league.  
  
Q. Coach, given that you guys are facing Michigan here in Auburn Hills, what
kind of support do you expect to get from the Michigan State folks and the
crowd?  
COACH NAGY: You know, that's what I was saying, I hope they bought up a lot of
the all-session tickets. We went to PF Chang's last night and we had a lot of
people that told us they were rooting for us. I expect that any Michigan State
fan is going to be rooting for us, I don't think there's any question about
that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. How does it feel being different, being a five seed as compared to last
year?  
TROY DANIELS: It still feels the same. You know, it's a 5th seed or 11th seed,
it really doesn't even matter. You know, I mean, maybe to you guys it does,
but we want to just stay focused on, you know, playing the game, winning that
game that we play tomorrow.  
  
Q. If you could talk about Coach Smart's reaction to playing his best
friend. Have you seen any evidence of it during practice the last couple
days?  
DARIUS THEUS: He's excited, you know. Best friends or not, you know, he want
to win. We played Akron twice before, so it's the same mindset.  
At the end of the day, they'll still be best friends. So you know, he's
excited about it just like we are, and we just want to come out and get the
win for him.  
JUVONTE REDDIC: Pretty much what he said. You know, we know they best friends,
but it doesn't matter who we playing, what type of relationship they have
outside of the court. When we on the court, it's mono e mono, you know, either
way, both are going to try to win.  
Like I say after the game, they're still going to be best friends, but at the
end of the day we want to get the W.  
TROY DANIELS: I think they -- those two summed it up, you know, pretty good.  
  
Q. A lot of focus has been put on the pressure that you guys might apply to
their back court, but flip it a little bit and talk about what you got to do
to deal with their size?  
TROY DANIELS: We have to be ready, you know, for Zeke Marshall. He's a big
guy, inside and we just have to be physical.  
And Coach Smart and the coaching staff of VCU is going to have us ready for
that. As long as we stick to the game plan then we'll go from there.  
JUVONTE REDDIC: They are a lot bigger than us. You know, we play a lot of
teams that had an advantage with size, but you know, we have our advantages
to.  
It really comes down to who wants it more. So, you know, size really doesn't
matter.  
DARIUS THEUS: I mean, like they said, they may have a little size advantage on
the inside, but, you know, we got confidence in our bigs to step up to the
plate and take on the challenge.  
We're going to use our advantages also. So you know we just excited for our
challenge.  
  
Q. Darius, what did the run to the championship game do for your program in
terms of confidence and also raising the bar about what is a successful run in
the NCAA tournament?  
DARIUS THEUS: You said a conference tournament?  
  
Q. I'm sorry, in the NCAA tournament. Making the run you guys did, what did
that do for your program's confidence in the knack tournament, the long run
you guys made that kind of put you guys on the map?  
DARIUS THEUS: It gave us a lot of confidence just to show that anything is
possible. During this time of year, during March Madness, you just got to come
out and play.  
I just thank VCU as a program, it just shows what type of players Coach Smart
is recruiting and how much heart that we have and we want to come out and
prove ourselves any given like just like any other program?  
  
Q. I just wondered if you guys are watching film or whatever you want to
call it these days, do you almost feel like you're watching yourselves?  
DARIUS THEUS: They have different sets, a little bit different sets than we
run, but I guess it goes back to Coach Smart, their coach being best friends,
so it may look a little similar.  
If it looks similar, then we just got to find something in ourselves to make
sure we stand out tomorrow.  
  
Q. So you guys have some confidence from getting into the Final Four a
couple years ago. What about the other side?  
DARIUS THEUS: They got LeBron James; we got Spike Lee (Laughter). No, I'm
messing.  
That's fine, you know, LeBron ain't on the court with them. So it's fine.  
We got Coach Smart and, you know, we got a lot of faith in him. And he always
has us prepared, always has a plan and a process for us. So you know, we're
not too worried about that  
  
Q. Those of you who played against Akron in the past, what do you
remember?  
DARIUS THEUS: They're very physical. You know, you can't look at the film and
think they're not a physical team. They're very physical. They try to run you
off your cuts and things like that.  
Like y'all said, they're very big in the inside, try to get the ball to Zeke
Marshall, and he's a very good player.  
Like I said, they're very physical and don't let the film fool you and think
that they're not. So we just got to be aggressive and try to blow up their
sets.  
  
Q. How surprised were you when Coach Smart decided to stay and what makes
him a special coach?  
TROY DANIELS: I was very excited, you know, because I came in under him. You
know, I didn't want to see him leave, regardless of whatever happened. So it
was a great feeling. Just wanted to go hard for him in the gym and off season
and for myself.  
What makes him a great coach is he's very down to earth. He's like a father
figure, you know, to a lot of us.  
He's very just fun to be around. He jokes around with us and stuff. So that's
what you need in a coach.  
  
Q. Were you surprised that he's staying?  
DARIUS THEUS: Not at all. We kind of figured he would stay with us. And I mean
that just shows his loyalty to the program and to his players.  
You know, like Troy said, just to touch on it more, he is like a father figure
to most of us, maybe all of us, and he does spend time with us off the court.
I think that's just what make him so special, not just as a coach, but as a
person.  
  
Q. Just talk about how you guys are a little bit of an opposite team with
their guard losing Abreu. How do you attack that as a weakness when, you know,
you don't have their -- whatever your star point guard and you guys have
guards to spare?  
DARIUS THEUS: We just got to use that to our advantage. They're still college
basketball players, so still can't take them lightly at all.  
But we just want to press, then they can be to our advantage. We can heat them
up a little bit, pressure the ball, you know, deny the wings.  
If we do that, that could be to our advantage. But like I said, he is a
college basketball player so we got to be disciplined and smart on the things
that we're doing out there in the court.  
  
Q. I was watching the President make his picks and he knew who Coach Smart
was. Do you ever feel like he's almost more than a basketball coach?  
JUVONTE REDDIC: Not really. You know, we see Coach Smart the same way we've
always seen him. He might be more of a celebrity now though because of the
success he's had in the past. We don't pay too much to all that attention he
be getting. He's still Coach Smart to us.  
MODERATOR: Thank you student-athletes. Coach, could you make an opening
statement and then we'll open with questions.  
COACH SMART: Sure. We're excited to be here in Detroit, or Auburn Hills, and
looking forward to the game tomorrow night against Akron.  
As most of you know, we certainly have some history with Akron, and Keith and
I have a lot of history. I've got a ton of respect for their program, their
players, the coaching staff, and particularly Keith.  
He's come a long way from when certain people thought he was a one-star coach,
and now he's a five-star coach. But I'm just really happy for him and his
program and the progress that they've made and the position they've put
themself in.  
But now we play him, and we cannot both advance. It's impossible. So certainly
at VCU, we're going to do everything we can to put ourself in a position to
advance.  
  
Q. Last time you guys played, you said you didn't want to play each other
again. Are you just putting your friendship on hold? Were you a little worried
when you saw this matchup of what this would do to your relationship?  
COACH SMART: Not at all. I mean, Keith's a competitor. I'm a pretty
competitive guy. So we both want to win real bad, but we were just together
about an hour ago and this head coaches meeting that we have and joking
around.  
After the game whoever doesn't win will probably be pretty upset for a while,
but, you know, that kind of fades away too.  
Certainly the friendship will not be affected in any way.  
You know, these things keep kind of creeping up and happening. We didn't
choose to play each other in the Bracket Buster, and we did, and then when you
do that, you play a return game.  
I tried to get out of the return game, but actually Terry, Keith's assistant,
was having no part of it.  
And then obviously the NCAA selection committee chose to put us against each
other tomorrow night. But as my college coach used to tell me, it's too late
to cancel.  
  
Q. Did you see the picture that Keith's wife tweeted of him wearing the VCU
shirt?  
COACH SMART: She sent that to me actually a week or two ago, so I had the
picture.  
My wife wanted to put up a picture of me wearing a Fear the Roos shirt, which
we still -- we have that shirt from when I was there. And I said no way. I'm
not wearing that. Maybe after the tournament.  
Keith's always been extremely supportive. We really bounce a lot of ideas off
one another throughout the season and the offseason. I think our team, you can
see certain things from his philosophy in our team, and maybe you can see some
things, you know, that he and I have discussed in how their team plays.  
But tomorrow night will be decided by the players, and that's how it should
be.  
  
Q. St. Mary's is trying to do what you guys did two years ago. If you were
going to give Randy Bennett some advice on how to win five games to get to the
Final Four, what would it be?  
COACH SMART: Well, I thought they did a great job last night. They're off to a
really good start. They played better last night than we did in our first game
in Dayton two years ago.  
You know, the biggest thing that we emphasize with our team is just to play
aggressive, confident, loose basketball in that year.  
If you remember, we were one of the last teams picked in the NCAA tournament.
A lot of people didn't think that we belonged, so we tried to use that as
motivation.  
I don't think Coach Bennett's team has been as aligned as we were. So I don't
know if that's as big of a deal in terms of motivation, but they have a
terrific basketball team and I think they can beat anyone. They just have to
go out and play their best and play with great confidence.  
Really, at this point, they have an advantage, because they have something
that very few teams in this tournament have at this point, which is a win
under their belt. And I think that could go a long way for them.  
  
Q. I'm using Keith's English here, so bear with me. He said a lot of the
pundits are mis-analyzing the game.  
COACH SMART: Is he talking about you Al? (Laughter).  
  
Q. He might be. I think he was talking about the tenor of the national media
and how they're looking at and viewing the game. Do you share that opinion?  
COACH SMART: Well, I think if what he's referring to is that people are
talking about he and I, then I think I agree; it's about the players.  
But to be honest with you, I don't have -- I don't have a great feel for what
the national media's saying about this game because I just -- I don't follow
that stuff right now. I'm pretty focused on what we're doing.  
In terms of style of play, you know, Akron's pressed a pretty good amount this
year. So they can press as well.  
You know how we play. We try to get up and down. We try to wreak havoc, which
is a term that we use. But I think it comes down to both teams executing on
the defensive and offensive ends of the floor.  
Style of play wise, we'd like for it to be fast. You'd have to ask Keith how
he wants it to be.  
  
Q. What did the run you guys made a couple years ago do to change
expectations or hopes of your program where just getting in isn't enough and
now you're a 5 seed and expected to win?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I think there's probably enhanced expectations certainly
around our program. We've always had extremely high expectations on the inside
of our program. We expect to win. Any time we take the floor, we want to win.  
Certainly the other team's going to feel the same way. But there's more
visibility of VCU now. People know how we play. People know what we do, and I
think with that comes some expectations that, hey, you should advance, you
should go deep into the tournament, particularly because we've done it before.
But I think the biggest thing you learn at this time of year, if you've been
here before, is should doesn't get it done for you; you got to go make it
happen.  
  
Q. They're obviously taller than you, generally speaking. Is that a big
deal?  
COACH SMART: Yeah. Yes, most teams we've played have been taller than us. Is
it a big deal? We'll see. I mean, it's an advantage that Akron has.  
I mean, we'd love to have a bunch of 7-footers across the front line that can
run and trap and jump and play the way we want to play, but so would Kentucky
and -- or Kentucky's getting all of them, but so do big boys.  
So I think in recruiting you just have to decide where your emphasis is going
to be, and you're going to at times have to give up certain things, maybe a
little bit of size, maybe a little bit of strength.  
A friend of mine always says recruit them long and lean. We'd like for our
guys to just play with a level of aggressiveness and tenaciousness that
sometimes can neutralize size.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, what's the biggest thing that Keith taught you?  
COACH SMART: Well, he taught me a great deal.  
I tell you a quick story. When I went to Akron to work, I was an assistant
coach. Keith was not yet the head coach. He was an assistant coach there, and
I had never met him. So literally my first day on the job was the first time I
met Keith. And a few hours later at launch time, Keith came into my office. He
said come on, I want to introduce you to somebody. And he took me to a rec
center gym. This was, I think, late May. And LeBron James pulled up in a
Hummer and Keith asked me to help him work out LeBron James, which we
proceeded to do about two, three times a week for the next two months.  
Unbelievable experience, but it just says a lot about Keith. He didn't know me
from anyone. Why would he include me in that? But he's just so inclusive, and
I think that that is -- it's just an example of the fact that he treats people
so well.  
Keith always talks about -- because he's been fired, because he's been through
tough times, he really reaches out and tries to treat people so well that are
going through tough times and that there's no way that they can benefit him or
help him in any way. But he just -- that's something that I always admired
about Keith and that I try to emulate.  
  
Q. He's got LeBron his side, but you've got Obama on your side. What do you
think about that? And one little serious question that's just: Is there ever a
chance or a possibility that you guys know too much about each other?  
COACH SMART: That's a good question.  
Well, to answer your first question, I'm just glad LeBron's not playing in the
game (Laughter).  
It's okay with me that LeBron's rooting for Keith. That's no problem, just as
long as he doesn't suit up for the Zips.  
If he'd have gone to college, you know, he always says Ohio State, but there
might have been a good chance if Keith would have been the coach at the time
that he might have gone to Akron.  
In terms of President Obama, that was nice of him. Any time he can mention VCU
or anything about our program, we'll take it. I think a lot of people know I'm
a big fan of his.  
In terms of getting in the way, that's the last thing you want to do as a
coach. To be honest with you, our style of play, it does take a level of
control out of your hands as a coach because you can't script every single
pass and every single possession. A lot of it's going to happen fast and a lot
of it's going to be determined by the guys on the floor. But that's how we
like it. That's how we practice, and hopefully it takes a level of control out
of the other coach's hands, too.  
It's nothing really that I'm going to do in a game based on my relationship
with Keith that's going to get in our guys' way. I mean, the last thing I want
to do is affect them and keep them from going out and playing  
I think this game's going to be decided by the players, and that's how it
should be.  
The guys that go out there and make plays and, you know, play defense the
right way, play with a level of aggressiveness, that team's going to win.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on your decision to stay and how much of a comfort zone
you've gotten in because of that decision? Back then did you consult Keith at
all or have him hear you out?  
COACH SMART: I consult Keith on pretty much everything. He and I talk quite a
bit.  
You know, anything in basketball and then a lot of things outside of
basketball we talk about.  
In terms of a comfort zone, I actually don't like a comfort zone. I want to
continue to be challenged and stretched. And the good thing is at VCU, I have
that. So, you know, it's not like we've gotten to the point with our coaching
staff where there's a status quo or we're satisfied with where things -- we
want to keep moving forward.  
I stayed at VCU first and foremost because of our players. I love our guys and
I love coaching them and working with them. I really couldn't see, especially
after the year we went to the Final Four, going in the locker room literally a
few days later and saying hey, guys, thanks, but I'm out of here. That just
didn't make much sense. And I don't hold anything against coaches that do go
to other schools. You know, they got to do what's best for them and their
families. You know, and everyone has to make the right decision for their
family in that moment, but for me, VCU has provided some terrific
opportunities.  
There's two reasons I coach. I love helping the guys move forward and I love
winning, and winning especially this time of year. I think at VCU we have a
really good opportunity as coaches to do both of those things.  
  
Q. You made that video to encourage them after the Abreu thing. Keith
wondered if you regretted that. Why did you want to participate?  
COACH SMART: Well, because Keith told me to (Laughter). You got to understand,
when you have worked for someone in this business, particularly for Keith, it
doesn't matter how long you're a head coach, you're always his assistant, too.
So he called and he said, you know, Romeo had sent a message and some of the
other people connected to the program in the past had sent a message. So he
asked me to record something and send it to him, and I did literally 15
minutes later. I do what I'm told.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH SMART: Yeah, just because I love the guy.  
I tell you what, in coaching, it's a challenging profession, and it's really
something that you never perfect. And I don't care how many hundreds of games
guys win, you're always looking for something new to get your players'
attention, to put yourself in the best position to win the next game or to
move forward for a conference tournament.  
You know, Keith told me after they lost Alex, he said we have to reinvent
ourselves. And I don't think there's a better coach in the country, you know,
to work with this team in such a short span of time like that to take that on.
And they did a terrific job of putting themself in position to win the NCAA
tournament and allowing themselves to be here today.  
So I did the video because he asked for it and I was happy to help.  
  
Q. Going back to Selection Sunday, Coach. I talked to Keith. He said when
you guys came up with the 5 seed, he had a strange premonition that they were
going to come up next. Did you have that same feeling?  
COACH SMART: Not at all. I had no idea. I didn't think about it at all.  
I saw us with a 5 seed and I was happy because I thought we'd get a 5 or a 6.  
You know, the seed doesn't matter so much. It's more the matchup. But I think
for our program to receive a 5 seed, which I believe's a second best seed VCU
has ever had says a lot about our players and the season that we've had.  
But I wasn't expecting Akron. When Akron came up, I was sitting right next to
my wife, and it was just kind of a strange feeling, but that feeling came and
within the and then we started our preparation.  
  
Q. That day with LeBron and your first day, were you awe struck?  
COACH SMART: A little bit.  
  
Q. Or were you more touched by him inviting you?  
COACH SMART: Hit me more later. I mean, because I didn't know what we were
doing.  
Keith's the kind of guy that he's very spur of the moment, and so he said,
come on, I want to introduce you to someone. So we drove to some rec center in
Akron, and we're standing on the court. And a Hummer pulls up.  
And then LeBron walks in the gym and there's nobody in there because it was
the middle of the day.  
COACH SMART: I didn't say that much that day. I mean I was a heck of a
rebounder, a passer (Laughter).  
That's pretty much how those work outs were for those couple of months. Keith
has a great way of telling people the truth, and you're talking about a guy
that was about to be the No. 1 pick in the draft and, you know, just signed
this huge deal with Nike and all the things that go along with that, but there
he was with Keith and me helping Keith, there he was doing defensive slides,
you know, in the Rhodes Arena with nobody there. That says something about
LeBron, too.  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: Coach Dambrot, opening statement?  
COACH DAMBROT: We go way back. I think first and foremost, we come from the
same DNA, the same genetics, the same mother, really, as VCU.  
So the foundation in the two programs is exactly the same. We're kind of like
the ugly big brother. You know, like I'm Danny Devito and he's Arnold
Schwarzenegger and we're kind like the Chevette and he's a Ferrari, but that's
my guy. I love Shaka like a brother and they've done a lot of great things but
we have the same attributes that make us a great team, too.  
We played them last year to a one-point overtime loss where they beat us at
the buzzer, so we definitely feel like we belong.  
  
Q. Questions for the student-athletes.  
I don't know if I'm asking you to give up any secrets here, but is there
anything you can say about what Coach Tressel said to you yesterday?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: I mean, he basically just gave us some encouragement for coming
to the tournament, basically. You know, some words of wisdom. That's the best
I can describe it.  
DEMETRIUS TREADWELL: Pretty much the same thing Zeke said.  
BRIAN WALSH: You know, what they said. Just keep our minds focused on the task
at hand.  
  
Q. Zeke, there's so much focus on the coaches because of their relationship.
Your thoughts on that?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: I mean, yeah, we -- you know, they go way back. They have just,
as you said, the same DNA that we have. We are coming in this game just as we
came in any other game in the regular season, in our postseason. We're going
to come in ready to win.  
  
Q. Can you guys go back to last year's game, or are the teams so different
from that game that it's almost like the game didn't happen?  
DEMETRIUS TREADWELL: Well, the game last year, I felt like our team wasn't as
good as it is this year, and I feel like they might have been a better team
last year.  
This year we just go out there and play. Last year doesn't matter. We just
going to win this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brian, I'm just wondering how you guys have improved over the past week
as far as the pressure you're going to face tomorrow?  
BRIAN WALSH: Yeah, absolutely. You know, Coach D has given us a great game
plan coming into the game. We know they're going to be full court pressing us
and being the pressure. And Carmelo Betancourt and Nick Harney have been doing
a great job the past -- not only the past week but the past ten days, ever
since the incident.  
They've been doing a great job. We have all the confidence in the world in
them and I think we're going to get the job done tomorrow.  
  
Q. Zeke, were you the only player on the team that's actually been in an
NCAA tournament game before. Have you told them or passed on anything about
what it's going to be like?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: I have. I've basically been telling them that this is going to
be all since the media pressure, outside, external forces that there is but
we're going to -- all we need to do is go out there and play the game like
we've been doing all year and we've got nothing to worry about.  
  
Q. Your coach is regarded as the mentor in this matchup. Can you talk about
what makes your coach good in your opinion?  
ZEKE MARSHALL: Our coach is good just because he knows how to unlock the
potential out of his players and he's a very winningness coach. His way has
proven the win. I mean, he has one of the world's winningness percentages in
our league right now.  
So he knows how to unlock the potential. He knows how to make sure you give
out your all and push to your max. And that's what makes him a great coach
because he knows how to do that without pushing too far.  
  
Q. Third of time in the tournament, Coach. Have you approached this any
differently than the first two? Anything you've learned from those first two
NCAA tournament bids and games?  
MODERATOR: Thanks guys. I'm going to let you go. Good luck tomorrow.  
We'll do the same process for Coach Dambrot now.  
Joe, you can have the first question if you'd like.  
  
Q. Third time in the tournament, Coach. Any changes as far as what you
learned those first two matchups with Gonzaga and Notre Dame compared to how
you've approached this one?  
COACH DAMBROT: No, I don't think so, Joe.  
I think the players play the game. The coaches get the players ready to play
the game and ultimately, you know, the players make the plays that either win
or lose the game really.  
So we've done what we've done all year. We've tried to make it as similar to
the regular season as we can. That's why it was great that we bust because we
probably bussed more than anybody in the world. So we're keeping it just like
we did in the regular season.  
  
Q. Your friendship with Coach Smart well documented but in regards to the
preparation for the game, can it help you? Can it hurt you?  
COACH DAMBROT: It's equal. I mean, we revamped our whole defensive call scheme
and it's all just like theirs. So like we know their calls.  
Half our offensive sets are his. We talk every day as to how to handle
different situations.  
Like I said, I mean, that's my best friend in coaching, so we bounce a lot of
ideas off each other.  
So does it help or hurt? I mean, we're not going to surprise them with
anything, and he's not going to surprise us with anything. It's going to be a
simplification, which really the game's about any way. It's just like blocking
and tackling, right? It's the same thing.  
  
Q. Shaka said his wife tried to talk him into wearing Fear the Roos shirt
and he wouldn't do it. Did your wife have to cajole you to put that VCU one
on?  
COACH DAMBROT: Not really.  
I didn't anticipate that we'd be playing, but I root for the Rams when we're
not playing, and they're my favorite college basketball team other than the
Akron Zips. So it wasn't hard to put the shirt on. I just didn't anticipate
that we would be playing each other in the NCAA tournament, but I guess I was
wrong.  
  
Q. What was your initial reaction when you saw the bracket come out and you
saw VCU's name first and then your team's name come up?  
COACH DAMBROT: Well, I thought we were going to be 12, maybe a high 11, and
when I saw them at 5, the way my year's gone, you know, with the peaks,
valleys, ups, downs, complete whirlwind, I just knew. You know how you just
know sometimes? So the gut feeling came and I knew Akron Zips-VCU Rams.  
That's the way it goes. I think everybody's right. It's not really a game
about Shaka and me; it's about the guys. And it makes for a good storyline,
but ultimately the guys got to play, and there's a lot of respect amongst
everybody. It's almost like the players are playing their step-brothers
because we here, we talk a lot about VCU in our program and I'm sure they do
about us.  
  
Q. You talk about how this team has regrouped without Alex and how key it
will be for whoever's playing point guard or has the ball to have some level
of exposure against the havoc that VCU will want to put?  
COACH DAMBROT: Well, I kind of -- I think it's a little bit oversimplified
that it's just about the pressure.  
I think it's more about us guarding them. I think if we can guard them and
play great defense, then havoc becomes less havoc, and I think if you can keep
them out of making baskets, then all of a sudden it becomes more our kind of a
game.  
We do have the tremendous shot blocker at the rim. So the one-on-one defense,
the gap defense becomes very, very important for us. Because if we can get it
into more of a half court game, we have some good advantages. We're big and
strong. You know, we've got Marshall who's now a very good offensive player.
We've got the beast next to him, Demetrius Treadwell. So we have some
advantages, but if we can't get it solid down to that point and guard them,
then they have some advantages.  
So I think from that perspective, you know, it's going to come down to how
well we guard them. I think the teams that have been able to guard them have
kept the score down, which allows them to have a chance to win.  
If the game gets up into the 70s, the mid to high 70s, we have no chance.  
  
Q. If you make this a half court game, how much do you like your chances
against VCU?  
COACH DAMBROT: We've got a good chance. We're better than what people think.  
Relatively speaking, it's the best team I've ever had other than when I had
LeBron in high school (Laughter).  
  
Q. Do you get a sense that Zeke has geared up to be on a national stage?  
COACH DAMBROT: Zeke has been way more consistent. If you look at the numbers
this year, he's been consistently good. Whereas last season, the year before,
he was -- he showed signs of brilliance, but could never consistently put it
back to back to back. I think he's gone eight or nine games in a row in double
figures. I think he's averaged last nine games over four blocks a game and
he's rebounding at a high level. So I think his maturity as a man has really
made him a better basketball player and has made him more consistent as a
player.  
  
Q. Coach Shaka told us an anecdote, he said you wanted to introduce him to
somebody and it was LeBron James. What do you remember about that day?  
COACH DAMBROT: I remember it was in the summer. He came in and LeBron had just
been drafted and I worked him out before he went to the pro camps. So I said,
come on, let's go, I got a couple errands to run. I want you to come with me.
So we went over to Springside Racket Club and worked LeBron out.  
I think it was a good first day of work for him. He got to meet one of the
best players of all time, and that's kind of how our relationship grew. We
roomed together every day on the road, even when I was the head coach.  
So like I said, man, that guy's my brother. I love Shaka, but I'm going to try
and kick his ass tomorrow (Laughter). Excuse my language.  
  
Q. Since you've already played him twice, is it easier to have your blinders
on for this game and focus on the task at hand as opposed to who's on the
opposite sideline?  
A.Listen, it's both of our obligations to make sure that we have our blinders
on. Once we get between the lines, listen, we're both two of the most
competitive guys you've ever met.  
So there isn't going to be any, you know, gloves out there. When the game's
over, we'll go back to being brothers.  
At least one of us moves on tomorrow, right? That's a good thing.  
  
Q. Shaka said when you called to do that video thing, there was no -- I sent
it like 15 minutes later. He said he still feels like an assistant when you
call. Have you noticed that?  
COACH DAMBROT: Well, let me say two things.  
One, anybody that thinks I'm the mentor to Shaka Smart is out of their minds.  
It's a co-mentorship. Old people can learn from young people, and that guy's
one of the smartest guys I've ever been around with an unbelievable work
ethic, passion, compassion, and he's taught me as much or more than I've
taught him, believe me.  
So I don't view myself as his mentor or he's my protege. I think I'm his
protege in some regards. I'm just older. He's one of the bright stars of
college basketball.  
I remember this story: I was driving home from Chicago with my son who was
playing soccer in Chicago, and they beat Kansas in the NCAA tournament. I
think that was what, an Elite 8 game? I don't really remember, but I started
to tear up and my son says what's wrong with you, Dad? I said, well, that's
our family. You know, so that's how I feel about Shaka.  
But with that being said, you know, we're going to give it everything we have
tomorrow, and that's what we have to do.  
  
Q. You know your team better than anybody on the eve of this game. Can you
read them right now?  
COACH DAMBROT: I feel the same way I did going into the MAC tournament.
Listen, I know this absolutely 100 percent, that we're going to compete like
there's no tomorrow. We're going to play hard and we're really good
defensively. If we do a good job definitely, we may kick it around, slap it
around, you know, throw it to the wrong team a few times, but our message to
our guys is very simple.  
We have to play for one another, right? We have to play for one another. And
we have to recover quickly.  
So that's a key against VCU is you have to recover quickly. You got to get on
to the next play because they prey on people that dwell on the last play,
because the last play then becomes the next play and then that last play
becomes the next play and pretty soon they got a 12- or 14-point burst and
spurt on you. So you have to recover quickly. You can't worry about the last
mistake. You got to get on to the next one.  
And you got to play for one another in order to do that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Dambrot.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll start the press conference with Coach Drew making an opening
statement.  
COACH DREW: You know, we're really excited to be here. We're extremely excited
that we're only four hours from home so our fans can drive and see the game.  
Historically we've always been sent out west or far away where our fans can't
come. So it will be refreshing to hopefully have some yellow in the stands
tomorrow.  
Real excited for our seniors. We have three here. We have three others on our
team. And you know this was their big goal is they wanted to make the NCAA
tournament. We had a tough loss last year against Detroit in our conference
finals and I think they had a chip on their shoulder all year to get back to
that point and have the opportunity to come to the NCAA tournament.  
So they know this is their first and only NCAA tournament and I think we're
all excited to get to the game tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Coach and for each of the players, can you talk about having so many
seniors, how much of a benefit it was this season in different situations and
how much you hope it can help you possibly pull off an upset here tomorrow?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: Having so many experienced players has really come out in
pivotal points throughout the season and you know there's been times where
we've been playing bad and we've been down double digits maybe in the second
half. Having that experienced group, that core group of guys, you know,
sticking together, we kind of work through situations that maybe in years past
we would have folded.  
You know, it's been a remarkable year being able to play with your closest
friends and be able to have this four-year journey with some fantastic guys.  
That bond is really shared on the basketball court.  
  
Q. For any of you, you play games in Detroit. Does this help that it's a
city that you're used to?  
KEVIN VAN WIJK: I think it doesn't really matter. I think for me, you know,
it's just last year we were playing and I don't think we -- we have some bad
memories here and obviously some good ones.  
And I think having to play here, I think we do need to think about the past,
need to think about what's ahead of us, and we got important games. So we
don't need to worry about what we did before here. We just need to worry about
what we're going to do.  
ERIK BUGGS: Like Kevin said, I mean, location isn't that big of a deal. I
mean, it's great because it's close and, you know, easier for our fans to
travel but it's definitely a business trip. I mean, you enjoy a moment off the
court, and when you step on the court it's all about business.  
  
Q. For Kevin, just want to know what you think of Derrick Nix after watching
film of him?  
KEVIN VAN WIJK: Well, obviously he's a great player. He's a physical player.  
He's shown great basketball throughout the years that he's been playing. I
mean, he's going to -- played against some similar guys during the conference.
So I'm really looking forward to playing against him and it's going to be a
great match up.  
  
Q. I was wondering if a couple of the players could talk about the family
atmosphere at Valparaiso with it being father and son coaches?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: Yeah, having Brian Homer and Bryce be coaches over my four
years has been a huge blessing. You know, it really has been a big family
atmosphere all four years.  
You know, that's not just through the coaches, but through the players as
well. Both coaches did a great job recruiting not just good basketball
players, but good people.  
You know, us as a family, basketball players, you know, we get along so well
on and off the court. We're not just a team that turns up to practice. We hang
out outside. We have this real close bond and, you know, the four years I
spent year has really been a family.  
ERIK BUGGS: Like Ryan said, Coach Drew and Coach Homer, they really preach
family.  
It kind of trickles down into the players. I mean, it's been a great time
being here at Valpo, not just on the court but off the court.  
We're brothers, and I think that carries over into our play.  
KEVIN VAN WIJK: Well, I think me only being here for three years, I think
playing under both coaches, I think it's great to have two different views.
Even off the court we still see Coach Homer quite often and he always talks
with us.  
I think it's just the great atmosphere and great bond we have with both
coaches and being able to continue to talk with them, it's a blessing like
Ryan said.  
  
Q. Quick question for Ryan. Do you know Dellavedova or any of the St. Mary's
players all that well and are you going to get a chance to see them play at
all?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: I know all four of the guys at St. Mary's. I spent two years
with them back in Australia. The Australian Institute of Sports. So, you know,
I kept -- I watched the game last night and obviously was excited to see them
win.  
If all things go well, we might end up playing them in the next round, but we
don't look too forward ahead, but to have, you know, more Australians be
represented at good colleges over here, it really speaks volumes of how
basketball in Australia is going and how it's building.  
  
Q. Erik, us I was wondering if you looked at the match up of Keith Appling
very much?  
ERIK BUGGS: I mean, Keith Appling, he's a great player. He has a great feel
for the game. I watched him in film. He's very quick and he's a really
explosive scorer.  
I think he's one of the big keys for them.  
I mean, I think that match up will be pivotal Thursday. Ryan, this was the
goal.  
But have you guys been able to enjoy this?  
RYAN BROEKHOFF: Yeah, I think the closer the games come, you know, the more
I've seemed to enjoy it. It's kind of sunk in that we have kind of completed
one of our goals.  
Obviously we still have goals in mind that we set at the start of the year.  
It is a business trip in the end. We'll enjoy the experience, but once, you
know, you walk over those lines and the ball's thrown up, it's all about
business and we're out here to not just make up the numbers but to really give
it a good effort and give our best.  
Anything can happen in games like this.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, student-athletes.  
Coach Drew will now be available for questions.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm wondering what goes through your mind when you see the shot
played this time of year, other times of year and do you use that all in
recruiting with parents or kids?  
COACH DREW: I definitely get excited to see it was such a great moment. Such a
blessing for myself, our family, our program, our University, our community.  
And in recruiting, absolutely not. Do not use any recruiting. I think the last
thing that players want to here is a coach talk about himself or what he's
done. So that's usually never brought up.  
  
Q. Coach, what is the biggest surprise that you've gotten from watching
Michigan State on film that you didn't necessarily expect when you headed into
scouting them?  
COACH DREW: You know, I think they can beat you in so many different ways.
They can beat you on the perimeter, they can beat you inside. They can beat
you on defense, they can beat you on the boards. They can beat you in
transition.  
There's so many different factors. It's not really one or two that, you know,
hey, if we do this we have a great chance. I think it's a collective
\effort\every time across the board trying to keep alive those different
areas, you know, down and into a manageable margin or area.  
  
Q. When I mentioned to the players if you could address that, how special it
is to have your dad and your mom involved?  
COACH DREW: I think the family atmosphere has definitely helped our team this
year. Their best friends off the court. Sometimes the coaches joke maybe
they're too good of friends off the court.  
But they just enjoy being around each other. I think they have a lot in
common.  
Coming from different backgrounds but yet have really formed a great bond in
college.  
I think in a lot of close games or when you go through adversity, I think
their togetherness has really been an asset for us this year.  
On a personal level, you know, my dad has you know coached the Valpo for over
20 years and recruited some of these players. To have them be part of that
moment I thought was only fitting.  
  
Q. For your mom as well?  
COACH DREW: It's been a struggle for the last year and a half. So to have that
moment, you know, it was pretty special, especially on a court that was named
after my father, you know, Homer Drew Court for what he'd accomplished at
Valpo.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you're focused on Michigan State but have you had much
of a chance to see Nate Wolters shoot and can you talk a little bit about his
ability?  
COACH DREW: Nate's a tremendous player. Actually got to see him. They played
Baylor. My brother's the head coach of Baylor, played him last year in the
first round of the tournament. And sensational play. I followed some of the
stats this year and some of the numbers he's put up and just had an
extraordinary year.  
Great shooter but he's also -- I mean he's athletic. He can get to spots on
the floor, get in the lane and finish with floaters and he's very crafty.  
And with his size he uses, it as a big advantage to pass around guys or shoot
over guys.  
So he's an excellent player and I would suspect we see him in the NBA next
year.  
  
Q. I was wondering what makes Ryan such a unique scorer?  
COACH DREW: Ryan, he's kind of the ultimate team player, but yet he's so
talented he stands out as being a star.  
Him and many of those other players from Australia, they're very team
oriented. It's all about team, team concept.  
And Ryan's the same way. You know, if we need rebounding, he'll come up with
some rebounds. If we need scoring he'll come up with scoring.  
What I love about him most is he just loves to compete, he loves to win.  
As you can see he doesn't have the biggest frame. He's not a lot of -- doesn't
have a lot of pounds on him but he is our leading rebounder because he has a
desire to want to go get the ball.  
That's what's helped make him successful.  
  
Q. How do you think winning tomorrow would compare to winning as a player?  
COACH DREW: You know, winning as a player in the moment and you really don't
process, I don't think, as much on both ends of the spectrum. You're just so
focused on what you have to do. I think as a coach, you know, you have to be
ready for all types of scenarios in the games. You're constantly thinking of
different scenarios, how to react if this happens, if this happens, to be well
prepared and right now, you know, our main focus all week has just been
Michigan State and basically just that first possession, the first four
minutes and going forth.  
I think as a coach I'd be definitely more excited for the players and I'm more
excited for our fans.  
As a player, you know, more excited just for me and the team but as a coach I
think you're excited for everybody involved.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the challenge that Derrick Nix presents?  
COACH DREW: Nix has done an excellent job with his body getting in shape.  
He moves, you know, very well for his size, and I think you got to credit the
Michigan State coaches for their development.  
When players come into Michigan State and when they leave, you can see a huge
progress of their skill, of just their body, of the improvements that they
make.  
And we have played a couple players that have been, you know, 260 plus this
year. I think, you know, he's probably a little more skilled around the basket
and has a little quicker feet. So he'll definitely be a load. He'll definitely
be a challenge for us.  
  
Q. Bryce, I was wondering, has anyone like Adreian Payne guarded Broekhoff
this year?  
COACH DREW: Adreian's a sensational athlete.  
You know, he's extremely long, and what I've enjoyed watching on film
recently. The energy he plays with and the emotion that he brings to the game.  
And, you know, Ryan's kind of a unique player for us. He's kind of a perimeter
player, but he plays some of the floor for us and we've seen all types of
matches. We've seen the five man on him. We've seen the one man on him. So our
team has seen all types of different people and he's had all different types
guard him.  
So we'll have to wait and see how Michigan State matches up if they put
Dawson, if they put Payne, if they put a smaller guy, if they switch screens
on him or what they do. But Ryan's pretty used to -- he's seen about
everything in the last couple years here.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: Opening statement from Coach Bennett.  
COACH BENNETT: I don't have much. Just we're excited to be here and join the
rest of the field. Look forward to competing tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: We'll now hear from our student-athletes.  
  
Q. This is for Matthew. I know it would take wins from both teams, but
what's it like knowing that Broekhoff is here? Have you talked to him much
since the Olympic trials?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Just that every now and then, he's having a great season.
I know it will be cool to hopefully catch up with him. He had a nice buzzer
beater that we all saw the other week. So, yeah, happy he's having a great
year.  
  
Q. For any and all, how tired are you? How tough was the trip?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: No, we had a good trip up here. We're feeling pretty
good. We got our asphalts in, so I think we'll be pretty fresh ready to go
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach Pastner made a statement earlier from Memphis that you were a
college player -- you were an NBA player who plays college basketball. Any
comment to that?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: No I mean, I don't know about that, but, yeah, it's a
nice compliment.  
  
Q. Jordan, not only was your first start last night, it was also your first
NCAA tournament game. What was weighing on your mind more?  
JORDAN GIUSTI: Well, I don't really know. I didn't really -- I've been playing
with these guys all year. I'm comfortable on the court.  
Starting was just -- I don't know. It's new, but it wasn't really that big of
a change because I've started second halfs. I'm used to playing.  
As far as the tournament goes, I mean, it's just another game really for me.
I'm not really used to the whole tournament thing, but right now it's just
another game.  
  
Q. Obviously with the playing game, the travel and all that, are there
advantages to having that game and now coming into this game?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Yeah, I think, I mean, you get the raw start. Hopefully
we can get a good start tomorrow.  
I think that happened at our conference tournament in San Diego, played a game
earlier than us. They got the jump on us. So hopefully we can do that
tomorrow.  
JORDAN GIUSTI: Yeah, I think it should definitely help us. We're already kind
of used to the tournament right now. We got the jitters out, you know. So I
think it should help.  
STEPHEN HOLT: Definitely our win against Middle Tennessee was a confidence
booster. We're just going to use that to our advantage as best we can.  
Main thing is just being excited to compete and being ready to play tomorrow.  
BRAD WALDOW: Yeah, I feel like getting that win yesterday, it's, like Stephen
said, a great confidence booster and it will keep us rolling to tomorrow.  
MITCHELL YOUNG: Yeah I think the boys are feeling confident after our win in
Memphis. Maybe we'll experience some jitters and some nerves. Hopefully we can
use that to our advantage.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about Memphis?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Obviously athletic team, like to get up and down the
floor, play pretty physical.  
Seen a bit of them so far, but definitely be watching them a bit more tonight,
a bit more game film.  
STEPHEN HOLT: Just like any game, we have to take care of the ball, make key
stops definitely, and basically box out and rebound.  
We know it's just going to be a physical game, just like Middle Tennessee, you
know, in the tough games in a tournament like this, that's what it comes down
to, is consistency, getting stops and just playing hard and aggressive and
making plays.  
  
Q. Matthew, someone said that you're like the Tom Brady of guards, that you
take a lot of look at film. Have you had a chance to study Geron Johnson who
might be your matchup? Have you had that opportunity to really look at the
Memphis films yet?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Yeah, I've been having a bit of look at their game so
far. Be watching it a bit more tonight.  
  
Q. Do you look at a lot of film?  
MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA: Yeah. I try to watch as much game film as I can. Just,
yeah, pick up little things what we need to do or what could work against
other teams.  
MODERATOR: Thanks guys.  
Coach Bennett will be able to answer all questions now.  
  
Q. You're known for bringing a lot of Australian players in. Did you know
about Ryan Broekhoff when he was at AIS?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, we knew about Ryan.  
We liked -- we had taken Clint Steindl the year before. They're kind of the
same position. So we couldn't really take Ryan because of that, because they
want their guys to go in and play right away, Clint was same position.  
I would have liked him a lot, great kid. We can't take them all.  
  
Q. What concerns you most about this Memphis Tigers basketball team?  
COACH BENNETT: Their transition, their ability to turn you over, I think those
two things.  
A little bit like Middle Tennessee, but they're bigger, bigger version. A
little bigger, a little deeper.  
Yeah, they have really good guards.  
And I think that the thing that's hardest to scout on them is they can just
steal the ball. Their pressure definitely.  
They get steals and that's hard to guard. It starts with that. You have to
take care of the ball against their pressure, so to speak.  
  
Q. Is it an advantage or disadvantage for you all having to play last night
and now turn around playing again two days later?  
COACH BENNETT: It's whatever you make it. We're going to try and make it an
advantage.  
I do like this about it: We hadn't played in a week, and it would have been
ten days since we played in our conference tournament, because we played a
week ago Monday. Playing Tuesday shortened that up a little bit and I thought
we'd have good practices during the week. I thought we played well last night.
I think it helped from that standpoint.  
  
Q. I know that Page got hurt in the Gonzaga game. I know he didn't play last
night. What is his status and is it true that Giusti was a walk-on?  
COACH BENNETT: Jorden Page, he won't play tomorrow. We're not sure exactly
what the extent of his knee injury is. I doubt he will play this week.  
If we were fortunate to advance, then maybe. I don't know. I can't say that he
would.  
Giusti is a walk-on. He'll be on a scholarship next year, but he was a
recruiter walk-on. He was a guy that we liked him as a player and we thought
in time that he could work himself into being a guy that goes on scholarship,
which he has.  
He's tremendous in an area, he's a really good defender, and he's a really
good competitor. As he learns to score and get more comfortable, it is not
easy just getting thrown in there and you're supposed to be able to make
plays, but you know you're going to defer to the other four guys, and that's
tricky. You want to keep the defense honest, but you don't want to shoot too
much because you know that's not your role.  
So he's done a great job of managing that role, and that's hard to do. I mean,
sometimes we have some better scorers on our team, but they can't play that
role with the rest of our players as well as Giusti can. And then Giusti, it's
hard for me to take him off the court because of how good a defender he is.  
  
Q. Is it easier to have a guy like that on and lose your starting point
guard when really Dellavedova has the ball so much?  
COACH BENNETT: I don't know if it's ever easy, but Matt takes care of so many
things for us, and I'm going to find out how many things next year when we
don't have him anymore, but he's -- yeah, he calms everything down. Put it in
his hands and he's going to get everybody where they're supposed to be and
keep from turning it over while he's doing it.  
So it sound easy. It's hard to find a guy who can do that. It's hard to speed
Matt up. It's hard to get him out of sorts. He's very composed and he's seen
about everything. He's seen big athletes against him. He's seen the quick
ones. He's seen the trap. He's seen the show. He's seen the switch. He's seen
them all. His experience and his leadership and his basketball IQ are about as
high as you're going to get in college basketball.  
  
Q. On Sunday after the selection, you were talking about how your offense
might get better and Matthew suggested one reason would be that teams that
hadn't seen you as often as San Diego and Gonzaga had. Is it simply because
Middle Tennessee hadn't seen it or was it something else?  
COACH BENNETT: It's more than that.  
You want to simplify it, I'd say it's because we made some shots. Like Matt
hit shots and Holt hit shots and sometimes it just gets down to that. You have
to make some open threes, and we had some in those other games; didn't make
them, and Matt in particular.  
But last night we did, and so your offense looks better when you're hitting
shots.  
The other factor is it matters, and that's -- they really haven't seen us. In
particular, they haven't seen Matt. Yeah, I'm not sure film does him justice
all the time. You don't realize how big he is, how strong he is, and what's
going on in his head when he's playing.  
  
Q. Randy, what does it do for you to have such a consistent power team like
Gonzaga, facing them two, three times a year?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, we -- what it's done for us, it's elevated our teams to
the point where we won the league two out of the last three years.  
We didn't win it this year and Gonzaga had one of the best teams they've ever
had, probably their best.  
So iron sharpens iron, and it's made us do things better, sharper, whether it
be recruiting, executing, rebounding, leadership, whatever it may be, every
area of our program, because we're trying to win the league.  
This year we didn't, but we lost to a pretty dang good team. So that's where
it helps.  
It also helps like in a game against Memphis. People say have you seen
anything like this? Well Gonzaga's pretty talented. They're a pretty good
team. So it's not like we haven't seen a team this good; we have.  
I notice that when we play Creighton, because Creighton's perceived as a
really good team. And I think most people would have thought that they would
be better than we are, but they weren't, and they weren't on that day. And
they're a really good team. Doug's a great player and Greg McDermott does a
great job. They have a very, very good program and a very good team, but when
we played them, it didn't seem like that was a team that was better than
anything that we'd played in our league. So I think that's where it helps, is
we play against good talent, good personnel, a good team.  
BYU does the same thing for us.  
MODERATOR: Thank you Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

HILLS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUBURN+HILLS)

  

## March 20, 2013

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Trey Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22847)

### [Tim Hardaway, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21925)

### [Glenn Robinson, III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25143)

  
_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach John Beilein of Michigan.  
  
Q. Yeah Trey, Mark talk about the match up with Nate Wolters of South Dakota
State. Certainly a lot has been made of that in the national media?  
TREY BURKE: A lot has been made of it. I know that's something I'm trying not
to focus on as far as a one-on-one match up. I obviously know he's a really
good player. I think 30 percent of their offense runs through him. It's just
my job to try to slow him down and make things tough for him.  
  
Q. Let's talk about this first experience in the tournament for you and what
you're looking forward to the most?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Just coming into it, I've just been excited the whole week
and I thought that myself and the team did a great job preparing for it and
you know I've just heard a lot of things about the tournament. Like I said,
it's my first time so I'm just excited to get out there playing and get going.  
  
Q. For Tim, you guys have a lot of NBA legacies on your team. Is that a
coincidence or do you think there's something about guys who've been brought
up in basketball like that that appeals to the program?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: I don't think there's no coincidence. We were brought here
for a reason. Coach does a great job of recruiting. It just happened. We
weren't planning on doing this or it wasn't planned on happening. I mean it
was a blessing, you know, for all of us to be on the same team and we're
riding with it.  
  
Q. Talk about the 13 seed and the perils of potentially playing a team where
you're so highly ranked against them.  
GLENN ROBINSON III: You know, we just got to go out and just continue to
compete the way that we have been and practice the same way. You know and just
as long as we keep doing the same things, I'll be -- I think that we'll be all
right no matter who we play or what the seeds are, anything like that.  
  
Q. Last year you guys get in the tournament, you blink and it's gone. What
do you learn from last year that you can take forward, what did that
experience teach you?  
TREY BURKE: No room in the margin this late in the season. It's our jobs as
captains to let everybody know, specifically the freshman that tomorrow could
be our last game if we don't come out and execute the way we know we can. So
just come out with the amount of intensity that we're down from the beginning
of the game and I think that will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Tim, you guys have had some trouble lately with slow starts. Are you
concerned at all about that going into tomorrow?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: I'm not concerned with it at all. I know that our team is a
great team. You know, we have had those slow starts here and there, but we
know what we're all capable of doing and we just want to make sure that we go
out there and stick with our game plan and play Michigan basketball.  
  
Q. What have you all seen of South Dakota State on film besides Nate
Wolters? I mean, it seems like they play pretty similar style to you guys. Do
you see a lot of similarities?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Just watching film and just studying their action, you
know, there's a lot of ball screens involved with Nate, and they're big, pick
and pock big. And you know that 17-footer looks like it's money every time he
shoots it. So we just got to do the job of just contesting, just doing great
job on our defensive switches our defensive principles, whatever our coaches
want us to do.  
Just try to go out there and try to play our hardest.  
  
Q. You and Wolters were both at the Kevin Durant camp. Did you play on the
same team? Play against him? What did you learn from that?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Just his work ethic. He has incredible work ethic. He plays
very, very hard. Doesn't take any possessions off, and you can tell that he
loves the game of basketball. He really gets his teammates involved. That's
what he's out there doing right now is showing everybody. So it's not going to
be an easy task guarding him. It's going to be tough.  
We're just going to do our best to contain him as much as possible and just
try to go out and try to get a victory.  
  
Q. I think your fans were sweating out whether or not you were going to be
here playing in Auburn Hills. I see you smiling up there, Tim. What did it
mean when you guys found out that you would just be able to hop on a bus and
go play?  
TREY BURKE: It means a lot being able to play in front of our fans here in
Auburn Hills. You know it's not too far from our campus. It means a lot. I
know we have a lot of support tomorrow and it may feel like a home game
hopefully depending on how many fans come out.  
It's just our job to just do what we need to do and they will be the fans. You
know, our fans have been great all year. They've been great at lifting us up,
you know, when we need, you know, some type of motivation and when we go on
runs, you know, we definitely hear them.  
Like I said, it's definitely a plus for us being here in Auburn Hills.  
  
Q. Along that line but kind of not a game related question, but on the eve
of getting this tournament started, some of you, futures to be determined. Do
you strike a balance of savoring the moment and enjoying being here verses
focusing on the game?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: I think there's just one thing that you got to do is just
stay in the moment at all times. I think our coaching staff does a great job
of expressing that.  
We're not looking ahead into the future. We're taking it day by day, game by
game, and I think that's something that we need to continue to do.  
Trey, you were talking about the fans and how you're going to have a lot of
your fans here. It might be like a home game. Are you expecting a lot of
first-time South Dakota State fans wearing green and white tomorrow?  
TREY BURKE: Yes, definitely. I think there will be South Dakota State fans
here. It's the NCAA tournament. So I'm sure that their fans will come out and
support them as much as possible. So like I say, I'm looking forward to it and
hopefully we will have more fans than them. I'm pretty sure we will since
we're here in Michigan, but they are a really good team and they know how to
get wins. We still have to do what we need to do.  
MODERATOR: Thank you student-athletes.  
Coach Beilein, we'd like you to make an opening statement.  
COACH BEILEIN: We're thrilled. I hope our team will show you that but we're
thrilled to be in this situation to be playing close to home, playing a team
of the caliber of South Dakota State who we can seek and play with anybody in
the country.  
It's NCAA time. It's a great time of the year for all of us, and we're
excited. We've had some good practices. Got a little bit of rest. That's the
only good part of being beat earlier in the Big Ten tournament. We got an
extra day just to regroup. Hopefully we're fresh enough to come out and play
our best.  
  
Q. How important is the transition game in a game like this both of your
team's a little bit uptempo offensively, but both offense and defense in
transition, that's got to be tough?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think what both teams have is terrific point guards, and you
get the ball into those two young men's hands and anything can happen. I mean,
the way the game is being played now there's things happening in transition
that it's just hard to practice for.  
Some of it's spontaneity, some of it's planned, and there's quick adjustments
that both defenses have to make, and I expect we see a little bit of that.  
In order to run, people got to make stops. We have to make stops. They have to
make stops. But when both teams are running, they're really good.  
  
Q. John, what's it like to be playing so close to home?  
COACH BEILEIN: I just mentioned that because the only time I've really played
close to home when we were at Richmond and we went to DC to play South
Carolina.  
So that was good for our fans. It's really good for our fans to be close by
here. I'm sure we're going to have a good crowd of Michigan fans.  
It is good. The travel's easier, the whole thing, but once the ball goes up,
it won't mean anything. We got to play really good basketball. And once again,
we're playing a team of juniors and seniors that can beat anybody because of
how well they play the game, how well they've been coached. Terrific
basketball team.  
But we're excited that we're this close to home. I think you'll feel that
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talk about the pitfalls of -- do you feel like the two guards are kind of
going to offset each other?  
COACH BEILEIN: You look at the assist numbers on both young men, assist
turnover numbers, they're very much the same, and I think that it depends how
you guard them, the areas they get to, but there's residual effect off of what
both of them do all the time.  
So while some people may be looking at a matchup of those two, both of them
get their teammates open. Those guys making those shots will probably
determine as much of that matchup between those two really fine players.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of guys with rich basketball backgrounds with Glenn and
Jon and those guys. Is that coincidence they all ended up with you?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, it's purely coincidence, but we really feel good about it
because, you know, their dads do know basketball.  
To allow their sons to go to Michigan, I know they felt very -- they valued
the education of Michigan. They knew -- you know, they'd all been through
this. They're educated men. They decided Michigan was a good place for their
son to go to. They also liked the coaching staff and our basketball program.  
In all three of those situations, it wasn't where we are now that they decided
to do that; it was when we were first rebuilding the program. So we really --
we think that's always been a feather in our cap to have families. It's not
just the dad involved with all these. There's a strong mother involved with
every single one of these young men, and they've had a big part to do with
their success as well.  
  
Q. Interested in your assessment of heading into the tournament now that
you're out of conference play obviously.  
How do you think overall the conference will represent in the upcoming
tournament?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, Tom Izzo and I were just talking about that. It was a war
this year that I -- you know, he's been in the conference longer than I have
been in, but it reminded me of the best years in the Big East and the best
years here, that there were so many teams that were not rebuilding.  
They were lock loaded and that were really playing well.  
So time will tell how we all do, I got to think we're going to be very
successful based on the way we did in December outside our conference. But you
know who will know what the tools of the season would be on us in March
because it was -- there was one time where we played five of our away games,
five of those away games were all nationally ranked teams. Now we had home
games in between, but five away games in a row against nationally ranked
teams. That's quite a challenge.  
  
Q. What concerned you the most in particular about this South Dakota State
team you play tomorrow?  
COACH BEILEIN: They're like an amoeba with their offense. They can do so many
different things without -- that you can't really organize for.  
And then with the point guard, he just finds people that are open. I mean, you
can't really set down things with them. They are in motion, in motion, and
then they're hitting with these quick striking things which we're saying they
can't have planned that. That is just players playing, and that's always
difficult for most teams to guard when, you know, there's always -- we say
this all the time so my guys hear it. There's a time to run a play and there's
a time to be a player. They do that mix really well.  
  
Q. You've got the two bigs. Have you played another team where you think
it's kind of similar?  
COACH BEILEIN: I just mentioned that before. I don't think we've seen a big --
a team in a Big Ten that has those two shooters that can shoot like that.  
That's really a challenge all the time. So you've got to try and find ways to
defend that. It's difficult to defend that, but that's a great formula for,
you know, a high-powered offense.  
So we've been practicing, practicing, finding different ways. We got hopes
that they're going to miss. They're going to get open shots sometimes. They're
going to get open shots. We got to hope that they're going to miss some of
those. But they're not going to miss them all and we're going to have to play
just good enough so we can -- don't give them the second shots, don't give
them easy runouts. When we haven't turned the ball over, and we've rebounded
the ball really well, we've been able to play very, very good defense. But
when we give people baskets through turnovers for poor communication, which is
common when you have a roster like ours, people could score on you easily.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_AUBURN HILLS, MICHIGAN_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll start with the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Keith, I don't know if you've played on this court before, but I imagine
growing up that you were someone that followed the Pistons pretty closely.
Does it mean anything more to you to be able to play on this court?  
KEITH APPLING: I mean, my freshman year we did play here, so I have a little
experience playing here at the Plaza. But by me being a hometown kid, of
course I followed the Pistons, especially when they won the championship that
year.  
It's a special feeling to be able to play here in the NCAA tournament and have
all my family and close friends be able to come watch us play.  
I'm just happy I have the opportunity to be a part of this.  
  
Q. AP, can you talk about Broekhoff and watching him and his style of play,
maybe who you've played like him and what your thoughts are after watching him
on film?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: He's a great shooter. He goes both ways.  
He's got a quick trigger like Thomas, and he picked the floor on the ball
going both ways like Watford. So he's going to be a tough cover.  
And I'm just going to have to buckle down and get ready to trail these
pindowns.  
  
Q. I was wondering, Adrien, if you could talk about coach has played you
guys as bigs together at times this season. Do you anticipate much of that in
this game?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, you know, Coach playing Nix and I together, we feel more
comfortable. And me going a perimeter guy now, I'm able to shoot the ball
consistent and I'm getting the ball into the post to Nix and Nix is able to
make moves down low and get buckets.  
  
Q. Have you guys reached out to Brandon Wood at all and had any
conversations with him?  
KEITH APPLING: As a matter of fact, I spoke with Brandon as soon as we found
out that that we were playing Valpo. Didn't seem that he was on either side.
He just wanted to go out there and play well.  
He asked me to tell the other guys that he say hello.  
  
Q. Gary, earlier in the week, Tom said the only really big concern he had
for health-wise was you. Would you tell us the condition of your shoulders,
please?  
GARY HARRIS: I mean, I feel pretty good right now. I don't really think about
it much. I go out there and play and it's really not much else I can do about
it. I mean, it feels pretty good right now.  
  
Q. You guys will have fans out here today watching practice. Can you talk
about using that to your advantage and having the home court advantage?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: You know, I think we're all looking forward to playing here and
having home court advantage, because our fans is great and, you know, we're
just very supportive and thankful that we're going to be able to play here at
the Palace and have their support.  
  
Q. Gary, I imagine this is the type of atmosphere, that you came to Michigan
State for, have success in the postseason. Can you talk about where your head
is at?  
GARY HARRIS: I mean, I'm definitely looking for it, my first NCAA tournament,
and I'm just -- everybody says that's the most exciting part of the season,
and I'm definitely just looking forward to it.  
MODERATOR: Coach will open up with an opening statement and then take
questions from the audience.  
COACH IZZO: Well, first of all, we're excited to be here. I think the NCAA
tournament never gets old, No. 1, and to have the ability to play in your home
state in a great facility like the Palace is, I think, special for me for
fans, for our university, and for our team.  
So I'm excited to be here. I know enough about Valparaiso to know that, you
know, somewhere in his repertoire, Bryce has that shot from way back in there.
And I hope that that's not in the game plan.  
But very, very good team. Very solid team. Broekhoff is a player that could
play at a lot of places.  
And his program from when his dad was there on up has always been a threat and
we're concerned about that, but I think we're most concerned about our own
team. We're getting healthier and healthier. I think Harris is still the only
guy that is -- he's really healthy, but, I mean, it's the up and down of if
anything happens to that shoulder.  
Other than that, I think we're probably the best we've been all year.
Definitely Trice is playing some of his best basketball and I think the other
guys are all great. BJ's as good as he's been. So should be a great weekend.  
And I'll answer any questions you have.  
  
Q. Broekhoff, Payne says he reminds him a little bit of Watford, a little
bit of Thomas. How do you describe him?  
COACH IZZO: It's the day before the game, you're going to ruin me with those
kinds of stats or what?  
I think it is true. I think Payne said it best. You know, he's got the ability
to put it on the floor a little bit more like Watford. He can shoot the three
and he can shoot it from places off balance like Thomas.  
So that's a very good evaluation of him, and yet he's his own man. What he
does a little different than both those guys is he'll take the ball off the
back board and bring it down in the break like a guard. He's really a six
seven guard. Doesn't post up much, where those other two guys will.  
  
Q. I saw you on the news talk a little bit about a home court
disadvantage.  
COACH IZZO: Just a little bit. I just said -- let me tell you, I'm tickled to
death to be here, but the only worry you have -- it's kind of funny, I was
talking to John Thompson the other day on a radio show, and I was teasing him
about sequestering his guys, like he used to have them stay a couple days away
from where they played and fly in with some of NASA's equipment. That seemed
like back in the day, and I said I'm not sure you could do that as well this
day and age with, you know, so much more media. You have to be at so many more
events, at which time and all that. And his comment is you want to bet?  
And so I think that's the only worry, you know, is that there's family,
there's more people around. There's more people they know, but that is
miniscule compared to the advantage of not having to travel far, having our
families be able to get here. Just be in your home state.  
Now, it's 99 to 1, and that was the one I was explaining that I just got to
make sure we keep a focus on what we're supposed to be doing and nothing else.  
  
Q. Can you talk about matching up with Nix? You've watched how the Crusaders
match up on different teams. Do you expect to see some of Bobby Capobianco,
the Italian guy?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I expect to see him. I expect to see some double teams. You
know, they trap the post pretty well. I expect to see some of that.  
We might see more zone, who knows. I think we're prepared for everything.
Whether we can execute is another story, but I think we're prepared for
everything we think they could do.  
And I think they'll throw some different people in there and keep running
people at them, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Drew is coaching in his first NCAA game. Can you go back and
recall what it was like for you coaching the first time in the tournament?  
COACH IZZO: Sure, I can.  
In the NIT, I remember going against Tark and looked behind his bench out
there and I knew I was in trouble. You know, he had all his boys there. It was
great.  
But in the NCAA, I think my first time was against Eastern Michigan of all
teams and then Princeton.  
So he's been around it. The difference is he's played the game. He's played in
it. He's played at other levels. He lived it with his dad. You know, I was
from the UP. You know, it was a little different up there.  
So I think once you grew up in it that way, I think it'll be a little easier
for him to handle and he's done such a great job there with his team. They've
won a lot of games and, you know, am I going to feel sorry for him? No. And do
I have great respect for him? Yes. I think he'll handle it well.  
  
Q. The players kind of joked about Brandon Wood and the media a little bit.
Does that give them any kind of way to tie into this game? Does that help at
all?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, that's a good question. I didn't really think
about it that way, but, you know, Homer Drew and I are fairly good friends.
And when Brandon wanted to transfer, it was Homer that -- you know, I said I
wasn't going to take him and then Homer called me back and said, listen, he
wants to go. He's going to go somewhere and I'd love to have him go to your
place. So there was a very amicable deal there.  
I think they also, you know, had an appreciation that he played good
basketball there. Everybody knew how good, you know, Brandon was a good
player, and to think that he was a good player on that team and yet that team
won a lot of games that year.  
So we understand the level. The advantage of playing somebody so close to home
for us is -- we know how good Valpo is and our guys have heard of Valpo, and
some of them played against players that are playing on Valpo.  
As you said the Brandon situation even maybe brings it a little closer.  
  
Q. Tom, you've coached a lot of teams that have gone on Final Four runs.
Heading into those runs before the tournament start, can you sense
commonalities or trends that those groups had going in? If there are trends,
do you see any with this squad?  
COACH IZZO: You know, like you said, I've been able to coach a one seed that's
made it and I've been able to coach, I think, a five seed that's made it. So
there's been different teams, different situations.  
This one doesn't have the same -- you know, it was, I think, Travis Walton's
year that, you know, he didn't want to be the first group of guys in a four-
year period that didn't go to the Final Four. That was incentive. There was
Chris Hill and all those guys had some of the similar incentives, and they had
just come off, they were the first recruiting class off that great three Final
Four runs in a row. So that was incentive.  
This one I think is more -- you know, we're a younger team. We're not as well
led, and that's not a negative; it's just a fact of life.  
But I think us playing everybody has helped this team be able to sit there
before a practice or in a meeting.  
The first meeting we had as we entered this NCAA tournament on Sunday, it was,
you know, we have played everybody. We haven't played at Duke and we haven't
played at Valparaiso, but we've played everybody at all different levels, you
know, from Boises, you know, to the Kansases and Miamis, and then of course
our conference games. I think there's an understanding that they can compete
with everybody, but I also think there's an understanding that, you know, we
haven't won some of those games, and some of them have been through self-
inflicted wounds. Some of the teams outplayed us and some of them we aided to
that.  
And that's what we tried to talk about and correct. So crapshoot, I would say
no, but commonalties, I would say no also. This is just a different team, a
different year. In some ways it's been more fun. In some ways it's been harder
because I don't have the same pulse, but they've proven their stock over 33
games that they can play with anybody, and now we got to make sure we're
beating the teams that we need to beat.  
  
Q. Obviously you have NCAA tournament experience. What is the most important
thing about this first game getting out of the gates that you've learned over
the years?  
COACH IZZO: Well, that my experience can help a little but I don't get to
play. If I got to play, I'd feel a lot better about my experience, you know.  
But I do think I can be a calming factor or a motivating factor because I can
look guys in the eye and tell them I know how to get here, I know what we need
to do to win. Now, whether you want to listen, whether we want to execute it,
whether, you know, you believe that, or whether the other team will cooperate,
those are the coin flip areas.  
But I do think we have a system that is in place to advance through this
tournament, but I make sure I let them know that isn't getting us there.
What's getting us there is how they play, and what they do each and every
minute of the day from, you know, taking their cell phones and girlfriends and
put them on the back burner for three weeks or, you know, making sure they're
focused in on the walk-through.  
The beauty of this tournament is you really get a feel whether people, a group
of maybe 30, 40 people, everybody that's on our group, everybody that traveled
with us, whether we can all stay focused on one task. And that's not easy to
do, and yet the team that moves on each week is probably the team that
accomplished that best. And that goes from administratively to our managers,
and that's the way I've always believed it, done it, and I think it will be
the same this year.  
  
Q. 2000, did it give you an appreciation of how difficult it is to go
through all 318 teams and then win it once and then try to do it again?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it sure does, Pat. You know, there's no question that at one
minute I've been here where, you know, you got to get to a Final Four. Then we
got there. Then we won one, and then we've been to four others since then.  
You know, then you kind of hear your own rumors that you can get there but can
you win another one, you know. And then I look at a Gene Keadys of the world
and I just think how many great, great, great, great coaches have never gotten
there.  
So I find myself a balancing act once in awhile of appreciating that I've
gotten a chance to do and be selfish enough to think it's not enough.  
And to do that, you just got to have bigger goals each year. I do think it's
-- as I look back, it is harder to maintain a program. It is harder to
probably win a second one because the first one everybody's cheering for you.
The second one if you're more of a favorite, everybody's cheering against you.
The first one everybody's excited for you. And the second one, more people are
jealous of you.  
And I think that's -- you know, I heard Mike Krzyzewski talk about the rushing
the floor thing and I remember my first time that we had the floor rushed on
us was at Indiana, you know, in 2001, and a cop grabbed me and said, come on,
Coach, I'll get you off the floor. Told him to get his damn hands off me. I
wanted to sit there. I said do they know who they're playing. You know, and
that's how it's changed over the years.  
Now we're one of the hunted instead of the hunter. And the more you're that
way, I think it's tougher to win. You got to be tougher mentally. You got to
be tougher physically, and you got to understand everybody's throwing grenades
at you and you got to handle it.  
So as much as I complain about it once in awhile, that's what I live for. I
live to be one of those that they're rushing the floor on them. Live to be one
of those that they want to get me and they want to get and you say they want
to get Michigan State. That's as big a compliment as you can have.  
  
Q. You see a team like Valpo with all the seniors they have. Does it make
you even more appreciative of being able to have a guy like Derrick Nix on the
team and what he's been through to get to this point?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I don't appreciate they're seniors. It scares me a little
bit when you got that many numbers, you got a couple fifth year seniors, some
other regular seniors and it's a very senior laden team. Experience, there's
nothing like it, and it's going to help all the time. As I said, it helps me
in preparation. The problem is I don't get to play.  
And the players that have experience, meaning those seniors, and have hunger
of not wanting to play their last game, that's sometimes a great combination
for success, and they've got that. You know, that is one thing they've really
got. And those guys have been through the wars. They understood it and I'm
sure they don't want to go home and end their careers.  
It makes me appreciate them. It makes me appreciate any seniors I have,
because I think when guys go through the system, and I've had some great,
great seniors over the years, you do appreciate them even more, yes.  
  
Q. Tom, two part. First, Coach Drew talked about the first four minutes of
this game being the most critical for them to keeping it close staying with
you guys the first four minutes. Your thoughts on the first four minutes.  
Second of all, going back to a couple last questions asked, do you look at
some of these first-time coaches, teams that just got in, with all your
success Spartan fans, they do put the Final Four on the schedule every year
and maybe miss those moments of appreciation for times like this?  
COACH IZZO: Yes, I do. I do. First of all, in the first four minutes, you
know, I used to think that, and, no plus or minus to him, and I remember Jud,
sometimes you say, well, we got to play the first four minutes, first four
minutes, you're down ten to nothing. What do you do? Quit the game? Go home?
You know.  
So I kind of curb that and watch what I think of it.  
I think the first four of both halves is very important.  
But the one thing I've changed my opinion on is a missed layup in the first
two minutes is no different than a missed layup in the last ten seconds. And,
unfortunately, we all feel different about it, you know. We remember things
that happen at the end. I'm trying to get my guys to remember things that
happen through the 40 minutes, because I think it is 40 minutes of hell and
you got to play all 40 of them if you're going to be good teams in advance in
this tournament.  
Second part was?  
  
Q. The excitement.  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I am envious of that. I sit down in our locker room now and
I watch the NCAA tournament and I remember those first couple years.  
You know, people were jumping. We were the team on TV. What do you think of
being here and this and that? And now, you know, it's just -- it is part of
the schedule.  
But I appreciate that, and I realize that that's what building a program is,
that you can sustain something. Sixteen straight years, you know, and, I mean,
it hasn't been done by many. So I keep telling our guys to appreciate it.
Unfortunately, everybody else takes it for granted.  
It's finding a way to do both, because I expect at the end of the Big Ten
season we're within reason of trying to win a championship. I expect we're
somewhere where we still have a chance to mathematically win in the last week.
And that's happened, I want to say, like ten or twelve of the last 14 or 15
years. That's a good thing.  
But you got to keep reminding yourself, you know, once a while I go to the
mirror and I slap myself a couple times and I say, you know, you better
realize where you are and what you're doing. And it gets harder, but it's one
of the reasons I do, without sounding corny, I do look up to the people in
front of me. That's why I study football and pro football and, you know,
listen to Earvin when he comes back talk about guys. I'm in a locker room with
Chuck Daly. I've read his books. You know, do learn how to handle success too,
because it's hard to, and you've got to appreciate it and realize that's what
you're striving for and not take it for granted.  
  
Q. As much success as you've had in the tournament and everything, when your
team has ups and downs during a season, do you still have to convince them at
this time that they can win it?  
COACH IZZO: You know, it's funny. That's a good question, and I'm listening to
your question and I'm thinking about our ups and downs this year. You know
with three minutes left to go, we haven't been out of one game, and that's
like having a chance to win the Big Ten at the end.  
We haven't always played great but, you know, there's a lot of teams that
haven't always played great. In fact, every one of the one seeds have had
their moments. You know, when you look at every one of the two seeds, you
know, Ohio state has gotten beat by 25 at Wisconsin, Duke has gone through
their thing at Miami. Kansas has gone through the TCU. When you really think
about it, we haven't had one of those.  
I think I've got to do more convincing because I'm just not sure this team --
you know, when you lack a true aggressive leader, they've got to hear that.
They can't hear it two hours in practice. They got to hear it every day in the
locker room.  
And I remember Day-Day against St. Louis in tears in the locker room at half
time and -- just because, and we were winning. But, you know, it meant that
much to him.  
And so, yeah, I think you got to do some convincing. You got to make them
believe, but, yet again, the longer you're in it and the longer you're in that
position, you got everybody else in town telling them, yeah, we'll see you in
Atlanta. You know, and are you kidding me or what? That's the hard part.
That's the balancing act.  
And as I get in every press conference that I'll ever do for the rest of my
life, that's what makes Twitter so hard. Everybody's tweeting them telling
them how great they are and then there's some Italian guy telling them how bad
they are and we got to find a happy medium.  
  
Q. You talk about how much Derrick Nix has reshaped his body and his game
and his life. Have you ever had somebody whose done those things quite like he
had?  
COACH IZZO: I never had anybody that big. You know, Zach Randolph was close
and yet we only had him for a year. But I'd say the closest thing was a Morris
Peterson, you know, who came in a pudgy little guy or pudgy big guy and he
grew academically, he grew socially, and he grew in basketball. And he turned
out to be my wife's -- one of her favorite players of all times because he
grew so much and he was such a good kid.  
And, you know, Nix is -- I mean, he is making a lot of progress. He's got a
ways to go, but we're not always fortunate as some and we don't always start
out the way maybe I started out. And I think I've learned to appreciate that,
and I have a great appreciation for the fact that he's trying. He's trying.
You know, he's trying to get better in all areas.  
In some ways I wish I had him one more year, you know, because I think like
Morris red shirted a year, and I'm not sure he would have been ready for the
real world after his junior, senior year -- you know, junior year. And yet,
boy, was he when he got out. And he ran with it and he's doing so well now.  
And that's what I hope for Derrick. You know, it's probably the most fun to
take a guy that you're not sure would have made it academically, athletically,
or socially, and you see it turn around and you see a guy making it probably
means more in the long run than the Final Fours because you really truly did
help a guy get better and that's what we all should be doing. Especially us as
coaches or teachers.  
  
Q. You were talking about how the people you looked up to you studied. Could
you talk about how that benefit you this of time of year?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I had a lot of pinch-me moments. Anybody I met from up there
was a pinch-me moment. Some of you guys were pinch-me moments just because I
saw your mugs on a piece of paper, you know, when I read the paper up there.  
You know, I mean, it started out when I was really, really young and it was
Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers 90 miles from my house, you know, and
go down there and watch practice and ride my bike and let somebody drive me
over and, you know, all those things. That was cool.  
And then, of course, reading his books and -- you know, and I looked at -- you
know, Jud was -- I remember coming down to the first practice. In fact, my
first practice I ever went to as an assistant coach at Northern Michigan, I
was a GA up there for awhile and was to Al McGuire, and got down there with
Hank Raymonds and, of, course Rick Mejarus were running practice and just like
the stories, Al pulled in on his motorcycle, and I said, What the what is
that. You know, and it was cool. It was great. I learned. In fact, I got to
tell him that story when he did our last game before he kind of quit the
announcing part.  
You know, so I looked at guys like that because they were close. Came down
here for Jud's practice when he was with Magic when I first became an
assistant coach. That was good.  
Y'all know I do study pro football. You know, with Mariucci, I'd access the
people like -- you know, get to spend time with Gruden at his practices or
spend time with Mariucci, and that's why I go down to the Lions practices now.
Jim invites me down. I think I learn a lot of things from those guys, and when
Earvin comes back, you know, you get a lot of Pat Riley stories. I got a
chance to be with Flip Saunders and Doc Rivers on the Goodwill Games. When I
do those things, or when I'm with Mike Krzyzewski on a board, hey, I think the
best thing I've done is figure I know nothing, and I do try to learn from
everybody. I really do. I don't think that's a fault or a weakness. I think it
is a strength.  
I think, you know, I'd be the first to admit, you know, I do look at the weak
ends now. That was Mike. That's where he taught me. I do believe toughness is
the key. That was Vince Lombardi's books, you know. And I just I think, like
every good coach, every good parent, every good teacher, you steal from
whoever you can legally steal from, and I've stolen from everybody, and that's
why I think it's helped me.  
Because these different venues -- I mean, I love going speaking corporately. I
always get there early and stay late just so I can meet the president or meet
somebody like that who gives me the business side of things. I just think it's
-- you know, I watch Pauley, and his son was a GA at our place. You know, when
Saban was there. I just try to pick guys that have been successful over time,
not flashing-the-pan guys, been successful over time, and I try to see how
they did it.  
You know what I found out for the most part? Everybody does it a a very
similar way, business, sports, parenthood, doesn't matter. There's a right way
and a wrong way, and that's what I figured out in this crazy world I live in.  
  
Q. Coach, I just got here a few moments ago. Readdress, if you would, the
home venue, the positives of that, if they far outweigh the negatives?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I don't feel any pressure with it. None what so ever. Zero.
Pressure to me is self-inflicted. You know, I'm not worried about those
people. I want to play. I want to win for those people, but I'm not worried
about the pressure of those people at all.  
That's the one thing. The only time I felt pressure was probably going into my
third year, we lost a couple games and I knew my job was on the line. That was
pressure. But this stuff is a privilege. It's an honer. It's we're playing for
everybody who's a Michigan State fan, and when you play in your home state,
you get a lot of fans that aren't Michigan State fans that join in, and I
appreciate that. I applaud that. I admire that.  
The more people that come here, the more people that get in, I think the
better for us, because I really -- when we win a big game, I can't tell you
how much -- I told Magic Johnson when we won our game in Detroit against UConn
I said, man, you think I'd get killed if I took you and my team and we just
walked the streets for a half hour before the next game? And he said, no,
let's go do it. I said, no, I'll get killed, you know, if I lose.  
And that's the only thing. I mean, I love sharing things with people. I love
seeing people happy because we do well. Especially if it's Michigan State
people. So it's 99. The only one was to keep our guys focused and that's my
job and their job. So it's all good. It's all good being here. We just got to
perform now.  
MODERATOR: Thanks very much, Coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Florida  78  
Minnesota - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach Smith
and then take questions for the student‑athletes. Coach?  
COACH SMITH: Well, first, I just want to congratulate Florida. They did a good
job. Every time we seemed to have an opportunity, they made a play or made a
shot to shut us down. But I was proud of our kids, the way they came out in
the second half and played a lot, gave it all they had, played with heart and
with some real toughness.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Andre, talk about what was going through your head on that fourth foul.
It looked like you were really frustrated at the call. But at that point you
guys were making a furious comeback.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, I was just fighting over the screen and trying to get
over it. 6‑2 point guard going against a 6‑9 center and they called a foul on
me. I was doing my job to get around and they just called a foul.  
  
Q. Trevor, what changed for you guys defensively in the second half?  
TREVOR MBAKWE: We just played with more aggressiveness. When we're aggressive,
we're a lot better team. Sometimes unfortunately, throughout the season it
took us being down a large amount, or just being down at halftime for us to
kind of pick it up. And by that time when you're playing against better
talents and better teams like Florida, it's kind of hard when you put yourself
in that position. But I think we just picked it up defensively, we pressed
more and were able to get in their face and cause turnovers and get out in
transition and that allowed us to get back in the game.  
  
Q. Andre, when they cut, you guys cut the lead to seven and obviously you
had the foul issues, but they made those two threes in a row to take the lead
back up. How deflating was that?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: It was real deflating. It was kind of how we did at UCLA, when
they made their run on us and we came down and hit a couple threes. It freezes
the momentum, and personally, it was my fault on both of them, because I
helped when I shouldn't have off a guy who has already made four threes. That
was a mental mistake that I made tonight.  
  
Q. Andre, when you saw the way that your team played in the first half, can
you talk about your mindset coming out in the second half. It seemed like you
definitely had a different mindset, aggressive, to get your self back in the
game.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, first half, we didn't play good defense. And that
affected our offense. We were stagnant. Second half, we had to pick things up.
In the locker room we were saying it was nothing new, we came back from
Indiana, we have been down big before and comeback. And we just can't hang our
heads and we just had to come out blazing.  
  
Q. For Trevor and Rodney, when you guys look back at this season, the way
you started and the expectations for this team, how will you look back and
describe what this team did?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: We definitely started the season out strong. Then we had that
stretch where we didn't play that same basketball.  
But looking back, I'm just happy to have been a part of this team and this
program. We have been through a whole lot, up‑and‑downs and our team stayed
together. Everybody stayed with it and every time we got down, we never gave
up, we always fought. So even though it didn't end the way we wanted it to,
I'm still really happy and proud to be a part of this.  
TREVOR MBAKWE: Yeah, I'm proud too to be a part of a situation like that.
Especially being fortunate to be granted a sixth year by the NCAA. And
obviously it's frustrating sometimes just being Top‑10 at a point and have
high expectation and then going through that rough stretch.  
It was a tough getting through the Big‑10 and we were able to. And we always
kept fighting. We coughed up some games that we felt we really should have
won. We lost a tough one in the Big‑10 tournament in Illinois, lost on the
game winner there, but we bounced back and had a good one. This team kept
fighting, we never really let up.  
Unfortunately we didn't finish as strong as we wanted to, but I'm proud of the
way the guys responded, especially during the tough stretch and when people
got down on us.  
  
Q. Andre, just talk about what this team can accomplish next season. You
have your three guards coming back, you and Austin and Joe.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: We can do some good things next year. We're going to be
experienced, Austin is going to be a senior, myself and Joe, we're going to be
juniors, we also have Elliott Eliason, Oto Osenieks, Mo Walker coming back. We
have some talented freshmen coming in and Wally Ellenson and Charles, but
we're going to be tough. We're going to be a tough team. We just got to get to
work.  
It starts now in the off season. Just getting in the gym every day work at it,
we know what it takes to get here now. We had a taste of what the NCAA
tournament is like and we'll have to strive to get back here and do bigger
things, do better next year.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, we'll let you go and take questions for
coach now.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys made the great comeback and Wilbekin and Rosario hit
those two threes back to back. Talk about how deflating that was and also the
fact that what Rosario was able to do tonight.  
COACH SMITH: Well, we wanted to‑‑ we knew he was very talented shooter. But he
really proved it again. Again, I was happy to hear‑‑ appreciate and Dre and
Hollins and guys who were helping off when they probably should have stayed
out. But they were moving the ball pretty well. Penetrating it. When you're
behind, and you're pretty fatigued at some point, because we put a lot of
energy into trying to get back in the game. And he moves pretty good without
the ball, he does a good job of spotting up and their team does a fantastic
job of finding him open.  
Again, I was impressed with his outside shooting. When you shoot 6‑9, even if
you're by yourself, that's still pretty impressive. And those were really
tough shots because we had some momentum going, cut it from 21 to what, seven
or eight? We were back in the ball game. Both those threes took a lot of wind
out of our sail.  
  
Q. This team has had games similar to this several times this season where
they either start slow and then come out strong or vice versa. Is that kind of
‑‑ is that difficult for you to explain? Have you ever seen a team that has
done that so often?   
COACH SMITH: Yeah, this one. But, no, I don't think that ‑‑ I don't know what
it is. Like today, we were off to a good start, 9‑9\. We have a bunch of
defensive breakdowns and good teams are going to burn you. We played against
very good teams every game. So today was no exception.  
So that happened and they got some layups and open looks and by that time
you're sort of‑‑ you start, you're a little deflated because now there's a mix
up and one of the things in basketball, the team that makes the least amount
of mistakes is usually going to win the game. That's where our mistakes and
that's why they were 8‑18 from three, we just had a lot of, I mean 10‑20 from
threes and we just had a lot of breakdowns off the dribble. But I don't know
what it is. Maybe we're just a slow starting team for the most part.  
  
Q. The other guard, Wilbekin, seemed to give you guys some problems there
down the stretch, was that more a product of trying to stay home against
Rosario or was it just a great individual effort by him?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we ended up the second half ‑‑ we made a run because we
went to a switching defense. We went to a man‑to‑man switching defense and
just decided, hey, they're getting too many open look, let's just ‑‑ open
shots beat you.  
If it's a mismatch, so what. And we broke it down and so I thought in the
second half, I thought he was pretty smart in finding guys open. We fouled
unnecessarily when we‑‑ when it was a mismatch, the whole thing was, when you
switch, front the post and if they do catch it, we'll come down and double or
trap you. But we fouled quite a bit.  
He's a guy that really does a good job of orchestrating their team, taking
care of the basketball, and really, he's really a very excellent defender. He
really takes a lot of pride. And I thought he shut down Austin. And whenever
he was around, Austin struggled in the second half. And part of it was because
of their defense there. They're one of the best defensive teams, Florida's one
of the best defensive teams we have played against and one of the best in the
country.  
  
Q. You stayed in the zone for awhile early on, were you hesitant to move
back to man ‑to‑man just because of ‑‑  
COACH SMITH: They were making shots. We couldn't stop them at anything in the
first half. So we tried zone and that didn't work. So we went man. We had foul
trouble. We tried to protect the people because of foul situations. I thought
that we got good play out of Elliot and Mo last night and it wasn't the same
tonight. It was a little bit, you know, they have a pretty talented front line
in Patric Young and Erik Murphy, so we had our issues there.  
  
Q. When Andre gets his fourth foul about halfway through the second half you
kept him out about four, four and a half minutes. How much of a balancing act
was that because you weren't getting a whole lot of offense from other guys,
as opposed to putting him back in.  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, because he's our most proficient, most efficient offensive
player and he's a guy that doesn't mind taking a shot. And he's aggressive.
He's an excellent free throw shooter.  
Again, I thought when he's out, now they can focus on shutting Austin down.
And then Austin was playing, he logged a lot of minutes, 37 minutes, we
couldn't give him much rest because we weren't able to find any offense
anywhere else. I was hoping that Oto would give us some, Julian would step up,
Maverick. But we just couldn't be, we couldn't produce any offense there. And
Rodney struggled in the first half trying to score.  
But he picked it up in the second half. So you got to score the basketball.
When you're not scoring and you're trying to manufacture offense, it can be
tough. And we went through a stretch there that when he was out of the game,
when Andre Hollins was out of the game, that we couldn't get any flow, because
he's also our point guard and that's the tough thing. When your point guard is
your best shooter and your best scorer, it makes it tough. Because now teams
they make him work the length of the court and then Billy Donovan's staff did
a good job of that. But he made some outstanding shots. That's one thing he
can do, he can shoot the ball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you have seen from this team in the NCAA
tournament that you think can carry over to next season with some of the
returning guys.  
COACH SMITH: Oh, yeah, I think that Trevor talked about it, one of the guys
talked about the returning players that we have. We have three starters
returning. I think that's, I think that speaks a lot about what ‑‑ we play a
lot of people.  
I thought Elliot started lot of games last year and with another summer and of
lifting, another year, he should be a lot better. Mo Walker is healthy. I
really think that we got to get people better like Oto and Maverick.  
I thought we have a couple good recruits coming in. So we should be fine. And
that's why I think we'll be a ‑‑ we lose a lot of rebounding, a lot of
athleticism in Rodney Williams and in Trevor. But I think we should be okay.  
  
Q. Do you have any indication that your job is in trouble at all?  
COACH SMITH: No.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach thank you.  
COACH SMITH: Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Miami - 63  
Illinois - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH GROCE: Well, couldn't be more proud of our team throughout the course of
the season. And I thought it was exemplified in full fashion today.  
I thought we battled, I asked them to play with courage, they played with a
high level of courage. I thought their poise was tremendous. They were
resilient. We had several guys make plays. We had our opportunities. I want to
give Miami credit. They're a really good basketball team. You don't win their
league and their tournament championship unless you've got good players and
you're well coached and you play well.  
It was a battle. It was like a heavy weight boxing match out there.
Unfortunately, we came out on the short end of it. The worst part for me is
that I've got these guys up here, two of the seniors. I got three more back in
my locker room and we don't get to go to practice on Monday and Tuesday.
That's the part that's hardest to swallow. Because these guys are high
character guys, I loved being around them from day one, they have laid a
foundation for where we're headed and as I told them in the locker room, I'll
be forever grateful for that. They represented the university well. Proud of
them. Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brandon, you kind of slumped over there at the end of the game and just
wondering what your thoughts were at that moment. You guys were so close
probably seemed like you were within reach there.  
BRANDON PAUL: When the clock hit zero it kind of just hit me faster than I
thought it would that that was the last game of my college career. And more
importantly, just my last time being able to step on a court with the guys I
came up with. With Tyler, Joe, D.J., the rest of the seniors, Kevin and Sam,
as well as, the rest of the guys on my team as well as the coaching staff.  
I've had a great career at Illinois, I've done a lot of things, and just
looking back I'm proud of the way we fought tonight like coach say. We made
plays and it put us in position to be successful. Miami played a great game
and they never gave up and they're a good team.  
  
Q. Nnanna, with about 40 seconds left you were battling for the ball I think
with Kadji under your basket. And it looked like you guys thought you were
going to get the inbounds play and then they gave it to Miami. Just how
surprising was that to you? What was?  
COACH GROCE: I'll answer all questions regarding that play. Thank you.  
  
Q. Nnanna, just talk about the way you guys came back at the end of the game
and just the feeling when you get that close and it doesn't work out.  
NNANNA EGWU: Basically he just shows the resiliency of our team the whole year
and we showed it time and time again through non conference season, through
the conference season. The seniors, they led us well throughout the whole year
and they showed us that they never give up. They keep battling from end to end
and that's just another example of that tonight.  
  
Q. Tyler, just a thought about what happened down the stretch and how close
it was and how it didn't come to pass the way you guys wanted it to.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Credit to Miami for making plays. We had the opportunities
there, we just didn't convert enough of them. They're a good team and we just
couldn't get stops down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, we'll let you go. We'll take questions for
coach now.  
  
Q. Just talk about that inbounds play there. It looked like everybody was
really surprised that it went the other way.  
COACH GROCE: Well I had two thoughts: One, I thought the officiating Friday
and today was tremendous. These are the best of the best. I thought they did a
good job as you saw. And my second thought is you saw the same video that I
did. Those guys did a good job though. They did. It's a hard game to
officiate, it's both teams physical, both teams desiring the same thing. 50/50
calls are hard sometimes.  
That's how he saw the play in life speed, and certainly respect him and
respect the call that he made.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on it a little bit with the guys, we have talked
about this all year, but what do those guys mean to you and how hard is it
right now sitting here right now knowing that you're not going to have those
guys any more.  
COACH GROCE: It's hard. It's really hard. It's really hard. Those guys have
done a lot. To be in this position I think a lot of people wouldn't have
thought that at the beginning. And then we got off to a good start and then we
struggled a little bit at the beginning of Big‑10 play and I felt like people
kind of doubted them again. Then they found a way to be resilient and grind
out some wins there in Big‑10 play and play really well down the stretch.  
Biggest thing though I said this is I just said this to them. I hope it's a
great life lesson for them that don't put self imposed limitations on
yourself. And believe in your self. And when times get tough, they're going to
get tough, they're going to get tough when they're married some day, when they
have kids some day, and they have got to pay bills and all those life lessons
that you learn, that's what sports are about. To be resilient and to grind and
find a way. And they did that all year.  
I'm proud of them for that. I'm proud of our staff. Felt like we got a lot out
of them. Our staff deserves a lot of‑‑ assistant coaches deserve a lot of
credit for that. I thought today we played really, really well. I thought they
played well also and they're a good basketball team and it just didn't go our
way.  
  
Q. You touched on it sort of in general, but specifically Brandon gave you
some big threes down the stretch, Tyler early, just talk about some of the
individual contributions, Tracy to the hoop.  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, I thought ‑‑ well we have got guys that have a lot of
courage. They do. They believe in themselves and one another and the coaches.
They have done a great job and guys made plays. Guys made‑‑ I thought Sam's
block was off the charts. I thought that Griffey made shots and rebounded the
ball well. I thought Paul made plays. I thought Richardson was really good
defensively. I thought he challenged the heck out of Shane Larkin's shot
there. That was a big shot in front of the Miami bench and I give them a lot
of credit for making that play. He's a terrific player.  
We had Nnanna with 12 rebounds, I mean you could go right down the line. I
felt like everyone that played contributed in some form or fashion. That's
kind of how it's been all year, we have been kind of a committee of guys
trying to do it together. And I think our guys have, for the most part, they
have done that, they stuck together through thick and thin and for that I'm
proud of them.  
  
Q. How tough is it to see D.J. Richardson shoot so poorly in his final
game?  
COACH GROCE: It's not easy, because I believe in D.J. I know he believes in
himself. I thought he had some pretty good looks there. They just didn't go
in. We had enough chances to make some plays that could have affected the
outcome throughout the game and he had some pretty good looks. And I trust him
a lot and most days he shoots 10 threes of the quality that he had tonight,
he's not going to make one of them, but you know, stuff happens.  
And the great thing about D.J. is he found other ways to impact the game with
how vocal he was, his leadership, the way he defended, I thought he was really
locked in and engaged. I was proud of him and the way he handled himself all
season.  
  
Q. Kind of reflecting, can you talk about how lucky you were to inherit a
group that was this resilient all year long.  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, they have been ‑‑ I'm very fortunate, that they were open
minded and having said that, I think that our assistant coaches worked very
hard and we worked hard to develop relationships with the kids and that's what
coaching is. Finding a way to connect and the players were very open minded
and allowed us to connect with them and their belief in what we were doing.
Grew exponentially as the season kept going on and on and on and on. Even when
we were dealing with the adversity there where we weren't, we struggled a
little bit, they stayed the course and so I feel very blessed to have coached
that group and what they have done as we move forward here from year one to
help us build a foundation of what we want to be about.  
  
Q. Building off that, how much does this help you, the success and getting
to the tournament for those young guys as you look to take further steps
here?  
COACH GROCE: Well I think it helps. Obviously. I'll have a chance to reflect
more on that maybe tomorrow. In terms of the breadth of the whole season. Our
guys have invested so much, I know that they're disappointed and they should
be. They put their heart and their soul and their mind into this from day one
and kind of had a cause and they battled every day to put themselves in
position to have this opportunity tonight to have a chance to go to the Sweet
16 and they made all that happen, so they obviously deserve all the credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH GROCE: Thanks.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Florida  78  
Minnesota - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll beginning with an opening statement from coach and take
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH DONOVAN: I thought our guys came out and really played a terrific first
half. Obviously had a nice lead and, at least tried to talk at halftime, about
the fact that I think we all knew Minnesota is a pride full team, I know Tubby
obviously very well, that their team would come out and respond.  
They did. And I think right about the 14 minute mark they had out scored us
13‑4\. And really they got themselves right back in the game.  
I don't know what they cut it to. I think it was maybe seven. And I give our
guys a lot of credit in terms of battling and fighting off that run and making
some plays, some key plays in key situations. I was really, really happy
personally for Mike. Because I don't think the last game for him was a game
that he was probably too thrilled about. I give him a lot of credit for
bouncing back and coming focused and ready to play today. And he was huge for
us with the way he shot the ball.  
I think the same thing could be said for Erik. Erik got us off too, those two
guys in the first half really played exceptionally well. Erik, unfortunately,
most of the second half had to battle foul trouble. But we weathered the Storm
and found a way to move on and I think that's probably the most important
thing right now, going forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Mike, can you talk about all the confrontation that went into a night
like this, and is this the way Billy has wanted you to play from the time you
got to Florida?  
MIKE ROSARIO: Like I told coach and the guys, it's a very emotional moment for
me because two, three years ago I wasn't in this situation and now being with
this program and being under coach and with a good group of guys, it's a great
experience.  
The message that coach gave us and gave me personally is, you got to go out
there and compete. And that's the one thing that my teammates understand and
especially down in the stretch. In the second half there, I thought that we
dug deep. We expected the other team to make a run, because if you're down in
the second half, by 14, 15 points, and you have your coach getting on your
guys at halftime, your guys are going to respond.  
So I thought that Minnesota did a great job at that. But I commend coach and
my teammates and Scottie Wilbekin and the rest of the guys finding me when I
was open. And I was knocking down shots. I thought we did a great job just
responding to the situation and just taking it and running with it.  
  
Q. Mike, can you talk about when they did cut it to seven. You and Scotty
hitting those back to back threes. How big that was?  
MIKE ROSARIO: Those are some big shots. The one thing that coach talked to me
before I transferred here, he said you're putting yourself in big moments and
big games, and just being in this big situation like that. I really took full
advantage of it tonight and I told myself, if I'm open, I'm going to knock
down the shot. And I commend Scotty for finding me the whole game, basically.  
I just told myself, I can't let my guys down. Because I was beating myself up
about the first performance that I had in the first game and I just thought
that I didn't bring that full Mike Rosario for the first game, and I just felt
like that I had to come out in the second game and really be on edge and help
my team in every way possible to win this game.  
  
Q. Erik, the experience you guys have on your team, how important was that
in weathering that Storm that coach talked about?  
ERIK MURPHY: That was a big factor. We have been in a lot of tough situations
this year and in the past too. And obviously this year in handling it. But
today when it got close, we really stepped up as team and came together and
just did our jobs collectively as group and got the job done.  
  
Q. Mike, did you feel like you were looking to score? Did it kind of come
naturally and the shots just kind of open up and the opportunities?  
MIKE ROSARIO: I wasn't really looking to score. I just felt that I was put in
the right situation at the right time and I told myself I'm not going to
hesitate. That's the one thing that coach told us going into this game, leave
it out there, leave it all on the floor. I felt that every time I have an open
look at it, I'm going to take it. They were falling tonight.  
  
Q. Erik, Scotty said in the locker room that there was some point after you
got your fourth foul and picked it up you kind of gathered the team on the
side in one of those timeouts and can you just kind of relate what that
message was to them?  
ERIK MURPHY: Yeah, it was tough because I almost felt like trapped a little
bit in the second half. I felt I was watching the whole game happen and I
couldn't‑‑ because of fouls, the situation I put myself in, but I just
gathered the guys and said, we just got to get the job done right now. We got
to come together, we got to play possession by possession and just do our best
to eliminate easy things for them and play well on offense and just get easy
shots for us.  
  
Q. Mike, could you talk about your first game and what shortcomings you had.
I know you didn't play the minutes, but.  
MIKE ROSARIO: I just felt that in the first game I wasn't on edge and coach
expects a lot out of me, being a fifth year senior. I just felt that coming
into that first game I wasn't doing my job. Everybody has a job on the team to
do and that's something that coach teaches us every day in practice and every
game. If you have every guy on the same page, doing their job, that's how you
have great teams.  
I felt that I let my team down by not doing that the first game. So I was
beating myself up about it and I was happy to come out today and get the job
done.  
  
Q. Mike, you guys are going to Dallas, going to face Florida Gulf Coast,
what do you know about those guys?  
MIKE ROSARIO: Right now we don't know too much about those guys because we're
so locked in on ourselves and what's going on with the Gators. But I'm sure
that coach will breakdown the next opponent to us and we're going to sit there
and just listen to the things that coach has to tell us about our next
opponent and make sure we're on edge.  
  
Q. For Erik, first time in school history that Florida's been to three
straight Sweet 16, you've been a part of all those teams. What do you think
that says about staying with the program and your teammates?  
ERIK MURPHY: It's something special to be part of that and the program's
special. We all really care about each other and when we‑‑ when there's a
group of guys that really cares about each other they can accomplish special
things.  
Even before the first Sweet 16, when I was younger, we had guys ahead of us
that paved the way for us and showed us what it took. They gave us that sense
of camaraderie. I think it just speaks to coach and what he's done with the
program. That's how he is. And then that feeds into us and that's how we
become.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, gentlemen. We'll take questions now for
coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your history with Mike and the first game and whether
the dark side and the light side are always battling in this guy.  
COACH DONOVAN: Definitely they are. From a positive perspective with Mike, is
I think in order to be a great teammate you really got to be an affectionate
guy, and a caring guy and a loving guy. And he expresses himself a lot of
times verbally how he feels about his teammates, how he feels about being
here.  
I think that's just who he is. He's not a selfish guy, he's unselfish. But
there are times with Mike, where he can come not focused, he cannot be
accountable, he cannot be responsible in terms of doing the things that he
needs to do.  
The reason our relationship at times has been maybe somewhat rocky is because
I've held him to a really high standard of accountability on and off the
floor.  
And I think that when he, as he mentioned tonight, is on edge and he is
focused, he plays better, he performs better. So I think I got asked after the
Northwestern State game geez you sat Mike Rosario for 11 minutes. I didn't sit
Mike Rosario for 11 minutes, he sat himself. And we needed to move on without
him because of what he just said. I think that's something that he battles
with sometimes.  
He's just coming with that focus all the time and being tight and intense. And
when he's like that, he's really, really good. I think I've tried to hold him
to that standard because he's not that great of a player when he doesn't play
that way. But in terms of like ‑‑I remember the Vanderbilt game at home, the
last home game of the year was his senior night, and he wasn't playing well.
We were in kind of a dog fight with Vanderbilt there and I sat him and he's on
the benches he's cheering, he's into the game, he doesn't pout, he doesn't do
anything that's going to disrupt the team.  
But there's times where he can be a little carefree, can be a little bit
loose, and he cannot block out or miss an assignment and those kinds of
things. And really what I tried to do yesterday was really challenge him in
the morning when we met in front of the team. That he's got a responsibility.
He's a fifth year senior, and it's his first NCAA tournament appearance and
that's the focus he comes with? Like there's something wrong with that. And I
think he felt bad about it.  
The one thing I always say about Mike is Mike will assume responsibility. He
is not a finger pointer. He does not blame other people. He'll take
responsibility. The one thing I appreciate, more than anything, is Mike let's
me coach him. He let's me coach him. But I'm on him all the time. A lot.
Because I want him to be the best he can be on and off the floor. And when
he's allowed to be that way, maybe class is not quite that important or I come
a little late to practice or I'm not really ready to play. No. You just sit
down. There needs to be some level of discipline. But he takes it, he moves
forward.  
So someone asked me going into this game how do you think Rosario will be. And
I said he'll be fine because he's got a very short‑term memory and he moves to
the next challenge pretty quickly.  
  
Q. All year we have been trying to decide who is the guy who makes this team
go, the X factor. Tonight in a lot of ways it was Scotty taking care of the
ball and especially in the second half when things looked bad. Can you just
talk about how well he played and maybe didn't in the Ole Miss game in
Nashville.  
COACH DONOVAN: He played well. I think some of the things with our team when
we have gotten into some of those situations, whether it's been at Missouri or
Kentucky, where we have had kind of a lead and then for whatever reason we go
dry for a long period of time, we were kind of in that same situation again
today.  
Scottie, I think, stepped up and you need someone to make a shot. I think that
when some of those previous games we didn't make a shot. Mike knocked down a
shot. Scottie knocked down a three. Yeguete made a layup. Scottie drove a
layup and got fouled. We got to the free throw line and we found a way to
manufacture points. And then we found a way to get some stops. And that was
encouraging to see from the bench that, okay, here we go again, seven or eight
point lead, we need to step up as a team right now and take this on.  
And they did and I was encouraged by that. And because we did it today doesn't
mean we'll do it if we're in that situation next week. Every situation's
different. But they responded the way, as a coach, I had hoped they would
respond when a team was threatening.  
And when you get into this time of year and the teams that are left, all these
teams that are left have resiliency and toughness and perseverance. And there
was no way Minnesota was going to come out there in the second half and let
the game go from 21 to 31. They're going to fight. And we didn't match that
intensity and the 13‑4 run got them right back in the game pretty quickly.  
  
Q. With Mike, how do you find the line between trying to rein him in and
letting him play the way he wants to and get those points tonight.  
COACH DONOVAN: There's a couple things for him that are really, really simple.
When he doesn't do them, he, I generally have to sit him. But the first thing
is, is just really, really take open shots. I want him to be as aggressive as
he possible can be. That doesn't mean that be aggressive to just go score all
the time, but be aggressive with the ball.  
The other thing with him is be responsible with the ball. If you want that
kind of freedom, and if you want to be able to play aggressive, there is a
responsibility that you have to yourself and to our team to make the right
decision. Okay.  
And then the third part for him is, just play the right way. Play the right
way. He has got as good of a basketball feel and understanding of anybody on
our team. He sees open men, he makes the extra pass, he can get guys shots.
But there's sometimes where he gets a little high risk and very, very low
reward. And when he does that, it puts our team in a very, very difficult
situation.  
And he understands, when he's locked in like that, he plays sharp and crisp
and tight. When he's loose and carefree and he's just kind of floating around
out there, we really don't get much from him. And I think a lot of times for
players sometimes the best motivating factor is the bench, when you have the
opportunity to sit somebody down. And I think for him he probably reflected on
Friday night and said, geez, I'm fortunate I got another day here to play, I'm
not going to show up against Minnesota like that.  
  
Q. The way you stay after him, is that an approach that might not work with
some other guys?  
COACH DONOVAN: Absolutely. I think everybody's different. I think you have to
try as a coach to hit the right buttons there. Mike let's me coach him. He
takes responsibility. The best part about him is he really cares about his
teammates. So when he ‑‑ I don't think a lot of times it's even done
intentionally, it's just that responsibility of every single day him not, or
me not allowing him to not to be his best. And that's all I'm trying to get
out of him is him to be his best.  
Doesn't mean he's got to score 25 points, but just go out there and play and
be your best. We're in an eight point game against Northwestern State, the
first possession we're talking about what we got to do to start the second
half, and he doesn't even remotely come close to blocking anybody out. Just
stands there. Guy runs right by his ear, catches the ball and lays it in and
now it's down to six and now he's sitting on the bench and he's had some time
to reflect.  
But he's a great kid. I love coaching him, I love being around him, because
he's an affectionate, loving kid.  
We try to do some things community service‑wise with our guys, whether it be a
children's hospital or homeless shelter, I've never been around anybody on our
team, or over the years that I've been there, that is more engaging with young
kids or people that are less fortunate. I mean, it's unbelievable watching him
carry on conversations. He has an incredible part about him that's really
unique and special.  
But he also has this other part of him that sometimes he's a little bit loose
and carefree and lacks some responsibility. And I think that you got to hold
him accountable. When you hold him accountable he generally responds.  
  
Q. You know how hard the NCAA tournament can be to just to get to the Sweet
16 for the third straight year. What does that say about where the program is
and the guys that you've coached these last few years.  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, I'm really, really proud our guys. I think it's really
hard to get out of the first weekend. It just is. There's so many good teams,
I think that the parity of college basketball certainly is a lot different
today than it was 25 years ago. I think that's what makes this tournament so
special.  
And then when you get an opportunity to go into a second weekend and be able
to get two victories, I mean it's, it says a lot about our guys. Because the
season is so long. It's such a long season. And to get yourself ready to play
night in and night out, I give our guys a lot of credit. Especially the
seniors, Erik and Mike and Kenny. What they have been able to do since they
have been here. And obviously the guys that are younger, Patric Young's been
here, been a part of it and so has Casey, Will Yeguete, it's been a really,
really good group in terms of just going out there.  
I like being around them, they're great kids, they work hard, they're very,
very pleasing, they understand what the program is trying to build, what we're
trying to do, and I think they take that very, very personally and they try to
do the best they can.  
So the last three years, those guys deserve the credit, because they're the
ones out there performing and playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH DONOVAN: Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Miami - 63  
Illinois - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask you to make an opening statement and then we'll take
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, the very first thing is, is our hats are off to
Illinois. I thought they played the best defense on us that we have seen. They
were so active in their man‑to‑man pressure and so much so, after the game was
over I was still kind of stunned and when I shook hands with John Groce, their
coach, I was speechless. I didn't even know what to say to him. Because I
thought his kids played their hearts out, our kids did too, and very, very
fortunate to come away with a great victory and a great team effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shane, just that 3 ‑pointer with a minute to go. What were you thinking?
  
SHANE LARKIN: Well, Kenny said high ball screen and they had been staying with
me the whole game, the big had stayed with me and tried to make me give up the
ball. And the guard actually got back to me and I just tried to make a move to
the basket and he cut me off, so I just stepped back and shot the three. And
it went in.  
  
Q. Did you think twice about that shot or was instinct?  
SHANE LARKIN: I have made that shot in the Carolina game and I kind of had a
mindset of shooting that shot when I came off the ball screen, so I just had a
lot of confidence. My teammates had confidence in me and coach did too, to
call that play in that situation, with that amount of time left in the game. I
just wanted to go out there and make a big play for my team and I guess luck
was just on my side when I shot it.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you just talk about the game you had today and to be able to
step up and score that many points that many clutch situations and also the
free throws down the stretch.  
RION BROWN: It was very exciting out there. I had a blast. I really thank my
teammates because without them penetrating and kicking it out, I definitely
wouldn't have been able to get those shots.  
And they have to respect Shane and Durand on those drives. And they did a
great job of finding me. And on the free throws, the only thing I thought
about was just Sweet 16, don't want to end this for those seniors. And I just
wanted to knock it down for those guys.  
  
Q. For Shane and Kenny, did y'all talk any amongst yourselves about the fact
that Florida and Florida Gulf Coast are going, you all wanted to be the third
Florida team to get to the Sweet 16.  
KENNY KADJI: Well in the game we didn't have any idea that they were going to
the Sweet 16, so we focused on the game. I think we were just talking about it
just before coming here and it's great to have that many Florida teams in the
Sweet 16. It shows that we have a great basketball state.  
SHANE LARKIN: We were just talking about it walking over here. It's great. The
state of Florida has great basketball teams. Florida Gulf Coast was a team we
played early in the season and they beat us. And a lot of people gave us grief
for that. But now it's just showing that they're a great team and for
everybody who said that we weren't a great team because they beat us they're
showing how great of a team they are.  
So just for us, Florida and Florida Gulf Coast to be in the Sweet 16 is a
great feeling and it just proves that Florida has great basketball teams just
like everybody else in the country.  
  
Q. Kenny, did you knock that ball out of bound at the end or did the
officials make the right call?  
KENNY KADJI: I mean I don't know. It was so many hands, you know, I don't know
who touched it last. I just tried to make a play on the ball and everybody was
getting out there and there was a couple hands. So I really don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, we'll let you go and take questions for Coach
Larranaga now.  
  
Q. Just expanding on what was asked earlier I think it's the first time in
history that three teams from the state of Florida in the Sweet 16. Just what
does that say about basketball in the state and the programs that have
developed there?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well I think you have three very different situations. Billy
Donovan has been at Florida now a dozen years, he's done a fantastic job. He's
got a very strong foundation. He's won a couple of national titles and
continues to recruit great players.  
In the infield on the other hand, this is only their second year of competing
at this level and he's done a fantastic job of bringing in players that many
of them I thought went under the radar screen.  
Because when we played them early in the season and they beat us at their
place, our players left there with a great deal of respect for them. They
played a great game, their players are tough and hard nosed and Andy and his
staff have done a great job.  
At Miami, we had a lot of pieces in place and then by adding Shane Larkin and
to Tonye Jekiri kind of gave us all the ingredients we needed to go on a run
this year. And we're very, very happy for this senior class as to how well
they have been able to play winning the regular season, ACC title, winning the
tournament championship and now earning the right to play in the Sweet 16.  
So for the state of Florida, as Shane said, there's not only a lot of good
college basketball being played in the state, but a lot of good high school
basketball being played in the state.  
Shane is from Orlando, Kenny played at IMG, and a lot of the players at both
those other schools are also in state players.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Shane again. I know we asked about him after
every game, but can you talk about what he did out there at that moment to be
able to make that shot.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, there are a number of things that build‑up to that
moment. As I said in my opening statement, Illinois played great defense on
our guards. And what ended up happening is Shane and Durand kept finding Rion
Brown. And Rion had the great game. So now towards the end of the game they're
not going to leave Rion. And now it's up to Shane or Durand to make a
decision.  
They went to the basket both of them did. Shane got one of his shots blocked.
So I think that as I've told you this a number of times, he has such a high
basketball IQ and I have the utmost confidence in him to make decisions and
choose the play that he wants to run. And whether he makes the decision to
shoot or pass, he's always right.  
Now doesn't mean we always score, but it's a decision that afterwards I think
to myself, you know, that was a great choice. And tonight, as he said, he
drove a little bit, seeing if he could get by the man. And when his man was
able to shut off the drive, he backed up and buried a three like he did
against Carolina late in that game and he has a lot of confidence in his
ability to shoot that shot and we have the utmost confidence in him.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach, we'll let you go.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 23, 2013

  

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Rodney Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23370)

  
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the student‑athletes now.  
  
Q. For Dre and Austin, talk about, there's a theory going around out there
that now that the Big ‑10 teams are not playing against Big‑10 defenses,
everybody's lighting it up. You guys did it last night. Michigan did it today.
Is there any truth to that? Do you think that's possible?   
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, it's some truth to that. Big‑10 is the best conference in
the nation and some of the best defense in the nation. We're playing against
Big‑10 teams night in and night out and it wears on you. People know your
tendencies, they know when you're good at, and the scouts are really good.  
So it's a difference playing against non‑conference teams, because we get a
different feel and the opponents aren't as well knowledgeable about what we're
doing. So that's a big key.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I think that Dre pretty much summed it up. It's a real grind
in conference play when you're playing against all those Big‑10 teams and you
know everyone's out to get you. At any given night, anyone can come in and win
a game.  
So playing against defenses, we see ourselves as a good defensive team. So
when teams go up against us, we're going up against other teams, some of the
best defensive teams in the country are in there. So it's nice getting out of
conference play and being able to play against schools out of the other
conferences.  
  
Q. Andre, what do you see from Scottie Wilbekin and just his tenacity on
defense and what makes him tough to go against?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: He's a quick defender, he keeps his hands active, he moves his
feet well. He's a solid PG. I have to contain him and I have to protect the
ball like any other game.  
  
Q. What are your, what's your game? What's the way that you want to, your
ideal way of playing?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Just let my teammates get in the flow first of all, kind of
feeding off them, trying to make sure I'm playing well defensively to start
off, because then they feed off to my offensive game and not trying to force
too much, trying to penetrate the gaps, find open teammates, get the offense
ran, push the ball up the floor.  
  
Q. For Rodney, this is a team that appears to do the physical things very
well. Your team has all season. Just how much is that emphasized in practice
and from your coach?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: I'm sure coach is going to emphasize that a lot. The Big‑10's
a really physical conference and we, it's not something that we're not used
to. So we're going to go out there and play just like any other team that we
played in the Big‑10\.  
  
Q. Andre, talk about the matchup with Scottie Wilbekin. He seems to live for
defense. Have you played against other guys like that and what do you, how do
you approach those kind of challenges?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, I played against one of the best defensive guards in
Aaron Craft. Just going up against him, you have to be a little bit more
decisive of with your moves and how you're going to attack, because they're
really good defenders, they move their feet well, just be a little bit more
secure with the ball. I think that works well with me, so I can, so I won't
make any careless turnovers, like I do sometimes.  
  
Q. For Andre and Austin, did you guys know each other coming up and how is
it just coincidence you both wound up at Minnesota and do y'all still get
confused as brothers?  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: Coming up we were familiar with each other in high school. We
knew each other just from playing against each other. We were in the same
conference for a few years and then our last, my last year they were in a
different conference. But that's how we knew each other.  
People still get us confused as brothers. Occasionally, but we're used to it
by now. We're like brothers because this is like a brotherhood with the team
and basketball and everything.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Oh, yeah, going off what he said, we were familiar with each
other. After one game our parents met, they were trying to figure out what the
other Hollins was, because we wore the same number in high school and in the
box score it was for Germantown it will show up, A. Hollins, 20 and then for
White Station, A. Hollins, 20. That was a weird coincidence.  
We found out that we're not related. We came here, he was one of the deciding
factors from me coming here. He was my host when I came. So from his advice,
you know, we're real tight to this day.  
  
Q. Andre, has Tubby shared any stories about his especially pick battles
with Billy in the SEC?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: No, he hasn't shared any stories with us with him, I guess. Not
yet. I guess we'll wait to see. It might come up in practice or something like
that.  
  
Q. For all three, saw a few tweets that coach had asked Mack Brown to stop
by your practice maybe say a few words to you guys. I was just wondering what
that was like. What you took away from that.  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: When Coach Brown came and talked to us he was basically just
telling us to enjoy the moment and telling us how good of a coach we have and
how good of a team we have and just to go out there and just to play our game.
The season didn't end as well as we wanted it to and we all know that. So he
just was just giving us positive words so we can go out there and execute and
just go out there and have fun.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, the main thing I took away from it was to seize the
moment, take care of business, kick some butt, and it's the time of the year
that live for as a player.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: Yeah, they touched on most of the points, but, yeah, he was
just telling us to seize the moment. And he talked about all the teams that
are sitting at home wishing that they were in our shoes right now. So we know
we got to make the most of this opportunity that we have at hand. And we need
to take care of business.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen. Thank you. We're going to let you go. We'll
take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH SMITH: First, it's good to be back here today. It's the best thing about
being here and being in Austin, what a great city. The hospitality's been
wonderful, certainly every time you participate in one of these events,
especially the NCAA tournament, it's first class. So we're just glad to be a
part of it. We know we had a ‑‑ it was a good win for us, against a very good
team, against a very good program at UCLA. Ben Howland's teams are always well
coached and we got on a little run there and did a good job.  
So we're happy with the win and happy to be still in the tournament, competing
against another very good program and a good friend, Billy Donovan.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. When you left Kentucky six years ago did you think you had seen the last
of Billy on the other sideline and secondly, in this tournament, nobody's
familiar with each other, you guys at least have some familiarity. Do you
think that could be part of the preparation that you do to kind of know each
other?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, I think so. We have gone back way when Billy first got into
college coaching as a graduate assistant at Kentucky and we have had our
battles when I was at Kentucky and at Georgia. So, yeah, but I'm happy to be
here facing him again in this type of a venue versus any other. So we play‑‑ I
think we try to coach and try to teach and play a style similar. He's got some
outstanding players and what Billy's been able to do, what he's done at
Florida has just been outstanding. Florida's a program that really wasn't
noted for its basketball and he's taken it to unbelievable heights. So I
certainly want to compliment him and his team on their 27 wins. Doing the
things they have done in the SEC, winning championships. So, yeah, I know he's
the Dean, so he's getting older now, of that conference. It's something to be
said when you're ‑‑ because Billy got involved in coaching I think at a very
early age and was very fortunate, I'm sure he'll say the same thing, and he
has done an unbelievable job in coaching and growing that program.  
  
Q. Did you ever think you would see him again or go up against him down the
road?  
COACH SMITH: Oh, yeah, I'm glad we are. At some point in time if you're going
up against him, you know your team has probably risen to that level of good
play. Because his teams are here on a regular basis.  
  
Q. Speaking with your players, almost to a man they say it's a breath of
fresh air to get out of the Big ‑10 and into the NCAA. Not just because of the
rough finish, but because offensively it gives them a little bit more of a
chance to get into transition offense, a little bit more flow which they
believe suits your offense the best. Do you agree with those statements?   
COACH SMITH: Whatever they say.  
(Laughter.)  
They're always right. They have never been wrong. I'm the only one wrong.  
I can see their point. We have kind of built this team to be that way, to be
an up tempo, running team and pressing team. Unfortunately, when you play
against teams that have as good or better players, you can't really force your
will on them like you can on some teams that want to play the style you want
to play.  
So if that helps them play better and motivates them to play better, yes,
they're right.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Can you talk about the evolution you see in the way Billy coaches, and
the gap since you guys went against each other in the SEC. And particularly is
it surprising that he has a team that is built more around its defense than
its offense?  
COACH SMITH: His teams always play good defense. I don't know, you can't win
consistently without playing outstanding defense. I think he plays multiple
defenses and presses and forces turnovers.  
I think one thing I'm impressed with this team that he has now, is their
ability to force tempo, turn you over, push it in the open court, shoot the
three. We're really going to have our hands full trying to defend them. But
that's the biggest concern I have is just their defense. Because they will
press you, speed you up, and we have a propensity to cough the ball up, so we
really need to concentrate on taking care of the ball.  
But his teams always defend well. I know when he had some of his great teams
that won championships, they were great defensive teams. This team is pretty
good also. You don't win 27 games not playing defense.  
  
Q. Your team is a team that obviously rebounds the basketball very well. How
much have you instilled that toughness during the course of the season and how
much does Mbakwe particularly factor into that?  
COACH SMITH: Well I think he had about 12 rebounds last night. But our point
guard had eight. So that's a good thing. We really ‑‑ we kind of have been a
good rebounding team, but we sometimes we rebound, sometimes we don't. Yeah,
we work pretty hard on rebounding. I'm sure that Billy does too. His teams,
they rebound the ball well also.  
I think that we have, especially last night, we got good production from
Elliott Eliason and Mo Walker inside, so that was a big help from a rebounding
standpoint. But we did give up quite a few second shots and that's a real
concern, especially playing a team like Florida. They're very athletic, very
quick to the ball, so we have got to really work extremely hard to box them
out, especially if we're in a zone or a man‑to‑man, because they, they're
pretty aggressive going to the basket. And we are too.  
That's something we do well, probably because we don't shoot the ball well. We
have to go get the second shot, there's a lot more second shots for us. Last
night there weren't that many, thank goodness. So that when you shoot over 50
percent it helps that you don't have to rebound the ball as well offensively.
But that's something that we have developed over the years, especially over
this year, and we have been pretty good at it.  
  
Q. Coach, I was looking through just the game points from Andre, Austin and
Joe Coleman. And while they each have had their games and their moments
throughout the season, it's actually been kind of rare for all three of them
to all go off on the same night. Which they did last night. But does that just
remind you how dangerous you can be when all three of them are clicking at the
same time and has it frustrated you that they can't all get together a lot
before this?  
COACH SMITH: Well it's basketball. I don't think anybody, whether it's Lebron
James, whether it's Chris Bosh. I just watched a game the other night, I think
he had two points in the last two minutes of the game. It's basketball.
Somebody's going to have to pick it up and thank goodness they were able to
click last night.  
But a lot of it has to do with the matchups and who you're playing against and
what opposing teams are trying to take away from you. And then that's when you
have‑‑ that's when the other guy steps up and hopefully he carries the load
when the opposing team ‑‑ it's called options, you know, you got options.  
Andre's not scoring because he's probably got somebody, maybe the defender is
in his face, and the coach has said, hey, don't let him catch the ball and let
him score. Whereas with a guy like Joe, they might say hey, playoff of him.  
So it's a scouting thing, it's a game to game, it's a matchup situation,
that's why you see ‑‑ I would love to have all 10 guys all doing the same
thing, playing just the way we taught them to play and scoring double digits
every timeout. But I know that's part of the game.  
But I was very pleased that when they do get out in transition, where we're
most effective, where we're effective last night, and Joe was‑‑ even though he
struggled early, he got back in the game and really became more aggressive.
And that was because UCLA started to change and started to switch some, so he
caught some mismatches and he got out in transition and got some easy baskets.  
  
Q. Any particular time when they are all clicking like that, does it keep
the defense honest and keep them from just going after one guy?  
COACH SMITH: Oh, yeah, we would win every game if they would play like that
and if people didn't take things away from them, we could probably, we would
probably be undefeated right now. But, unfortunately ‑‑ so that's ‑‑ I don't
know if it's frustration, it's just us finding that next person, player, that
can pick up those pieces and be effective.  
  
Q. You guys stuck with that high pressure zone defense yesterday. Do you see
that, can that work against a team like Florida?  
COACH SMITH: High pressure?  
  
Q. The zone defense. You stuck with that for most of the game against UCLA
yesterday. Could that work against a team like Florida?  
COACH SMITH: Well they're a pretty good 3‑point shooting team. And UCLA didn't
make, you know‑‑ they were off on their 3‑point shooting last night. So I
don't think you can give Florida a steady diet of anything defensively. We got
to change it up, try to keep them off balance as best we can.  
So we'll try to mix it up in some form or fashion. And the zone will probably
be a part of it.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Scottie Wilbekin as a defender?  
COACH SMITH: Scottie is‑‑ I'm just impressed with his all around game. He does
some good things. Scottie's a guy that really, I wasn't really, I haven't had
a chance to watch them play much, but he's a pretty crafty guard that can
really deliver passes to people, he can stretch the defense with his ability
to shoot the ball, and again, he's shooting for a very good percentage.  
I don't know, we have got to find a way to contain him as best we can. But I'm
very impressed with his ability to defend as well. He reminds me, he's got a
little bit of Aaron Craft in him, from Ohio State, that he really takes a lot
of pride in his defense.  
  
Q. Couple of your players talked and tweeted about the fact that Mack Brown
spoke to them at a practice, I was curious, how far do you go back with Mack
and how did that come about?  
COACH SMITH: Well, coming to Austin, I've known Rick Barnes for a long time
and Rick and I talk often, he extended the courtesy of, anything you need
while you're in Austin, Tubby, let me know.  
So then he said, you know, Mack Brown? I said, yeah, we have been knowing each
other for some time. I think we were involved with interviewing for a job
years ago at the same time. Not football for me, him not basketball. And so
since that time I've kind of watched and had a lot of respect for what he's
done since his North Carolina days and here.  
And then he's from Cookeville, Tennessee, where a good friend of mine, Mike
Sutton, coaches and knows him, knows his brother extremely well. So I've had a
chance to know him.  
So in the business, in the coaching fraternity, you kind of, people that are
successful, you know, he's a highly successful coach, and I thought his visit
was very inspirational for me and I think the players were very pleased or
very happy and very, how do I say it? Very thoughtful. Thoughtful words that
he had for our players were well placed and very interesting. And I'm grateful
that he did that. Because I think it was a big help. Just talking about what
coaching is about, what we mean to them, what the profession, what coaching
means to us and to him.  
So it was good, I'm sure it was good for our players to hear another voice,
another person, another coach in the profession, in a different, in football,
saying things like that.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH SMITH: Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the student‑athletes of
Illinois. Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. This one is for Brandon, you're from the far north suburbs so you're
pretty familiar with the Chicago area, you've got four guys from the Chicago
area that are sophomores, the Athletic Director has been aggressive promoting
the program in Chicago. Tell me how much it means each tournament win and the
more visibility, how much that means for your family and friends and the
family and friends of the Chicago guys back home.  
BRANDON PAUL: I think it means a lot. Especially as a kid growing up you
always want to play for your home state team. As a recruit, that's what I
loved seeing about Illinois, they recruited inside the state a lot.  
For the younger guys it just shows that they get a lot more, I guess, press
and it gives hope for other hoopers growing up, thinking that they can make
their dreams come true. So I think the personality of Coach Groce as well as
Mike Thomas, it's really good for the program.  
  
Q. Brandon, the last two games you've been guarded by Victor Oladipo and
Andre Roberson. You're not really catching a break tomorrow when you're going
to see Durand Scott ACC Player of the Year. What have you seen from him on
film?  
BRANDON PAUL: He's a good player. Solid on both ends of the floor. He knows
how to put the ball in the basket, obviously he's a great defender, playing on
a great team that has had a lot of success this year. But I've played against
tough defenders my whole life and these are the moments you get up for as a
top player.  
  
Q. Guys, this is for Tyler, I wonder if you could speak to the challenge
that Miami's big inside game will post for you and also for your team.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: They got a lot of big talented guys down there. We have to keep
on the glass, it's like Brandon said, it's nothing we haven't seen before
going through the Big‑10\. We have gone against bigger and stronger guys all
year, so but we look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. D.J. and Brandon, what do you remember maybe about your first
conversations with Coach Groce when he first got champagne your first
impressions that you made you think that this guy might be really the right
guy for the job.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Before we heard he was our new coach, just looking at his
background, just how much he's achieved throughout his career as a coach.
Taking a team like Ohio to the Sweet 16, when he first got there, our
impression was like we all trusted him and what he had to say. His standards
for our team was high quality and I think we all followed that throughout the
year. I think that we helped him and he helped us get to the predicament and
the place we are at right now.  
BRANDON PAUL: I was really impressed by the way he opened up to us players. He
had individual meetings with everyone. He was genuinely interested in what we
had to say. He wasn't just doing because this is his new job and what's what
he had to do.  
But he wanted to know about us, not only as players, he wanted to know our
backgrounds, our friends, our family growing up. So that really impressed me.
It gave me the type of confidence in him that continues to grow to this day.  
  
Q. Sam, I'm going to ask the question about Florida that Paul asked Brandon
about Chicago. You got two teams from Florida in this building today. You're
from Florida. Did you ever think about playing there? Did you dream of those
schools? Do you have a chip on your shoulder about tomorrow's game because of
that?  
SAM MCLAURIN: Actually, I'm from Tallahassee and when you're from Florida
you're either a Hurricane, a Gator or a Seminole and I'm a Seminole, so, no, I
never thought about playing for those guys.  
  
Q. For Brandon and D.J., you guys obviously are seniors trying to make
something special and it's been awhile since you've been to the Sweet 16.
You're playing a team, Miami, that's full of seniors, also a number two seed.
I'm assuming that based on what you guys want to accomplish and based on what
you guys have done, with some of your earlier wins, you're not intimidated
because of their seniors and they're number two.  
BRANDON PAUL: We're not intimidated by anyone. We have been through a lot of
games this season. We played top teams. Obviously with we went into a hostile
crowd out in Gonzaga, played against Indiana twice this year, played against
Michigan twice this year, basically the whole Big‑10\. This is just another
challenge for us.  
Obviously Miami's a great team, they have had a lot of success this year, and
their guys have great leadership. They have a lot of seniors like we do, a
little bit older than us, but at the same time we have been through a lot and
I think our position in the Big‑10 has put us in this position right now to
continue to be successful. But it's not going to come easy and we're going to
look to battle tomorrow.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: I think that Brandon basically hit all the points. We have
been through a lot of different situations throughout our whole careers, all
our seniors played in tough games, played a lot of minutes for our school. Sam
played a lot of minutes for his school playing some tough games.  
It should be a tough matchup. We have five seniors as well and Joseph Bertrand
is another guy that's, he's a red shirt junior and he's experienced as well.  
  
Q. When you went back and looked at the tape from yesterday, what went wrong
during the drought?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: We really didn't ‑‑ we just talked about the game a little
bit. The NCAAs, it's about advancing. We went through a couple of things about
the game yesterday, but our main focus now is on Miami. They made a run
yesterday, but now we have advanced. And the main goal was to find a way to be
better than Colorado and that's what we did yesterday.  
  
Q. Tyler, you guys have played some big teams in the Big ‑10, but few have
as many bigs. They have four or five guys that are pretty burly. Do you and
Egwu, do you make a concerted effort to hit the glass harder knowing there's a
lot more beef this time around.   
TYLER GRIFFEY: We always make a concentrated effort to hit the glass and go to
the offensive glass as well. Coach talks about getting 68 percent of defensive
rebounds back. That's a goal that we have set for every game. We definitely
try to achieve that.  
But they got some bigs guys. Julian Gamble, Reggie Johnson, Kenny Kadji, we're
going to have our work cut out for us as well. But we look forward to the
challenge.  
  
Q. For Sam and Tyler, has there been anything throughout the year that you
have seen, the way Coach Groce goes about day ‑to‑day work or preparing for
games that's been particularly different or interesting for you guys to see?
  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Everything he does is at a high level energy wise. He's a ball
of energy. He gets his coffee, he drinks two or three cups a day. But no,
everything he does is, he's so focused, so energized and so enthusiastic about
his job and about helping us succeed.  
SAM MCLAURIN: I think not only with the energy that he brings every day, but
he is really high on us paying attention to details. When we're not executing
details and it shows up on film, he gets on each and every one of us about it.
And he just tells us how much that is, how important that is for us to get
where we want to be.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, thank you for coming in. We'll let you go.
We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH GROCE: Obviously we're excited to have the opportunity to play in the
round of 32 and our guys have worked really hard to get to this point. Playing
a great Miami team tomorrow. You don't win the ACC championship or the
tournament championship unless you've done a lot of things right. Obviously
they're well coached, they have got great size, great depth, good guard play,
they shoot the ball well, they're very good defensively, very solid.  
So it's going to be a great challenge for us tomorrow. But our guys are
excited about it, to have the opportunity to still be playing in March and
being in the NCAA tournament. Then the round of 32 is something that those
guys will always have with them that they will always be able to take with
them. Step one was getting in the tournament, step two is trying to survive
and advance. We were able to do that in the second round and now here we head
to the third round and the goal's the same, to try to find a way to be a
little bit better and score a few more points tomorrow than Miami. It will be
a great challenge, but one we're looking forward to.  
  
Q. First you've seen Miami on film now. Firstly, how much coffee have you
had over the last 24 hours and secondly, what are their bigs presenting for
you as a challenge?  
COACH GROCE: Well I stuck with my two cups. Okay. So that's my deal. I have a
deal with my wife. A few years ago when we were in the tournament I drank a
couple pots. So I've tried to curtail it back. Second question, haven't had a
chance to watch a lot of them since our game yesterday and really impressed. I
just mentioned a lot of it at the outset here with our initial comments. But
their guard play, Larkin makes everybody better. I think that Larkin and Scott
are really good defensively. The three man does a great job of playing off of
people and getting shots and is a really good 3‑point shooter. They're a good
3‑point shooting team, they have the ability to drive the ball to the paint,
they post the ball, they're great on the glass, they have good size, they have
good depth, and you can tell they're very confident. As they should be.  
And he's done a great job with them. They're an older team, some of their guys
are fifth year and I think in one case even a sixth year guy. So they're an
older team, which I'm sure he would tell you probably played to their
advantage all season long. I always said I think experience is a great
teacher. So we have got our hands full. But one that our guys are excited
about.  
  
Q. How similar are Larkin and Trey Burke?  
COACH GROCE: Well I think there's some similarities and primarily and I'll
keep it simple, in two regards: One is the fact that both of them can score.
They have the capability of scoring the basketball at different levels.
Whether it's the 3‑point shot, the mid range shot, or getting to the rim. When
you do foul them, both of them make free throws. They're very well rounded
scoring players.  
The second part that I think that makes them similar, as indicative of his
stat line, Larkin's stat line yesterday when he had eight or nine assists, I
don't have it in front of me, is that they have the ability to make guys
better around them with the pass. They see things, they can make their team
better, they make their teammates better. So I think in those two ways they're
certainly similar.  
  
Q. Brandon was in here, he was talking about how impressed he was when you
first got there taking the time to get to know each player individually. What
types of things did you ask them when you met with them and how does that help
you as a coach, especially getting to know a new team?  
COACH GROCE: Well it was really important. I said all along I think it's
difficult, there's different ways to skin a cat, but for me I've always felt
like to coach our players I have to know them. I just talked about it with the
gentleman in the back. Whether what motivates each guy, how do they learn
best, what drives them, what are their goals, what are their ‑‑ we all have
them ‑‑ insecurities, what are their homes, what are their dreams, where are
their minds at, where are they at academically, do they have a girlfriend,
what's their dog's name, cat's name. Where do you live? Just all those ‑‑
brothers, sisters, names, mom, dad, all those different things, family
situation, background, just in terms of trying to learn as much as you can
about them. I think it's in my experience in coaching, we care a lot about our
guys.  
Our assistant coaches do an unbelievable job, they do, they deserve a lot of
credit. In terms of getting to know our players as well. But I've always said
if they feel that it's very genuine and you know that you care about them as
people first, and students second, and then athletes third, then they usually
run through a wall for you. And these guys have done that. I'm grateful for
that. They were very open minded.  
So one thing I remember about those meetings, and as our relationship has
grown from it's basically been a year, last March until now, it's been pretty
cool. I have enjoyed getting to know each and everyone of them and those guys
are a part of our family, my wife would tell you that. And they will always be
a part of our family. They have done a great job in terms of being open minded
and I think it's a big reason why we have been able to have some success.  
  
Q. With all the Chicago guys on your roster, the history of the recruiting
pipeline to the public league, especially Simeon, the aggressive efforts by
the AD to market to Chicago, how much does each tournament win here mean for
Chicago and that area?  
COACH GROCE: Well I think it means a lot for Illinois. It means, obviously a
lot for our alums and all the Illini Nation and Chicago's a huge part of that.
That's our largest alumni base or network of people. A lot of alums up there.
I think it certainly helps, I think that I've always said success breeds
success. I think that it gives credibility for sure.  
We still have a long way to go. We haven't arrived by any means, but the one
thing I ‑‑ and you mentioned our athletic director and just our whole
administration. We understand the importance of our state and of Chicago and I
know he's working very diligently, our staff is as well, we're all doing our
part, to connect. And I think that's the most important thing.  
Every day I get up, I love going to work because every person that I come in
contact with at the University of Illinois that's around our program wants to
get better every day. And I think that's the type of organization that you
want to be in. Certainly our push in that area is one of those areas where
we're attacking aggressively.  
  
Q. What did you see from the film study of Miami's perimeter defense?  
COACH GROCE: I think that Larkin and Scott are terrific on defense. I think
that their size allows those guys to even be more aggressive at times because
you're funneling into bigs and a lot of depth up front.  
I think they're very, very sound. I think those two guys are really, really
good on ball defenders and they get contributions from other guys too. But
there's no question that they stand out in terms of their ability, especially
to guard the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, Larkin and Durand Scott get most of the headlines and most of the
stats. What do the big guys do that doesn't show up on the score sheet that
concerns another coach?  
COACH GROCE: Just their size. Their ability to rebound. Offensive rebound,
defensive rebound, their ability to play the post with their size. I think
those guys screen well. They do a good job of getting deep position and for
the most part scoring around the basket well. I think they bring a lot to
their team. And then there's‑‑ they come off the bench with even more size. So
I think their depth up front is also really a strength for them.  
  
Q. Seems like any time you ask anybody about Nnanna Egwu the first thing
they say is how hard he works. I'm wondering what you've seen from him in
terms of his dedication, for his development, and the progress he's made this
season.  
COACH GROCE: Well he's made a ton of progress. I think that even my hope is
this time next year we see even another leap. I don't see any reason why ‑‑
he's only been playing the game for about six years now. Six plus years. He's
going to continue to get stronger, his work ethic is off the charts.  
You're exactly right when you say Nnanna Egwu, one of the first things that
comes to mind for me is his work ethic and how hard he works. He works every
day. His character is exceptional. He's going to do whatever you ask him to do
and then some. And I really appreciate that about Nnanna. He cares about the
university of Illinois, it means something to him that he's from Chicago,
plays at the state school, takes a lot of pride in that.  
So he's got a lot of great attributes and I think because of that you're going
to see him, not only has he got better this season I think you're going to
continue to see him get better.  
  
Q. All season these guys have kind of taken an us against the world approach
and tomorrow's probably another example of that, where not a lot of people
giving you much of a chance. But how much does that influence the way they
play and the way they compete?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I think it does some. It's only human nature I think when
you hear ‑‑ and you heard it going into yesterday's game. There wasn't a lot
of people that picked us yesterday either and those guys know that. I can
maybe assist them in not tweeting, but I can't stop them from reading social
media and watching TV and in their rooms and in their hotel rooms. I mean they
know. I think pride takes over a little bit. We got a lot of proud guys in our
locker room. A lot of competitive guys. I'm sure that they're looking forward
to the challenge tomorrow.  
But you're right, they have been in so many situations where their backs have
been against the wall and no one gave them a chance from the beginning,
really, until now.  
So they're used to that. I think it drives them a little bit. I think if
you're a competitor then certainly it does that.  
  
Q. I understand you and your staff keep track of a pretty vast array of
statistics. Can you just talk about your love of the numbers part of the game
and where that came from.  
COACH GROCE: Well, I don't think it tells you the entire story, obviously,
because you're talking about a team game. You're talking about a connection of
five players playing the game together out there and that's as or more
important.  
Having said that, I do think statistics can tell you a lot. We use them quite
a bit. Looking at a team's efficiency, both offensively and defensively.
Looking at individual player characteristics. I think all those things are
helpful. Especially on quick turn arounds.  
I remember how we used to scout back in the '90s when I started and guys
before that would even say I remember when they used to live scout. And it's
changed so much now. Everything's video. You can get information a lot more
rapidly. I think that's helpful certainly in tournament settings for sure.  
  
Q. To follow ‑up on that, does being a math teacher at all help for your
love of numbers?   
COACH GROCE: Yeah, I've always, obviously, I've always loved numbers. I was a
math teacher at one point and I think that's probably some of that. Being
around sports my whole life counting, I've got a seven year old son and he
plays his bracket out every day. So I went to his parent/teacher conference
last week and they told me that he was exceptional with numbers. So to say I
was proud would be an understatement.  
But, yeah, math, that's kind of our, our background a little bit and it's
carried over to Connor, which is good. But I do think you can learn a lot from
statistics and we certainly use those to our advantage.  
  
Q. Hearing you take about that, Coach Larranaga's also a total numbers
freak, number cruncher. He was an economics major in college. He uses all
those computer statistics and all that. I'm wondering, do you feel any kinship
with him also having been at a Mid Major and what he did with George Mason and
how much did you follow his career and what do you think about him as a
coach?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I followed his career a great deal. I think anyone that's
in the business knows Coach Larranaga and his story. He and I are nothing more
than acquaintances.  
Having said that, I don't happen to come from the same coaching tree that he
does, I come from a different one. I coached against his team in my first year
as head coach when he was at George Mason. We played on the road there at
George Mason. That was a tough environment. He did a great job during his
tenure there.  
I've always watched his teams. I've always admired his personality. You can
see that he really cares for his players. And you can tell that guys really
are attracted to that. So I have a lot of admiration for him.  
And then certainly I think his coaching speaks for itself and what he's done
at George Mason, what he's done with this crew. My assistant coach, Dustin
Ford, was a player at Ohio when he was coaching at Bowling Green. So there's
some familiarity there. But certainly have a lot of respect for him and what
he's done at each and every program that he has been a part of.  
  
Q. On that math question, being a math guy, do you pay any attention to the
bracketologies, RPI, strength of schedule, all those statistical things or is
that just a distraction?  
COACH GROCE: I let my sports information director do that all year. Just
because I felt like I can't tell our players to be locked in one game at a
time and control the controllables and then be unlike them. I think that would
have been hypocritical. So I don't do that.  
To be honest with you, I didn't pay attention to any of that or know what
those things really were until after we finished the Big‑10 tournament. Then
at that point in time we were done and that's when I started asking DB,
Derrick Burson, our media relations guy, some questions about it. But up until
that point, none at all.  
  
Q. This doesn't concern your matchup, but Minnesota is here and you faced
them. Obviously, they had the best rebounding differential in the Big ‑10\.
What is it that makes them so tough?   
COACH GROCE: Wow. Probably coach's disposition. His teams have always been
that way, if you follow them back, not only at his tenure at Minnesota, but at
Kentucky. They have been great at rebounding the ball.  
I don't know where they stand now. We were talking about numbers, but prior to
the game we played them in the Big‑10 tournament, they were No. 1 in the
nation in offensive rebounding percentage. No. 1 in the Big‑10 during Big‑10
games. Very physical, do a great job of rebounding the basketball. Obviously
you can't get better than being ranked number one in that area. So that's an
area of concern every time that we played them.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Miami student‑athletes. Open it up
for questions.  
  
Q. Guys, when you're practice was interrupted today, what were you
thinking?  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: We didn't really know whether to leave or not. Until one
of the security guards told us we had to evacuate the building. But then we
made the most out of it. Julian was out there rapping, we were just having
fun. Being brothers like we really are.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: It's an unexpected in any event, but you have to know that you
always have adversity, whether it be now have the court and you have to be
able to handle that. So I think it's a little bump in the road for us. And
just being able to make the most of it and have fun outside with your
teammates, like we always do.  
KENNY KADJI: Whatever they both said.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Considering how the so ‑called experts had you in the middle of the pack
in the ACC in the pre‑season, you go on to win the out right conference title,
to be one game away from the Sweet 16, which would be the first appearance for
Miami in more than 10 years, in the Sweet 16, what does that mean to this
program?   
KENNY KADJI: It means a lot. But we know that it's just another game. We have
to play against Illinois and they're a pretty good team. We don't want to look
ahead of them.  
Making it to the Sweet 16 would be great but we got a battle in front of us
and everyone will be ready for tomorrow first.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: We try not to think about the past too much. We have to worry
about the present and take care of the things we can control. Because we know
there are very little things in the grand scheme of things that we can
control.  
So just going out there and just playing the game, not getting caught up in
the hype and playing to the best of our ability and giving Illinois our best
punch.  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: We're a really confident team. We understand how deep we
are. All the players and coaches have a lot of confidence in each other. I
feel like that really helps us.  
  
Q. Illinois, what do you see from them? What makes them dangerous?  
JULIAN GAMBLE: They're a very good 3‑point shooting team. That's one of their
strengths. Along with that, they have a lot of experience. They have a lot of
seniors and red shirt juniors and they have very good coach as well. They're
very battle tested.  
Playing in a league like the Big‑10, they have been battle tested every night.
So we don't expect for them to be intimidated at all. We know we have a target
on our back and we know we have to play have to go out there and play our best
basketball.  
  
Q. Trey, can you talk about Illinois' defense and what sort of schemes
you're expecting from them?  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: At the end of practice just now we worked on their little
what was that?  
JULIAN GAMBLE: Zone.  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: Zone, trap, out of the sideline out of bounds. And other
than that, we pretty much just talked about them playing man‑to‑man and being
ready for them to play zone as well.  
  
Q. For Julian and Kenny, I know your guards get a lot of headlines and they
get the big stats, but you guys are very deep as far as big guys are
concerned. How do you set the tone in the trenches to make things easier for
your guards?  
JULIAN GAMBLE: First off, every headline and all the attention our guards are
getting is well deserved. They're all very hard working guys. As for us to be
able to really control the boards and just be physical with those guys and
really try and help our guards get open. They get so much attention
offensively and people try to attack them defensively, so also be able to just
help them and kind of take the load off their shoulders a little bit.  
KENNY KADJI: I think we got a pretty big team. We have four big men and we
want to control the paint all the time. We're worrying about foul trouble and
things like that. We know that Reggie and Tonye is coming off the bench and we
got guys who can come and play well. So we just want to control the paint and
be enforcers down there.  
Our guards are going to do a bunch of the scoring and controlling the game and
all we want to do is be physical and not let anybody come in the paint.  
  
Q. For everyone, you guys have a win over Michigan State already, given the
hype surrounding the Big ‑10 and you've already played a Big‑10 opponent, you
know what that's about. What can you kind of take from that game into this
one?   
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: I think what it really comes down to is us doing what we
do best and that's locking down defensively. I feel like if we play the Miami
defense and take away the 3‑point shot I think that we'll do great.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: I think that having played a team from the Big‑10 kind of gives
you a little bit of experience, but league‑wide they're just very tough. Teams
that are going to rebound and really test you defensively. Illinois' a team
that forces lot of turnovers, but they also foul a lot and in these games you
never know what's going to happen. So you have to really be strong with the
ball and not be able to turn the ball over and really handle their pressure.  
KENNY KADJI: The Big‑10 is a big conference, a physical conference and we know
that. We won against Michigan State this year, but we lost to Minnesota last
year by like 20. So we know that we have to come and be physical, played hard
down in the paint and expect to win too.  
  
Q. Julian, you're a rapper and Kenny, you're a dancer, Trey's kind of quiet
over here. How would you describe Trey?  
JULIAN GAMBLE: Trey is the cerebral assassin. He's the Swiss army knife.
Anything you ask of him he can do. And Trey can rap a little bit too. People
don't know that though. But I live with him, so that's confidential.  
KENNY KADJI: Trey does everything. Everything you ask for he gets on the court
and does it. I think that he's the same off the court. You can ask him
anything and he'll come and surprise you and do whatever you want him to do.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: Kenny is also not much of a dancer.  
KENNY KADJI: Yes I am.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: I'm a dancer, Zinger, rapper, anything you need, I got you.  
KENNY KADJI: They have videos of me dancing, so.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you if any of you guys ‑‑ did you guys get to watch
the Illinois game and what did you think when you watched the flows and weird
ebbs of that game?  
KENNY KADJI: A lot of scoring drought. They went on a run, and then for a
couple minutes they couldn't score and then they went on a run. So you never
know.  
They shoot a lot of threes, I think they shot 31 threes yesterday. So you
can't be surprised. They shoot the ball sometimes, they won't make any,
sometimes they make everything. So you got to be just keep playing your
defense and try to stop them.  
  
Q. For each of you, could you talk about when Coach Larranaga came in what
his approach was, what he's done to kind of get this thing turned around so
quickly with you guys.  
KENNY KADJI: I was very surprised. For a guy his age, he's so energized. He
came in and I think the first day we had individuals work out, strength and
conditioning coach and then we went and ran a mile the same day. So we were
exhausted.  
He knew that we had a pretty good team and we could do some great things and
he came and gave us a plan and he told us what to do to execute it. And that's
what we did.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: I think it was just a beginning it was a culture change. That's
something that he wanted to focus on, just changing the culture and what
people thought about Miami basketball. So really just getting back to the
fundamentals of the game and throughout the game having that toughness about
us, toughness that teams really remember us for. And then down the stretch
it's been being very poised and I think it's just kind of stuck so much better
because we have so many veterans and it's a lot easier for us to buy into what
he's saying, because we just want to win.  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: He wouldn't have left a good George Mason team if he
didn't have, didn't think we had a lot of potential. And when he came in, he
knew how to relate to us on and off the court. And I feel like that's why we
have been so successful.  
  
Q. Seems pretty clear you guys aren't just teammates you're also friends.
Talk about how that's important and how that's helped you support each other
during this run.  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: You hear it so often that teams are a tight knit family,
but I can honestly say that Julian's my roommate, I knew about Kenny before I
even got here. So we are really all like brothers and we have fun on and off
the court and when we're having fun on the court, I think that's when we're
really tough to beat.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: I think it just kind of speaks to the bond that you have and
how that off the court bond really translates to on the court. If you think
about how much we really have each other's back and even when a guy makes a
mistake to really be there and pick him up or all just cheering for each other
the same way. We want to, we want each other to be equally successful and it
all comes from team success. So I think that on the court and off the court
bond that we share really helps us out and it shows how much we love to be
around each others. Not only the players, but the coaching staff as well, that
we love each other very much?  
KENNY KADJI: And I also think that we can relate to each other. There's a lot
of five year, six year seniors on this team. Guys who have been through a lot.
I played Trey when I was at Florida, I mean I knew Durand Scott, knew a couple
guys on the team and I just think that we have been through so much that we
could relate to each other. We knew what we had to do to be successful and we
wanted to win.  
  
Q. For Trey and for Julian, I know you guys are focused on the next game,
but the whole country seems to have discovered another one of the schools in
your state in the last 24 hours in Florida Gulf Coast. I know that you guys
were familiar with them long before any of us were, what can you tell us about
those guys and were you surprised to see the upset yesterday?  
TREY MCKINNEY JONES: I wasn't surprised, just because of how they put it on us
early in the season. They're a great team and as you saw yesterday they're
very confident. They weren't ready to back down at all. And they put the pedal
to the metal and they didn't stop.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: They're a little bit similar to us in that they play with a
chip on their shoulder even when we played them at their police they played
with a chip on their shoulder. Actually one of their players on the team, Eric
McKnight, I grew up with in North Carolina as well, so I kind of know the type
of person that he is and the struggles that he's gone through to be able to
get to that moment.  
So I wasn't surprised at all. They just went out there and played basketball.
It just goes to show in these tournaments you have to come in and play and
seeding doesn't matter and you can't go into these games and take any of these
teams for granted.  
KENNY KADJI: I just know that everybody on our team picked them to win that
game. We knew how Florida Gulf Coast was and they're a pretty good team and
the way they played against us at their place was unbelievable. Everybody was
saying we didn't have Durand Scott back, I knew that that was not a fluke and
they were a pretty good team. So, you know, just good job to them. I think
that they will go far in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, we'll let you go. Thank you for your time.
We'll take questions for coach after his opening statement.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well we have had a lot of firsts this year and today we had
another first. We arrived here for our practice time and the fire alarm went
off and we had to be escorted out of the building for about 20 minutes to a
half hour.  
But the neat part about our Miami players is they kept everything in stride
and had a good time outside, just hanging out with each other and talking and
getting ready. Kind of following the ticker to see who was playing and who was
playing well and who was winning.  
But we had a very good practice and getting ready to play a very fine Illinois
team that shoots a ton of threes.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You just mentioned that they shoot a lot of threes. How does this affect
your big guys having to close out? There are going to be times when they're
not going to be able to pack it into the lane, they're going to have to do a
little bit more than just play rebound defense?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Yeah, I think it's very challenging any time you play a team
like Illinois that shoots a lot of threes. It puts a lot of pressure on your
defense.  
You have got to be aware of who the 3‑point shooters are, whether you're a
guard or a big guy, it takes a team effort to defend those kinds of shots. Our
guards are very well aware of how good those players are for Illinois. And our
big guys are very well aware of their big guys. So we feel like we'll be well
prepared, we have got one more session tomorrow to review.  
  
Q. What do you take from Illinois when you watch a game like they had
yesterday when they the weird ebbs and flows of the game they had?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well I think the first thing is the confidence they show in
their 3‑point shooting ability. Because it's very easy for a 3‑point shooter
to get discourages if he misses a couple and quits shooting.  
But I believe their confidence kept them shooting the ball and eventually they
went back and hit a number of key 3‑pointers. And I think that when you are
committed to that style, it gives your players a lot of freedom and you've got
to play great defense for the entire game, because at any time you let up,
they could drain four or five threes in a row.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the chemistry and relationship that Larkin and Scott
have really developed, where it was and how it's reached this point.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, the first thing is they're both point guards. Durand
Scott, until Shane came, was really the starting point guard. And last year we
played those two guys a lot together because we felt like they were a great
combination, because one of the things that's a little bit rare is they both
are very committed to playing great defense. They're both highly competitive
at the defensive end of the floor, they both made the all ACC first team all
defense and Durand Scott was defensive Player of the Year.  
I think that they have tremendous respect for each other because of the effort
they put at the defensive end of the floor. But they're also very skilled
offensive players. They both can play the one, they both can play the two,
they both handle the ball very well, they both drive very well, they both can
shoot the three, and they're both big time free throw makers. So the
combination of having Shane and Durand in the back court is a luxury that I
think few coaches have. And we're very, very lucky to have both of them.  
  
Q. Obviously you have a senior group that's hooking forward to the
opportunity that they have got right now, but you look at Illinois, that's not
a team that looks like they're going to be intimidated of your number two seed
considering the teams they beat in Gonzaga and Indiana previously.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well I wouldn't think anybody's intimidated by anybody you
play. You won your way into this tournament and you won a lot of games prior
to the one you're going play tomorrow. So I would believe we both have mutual
respect for each other and know that we know they have got a lot of very good
players and we feel like we have got a lot of very good players and a good
team as well.  
  
Q. Several of your players talked about how when you came in you made it
clear that you weren't going to try to change the culture, but you also tried
to assimilate yourself a little bit and get to know them each individually.
Can you just talk about your approach when you came in, what you tried to do
and basically how you've kind of gotten it turned around to what seems so
quickly.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, we began the very first meeting, I told the players
about a book I read many many years ago, called the Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People. And how important it is to develop the right habits if you
want to be successful.  
And if we develop those right habits as a basketball team, we would enjoy more
success than they could possible imagine.  
And I wrote those seven habits on the board, explained to them what they
meant, and how they should embrace it. And as we begin practice each year, we
begin with an expression that's in the book, it's called, well the book is
written by Doctor Stephen Covey, and the quote is, begin with the end in mind.  
And what we were telling our players is, before you can be truly successful,
you got to dream it. You got to visualize it. You got see yourself being
successful. You got to know what it takes. You got to know what sacrifices you
have to make.  
But then every day in practice you got to live that dream. You got to prepare
yourself knowing that, hey, tomorrow in order for to us play great, we got to
prepare very well today.  
They embraced that philosophy and that attitude and we have been two years in
the making.  
  
Q. In 2006 obviously you had that great tournament run with George Mason.
John Groce at Ohio also became fairly known for taking a smaller program deep
into the tournament. How much does that experience help now that you're at a
bigger program?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I think that experience, good or bad, is something you
can look back on to help you make future decisions. So things that we did
poorly, we try to avoid. Things that we did well in the past, we try to
repeat.  
We try to explain to the players why we're doing this. And we do that through
a series of stories. So we have told our Miami players a lot of stories about
things we have done that worked, things that we did that didn't work so well,
and why we avoid doing certain things and why we repeat certain things over
and over again.  
So I think that experience is very important.  
  
Q. Illinois has a lot more fans in town than anyone else, quite a few more,
it seems. And I've spoken to a lot of Minnesota fans who are all going to get
behind Illinois as well. Is that a Big ‑10 type thing?   
COACH LARRANAGA: Tell them I said thanks. I got a brother who lives in
Minnesota, will that help?  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. So the question is, does this have the feel maybe like a road game for
you guys? Will you talk to the players about that at all and do you play any
differently on the road?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, last week in the ACC tournament we played in
Greensboro, North Carolina in the semi‑finals we played North Carolina State.
And I don't know how many seats are in the Greensboro Coliseum, but it was a
sea of red and like a pinch of orange. And then the next day we played at
North Carolina. There was a sea of Carolina blue, and a pinch of orange. What
I would say is the same thing I tell the players all the time, it's not who we
play, it's not where we play, it's how we play.  
And whether we're at home or on the road, we got to play well. We'll have to
play well tomorrow night if we want to move on. I think fans can be a
tremendous help, but I think that the most important thing is we have had
success on the road. We won those games in the ACC tournament. We're not going
to be uncomfortable in any environment.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier when you had the fire drill and the players went
out and just how they reacted and they talked about that in the locker room as
well, the close knit group that you have, the bond that they have, how much
has that played into the success that they have had this season?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think it's huge. We refer to it as chemistry, bonding, I
think it's very important that you like your teammates. That you get along
with them on and off the court. It makes it easier to get along with them on
the court if you're good friends off the court. Because you trust each other.
And trust is a major factor in being successful.  
I think these guys have developed that trust over a period of time and I also
think it's great to have great leadership. We have that in our senior class
and we also have that in a young man like Shane Larkin.  
  
Q. You talked about how your players reacted to the delay, how did you do? I
know sometimes coaches get a little uptight the day before a game. How did you
handle that break that you guys had?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I told the players before the tournament began that I
was going to have more fun than any other head coach and I wanted them to have
more fun than any other team. Nothing was going to bother me. There would be
no complaining, whatever happens, happens. We'll control the things we can
control and not worry about the things we can't.  
So I looked at that as, okay, our guys are out there having a good time with
each other, we'll get back to work as soon as we get cleared to go back into
the arena.  
  
Q. Following up on an earlier question that you said, have you ever noticed
a similar thing with the ACC teams and fans where they kind of back each other
like the Big ‑10 does? In previous tournaments?   
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I think that all leagues have a tremendous loyalty to
each other. And you like to see your league do well. It's about earning
respect and we're very, very proud of being members of the Atlantic Coast
Conference. We think we have got the best basketball league in the country and
I'm sure there are a lot of other leagues, including the Big‑10 that think
they have the best. So when we're watching an ACC team play against another
outside opponent, we cheer for the ACC team as well.  
  
Q. I know you played Florida Gulf Coast early on, what were your thoughts
about what they did last night?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, we played Florida Gulf Coast in November and after the
game everybody was appalled that an Atlantic Coast Conference team would lose
to a Florida Gulf Coast team. And first thing I told them is, hey, they played
great, they had the largest crowd in school history, they have got a very good
team, we didn't play that well that night.  
So watching them play yesterday was not a surprise to us, we know they're
very, very capable. They're a team that flies under the radar screen because
they're not on TV as much as other programs. But they got, they have a lot of
good players.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the student‑athletes of
Florida.  
  
Q. For all these guys, start with Patric, just what the transition is like
going from a team up ‑and‑down that you faced on Friday to facing a more
physical team and how important is rebounding going to be? Stopping them on
the boards.   
PATRIC YOUNG: Well, we're going to do a good job with scouting, make sure we
come ready and just and just as every game, it's important for to us rebound.  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Every game is going to be physical from this point out. We
got to do a good job of being ready and on every possession, box out and limit
their easy buckets.  
WILL YEGUETE: Got to make sure we do a good job rebounding. I think we've done
a good job in the second half of the game and we just got to keep it up and
box them out and make sure we take care of the ball.  
CASEY PRATHER: We got to make sure we come ready for the physical
confrontation up front and got to do great job on the board and block out and
limit them to one shot.  
  
Q. Scottie, talk about Hollins and the challenge that he's going to present,
he had 28 yesterday and has had the tendency to kind of go off in games. Had
41 against Memphis. What do you see specifically out of him?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Well, first of all, he's a great scorer and he can score in
a multitude of ways. So I really got to just be ready and I got count on my
guys to help me if I get beat. But I don't know, just be ready to contain him
and don't let him get any easy shots, always have a hand in his face.  
  
Q. Want to know about your embracing the defensive stopper role.  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, I guess I embrace it. I love playing defense and it
helps when you got guys that are beside me right now that love playing defense
as well. I just try to come out and play my hardest on defense.  
  
Q. Pat, can you talk about Mbakwe, what you see with him and how physical a
player he is.  
PATRIC YOUNG: From what I've seen, he's just a really high energy guy, he
plays hard, and he's a big part of their team.  
  
Q. Were any of you guys kind of familiar with Tubby Smith back in his days
in Kentucky and are you aware of kind of his status as far as him in the
coaching game?  
CASEY PRATHER: Yeah, he's definitely a great coach. I saw him earlier in my
career and I was just amazed at the things that he could do at Kentucky.  
  
Q. Scottie, where did that love for defense come from?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Probably back when I was playing AAU nine and under, ten and
under, my team, we just really pressed a lot. And I just loved getting steals.  
  
Q. For Pat, but you guys can address it too. What's it like having a bat
flying during practice and how much of a disruption was that?  
PATRIC YOUNG: Well, it didn't really bother me at all or bother coach at all
either. He was like, what did he say? "If you get bit, I'll pay for your
medical bills."  
(Laughter.)  
It was a little distracting, but we just kept doing what we were supposed to
do.  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: I kept focused.  
CASEY PRATHER: It was funny watching the guy's reaction to it. There was like
two of them at one point.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, we're going to let you go. Thank you.
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Donovan and then open it up to
questions.  
COACH DONOVAN: I think any time you can win in this tournament and advance
it's exciting. Excited about the opportunity to play against Minnesota. They
have ‑‑ obviously Tubby and I go back a long way, he's done a terrific job. A
lot of respect for their team. I know we have a great challenge in front of
us. But I think that all of us at Florida are excited about the opportunity to
be able to play again tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I know it's been a long time since you guys were all together, but what
would people see on the court from your team and Tubby's that maybe came from
your time with Pitino?  
COACH DONOVAN: I think that the one thing is probably trying to get players to
play together. Playing together, being a team, understanding that there's a
greater good when everybody's sacrificing together. I think you're always
going to see differences inside of teams as it relates to personnel, style of
play, what's the best way for your team to play.  
Tubby's always been a terrific defensive coach and really sound offensively.
But I think that probably all of us being together, I would hope that we would
say the one thing that we try to get our teams to do is just that. To
sacrifice for a greater goal, greater good, and to play together, to play
unselfishly, and to try to play the right way and do the right things.  
  
Q. Obviously Tubby left Kentucky six years ago, how much have you guys been
in contact since then and would you refer to that as kind of a friendly
rivalry even though it was a serious rivalry between Florida and Kentucky at
the time?  
COACH DONOVAN: Tubby and I have got a very good relationship. I love his
family. But I think the one thing for myself ‑‑ I'm sure Tubby feels the same
way‑‑ really all the time is the players are playing on the floor. They're
playing against each other. It's never really been about that.  
What I look at more than anything else, is who we're playing against and what
they do and what we have to do to try to be successful in the game. Even
though it's Tubby at the other end of the sideline I'm not watching him. I'm
watching the court and film, I'm not watching him, I'm watching what's going
on on the court. All I can say is Tubby is a terrific coach, he's done a great
job with his team. They're very talented, they're very gifted, they have got a
lot of experience, they have played in a very, very difficult conference,
they're a tough, hardened team and with all those things being said, I think
we all realize at Florida what a great challenge we have in front of us.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about Minnesota's rebounding ability and how you
matchup with them physically and how much of a concern that is?  
COACH DONOVAN: A great challenge. They really do a great job getting off the
glass. They're a terrific offensive and defensive rebounding team. Mbakwe is
as good as there is in the country. But they chase it. They go after it. They
do a really good job and this will be, again, not only a challenge for our
front court, but it will be a challenge for our team to collectively be able
to rebound the basketball. Because certainly their misses, they get a large
percentage of misses back. They are relentless in terms of going to the glass.  
  
Q. Billy, this looks like your best defensive team, at least statistically.
Where did that come from? Was that a concerted strategy this year or does it
just fit the players and the personnel you got?  
COACH DONOVAN: I think a couple things happened. I think going into this
season, one of the things I tried to do every year is try to create projects
for myself and our assistants of how can we get better. I think if you would
go back and look at last year, we were able to make a run in the NCAA
tournament because of the way we defended the 3‑point line during those three
or four games.  
If you go back and look at our conference in regular season stats from a year
ago, we gave up nearly 40 percent from the 3‑point line. And the first thing
that comes into question is why, what is the problem, what is going on. So we
broke down every single 3‑point shot that was made against us or even taken
against us, from the whole entire season last year and what was the reason
why.  
So some of it was positioning, some of it was lack of screening coverages,
guys being out of place, maybe not challenging hard enough. And then I do
think Erving Walker, at the point guard spot for us last year, being five foot
six, five foot seven, we played with a much smaller point guard for three
years. And as great as he was and things that did he very, very well for us,
there was always a challenge that he was an easier guy to shoot over.  
And I think the addition of Scottie Wilbekin, defensively, has added something
different to our team. I think Patric Young has grown in a lot of ways in
terms of his knowledge and understanding of the game. That he's kind of been
an anchor, not so much a shot blocker, but he's been an anchor back there that
he can see actions and things starting to develop before they happen. And he's
a good communicator and he's been able to call out different coverages.  
So we felt like we needed to tweak some things, from last year that we needed
to get better. We also thought we could do some different things because our
personnel was a little bit different. But we really looked to break down our
defense and find areas that we could get better. And to our guys' credit, they
have been really committed in that area all year long to try to make the right
strides and growth to become better defensively.  
  
Q. You mentioned Scottie, what is it that makes him so good as a defender?  
COACH DONOVAN: I think he has three qualities that enable him to be very, very
good. The first thing is he's got great feet. He's really got good feet. The
second thing is, he is a physical defender. He can get through, around, and
off screens very, very well. And then I would say the third thing is he is a
guy that's a tough minded defender maybe more so than any guard I ever
coached. He values that. He himself puts a lot of value on defending.  
I think most kids put a lot of value on scoring or what they do on the
offensive end of the floor. I think he understands the impact he has and can
have defensively when he's really locked in guarding the way he guards. But
he's somebody that really enjoys that challenge and that part of the game and
is he great all the time, does he stop everybody? No. But you know his focus
defensively is going to be where it needs to be.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Andre Hollins and the strengths that you see from
him on video and just what some of the challenges that he presents.  
COACH DONOVAN: He's an outstanding player. He shoots it, obviously last night
really shot it well from behind the 3‑point line. He puts it on the floor, he
can create, he can get in the lane, he gets other people involved. When he
gets going, and he really gets into a rhythm, he's a very, very difficult guy
to stop.  
Again, NCAA tournament game, he comes in and gets 28 last night against a UCLA
team that's pretty darn talented. I think that speaks to the kind of quality
of player that he is.  
  
Q. You sat Rosario for a while in the second half because of a missed
assignment. What are you looking for him going forward and maybe learning from
that?  
COACH DONOVAN: Yeah I think that the biggest thing with him is that's over
with and done with. For whatever reason he was not as in tune, or in line
mentally, as we needed him to be yesterday.  
Coming out of the half, we're up 8, it's their ball, we're up 12 coming out of
the half against Ole Miss and that evaporated pretty quickly. So we knew the
first four minutes were critical. We come out and he just gives up an
offensive rebound. Doesn't even block his guy out. And that's what we kind of
had talked about, was getting some stops.  
So I just basically he took him out of the game and we started to obviously
make a run at that time and started to extend the lead and I wasn't mad at him
to the point I was going to bench him the whole game. But game was going well
while he was on the bench, that probably contributed to part of it. And also
him not blocking out there.  
  
Q. Back to Scottie, you were very complimentary a couple years ago about
Aaron Craft. I wondered if you have shown Scottie any film of Aaron because
you seemed to describe about the same kind of guy?  
COACH DONOVAN: No, not really. I think that what I try to do is, when Scottie
came to me, he was a guy that bypassed his senior year of high school. So I
was very concerned of what could we actually get from him as a freshman who
really should be a senior in high school. Is the game going to be too fast, is
he going to be intimidated, is he going to be physically overwhelmed, is he
going to be too weak to physically play.  
After about three weeks, I think after the first three weeks of practice,
that's when you can really find out what guys are made of. Because the first
three weeks everybody's amped up and jacked up, but then fatigue starts
setting in. The grind starts setting in and this guy never wavered. And he's
been like that for us a long time. I never showed him films on Craft, I think
Craft's a great defender. I love him, I love his toughness, I love the way he
slaps and reaches at it and the way he comes up with loose basketballs and
uses his body.  
I think Scottie's very, very similar. I think that what you try do as a coach
is when you got ‑‑ guys come in with a certain mentality and what you do is
try to get them to enhance that mentality. His mentality's always been‑‑ he's
always been able to function, and will always be able to function on any team
because of the way he plays defense. And you need a guy like that and there's
always going to be room for a guy like that on your team. And he's gotten
better offensively as he's been in more of an expanded role this past season.
But that's who he is. He has great internal competitiveness and pride in
playing defense. Maybe more so than anybody I've coached.  
  
Q. Tubby's Athletic Director, Norwood Teague, hired a couple of your
assistants from VCU in the past, and it's kind of a unique situation where you
had a guy that had that much faith in a couple of your assistants and he's
trying to help Minnesota basketball and bring it to another level.  
COACH DONOVAN: I've known Norwood for awhile, as you mentioned. He wanted to
interview Anthony Grant and I always said this about Anthony Grant, that he
should have been a head coach a lot longer before he was hired. Anthony was
never a self promoter, he was never out there networking, that wasn't who he
was. He just put his head down and did his job. And Norwood called me about
him and I told Norwood, I said, I'm just telling you right now, Norwood, it
will be the biggest coup of VCU basketball that you could possible get of
hiring anybody that you could hire out there nationally that would go to VCU.
And then Anthony obviously went there and did a great job. And the kind of the
same thing happened he called me back about Shaka who was on the staff at the
time and I said the same thing, I said listen, this guy is unbelievable, he's
great. You got to make a decision with the age and him and his youthfulness,
but he would do a phenomenal job. And I think that Norwood went down that road
again. So because of those two guys, Norwood and I have been able to develop a
relationship over the years.  
  
Q. Wondering, when Florida Gulf Coast sends a shock wave through the whole
tournament with the upset, can you, will you use that as a real specific and
fresh example of how little that the name means on your uniform in this
tournament?  
COACH DONOVAN: You know, I think that a lot of times I think this is what
happens in college basketball: You get November, beginning of December,
everybody's fixed on college football and the NFL. Okay. And then all of a
sudden you start getting to March, it starts really moving towards end ever
February, beginning of March, starts moving towards college basketball. Just
the nation.  
The same Florida Gulf Coast team that beat Georgetown also beat Miami. So our
players, they live in that world, they understand that. But a lot of times
because people maybe say, oh, November doesn't really mean anything,
everybody's kind of getting going, they're, you know‑‑ and listen, Miami's had
a great year and they're a really, really good basketball team, but these
things happen all the time. It's just that the nation's watching it now and
maybe the nation hasn't been watching as closely in that time of year. So I
think our guys understand, we have lost to a Jacksonville whose come into our
place and beat us at home. We lost to South Alabama. Our players have
experienced that. They have gone through that.  
So I don't think we're going to sit there and say, okay, this is what
happened. Minnesota, right now, forget about the seeding, they have played in
the Big‑10, arguably the best conference, from what people say, in the
country. They have probably played against 10 or 11 Top‑10 teams over the
period of time, playing Indiana twice, playing Michigan State, all that.  
So our guys understand that the playing field of college basketball, anything
can happen in a one game deal. And our guys live in that for five, six months.
We see that happen quite a bit.  
  
Q. Pat seemed to be a little on edge maybe when he was up at the podium. How
important is that for you guys for him to kind of have an edge against
Minnesota and play maybe with some anger?  
COACH DONOVAN: Yeah, I think that the biggest thing to me was that he chased
balls yesterday. That was, that's what we need from him. He chased balls and
he got involved in the game early. We found him a couple times on some plays.
After the game he was winded, but I'm sure he was excited. But we need him
playing with a motor. That motor is ‑‑ first of all, he does not play well
when he does not play like that. It's pretty simple. That's something that
internally he's got to be more accountable and responsible for. And he's got
to take ownership of it and make the decision that this is what I need to do.
And then he's got to go out there and do it as hard and aggressive as he
possibly can.  
When he does what he did yesterday, not so much the scoring, but the chasing
of the balls and rebounding and the defense and being in the lane and clogging
it up, it makes us a better team. And we need that from him as long as we
continue to play. Because when he doesn't do that, we're not the same team.  
  
Q. In this tournament, teams aren't familiar with each other. Do you think
you and Tubby are more familiar with your teams because you have gone against
each other so much?  
COACH DONOVAN: Maybe philosophically. As I said earlier, Tubby's always going
to put an emphasis on defense, his teams have always been very good
defensively. I think he always utilizes and takes advantage of the personnel
he has on offense. They're always a tough, disciplined team. Those are things
you're always going to get prepared for when you are playing against one of
his teams. They're going to be very well coached, they're going to play
together, they're going to defend, they're going to be unselfish on offense,
and again I think that probably he's probably changed some things offensively
over the years based on his personnel.  
But I think the core value of who Tubby is as a coach, and what he represents,
and what he is about has probably stayed the same there. So I think being
around him, you kind of understand what the core beliefs are, but that really
has nothing to do with the fact that we have got to get prepared for personnel
on the court and how they're going to play, what they're going to do.  
You can know a team as a really good rebounding team, and I think Tubby's
teams have been good rebounding teams, but you got to block out and rebound.
So I think a lot of times you see on film what's being emphasized and again, I
got great respect for the job Tubby's done and the way his team plays.  
  
Q. With your assistant coaches, can you explain a little bit about how those
personalities fit together and maybe how you guys work so well under the
stress and short turn arounds of this time of year?  
COACH DONOVAN: Well I think the one thing is, is when you're a coach, you're
always breeding chemistry, connectedness, you know selfishness, togetherness,
all those kind of things. I think if you walk down the court and your staff's
not those things, I think it's really, really hard to expect your players to
be those things. So I think when you start talking about unselfishness and
sacrifice and guys working together, we as a coaching staff have got to
display that before our team could ever display that.  
So I've got a lot of trust and confidence in our staff, they work really hard.
They are reliable, they're accountable, they're dependable. But what we'll do
is one guy will take Northwestern State after the selection show, one guy will
take Minnesota, one guy will take Illinois and those three guys will just be
basically locked in a room until the time we play watching film, breaking down
film and then we'll meet and sit down and talk as staff. But when we go on the
court to practice we're all connected on what we're doing and we're all in it
together.  
  
Q. You've been around awhile now. If you could just go big picture about the
coaching profession. Ben's been to three straight Final Fours, there's
questions about his job. Tubby's won at Minnesota, there's questions about his
job. How precarious has it become for coaches right now?  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, I would just say this: One is, I don't know all the
dynamics that go on inside another athletic department. So is it something
that's greater or bigger than the winning and losing? I don't know.  
But I do think, if it's about that, about the winning and the losing part of
it, to me, that's crazy. Because the job that Ben Howland has done there ‑‑
and we obviously played them twice in the Final Four‑‑ was great. They just
won a PAC‑12 championship. Tubby's won national championships. He's an
outstanding coach. He's done it for a very, very long time. If there's
something greater or deeper inside that nobody else knows about, then it's
hard for me to comment on that.  
But if you're talking about coaching‑wise, both of those guys are outstanding
and terrific and as good as anybody in the business.  
  
Q. You were just talking about being familiar with Tubby Smith and the
things that he's maintained over the years. Do you feel like your style has
changed to a degree since when you were coaching against him?  
COACH DONOVAN: I think we all change and evolve as coaches. Everybody's going
to do things ‑‑ a lot of what you do is based on your personnel, who you're
dealing with, what the strengths and weakness are of your players.  
But I do think there's a core foundation and fundamental things that you're
probably not going to budge on, regardless of who you're coaching, that you
believe in. You want to play the game a certain way on offense, you want to
play the game a certain way on defense. There's core fundamental beliefs that
I think every coach has that I think they're going to stick to, but inside
those core fundamental beliefs you have to adjust based on your team and your
personnel.  
So I would hope that, for myself, that I'm constantly evolving and growing
based on what we're doing from a recruiting standpoint and what players are in
there. I feel like my job as a coach is to try to put guys in positions to be
effective and successful on the floor and in order to do that sometimes you've
got to change some things from year to year for that to happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Miami  78  
Pacific - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started and take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well the first thing, we had the utmost respect for Pacific
and the Big West champion and for Coach Thomason and the job he's done
throughout his career.  
The guy's coached at his alma mater for 25 years, done a fantastic job. And we
were very concerned because of their 3‑point shooting ability, but I thought
our team did a terrific job establishing our defensive presence and by
halftime we were able to build up a 20 point lead and we played, we defended
the three very well.  
Second half, we were able to stay out in front and continue to play well. We
were able to utilize a lot of our players and everyone that stepped on to the
court played hard and well. In the tournament, we believe that you have to
play well to advance and we did that today.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shane, did anything go wrong today? Was it almost scripted?  
SHANE LARKIN: Well, yeah, we played pretty well today. Everybody shot the ball
pretty well. We rebounded, we defended, and we just stuck to the game plan.
Coach told us what we had to do before the game started and we went out there
and executed it. When everybody's shooting well like we did tonight we're
pretty tough to defend. So tonight we just played an overall great game.  
  
Q. Reggie, after all the years you've been at UM and everything you've been
through can you talk about what it was like to finally play in a NCAA
tournament game. How did it matchup to your expectation and just how does it
feel to have played a big role with 10 rebounds today?  
REGGIE JOHNSON: It's definitely a great experience to be out here and have an
opportunity to play with these guys. I was saying to Durand, we waited four
years to play in this tournament and we finally got our first win. I went up
to him and gave him a big hug and told him that we're not done yet. The
experience was fun, it's on national championship, so we got to listen to
Coach L and buy into his system and we got to try and do something special.  
  
Q. For Durand, during your career you haven't been really known as 3 ‑point
shooter, but you have what, five 3‑pointers in two of your last three games.
Can you talk about that? Has the shot been there or just talk about your
3‑point shooting?  
DURAND SCOTT: I give most of the credit to the coaching staff. When they came
in they made sure they broke each player's individual game down, figuring out
what they're good at and what they need work at. And especially with Coach
Huger, he definitely helped me with my foot work, which definitely needed much
improvement. And then they kind of gave me confidence and told me like, you
can shoot the ball, just go ahead and shoot it, they gave me the green light.
And then from there I just tried to shoot the best of my ability and I had a
great game today.  
  
Q. Shane, you guys were up 8 ‑7 and then you made some free throws, made a
steal, drove, dished a couple times. Did you feel like at that point you were
just kind of taking over the game? Did it feel like it was just coming easy to
you?   
SHANE LARKIN: I would say my teammates really helped me out. They're always in
the right position, they know where he they need to be for me to be successful
and I try to be in the right position for them to be successful. And just at
that moment in time we kind of weren't playing very well, we had eight points,
they had seven, whatever you said, and we just needed a spark.  
So I tried to go out there and make something happen and luckily my teammates
set the right screens for me to get to the basket and they were in the right
spots and spotted up for me to pass if for them to shoot.  
So my teammates did a great job of being in the right position and that's just
the chemistry we have. We know where we need to be and we just did a great job
at that moment in time in creating a bigger lead.  
  
Q. Durand, I would like you to talk about just some of the assists that
Shane throws. He gave you two of them and he was already holding up three
fingers before you made the shot. And then Shane, I would like you to just
talk about, you had a tough shooting night, but being able to have the assists
and do the things like that.  
DURAND SCOTT: I told the last reporter that, before Shane got here, I was a
point guard, so I know what it feels like to be in that position. So with him
being with the ball in his hand, I know all he wants to do is run the floor.
And I know he's going to put the ball where it needs to be, put everybody in
the right position, get everybody shots, and obviously be aggressive himself.  
So I just wanted to do a good job of running the floor and finding open spots.
And he did a great job of finding me and I definitely would knock the shot
down for him, because I'm pretty sure if I missed it he would have been very
upset with me.  
(Laughter.)  
SHANE LARKIN: Like he said, I didn't shoot the ball particularly well tonight,
but I just wanted to impact the game in other ways. You're not going to go out
and shoot well every single night. So tonight I just wanted to really get my
teammates involved and Durand did a great job being in the right place.
Reggie, Julian, Rion, Trey, Kenny everybody just knows where to be and Tonye,
definitely, Tonye tonight was great, great for me, great for him. I think
that, was it a career high tonight? Yeah career high.  
So he was just in the right spot catching the lobs, Durand was knocking down
threes, Trey, Rion, everyone just did a great job. And when they're in the
right spots and we have the correct floor spacing, I just get in the lane and
somebody has to help and I just got to kick it out and they make the shots.  
  
Q. Durand, what did coach tell you guys before the game? What was the
pregame message and you guys seemed really loose when you came out. Just
seemed like you were having fun. And you've been talking about that a lot, but
what was the message right before the game?  
DURAND SCOTT: Well, basically it was just go out there and just play hard. You
know they're going to come out and they're going to put up a great fight,
which they did, especially in the first couple of minutes, we were sharing
baskets. And coach especially tells us to stay poised and keep fighting and
make sure you take care of the defensive end. I think that's what we did
tonight. And that's why we were successful.  
  
Q. Durand, you mentioned that Shane would be upset if you missed the shots.
When you were the point guard, did you get upset if you had a guy open and he
missed?  
DURAND SCOTT: Yeah, I guess I would.  
(Laughter.) But he definitely tells me, when I don't shoot the ball, he will
come up to me and tell me I need to shoot the ball. And he's not doing that
because he's upset, he's doing that because he's a great leader and he wants
this team to be successful. So for me to not be able to be ready to shoot the
ball and not make the shot would be a disappointment for him and for the team
as well.  
  
Q. Reggie, how disappointing or how tough has it been for you personally not
to have as much playing time since you came back from the injury and how did
it feel to go out there today and kind of play like the Reggie of old?  
REGGIE JOHNSON: It was fun. I'm about winning. Coach is about winning. So if
it takes me to sit on the bench, I sit on the bench. I want to play, I
definitely want to play, but Coach L is going to do what's best for the team
and that's that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student‑athletes know and take questions for
Coach Larranaga.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about getting Reggie involved today. How important
that was. He's just hasn't been contributing as much as in earlier and he
seemed to really rise a little bit to the occasion today.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I think what you have to realize is our team is based
on team effort. And every guy has his own role. Every day it's a different guy
who rises up to the occasion. Reggie's been splitting that position with
Julian Gamble, who is, to me, the combination of Julian Gamble and Reggie
Johnson gives us a dynamic player at the five position.  
Now, I think in years past Reggie got a substantial amount of playing time and
Julian didn't get to play as much. Now they're kind of just sharing that spot.
And I just observe what's going on and I try to make my decisions based on
what I see and how I feel.  
Tonight I thought when Reggie came in he set great ball screens for Shane, he
defended very well, and he got a lot of defensive rebounds. And whoever is ‑‑
on offense you say whoever's got the hot hand, you go with them, but it's true
defensively as well, whoever is defending well and rebounding well, we go with
that guy more.  
So I think it's harsh to think that Reggie's not played well. I think it's
more of a combination of Julian and Reggie both doing a great job and sharing
the position.  
  
Q. How much has Durand developed as far as versatility since you've been
there?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, Durand Scott was a point guard when we first arrived
and he is still a point guard. But we have tried to get him to be a little bit
more versatile with his scoring ability and especially his 3‑point shooting
ability, which you saw today. Because we felt like Durand and Shane Larkin
could be a dynamic combination, because they're both so tough defensively,
they both rebound the ball well for guards, they both handle the ball well,
and the coaches, Coach Huger has been working with Durand on his 3‑point
shooting and we do a drill called five minutes of threes. And if you can make
50 in five minutes, that gives you the green light to shoot the three when
you're open. And Durand has made as many as 80. And he still would pass up on
those shots.  
So between Shane and coach Huger, my other coaches, myself, we have just
encouraged Durand that, hey, when you're open and you're in rhythm, take the
shot. You don't have to drive every time. And he's good at both, he can play
the one, the two, or the three. He's tough defensively in all those spots.
That's why he was the ACC defensive Player of the Year, but that's also, his
versatility gives us the ability to expect him to score in many different way,
drives, free throws, and 3‑pointers.  
  
Q. You got 28 points, 19 boards from your bench today. Not sure if you have
gotten that kind of production in terms of shear numbers this season. Talk
about how the kids played off the bench.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, our message to the team before the game was the teams
that advance are the ones that play well. And the teams that really succeed
are the ones that everybody plays well. And I thought we did that today. I
thought Reggie came in off the bench, Tonye came in off the bench, Rion Brown
and Erik Swoope, all four of those guys scored in the first half. I think
every one of them had a rebound.  
And when you're helping your team in a lot of different ways, as a guy who
comes in off the bench, that really helps us, because it keeps the flow going.  
As a coach, you want to give your starters quality rest time, but the only way
you can do that is if the subs are coming in and playing hard and playing
well.  
  
Q. I know you've seen Shane play a lot, obviously do a lot of different
things like he did today, but talk about the run when it was 8 ‑7\. He had a
couple free throws, had the alley‑oop, made a 3‑point play, and just the
variety of assists that he had there to Durand in the second half.   
COACH LARRANAGA: One of the things as a coach that you want to be able to do
is trust your players, especially your point guard. And since the very first
day I saw Shane Larkin play I thought he was great. And he's only gotten
better at making decisions, at developing his skills, at developing his role
as a leader.  
So today I may have called one or two offensive plays, but I said to him, you
run your team and you make the decisions out there as to what you want to run.  
And he was the one that just called the plays the whole game long. And when
you have a player of his skill level and basketball IQ, it's very, very easy
to have confidence and trust that he'll do the right thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Minnesota  83  
UCLA - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll beginning with an opening statement from you and then
take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH SMITH: I thought we were pretty efficient tonight in the things we did.
We really were on our game making shots and that's always a dream for a lot of
things when the ball goes in the basket. But I thought our defense was
outstanding both Andre and Austin really got us going making shots and when
we're making shots from the outside we're pretty effective.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Andre, they had made that run there at the start of the second half and
got it to within five and then you hit the back to back threes in a span of 31
seconds. Could you feel the momentum go back to your team at that point?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Most definitely when a team starts scoring on your defense and
they start cutting the lead down you get a little more pressure on to you
score. After I hit those threes, it relieved the pressure a little bit from
us, and then from then on we picked up the defensive intensity. Austin and I
hit shots and Joe Coleman, he played well, so we made shots tonight and that
was the big difference.  
  
Q. Austin, you guys talked yesterday that you know pretty early on when Dre
is going to be in a groove. Did you sense it pretty early on tonight?  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: He was hitting shots in warm ups. I'm not too worried about
Andre when he comes out here. I know that he'll be ready to play whenever he
steps on the court. So it was just a matter of going out there and playing and
it started on defense. Our intensity was up and we were making shots tonight.  
  
Q. Andre, you guys have talked some in the past couple weeks about finding
that guy on the team that can step up when you really need him and hit the
clutch shots. That was you last year at this time, did you feel like you
needed to kind of take that role again tonight?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: I guess so, yeah. My teammates believed in me and they know I
can make the shot and tonight I hit it. I hit the shot. It was some clutch
threes when we really needed them. They were trying to make a run and I'm
thankful for my teammates for giving me the ball when I was open and I hit the
shot.  
  
Q. For both guys, 11 turnovers, how important was it taking care of the ball
now. I know it's been an Achilles heel and did tonight feel like the team we
saw early in the year when you were 15 ‑1 or when you beat Indiana?   
AUSTIN HOLLINS: Yeah, that was huge. It has been an Achilles heel for us all
year and we went out there, we weren't forcing anything, we were taking the
open shots when they were there and we were taking care of the ball. We were
being strong with the ball. We had a few careless turnovers here and there,
but for the most part I think we did a really good job of that tonight and
that was one of the focuses just take good shots and take care of the ball?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: We took care of the ball tonight. In crunch time in games that
could be your last game, every possession matters. And tonight we took care of
the ball, we defended well, we got out in transition, and we shot the ball
well. I think we shot 50 percent for the entire game, and, what, 56 percent
from the three. That's a big difference. Teams can't really ‑‑ and also we
stopped their offense by pressing today. And that was a key.  
  
Q. You guys obviously you look at the way you played earlier in the year up
in the Bahamas, Andre, and where does this game stand with that game. That was
a special moment for you, but being able to come on this stage and play like
this, what does it feel like?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: It's huge. Growing up as little kid you just dream of these
moments and I'm just so thankful to have a great team like we have and a great
coach and great coaching staff to be able to have this opportunity. We're
still, we have more games to go. We take it one game at a time, like coach
said, and we have to raise our intensity in this part of the year and I think
that's what we did tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student‑athletes go and we'll take questions for
coach now.  
  
Q. How much pre ‑work have you done on Florida already? Your staff and how
much have you guys scouted them already?   
COACH SMITH: I'm pretty familiar with Billy Donovan, we played quite a few
games against each other when I was at Kentucky. So he's a ‑‑ they sort of,
like UCLA, they like to get the ball up‑and‑down the court. And Kenny Boynton,
they have an outstanding guard there who can really motor the ball up the
court much like Larry Drew can. And they have some people that can do some
things.  
But we really haven't done much. I haven't watched them play. Part of the game
we walked over tonight I thought Northwestern State did some good things. But
Vince Taylor and Saul Smith and my staff, they have, they watched the game, so
we probably have got film already broken down, probably have stuff already and
then I'll concentrate on Florida tomorrow at practice.  
  
Q. You guys stuck with the zone for most of that game, was that something
you game planned coming into this or was that more of an adjustment, in game
adjustment?  
COACH SMITH: No, we planned to zone them a lot. I thought that was ‑‑ but the
zone was going to be a byproduct of us pressing. We knew we were going to have
to extend, we wanted to extend our defense, but we didn't want to ‑‑ so we
wanted to wear them down and not wear ourselves down.  
So I thought tonight the press was pretty effective. We knew that would limit
their number of‑‑ because they can get out in transition, UCLA is one of the
best in transition and Shabazz is great. You saw what he did tonight when he
gets out in transition.  
So we thought trying to slow them up with some soft pressure and then dropping
back into the zone would be effective, keep us out of foul trouble and stop us
from ‑‑ because we have had trouble guarding people one‑on‑one, everybody's
taking you off the dribble, it's dribble drives and draw and dish and I
thought that we would be more effective zoning.  
  
Q. Six minutes into the game I think you had already used 11 guys. Was it
just an effort to wear them down?  
COACH SMITH: Yes. I thought that our bench was very effective. I can't say
enough about how Elliott, Mo, I look down here, these guys, Elliott 3‑3, Mo
was 2‑4\. They had eight rebounds between them. Oto came in and gave us what
we needed. That's what we expect from these guys.  
And I talked to them about having, me having confidence. It's one thing for me
to have confidence, but they got to have confidence in themselves. And Mo has
really gotten better. He's in shape now and I thought that was a huge, huge
difference maker in the game. Even when Rodney got in foul trouble, I thought
that Andre Ingram‑‑ but I was planning on playing a lot of people because we
wanted to try to force the action, push the ball, and press.  
  
Q. Was this the most fun you've seen your team have in the last couple weeks
is?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, we're 0‑3 in the last three games, we haven't played well
at all in a while. We haven't played well since the Penn State game. So it was
good to see our guys having fun, playing the right way, sharing the
basketball, taking care of the basketball. We have had a real problem with
turnovers. But tonight UCLA really didn't press us, they played pretty much
half court man‑to‑man and that probably helped us.  
But we'll see a different look against Florida. So we'll have to really
concentrate and even at that we still turned it over too many times tonight.
We would dribble off our feet, you know, not come meet the pass, it was
really, really interesting to see. So turnovers that we had.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach, we'll let you go.  
COACH SMITH: Thank you. Good night.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Miami  78  
Pacific - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with Pacific. We'll take an
opening statement from Coach Thomason.  
COACH THOMASON: Molly, put these in.  
REGGIE JOHNSON: Is Reggie Johnson.  
SHANE LARKIN: Is Shane Larkin.  
DURAND SCOTT: Is Durand Scott.  
COACH THOMASON: No. 1, it's been real fun coming to Austin. First time I ever
been to Austin. The people we have met and the hosts and everybody have been
so kind and so polite. It's been a great experience for us. Even though we
didn't play particularly well tonight.  
I'd like to thank and congratulate Miami on advancing. Great team, great
pieces, they played tremendous, shot the ball well, rebounded the ball well,
played good defense. And I'll be rooting for them rest of the time. So maybe
they can win a national championship. If I had to go out in coaching, you want
to go out to a great team, but also to a great coach and a class coach, and
Jim is that.  
So it's been a great time. I wish we could have shot better the first half.
We're a pretty good free throw shooting team, which we didn't do tonight in
the 30s, I think. We're a pretty good 3‑point shooting team, which Travis
finally got a little hot in the second half but everybody else didn't shoot
very well.  
So sometimes you meet those moments where you just don't perform very well,
and that was us tonight. So if I had to take a bad game in the last four, I
would take tonight over the last three, because we got here and I'm really
proud of that for the kids.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Travis, obviously especially in the first half it looked like you guys
were having trouble getting good looks. A, was that true? And B, what would
you say about their defense and why did they make it so difficult for you
guys?  
TRAVIS FULTON: I actually think we got some pretty good looks, we just weren't
knocking down the shots like we know we can. And yeah, they pressured us, but
not to where we weren't getting good shots. But I think it was maybe the
jitters getting out of us early on and we weren't hitting those open shots
like we normally do.  
  
Q. How much exactly did nerves play into the poor shooting start at the
beginning? And then just talk about dealing with their size.  
KHALIL KELLEY: Obviously there's going to be nerves in a big game like this. I
feel like we had some open looks, as Travis said earlier, but shots weren't
falling. Obviously with their size it's tough in there. We haven't played a
team that big.  
So we had to really get used to trying to go in there and try and maybe kick
it out or pull it up or try and just to shot fake and do different things.
They made it tough. So we have to give them some sort of credit.  
  
Q. Khalil, obviously for you played a very good game, actually. You came out
energized. Take me through that opening sequence for you, those five or six
minutes and you were the only one not looked like that wasn't nervous.  
KHALIL KELLEY: I don't think it was about nerves. I just wanted to come out
and try and play hard and just see what happened. I feel like the entire team
played hard. We just weren't making shots like we usually do. Things like that
happen. I still feel like we had a great season and I'm still so proud of our
team.  
  
Q. You mentioned their size. Do you feel like were you in forest a little
bit with all their trees and that kind of intimidating?  
KHALIL KELLEY: Not intimidating, but obviously it was tough. There was times
where I was trying to push them under or try and get around them and it was
pretty hard. They had some big dudes down there.  
But I'm never scared of anybody, so I just wanted to come out and play hard
and just show that I could play down there with them.  
  
Q. Travis, obviously you're one of the seniors, so it is your final game. I
know it's 20 minutes later, but sum up the season then just the two years
you've had here at Pacific. And that whole group that's had the two years
together.  
TRAVIS FULTON: I've had great two great two years here. I'm so glad I came
here. We have come a long ways from our 11‑19 season, whatever it was last
year to come and do the big tournament this year. That's what I've always
wanted, I'm so glad I came here and I couldn't be more proud of our team and
our guys, so definitely.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on this being Coach Thomason's final game and the
experience you've had with him over those two years.  
TRAVIS FULTON: Well, it's been a great two years with coach here and it was
great to play for him. I know he gets on my butt sometimes, but I know it's
because he loves me and that he wants me to get better. So I stuck with it and
I wouldn't let him get to me. I know he was just doing it just because he
loves me.  
  
Q. In the first half when they went on their 14 ‑0 run, they stretched it
from 8‑7 to 22‑7\. How difficult was it going to be for you guys to dig out of
that hole.   
KHALIL KELLEY: We knew it was going to be hard. They're a great team. It
seemed like their defense was the toughest part. Just, they all had good
length, they were all quick. So we had a hard time getting up good shots and
it made it tougher to come back. It made it seem even harder.  
  
Q. For Travis, how would you rate their back court and were you expecting
Scott to go off like that when he had 3 threes in a row?  
TRAVIS FULTON: We knew he was a great shooter going into this game and when he
gets it going, he gets it going. And he did tonight. We knew coming in that he
could get it going and we just didn't do a good job on him.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen. We'll let the two of you go. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Did you see a weakness in this Miami team?  
COACH THOMASON: I don't know, I didn't see what they ate at pregame meal or
anything or how they did that.  
But, no, when you have a point guard that's so quick and so demanding about
the on ball screens and can create. He's so unselfish, but he can shoot and
score. That's a problem right there.  
And their two wings are really big and strong. Obviously four is the best
shooter of the two. And we knew Scott can shoot and drive and we just said
hey, if he has a great game, it's not going to work out very good for us. You
know what I mean?  
And actually the first half him and Kadji didn't really play that well. That's
a problem. We needed to shoot really well, get off to a great start, control
the tempo of the game a little more. I thought we had some good looks. Travis
shot a wide open three on the baseline and shot an air ball. Tony Gill had an
air ball in the second half. Tony Gill made every shot he shot in the Big
West. I told Tony after the game I said, if you had to have a bad game I'm
glad it's today rather than before the Big West game because we would have
never won without him.  
So the ‑‑ we needed our guards to play really well tonight. Lorenzo was okay.
Rodrigo and them weren't as good as they normally are and Sama has been
struggling of late. But Durand gave us a little spark, played good. Khalil
probably played the best game he's played in the last month and a half. So
that's good for him working in the off season to get better his junior year.
So the kids are really nice kids. Sometimes they don't concentrate on the
court, but they peaked at the right time.  
I thought all year they could win a championship. I thought they had the
ability to win the tournament. But we had to play pretty well and we did. And
Miami's just a lot better than us. I'm glad it's not a 4‑7 series, to tell you
the truth.  
  
Q. What was kind of going through your head as that buzzer sounded? Did you
let some sentiment seep it, think about the finality or anything?  
COACH THOMASON: I was mad with a minute to go. Why Timmy was bellying up at
the side instead of chesting up. No, you just coach to the end. There's no
sentiment. I got through all that last may. Move on. You know. And looking
forward to it. That's probably not the answer you want, but.  
  
Q. You were talking about ‑‑ we talked about this coming in, like how good
was Miami and you obviously played a lot of good teams during that tournament
run you had. So now that you played them, how good was Miami and is this the
best team you've ever played in the NCAA tournament?   
COACH THOMASON: I thought that Kansas was pretty good when we played them.
They made a great run. Washington was a terrific team when they were the No. 1
seed and we lost to them in the second round. They got beat by Louisville
later on, but that team was really good.  
Khalil said it's the biggest team we played, but he forgot we played Gonzaga
and they're really big. Gonzaga is really big. They might have more bigger
guys than these guys have. So it's not easy because they're so big and strong,
but the problem is their smart, they play well together, they play smart
defense, they don't gamble a lot.  
They just don't give you a lot of mistakes, don't make silly passes. So
sometimes you play teams that do that and it gives you a little more
opportunity. We had an opportunity if we would have shot well to hang in
there. The first four minutes was good, it was 5‑4\. The tempo of the game was
good. Actually the tempo of the next four minutes was pretty good.  
But when you don't score, I don't care how good the other team is or how not
good the other team is, they're going to be ahead. And then they relax and
once they relaxed they shot great. They went 12‑22 tonight and there's no way
we can beat them when they're shooting like that.  
  
Q. Since you're retiring I guess you can speak your mind now about any
subject?  
COACH THOMASON: I've always done that all my life. That's some of the problems
that I've had.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Curious, the sport that you're leaving, there's been a lot of controversy
about the style of play and the grinding and the fouls and is there anything
that you would change maybe start the season later, call fouls more or what
would you do?  
COACH THOMASON: Yeah there was an article about the game a few weeks ago in
our paper, it was a national by Jay Bilas, I think it was, and I really agree
with him. I think it's a concern. I think it's a concern of the style of play,
how physical it is. Post guys really can't score without being fouled a lot.  
I think the arc, that circle has to be figured out what that is. They have put
it in and I have no idea what's a foul and not a foul. I've heard five things
from different Refs. I don't know how to coach it. So they got to clean that
up maybe move it one more foot out.  
They're going to have to start being like the NBA refs where things are
automatically a foul. And that's going to stir the game up for awhile but then
maybe it will be more of a flowing game, a fast breaking game, a movement
game, but we got tremendous athletes out there and nobody can cut and move and
do anything. So I think that it's a concern how to solve that problem, that I
don't know exactly about that.  
  
Q. What are you going to do now in your second career?  
COACH THOMASON: Well, tomorrow ‑‑ I think we're getting home tonight. The
reason is someone said that the charter will be there at 6:30, so I guess
someone knew that we were going to lose before the game. But at halftime I
thought about calling the charter and saying we'll be there.  
(Laughter.)  
I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow but, I have played golf one time in
five months and so I might call my buddy and go out there and play tomorrow if
I get home tonight.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about what you were going to do now, but does it,
I know it is less than half an hour after the game's over, does it feel over?
Or is it going to take some time to sink in that this part of your life is
done?  
COACH THOMASON: Yeah, people asked me all the time, like how are you going to
feel? I go, I've coached for 42 years, how do I know how I'm going to feel not
coaching. I don't know those answers. I'm looking forward to it. I know I got
a bunch of tapes and a bunch of stuff to start exercising, and eating better
pretty quick.  
My wife says when are you going to open that box and I said well when the
season is over. So I'm sure that she will have that box open by the time I get
home. I told her I would take three months to figure out things you might want
to do or not do. But I'm really looking forward to it.  
My wife's a little nervous, she's only known me as a head coach, so she will
either like me better or we're going to have problems, but we have been
married 40 years, so I think we're okay.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH THOMASON: All right. Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 22, 2013

  

### [Larry Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20855)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [David Wear](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23318)

  
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Minnesota  83  
UCLA - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with UCLA. We'll take an opening statement
from Coach Howland and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH HOWLAND: I thought that obviously we struggled against the zone in the
first half. I looked up and saw the field goals attempted, we were at one
point I think like 2‑14 or something like that.  
We had some open looks early. We couple wide open shots that we didn't knock
down. And it kind of snowballed to where we continued to miss some pretty good
looks early in the game.  
And then give them credit. Minnesota, a battle‑tested team out of the Big‑10,
they're very, very physical and tough. We ended up out boarding them tonight,
ironically, by six. But I'm not going to let this diminish, tonight's loss, as
much as it hurts, as sad as we are, diminish what a great season these kids
provided. And to be 25 wins, PAC 12 champions of the regular season, lose
Jordan and find a way to continue to fight back the way they did in our last
two games, I'm just really proud of them and really proud of the spirit of
this team and the young kids that we have that represent UCLA.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your college career coming to an end in this sort
of fashion. Probably not the what you envisioned it ending.  
LARRY DREW II: Yeah, it's definitely not how I had envisioned it at all
ending. But like coach said, it was a terrific run for us. Caught a couple
tough breaks near the end losing Jordan and everything. But like he said also,
just proud of the way that we kept fighting, kept competing. I'm just glad to
be here and just glad to have been given the opportunity to don the UCLA
jersey and colors.  
  
Q. David, talk about your emotions in those last few minutes. I know you
guys struggled a lot in the second half especially.  
DAVID WEAR: Yeah it was really disheartening to be down that much in the last
couple minutes. I thought we prepared really well for this game, I thought
mentally we were ready for a battle. We were ready for a war. It was just
unfortunate we didn't really shoot the ball too well. I felt we played tough
and we rebounded well, but they just made more shots than we did.  
  
Q. David, were you guys hampered by the foul trouble? I know Travis had four
and Tony had four there. How hard was that to kind of have to play conserves
detective?  
DAVID WEAR: It was definitely tough just because we're already have a short
bench as it is. And then to have foul trouble with those two guys, our bigs,
it was definitely tough.  
Because again, we were ready for a physical game inside and we came out and
they called a couple quick fouls and it was just tough trying to adjust to
that over the course of the game. And really trying to just trying to not play
so physical, I guess, inside. And keep picking up cheap fouls.  
  
Q. David, talk about kind of the effect that this loss has on the program,
far reaching affects that it may have?  
DAVID WEAR: Honestly, I thought we had great season. The group of guys that we
played with we were a family, we battled through a lot of adversity throughout
the course of the whole season. And I'm really proud of just the way we came
back. We won the PAC‑12 regular season championship, and a huge win up at
Washington, which was big for us. And then we battled all the way through the
PAC‑12 tournament and then of course it was extremely tough losing a player
like Jordan to this team.  
So I'm really proud of this team and I feel honored to have been able to play
with these guys and have the year that we did.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student‑athletes go and take questions for Coach
Howland now.  
  
Q. Describe your feelings in those last few minutes.  
COACH HOWLAND: Yeah it was disappointing to lose. I thought we did a great
job. We cut it to five and I'm not sure how much time was left. I want to say
it was about 10 or 12 minutes. Right around the 10 minute mark.  
And then Hollins, and I should have mentioned him in my opening statement,
played great. Their point guard was unbelievable tonight. Just how effective
he was. Shooting the ball and pulling up and he made two big threes in a row
to put it back to 11. That kind of ‑‑ and we were obviously short handed. You
could see that our guys wore down physically a little bit. But as I look out
there I've already stated I'm really proud of these group of kids and really
indebted to them for the great season that they provided and so coach able,
just really, really good young men.  
  
Q. Let's talk about something that went well tonight. Obviously the
rebounding factor for Minnesota was something huge coming into the game and
you guys did a really nice job of keeping them off the board, especially the
offensive boards for the most part. Talk about what you did maybe this week to
really focus on that.  
COACH HOWLAND: You know, in terms of the board play, we didn't get enough
defensive rebounds because they shot 50 percent from the field. The first half
in particular was tough for us. I think we were up at halftime on the boards,
if I'm not mistaken. We had too many turnovers. At half time we had nine
turnovers and only three assists.  
And we really struggled just attacking the zone and knocking down some open
looks when we had a chance. And it's a different setting when you're playing
in the NCAA tournament and it's one and done if you lose or whatever it is,
it's sudden death.  
I thought that early we were a little tight and I thought that probably
affected our guys a little bit just thinking back to how the game unfolded
from the beginning.  
  
Q. Are there any indications that you coached your last game here?  
COACH HOWLAND: No. No comment. No, I can answer it.  
  
Q. No, did you hear the fans behind you giving you a standing ovation, it
seemed like they were cheering for you.  
COACH HOWLAND: I didn't. I never hear anything during the games. When I come
to a game, I'm so focused on the game, I don't notice what people ‑‑ after
hundreds and hundreds of times of coaching, if you're hearing the fans, then
it's a rarity.  
  
Q. So there was no feeling you were in your heart that this might have been
in the back of your mind?  
COACH HOWLAND: I'm just really proud of the season that these kids provided,
the UCLA fans. I think that going back into Pauley this year and bringing home
the championship in the regular season, it's really, really disappointing to
think about losing Jordan in the last play of the game against Arizona. That's
just the breaks. That's just an unfortunate thing.  
And had it happened two months earlier, it really would have been a problem.
And I said throughout the season, the one thing that could stop us would have
been losing a key guy. And that's what ended up happening to us down the
stretch. I thought we played great against Arizona, when was that? A week ago
today. Right? And so it's just unfortunate, but overall, really proud of our
team and proud of our kids and excited about the future for them.  
I think that our guys improved a lot, and I look at Larry. Larry didn't have
one of his better games today, but on the season as a whole, his improvement
from the beginning of the year to throughout the season was just tremendous.
That's what you want to coach. You want your team to improve, to compete, you
want your players to improve individually and as a team. I thought our guys
did that.  
  
Q. You talked about how tough, how physically tired they appeared. Was it a
mental thing too because of the Jordan Adams thing and the early foul trouble
and controversy about your job status, was there a mental, was it mental for
them as well tonight?  
COACH HOWLAND: I thought our guys were good mentally. You lose one of your ‑‑
Jordan is arguably our most effective all around player at both ends of the
floor. No question that affected us. I mean it affected us in the seeding, we
should have been in Salt Lake instead of here if he stays healthy.  
And I'm really excited about how the three teams in the PAC‑12 won yesterday
and I think our league gets pretty much a bum rap when you look at it overall
in terms of the quality of the teams this year. I think that both Cal and
Oregon and Arizona are all having a chance to go to the Sweet 16.  
So our guys won that league with all those players and all those teams in it
and really excited about what they provided. The kind of year they had.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. We'll let you go.  
COACH HOWLAND: Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Florida  79  
Northwestern State  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from coach and then
take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MCCONATHY: You know, really proud of our team for coming out and
competing hard and some people would say well, coach, you got whipped pretty
good, but it's all about competing and playing hard. We played against an
extremely well coached team. It's quite obvious in Florida.  
Their bulk and strength over the course of the game just really got us in the
second half when we got ourself in a situation where we didn't make shots. I
think we had 12 empty possessions and they were going down and getting them.
Murphy and Patric Young. They did well, very, very well. And we had a hard
time on their ball screens. But I'm really proud of how hard our kids played.
Just got to be big enough and strong enough to compete against the talented
team and well coached team like Coach Donovan has in Florida.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For DeQuan, talk about the spell you guys had after you get the two early
baskets to cut into the lead in the second half and then you just couldn't buy
a basket, how much of it was defense and how much of it was just not shooting
well?  
DEQUAN HICKS: It was mostly, it was mostly just, we got the good run at the
beginning of the half and then it just seemed like it just seemed like the
buckets wasn't falling for us. But that's how it goes. Games are runs. So we
run some, we keep a run, they get a run, we just couldn't make our run. And
they made a run and pulled away.  
  
Q. Shamir, could you have ever foreseen a defense being able to hold you
guys to a 19 percent shooting effort for a half, particularly after you guys
shot 54 percent in the first half.  
SHAMIR DAVIS: Well, you have to give a lot of credit to Florida's defense.
They are one of the best defensive teams in the nation. Along with Stephen F.
Austin, which is a very good defensive team.  
I wouldn't say it was all to their defense, we just missed a lot of shots that
we normally make. It isn't all their defense. We were over thinking a lot of
shots, maybe, shooting a lot of shots that were going long. But they played a
really good defense and they got their hands up, contested a lot of shots, so
kudos to them.  
  
Q. James, you played SFA three times, leading scoring defense in the
country, what's the difference in their defense and Florida's defense?  
JAMES HULBIN: I would have to say it's really not a difference. It's just
they, well Stephen F, they do less possessions and Florida, they like to run
like we do. But as far as a half court defense or that, I give them good
credit. They're really a good half court defensive team.  
And shots that we usually hit, we just, they just weren't falling in the
second half. So they made their run and we didn't make ours. Okay, gentlemen,
we're going to let you go and we'll now take questions for coach.  
  
Q. This is somewhat similar to the question I asked Shamir, but could you
have ever seen your offense that's No. 1 in the country scoring 34 below your
average tonight?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Well I think what happens, it's hard to really imagine this,
but our offense spurs off of our defense. And we had two steals. Therefore, we
were never able to get in any flow or rhythm because of the fact that we
couldn't make anything happen.  
When we did make some plays, you could feel us wanting to‑‑ kind of like, the
old car that you try to crank up years ago, not that I ever had one like that,
okay, but crank up and you would feel it wanting to crank, but it wouldn't get
cranked because they were coming right back at you.  
You can dice the thing up all different ways, but I wouldn't have ‑‑ to answer
that, I wouldn't have thought that we would have gone to 19 percent after the
first half. I mean we played a very, very good first half. In fact, I think we
cut it to four right before the half and we lay it up and then we give them a
lay up back on the other end. Something that we just haven't done this year.  
But the caliber of team that Florida is, you just can't make mistakes. We get
out‑rebounded by 17. Four of those were offensive rebounds off of free throws
that we work on every day. They made 3 threes out of those, and I think they
got a bucket on the other one. So that's 11 points right there off of missed
free throw rebounds.  
So I just didn't think ‑‑ I would have thought we would have scored. Now that
I said all that.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Murphy, Young and Yeguete, I'm sure that was one
of your worst fears was that they would dominate the boards like that because
of their length?  
COACH MCCONATHY: You know really and truly, when you look at us, we have got
pretty good length. We walk through an airport and they think we might be
semi‑all airport. But Young and Murphy, just are so long and big, and we let
them get the ball where they are going to make a move and their length just is
immaterial possible to deal with.  
And in Murphy, of course, being able to step out and shoot the three, it makes
it a whole different ball game because you got to be able to react to that
situation on the pick and pops that he does.  
So their length was just a huge concern. And it was a bigger concern when I
walked out. As I talked to some people, tape really does not do them the
justice of their length. The length that they have.  
  
Q. You guys, last time were you here, you had such a senior heavy group,
took you awhile to get back, feel you're in a little better position to make
another run right away with guys like Jalan and DeQuan and Brison coming back
next season?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Yeah I think. So we got back to our conference championship
game two times in a row after losing, after winning it in 2005 and 2006. So I
think that we're in a lot better position to make the run and stay back where
we need to be.  
I think we have the mentality. We have got two or three really nice pieces
along with some other kids that are on our team that allow us to get back. We
have got some nice kids coming in that I think will help us.  
That's important. Disappointed because you lose, well it doesn't matter, well
it does matter, but you're here, you made a run, you won a Southland
Conference tournament, you have been in the big dance, you've done that, you
can't take that away from those kids.  
That's something that's important for us to realize. It's important for me to
realize too. Because we have experienced some success. Not on the level of
Florida and those teams that have won national championships, but everything's
relative. You got to find out where you are.  
Hey I appreciate y'all. Do you want to ask me one more question. I may not
have this chance ever again.  
(Laughter.) I'm going to get everything I can get.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. I asked this question of one of your players, but how much do you think
it was Florida's defense versus a poor shooting night in the second half?  
COACH MCCONATHY: I think that it's 50/50. I think that their defense was very,
very good, but I just think that we scored the two buckets ‑‑we have for the
second half, what did we have? How many field goals did we have? Four? Well
I'm looking at the wrong team. We had three field goals in the second half.
Three. And I mean, they had so much to do with that and if you don't make
shots against such a big strong, well coached team, you're going to have a
hard time.  
And then they got their rhythm going and flow going and we were backing on our
heels. Part of it too, and I had to try to junk up what we were trying to do
to slow them down, and that's just not really who we are either.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, coach.  
COACH MCCONATHY: Hey, I can say this. I appreciate you. The people that I
talked to have been wonderful and I thank you very much for the way that
you've treated our kids. Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Florida  79  
Northwestern State - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with Florida. Take an opening
statement from coach and then questions for the student‑athletes. Coach?  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, I thought for us it was a game of two halves. Kenny and
Rosario had early foul trouble. Probably played Scottie Wilbekin with their
rotation, probably too many minutes.  
And the thing I was disappointed about in the first half was our defense. We
did not do a great job, they shot over 50 percent from the field and I think
45 percent from three. And we did a much, much better job. I think some of
that is when you're playing a team for the first time and you haven't really
seen them before, there's a little bit of an adjustment period, probably. And
I thought our guys adjusted pretty well coming out of the half defensively.  
Then I thought we really defended well in the second half. We established
inside. I thought Patric Young and Erik gave us really good post presence
where we could get the ball and do good things around the basket. And I
thought our back court and Kenny did a good job of finding them and getting
them the ball. So it was a good win considering the fact that we came out of
maybe a little bit of a slow half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, talk about defensively in the second half the run you
guys made and it seemed to kind of fuel your offense as well. But they were
getting an awful lot of lay ‑ups and easy baskets and what you did differently
in the second half.   
KENNY BOYNTON: I think that we came out, I think it was our energy. Our energy
level and our focus. I think in the first half we had slip ups and guys were
cutting back door, they got wide open layups.  
I think in the second half we just, as a team, came together and started
helping each other out. And the main key thing was getting rebounds and
getting out and I think we did a great job at doing that.  
  
Q. For both student ‑athletes, can you guys talk about the keys in the
second half? They only shoot 19 percent and you guys ended up holding them to
34 points below their season average. What were some keys in the second half
for you defensively specifically?   
ERIK MURPHY: I think one thing was we got back in transition a lot better and
got matched up. They were hurting us a little bit in transition. We just came
together as a team and decided we were going to get stops and when we play
together on defense, we play well. It's tough for teams to score.  
KENNY BOYNTON: I think that the same thing Murph said. I think it was a
collective effort. I think that we did a better job at guarding the 3‑point
line. We had our heels inside the 2‑point line and they got some open looks in
the first half. And I think we did a good job contesting those shots after
that.  
  
Q. Erik, you make a lot of 3 ‑pointers, but scored a lot inside tonight. Was
that part of the plan to go at them?   
ERIK MURPHY: Yeah, I just try to offensively, whatever's there, I try to take
advantage of. The ball got inside tonight to me and Patric Young and we just
did a good job of finishing around the rim. And guards got us the ball in good
positions and that's what worked tonight.  
  
Q. Kenny, how does it feel to go over 2000 points in your Florida career.
You're only the second player in school history to have done that.  
KENNY BOYNTON: It's a great accomplishment, but we're in a struggle in the
first half. Luckily we still got the win with it.  
  
Q. Erik, their coach was saying he kind of knew they were in trouble when
you guys walked out on the court because you were longer than he thought, than
he saw on tape. Do you feel like you guys could dominate the boards the way
you did, you Patric Young and Will?  
ERIK MURPHY: Yeah, I think that's a big thing for us is rebounding. That's one
of the keys to defense. If you guard and make teams miss, you got to rebound
and end the defensive possession.  
And I think that as long as we have a mindset that it's the whole team, it's
not just the front court guys, it's the whole team. I think if we have that
mindset of just ending defensive possessions with rebounds, I think we can do
that.  
  
Q. Speak to what may or may not have been said at halftime about the defense
in the first half?  
KENNY BOYNTON: The main focus was energy. As a team we were giving up just
wide open lay‑ups, defensive efficiency, I think they shot like 1.02. So the
main thing was coming out with energy. I think that we did a great job of
coming out in the second half and getting stops and getting out in transition.  
  
Q. Erik, what was it like to come out for tip off to almost an empty
arena?  
ERIK MURPHY: I mean, it doesn't really affect the game. We just got to do our
jobs and play the game. I don't think that really bothers us. It's an early
round game, it's in Austin, who knows how many people are going to show up.
That shouldn't have any affect on how we play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student‑athletes go now and take questions for
coach.  
  
Q. The first half of that game and the last half of the Ole Miss game, it
seemed like they were similar in a way in that you guys were having a hard
time protecting the rim. What had to change there in that second half?  
COACH DONOVAN: I think a couple of things happened. One is the game got going
up‑and‑down the floor and I thought that that was good for us. It's the way
they play and we try to play the same way.  
I thought we did a really good job against their press of getting the ball out
up the floor and advanced. And we got some advantages on the break and we
scored easy baskets. And we're jogging back and we're just saying okay we're
back, we're on our man, and I think our guys were, as much as we talked about
it, were surprised that those guys just all of a sudden just coming at us on
the break. And beating the defender and we didn't really have good help at
all.  
Then I thought our pick and roll coverage, on West in particular, we were
leaving the ball too early before our guard got back on the ball and that was
opening up driving lanes. Then when they did drive we were getting cut behind
our head and we just did not do a great job handling that part. We were back,
it wasn't even a matter of not getting back, we were back. And our defense was
set.  
But it was almost like this is a little bit different than what we have gone
against before, with the way they did it. One time West came down the floor,
was already down, he dribbled up and shot a three and it took Wilbekin by
surprise. He thought, wow.  
That's the way they play. I liked watching them on film. The things that they
do. It's definitely unique. They all have freedom. Hicks is a tough matchup
guy because he passes it so well and he can score from 15 feet and in very
well.  
But I think their overall speed got us back on our heels where our defense
wasn't very good at all. And then we had a couple plays where we missed some
chippies around the basket, we didn't shoot it great from the free throw line,
and we were fortunate to go up eight at the half.  
But I thought in the second half we had better built‑in help. That was the big
thing was building a wall around the ball with whoever's guarding the ball.
That's a hard play to guard when the floor is spaced and a guy is coming at
you full speed and you're standing there. You need some built‑in help. I
thought our help built‑in to recover was much better in the second half.  
  
Q. Patric Young said he was a little bit winded in the first few minutes, is
that a product of the way that they play and how did you feel about the way he
bounced back from that?  
COACH DONOVAN: I think that when you get into tournament games there's always
that anxiety, there's an excitement, there's an emotional level where you
probably feel like you're running in quicksand a little bit.  
I think it probably took him a little while to get going. I thought we did a
good job of establishing him up front. He was 6‑10 from the field and I
actually thought he missed some easy shots around the basket. But we got it to
him in good areas of the floor.  
I think that his being winded was probably just normal of, NCAA tournament,
sitting around and watching games probably yesterday and today, and we're
getting ready to play, there's just an excitement around the tournament that I
think a lot of teams, you're exhausted and you feel like you're out of shape,
but once you settle in, you're a little bit better.  
And I noticed the same thing that you're talking about. I tried to sub him
pretty frequently there in the first half to get him a quick rest and put him
back in.  
  
Q. You outscored them 44 ‑22 in the paint. Talk about the ability to work
the ball inside throughout the game and stick with it throughout the game.   
COACH DONOVAN: Well, one of the things that they do, which is unique, is they
switch a lot of things out on the perimeter. And you got to be very careful
passing the ball, because if you're careless with the ball, it leads to a lot
of fast breaks for them. And I thought we did a very, very good job of
catching entry passes. And then Patric Young was able to establish himself, so
was Erik, that we were able to get it inside. Will Yeguete got in there, he
was 1‑6 from the field, but he even got it deep and probably needed to do a
better job finishing than he did.  
But that was kind of a mindset, that we needed to establish it inside. I think
one of the things that they probably get teams to do, which would not have
been good for our team, because this is the best way to exhaust your front
court, is to come out in transition, beat their press, have numbers and start
launching threes.  
We wanted everything to be taken to the basket first and then if they showed
off penetration, then we can kick out and take threes. And I thought our guys
made some really good, wise choices in both halves of doing that. That we went
to the basket. We had a stretch there where Frazier was open, Kenny was open,
we had a couple plays in the second half where we really shot it quick. Wide
open, it's hard to turn those down. But if you end up in a game like this, in
my opinion, you take 35 threes, and your front court players, all they're
caught doing is running from the front of the rim to the front of the rim and
they needed to be established. And I thought our guys got it to them in good
areas.  
  
Q. You touched on this, earlier, but you guys tried to match their pace. You
guys, went at it the way they went at it. Was that something you had talked
about beforehand?  
COACH DONOVAN: We're going to always play fast. We're going to ‑‑ sometimes
it's harder to play fast against certain teams. They want to play fast, it's
no different for us. We want to play fast.  
So we had no problem, everybody was talking about the fact that they rotate
five guys in, five guys out, are our guys going to get worn out. We're playing
pretty much eight guys. We can manage eight guys and rest guys enough that
they can be effective over a 40 minute game.  
But the faster the game, I think it was more to our liking. We shot a really
high percentage from the field, and we got out and we attacked their press.
And we weren't looking to pull the ball back out, we were constantly running.  
I think that's just the way we want to play. So I was never concerned going
into this game about the pace of the game. That didn't concern me.  
What concerned me more was what happened in our first half. Hard drives to the
basket, not being in good position help‑wise, rotating, giving up second
shots.  
And then what would lead into even more transition for them would be if we
turned the ball over too much. And we didn't really do that, but the pace I
thought was fine for us, we wanted to play just as fast as they did.  
  
Q. You were talking about sitting around watching games all day and
obviously there's all kind of upsets. Even when you were a timeout, they were
calling the Gulf Coast win over Georgetown. Do you caution your guys about
getting caught up in it or let them enjoy it?  
COACH DONOVAN: I talk to them a lot about it. What happens I think sometimes
publicly is, when games start, they're always, for the tournament and the
excitement of it, they're always looking at the seeds. This is a higher seed,
this is an upset. This is not an upset.  
Listen, it's amazing to me. Every year there are upsets, as people like to put
it. I don't know why anybody's surprised any more. Everybody that's in this
NCAA tournament is a really, really good team. And if you don't play well,
you're going to probably have a hard time winning the game.  
So I just talked to our guys, more than anything else, that when the ball goes
up in the air and it's tipped to start the game, there's no extra points we
get for being a higher seed. We don't start the game 10‑0, there's no extra
benefits from being that. It's two teams lining up and playing.  
I talked to our guys a lot about, you cannot, in these situations, get so
wrapped up in what you're talking about that you lose sight of the fact that
they need to go out there and play.  
Now, I don't like pull the plugs on their TV sets and tell them not to watch
TV and sequester them and they can't do anything and they're in a room. I'm
not going to do that. But there needs to be a level of maturity and
understanding that whatever they're watching on TV has no bearing on our game.
Okay. We have got to come ready to play. And in this tournament, anything can
happen on any given night. It's just, that's just the way the tournament's
always been. And it will continue to be that way.  
And that's what makes this tournament so great and so special. And also
there's a lot of teams out there that are really, really good. But I think
people who don't get a chance to see Florida Gulf Coast ‑‑ I knew they were
really good. They beat Miami this year. But they didn't get a lot of attention
or recognition from that. But when you're in college basketball and you're
following that stuff and you're hearing that stuff, you understand how good
teams are.  
Maybe our players get a chance to see some of the teams play, maybe they
don't. But I understand that, you know what, like there's just games there
that are going to be very, very challenging and very difficult.  
I was very concerned coming into this game. And I would have been concerned
against any team that's in the NCAA tournament, because that's just the way it
is. But you got to keep your focus on who we're playing against, what's the
scouting report, how do we need to play, and the things that we need to do to
try to be successful in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Illinois  57  
Colorado - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from coach and
then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH BOYLE: Well, obviously we're extremely disappointed in the result, but I
thought our players in the second half showed extreme heart coming back from a
16 point halftime deficit to take the lead. We just didn't have enough of what
it took in key possessions of the game, some offensive and some defensive to
finish this thing off. Illinois made more plays down the stretch than we did.
We weren't able to get to the free throw line like we normally do. It's a big
part of our offense and when we aren't getting to the free throw line we have
got to make some shots.  
And we made enough in the second half to get back in the game and close the
gap and to take the lead, but we couldn't ‑‑ then we have gone on scoring
droughts all year, for those of you who haven't seen this team. But our
defense was good enough in the second half and our heart was good enough. And
we're disappointed, being one and done is not what we're interested in being
in the NCAA tournament.  
But that's the reality now, we have to live with that for another year and I
told our team in the locker room that Sabatino Chen, our only senior, and
Shane Harris‑Tunks, who is going to graduate in May and move on, are the guys
I feel most disappointed for.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ski, you guys were down 16 at half and went on a 23 ‑2 run. You hit 3
threes, what was said at halftime and what were the adjustments?   
ASKIA BOOKER: Well the adjustments were defense and rebounding. We wanted to
get the ball and push it in transition off of stops that we got. I think that
just being aggressive, attacking them in transition and looking for open guys.
When you find them, they knock it down and I knocked down some shots and then
Josh had some shots, Xavier, Andre, we all made great plays on that run.  
  
Q. Ski, you were taken out of the game with about five minutes left, did you
feel like you lost your flow when you got taken out of the game?  
ASKIA BOOKER: I'm not going to say I lost it, I was hot at the time. I can't
say whether I should have came out or not, because that's coach's decision,
but he felt it was best for the team, so I had to go with that and whether I
lost it or not, I mean we still had to play defense and rebound. And they hit
two big threes coming down when we were up and that changed the momentum and
that's how we got back down.  
  
Q. Josh, they always say when you make a run like that it takes a lot of
energy to come back from a deficit. Did you feel like you kind of, the team
kind of ran out of gas at the end of the game?  
JOSH SCOTT: I don't think so. I think we were just trying to compete and try
to get it done no matter how much the score was going up. We didn't want to
quit.  
  
Q. Ski, when you guys came all the way back did you feel like you guys were
in a good place to sustain that lead and win the game?  
ASKIA BOOKER: Without a doubt. We were getting stop after stop after stop and
we were pushing it down their throats. And coach made some great calls for
certain plays to be ran and we executed very well and we felt like we had the
momentum in our hands. But give credit to Illinois for finding the open man
and knocking down the shots and that's just something that they do very well
and they take a lot of threes and they made some in the second half.  
  
Q. Their ball screen defense in the first half was really good and it threw
you guys out of rhythm a lit bit. Is that something you tried to capitalize on
in the second half specifically?  
ASKIA BOOKER: Without a doubt. They did different things. On Spencer, they
trapped. On me they just hedged, they showed really hard. But I don't think it
threw us off. We just had to find the open guy, keep the ball moving, we don't
always need ball screens to score. When you keep the ball moving and keep guys
on their heels and we attack, we're just fine.  
I think that's what we did in the second half, we kept them on their heels,
but their ball screen defense, it's pretty good, but just give credit to them
overall.  
  
Q. Josh, with such a young team, what does this experience do for you guys
going into next season?  
JOSH SCOTT: I think we can learn from it. I think it gives us some fire. Every
time we go work out, lift, it's an experience that you learn from an you just
improve upon, so that's what we're going to take from this going forward into
next season.  
  
Q. Ski, what's the future of this program?  
ASKIA BOOKER: Well first the future all depends on the individual guys in the
off season. How hard we work, how much work we're going to put in, whether it
be day, night, evening. The off season is where everyone gets better.  
And once we come together, I think Coach Boyle is going to take ‑‑ that's in
his hands and he's going to make us work and we're going to build our program
on defensive rebounding. I think the sky's the limit for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, we're going to let you go and we will now take
questions for Coach Boyle.  
  
Q. What was the key for them in limiting Spencer today?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, Spencer got in foul trouble early. I thought that offensive
foul charge, his fourth foul was a really critical juncture of the game. But
our team responded. We made our run with Spencer out of the game. They did a
good job on Spencer. They showed hard on those ball screens and they tried to
get the ball out of his hands and Spencer made a couple of shots for us in the
second half, but the thing that makes Spencer special is he has the ability to
affect the game in a lot of different ways, not just scoring.  
Four assists, four turnovers is not a normal line for Spencer. It's got to be
more four assists, two turnovers, or six assists, you know, three turnovers.
But he wasn't at his best tonight, foul trouble had something to do with that.  
But I thought our team responded. When one of your best players has a subpar
game and you're in it to the end, like we were, says a lot about this team.  
But they tried to get the ball out of his hand as much as they could. I think
that was their game plan.  
  
Q. You mentioned this at the top, but what do you take away from a game like
that? It's such a roller coaster. Does it hurt more to lose it that way?  
COACH BOYLE: It always hurts, but, yeah, when you comeback ‑‑ we talk all the
time and this team's done it all year, at times, but it's easy to come back,
it's hard to come back and win. We have come back and won some games this year
from deficits. Again, our scoring droughts are tough to deal with, and that's
why we have to guard, we have to rebound.  
We played well enough to win today, we just didn't play well enough down the
stretch to win today. Illinois made the plays down the stretch. They made the
shots, the two threes to cut into the deficit of two. They went up four and
then we didn't score the last five minutes of the game, five, six minutes of
the game until Xavier Johnson hit that long three at kind of garbage time.  
We came back, we made shots to come back and get in the game. Played good
enough defense, we held them to 13 percent field goal percentage in the second
half. But we just couldn't make a shot when we had to make a shot. Whether it
was in the lane, whether it was a three, and you know, in games like this you
got to be able to make shots at some point to win it. And they made more shots
than we did down the stretch.  
  
Q. Expanding on those scoring droughts, kind of what leads to them? Are they
just not getting good looks or they're just not falling?  
COACH BOYLE: I think first half it was turnovers. We had three assists and
eight turnovers in the first half. They had 15 points off our turnovers in the
first half.  
So that was the part in the second half. We got, again we made some shots and
then, boom, all of a sudden we missed shots in the lane, we missed them at the
rim, we missed open threes.  
I've said it before, I'll say it again, as a coach, you just want to make sure
your team gets good shots. There's not a lot you can do if they miss them.
Whether they're layups or whatever, but if we're taking good shots, which I
thought in the second half we were, you got to live with it. But if you're not
making them, it puts a lot of pressure on the other end of the floor. The
first half, the turnovers killed us. We don't get a shot then and it's hard to
miss or make them.  
  
Q. What are you going to work on in the off season to try to get this team
to take the next step?  
COACH BOYLE: I just told them, I said, No. 1, I'm proud of what they have done
this year. With a young group that we had, they have helped put Colorado
basketball on the map.  
Now we have got a lot of work that we need to do in terms of improvement and
gaining some national respect. And it's incumbent on every person in our
basketball program, whether it's the head coach, assistant coaches, or
players, to give everything they have got in this off season. We'll take some
time, get our batteries recharged. But just because we're going to be a year
older next year doesn't mean we're going to be a year better. Our players need
to understand that. Our freshmen need to understand that this is where you get
better, in the off season, in the weight room, working on the deficiencies
that are in your game, whether you're a freshman, whether you're a sophomore,
or whether you're a junior.  
Again the people I feel sorry for are our seniors, that guys that are
graduating in May and won't be with us next year. And it's our job to make
them proud. But I'm proud of what Colorado is in the process of becoming. We
have still got plenty of room for improvement and this isn't our last time
here, I promise you that.  
We're going to be back. But we can't take it for granted that just because
we're going to be a year older next year and a year more experienced that
we're going to be a year better. And that's our job as coaches in the off
season to make sure our guys understand that.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the play of Ski Booker in the second half when
the shots weren't falling and a guy who hasn't really been able to hit many
shots recently really brought you back.  
COACH BOYLE: He made some shots. He made one and then we ran a play for him,
he made another one. And then again, consistency's been a problem for this
team and certainly for Ski, when it comes to shooting the basketball all year
long.  
But those were big shots. They kind of got our team some life, and
unfortunately there just weren't enough of them. And we missed too many wide
open looks tonight. But I was proud of Ski, he's not afraid to take shots.
That much I'll give him credit for. And he made some big ones in the second
half to kind of get our team sparked.  
But there's some things that we didn't do defensively when we had to down the
stretch and it cost us the game.  
  
Q. 21 wins this season, do you have a prediction for next season? Another 20
win season?  
COACH BOYLE: I'm smarter than that, but thank you. We're going to be better
next year, I think, because of the work ethic. Josh was here, Ski was here.
The one thing we tried to do, is we tried to recruit basketball players at the
University of Colorado that number one, love the game and number two, want to
be great. And I know both these kids do. We have got other guys in that locker
room that do.  
So as long as they do what we think they're capable of doing in the off season
and put that work in, we will be better. We have got games still to schedule,
so I don't even know our schedule for next year, so I'm not going to start to
try to talk about wins. We just got to try to finish that schedule out. It's
getting harder to get teams to come to Boulder, Colorado, I can tell you that.  
But at some point somebody's, we're going to have to play somebody at some
point. So as a coaching staff, as we go into the next week or two and into the
next month or two, we're going to have to really turn our attention to our
schedule and try to get the best one we can for next year's team.  
  
Q. What was the message at halftime down 16?  
COACH BOYLE: The message at halftime down 16 was, guys, we're going to get
back into this game one possession at a time. We have ‑‑ we cannot be happy
with trading baskets for them or with them. And we have to get stops. And try
to get ‑‑ we're having trouble scoring the ball, try to get some baskets in
transition. The only way you do that is by getting stops. They're shooting a
lot of threes, those threes aren't going to go in all game. If they are, we're
going to shake their hands. They didn't go in all game, they missed a lot of
threes in the second half, we got long rebounds, we weren't able to convert as
many in transition as we wanted to.  
But the message was, one possession at a time, we don't have a 16 point play
in our play book, we're not going to get back in this thing all at once. We
got to do it one possession at a time on offense and on defense. And our guys
took that to heart. They have been in that position before.  
So I'll finish with saying, Colorado basketball, the future of it is in great
shape. We got a lot of good young players in our program. We got a lot of good
young players coming into our program, and we're going to be back here. I
don't know when, but we will be back. Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  

Illinois  57  
Colorado - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach Groce
and then take questions for the student‑athletes. Coach?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I just, this time of year it's about surviving and
advancing. So we're grateful to have the opportunity to play on Sunday. I
thought it was only fitting that the game was maybe about as strange a game in
terms of the ebb and flow of the game that I've been associated with, that it
would be that way with this group. We have done it the hard way a lot this
year.  
I'm proud of our guys for resilience. At one point Colorado went on a 23‑0 run
in the second half. And I think that in that situation a lot of teams would
crack and I thought our guys continued to stay very poised. I thought the 16‑2
run late in the game that was spear headed by our defense was a huge, huge
part of the game. We got down five, I thought our defense made some plays for
us that were big.  
I want to give Colorado a lot of credit. They're down 16 coming out of the
half, I thought there for the early portion of the second half for sure they
were the toughest team there for that portion of the game. Continued to play,
enjoyed as I told Coach Boyle before the game, watching their team on film.
Really respect how hard those kids play. Respect the way they defend and the
way that they rebound. And they have got a young team and it will be great to
see how they move forward. I think they have got a chance to keep getting
better.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. D.J. or Brandon, just how do you explain these wild momentum swings? And
kind of the hot and coldness of the whole season. Can you put your finger on
why that happens in games?  
BRANDON PAUL: This is March Madness and that stuff happens all the time. At
the end of the day I think that as seniors we got to find a way to tough it
out. We got to find other ways to get some points on the board. And I think
getting to the free throw line‑‑ my shot wasn't really falling as well
tonight, so I tried do my job getting to the free throw line. And we got a lot
of guys who stayed poised.  
Tracy got us the ball and in positions to score. We can't tie our defensive
effort to the same as our offensive effort. So I think coach said we went on a
16‑2 run that just shows the type of poise we have on this team.  
  
Q. Can you describe the emotion that was going through your heads out there
during that run? The crowd's going with the other team making the run and you
turned things around almost on a dime. Just talk about what you were thinking
about and how it changed.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: We played what is this our 35th game? We have been through so
many different situations throughout the year. We played in so many big games.
Played games we had to come back and make plays at the end. And playing a lot
of games to get us prepared for a game like this.  
And I think we made some big plays tonight like we did earlier in the year in
other games. We just find ways. We trust each other, we trust the system and
we just find ways and the outcome out positive our way. So we just got to stay
tough minded.  
BRANDON PAUL: We play a lot of teams that feed off the crowd so we don't let
that get to us. We stay focused on the task at hand. Coach does a good job of
making sure we stay cool, calm and collected. So we have been through this
before, and we have been through lots of tests before and we have had a lot of
character. We have been through this throughout the whole year.  
We played against a lot of teams that really base their energy off the crowd
and they to do a good job of pumping the crowd up and we like to stay poised
and coach does a good job along with the rest of the staff making sure we calm
and cool and collected in the huddles. And no one is pointing fingers and we
all keep the same mindset.  
  
Q. What were you guys saying to each other during timeouts during that
drought?  
TRACY ABRAMS: Like Brandon was saying, the coaches do a great job at making
sure everybody's composed and on the same level. You see a guy put his head
down or look like they got a certain face on, they always keep us composed and
collected like Brandon was saying. And there's definitely a big difference
just to stay positive and just bring positive energy to our huddles and stuff.  
  
Q. Brandon, Illini Nation is in the house, there's more orange in that arena
than any other school that's here. How important is that to you guys and did
that even help you when times got a little tough in the second half?  
BRANDON PAUL: Yeah, that's really important for us. They're a great fan base.
Orange crush was always with us. We're at home or whatnot, they travel with
us. And we got Illini all over the world. Every we're we go, we see orange. So
having their support behind us through the ups and downs definitely goes a
long way. We feed off their energy making baskets at the end, making plays,
and we appreciate all the support we can get. We're going to continue to feed
off their energy.  
  
Q. Brandon, you talked about this a little bit yesterday about not wanting
this to be over. Talk about what it means to have it not over and was there,
did you have a moment when you thought it might be over?  
BRANDON PAUL: No. I think if we had that type of moment it means we have given
up. We're a team that never gives up. So we like to finish everything. Down
the stretch things weren't going well for us, but we kept playing, kept
fighting. D.J.'s in my ear telling me just to make plays and don't worry about
what happened before. So we got a lot of guys that continue to make plays and
now we're on to the next. Our focus was on Colorado and now it's on Miami.  
  
Q. What does it mean to be able to get this one?  
BRANDON PAUL: It means a lot. Obviously just to be able to advance, we got
guys on the team, this is their first time advancing in the tournament, first
time being in the tournament. Me and D.J. have some experience in this and now
that we are advancing we want to continue to survive and advance pretty much.  
  
Q. For D.J. or Brandon, is the shooter's mentality just to have a short
memory and if they're not falling just keep shooting and trusting yourself
that eventually they're going to fall down.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: We're mature players. We have been in college for four years,
we have been through up‑and‑downs throughout our careers. We are shooters, we
both can shoot. We're going to keep shooting even if they don't fall. We keep
defending‑‑ that's the main thing, if we defend, we'll find some ways to score
somewhere down the line and that's what we did tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student‑athletes go and we'll take questions for
Coach Groce now.  
  
Q. Have you ever been a part of a team that went through a 23 ‑0 run and
still came out and won?   
COACH GROCE: I don't know if I have. I said that to the staff after the game.
It was an odd game. Again, give them a lot of credit. I thought we played
really well at both ends in the first half. Maybe as complete a half as we
have played in a while. It was really encouraging.  
Then to start the second half I didn't think our defense was quite as good at
the start. The second half, I thought our offense was good again, but we
didn't make shots. And then they made the run and then that's when I thought
our offense sputtered a little bit.  
So we used a couple timeouts there to try to refocus us back to center field a
little bit. But give them a lot of credit, they were physical in the second
half, they were aggressive. I thought that at both ends of the floor they were
aggressive. But long answer to your question, no, I don't think I‑‑ I mean, it
was a strange game in that regard.  
  
Q. The players were asked something similar to this, but how did you try to
refocus them during timeouts, maybe try to make them forget about that run,
because you were still down only maybe five points.  
COACH GROCE: Well, we talk a lot about controlling the controllables. And
that's the only things in the ‑‑ we talk about driving the car and looking
ahead and we can't look in the rear view mirror. Nothing's going to change.
The score is the score, they're not changing the score. We had to find a way
to kind of grind and figure it out. I thought our defense was really good late
in the game, as I mentioned at the outset here, during that 16‑2 run. I
thought that was the difference.  
  
Q. Looking at shooting 13 percent in the second half, and still winning by
almost double digits. How does that happen? How do the numbers add up?  
COACH GROCE: I couldn't tell you. It's similar to the question that the
gentleman here asked just a second ago, but we found a way. As I said at the
beginning, this team, it's been a fun team to coach, an interesting team. They
found ways in a lot of different situations where their backs have been
against the wall and today was another prime example of that.  
  
Q. You always say seniors die hard. Talk about Brandon and D.J., and if they
were saying anything while the run was happening in the 21 ‑0 run that
Colorado had.   
COACH GROCE: Yeah, they were talking about staying poised and being positive.
That's what we have tried to do all year. We want positive energy around our
team as much as possible. If we have an issue, I tell them, we correct it and
we move on.  
Obviously we talked strategy in those timeouts. But I thought those guys were
very positive. I thought they did a great job of staying positive and staying
poised. I thought our shot selection got a little bit away from us there when
it got close and they kind of took the lead for about a maybe a four or five
minute span. And then we kind of got‑‑ that's when I meant by getting
refocused. We got a little bit better at that point.  
  
Q. Wondering how much you've watched Miami and what do you think of them as
your next opponent?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I don't know, obviously, a lot about them at this point. We
deal one game at a time. We have done that all year. I know that they have got
great size, I know they're going to play very hard. I've watched Coach
Larranaga's teams, not only at Miami, but also at George Mason previously,
they're very well coached. I know that Larkin is a terrific player at the
guard position. I'm sure I'll learn a lot more here over the next few hours.  
  
Q. A lot was talked about going into the game about how good they are at
rebounding the ball, especially Andre Roberson. You guys actually came out on
top. Talk about how well you did crashing the boards.  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, sure, we did some really good things on the defensive end
when you look at it as a whole. I think a big part of that was defensive
rebounding. We had 11 offensive rebounds to their eight. 12 turnovers to their
15. So that's a plus six possession battle. Which I think is huge in a game
that's nip and tuck like that down the stretch. I thought for the most part we
did a very good job of rebounding.  
  
Q. Did you expect to turn them over as much as you did in the first half and
did you see that as a way to get your lead?  
COACH GROCE: We wanted to be really aggressive. I thought that was really
important. I know there's been times where they have turned the ball over here
and there, as you watch them on film. But I think to say that you're going to
count on them turning it over as much as they did in the first half, I don't
know, that may be fools gold.  
But I thought we were really aggressive in the first half, got some
deflections. We were active defensively and did a good job of turning them
over as well as affecting shot percentage and defensive rebounding the ball
well. I thought overall as a whole our defense was pretty good, other than
maybe the first, you know, five to eight minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. I kind of know the answer to this, but do you worry that this takes a lot
out of the kids to play in two days? How do you get ready to go again?  
COACH GROCE: Well, they're obviously they're 18 to 22 years old. There's a
reason why we do strength and conditioning, there's a reason why we play the
schedule we play, we do the things we do, is to prepare for these type of
moments.  
I think our guys know that this is‑‑ I said it before‑‑ this is a special
opportunity. We'll be able to, I think, rev it back up again on Sunday, no
question about it. The next 48 hours is critical. We'll do a lot of things to
help get their minds and bodies back.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 21, 2013

  

### [Austin Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24981)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Rodney Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23370)

  
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the Minnesota
student‑athletes. Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Rodney, when you had the shoulder strain, right before the Wisconsin game
or Illinois game, was that a bigger issue than you first thought it was?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: Yeah, that was definitely a big bigger issue than I thought
it was going to be. But our trainers, they helped me get into the training
room every day, get treatment every day, and they got me back as fast as
possible.  
  
Q. When did you feel like you were back to a hundred percent or are you back
to a hundred percent?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: Probably after that Ohio State game. It was still bothering
me a little bit after that, but up until the next game, I was getting a lot of
extra treatment and stuff like that, so after that game is when I felt back to
normal.  
  
Q. Rodney, a lot of stats have you guys as one of the best rebounding teams
in the country. What is the key to good rebounding and why are you guys so
good at it?  
RODNEY WILLIAMS: We just crash the boards real hard. We see a shot go up and
we just head to the basket. We got a guy in Trevor Mbakwe, that's just about a
double digit rebound guy a game. So when you got somebody inside that can be
there for you, you're going to end up one of the best rebounding teams in the
country.  
  
Q. UCLA conversely is a very poor rebounding team. Is that something you
think can you exploit tomorrow?  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: Yeah, I think that's something that we're going to try to
exploit. It's just like Rodney said, we got some really good rebounders in
Trevor and himself. And they have to get good position. And we crash the
boards really hard, so that's something that we're going to try to do well.  
  
Q. Austin, you guys have been favored in this game, even though you're an 11
seed. Do you pay attention to that at all and does that give you any
confidence going into this?  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: No, we don't really pay too much attention to that. We're just
going to go into the game and try and play our best basketball, regardless of
who the opponent is, regardless of the seed. I really don't think that the
seeds matter.  
UCLA is going to be a tough team and I think that we're a tough team to deal
with. So it's just going to be a matter of going out there and who wants it
more.  
  
Q. Austin, is there a certain pace of the game that you guys feel
comfortable playing at? Do you want to keep the pace in your favor in
tomorrow's game?  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I think that we can play a lot of different paces, but the one
thing that we do want to do is control the tempo. We want to keep the tempo in
our favor. Whether that means running the floor or slowing it down and getting
into a set, half court offense, but we like to get out in transition and get a
lot of points that way.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of people who have said, after watching the Big ‑10
season, that all the Big‑10 teams are going to be relieved to get into a
tournament where they're not beating each other up like you guys have done the
last couple months and that it might bring out more offense in all these
teams. How much do you think that's likely to happen?   
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I think that it's pretty likely. It is tough in the Big‑10,
with it being the toughest conference in the country, getting out of the
conference is exciting. Not only to play against other teams, but being in the
NCAA tournament. So I think that it will be something different for us. We'll
be really pumped up to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll let you go. We'll take an
opening statement from Coach Smith.  
COACH SMITH: Well, we're very excited to be here in Austin. To be a part of
this tournament is always special time. It's probably the greatest show on
earth. So we're really ‑‑ we know we're going to have our hands full against a
very good UCLA team.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Questions?  
  
Q. So with a 15 ‑1 start and a 5‑11 finish, how do you explain how that
happened and what are your thoughts about being able to make that 15‑1 start
more like how you play moving forward now?   
COACH SMITH: Well, we know we got off to a good start. Again, your non‑league
schedule's always a time to iron out any wrinkles you might have, any problems
you might have. And we got off to a good start and then we had a tough loss at
Indiana. And we just never seemed to get back our footing because it's tough,
when you get on that roll, and we couldn't get out. Our confidence was shaken.
Some tough losses at Northwestern, and others. And then we had some guys that
went through there where Rodney Williams had hurt his shoulder and didn't
play, didn't log many minutes at all. He's an integral part of our team.  
Those are no excuses, we still have a very experienced team and I thought that
we would do better in the conference play, but we also had some close games
and games that we just didn't do a good job of taking care of the basketball.
One of the things was, our biggest issue all year long was turnovers, too many
turnovers. And that's something we have tried to remedy. Even in our last
outing we had 19. So that's been a real challenge for us, even though we have
been a good rebounding team.  
But anyhow, as a coach, you have those ‑‑ a year ago we went through a
situation where we lost six games in a row. We would win three in a row and
then lose four in a row. We won two in a row, we lose two in a row. It was,
the inconsistency that we had was very troublesome. But again, we did enough,
I think, based on us being here, to warrant us being in this tournament and we
believe we're a team that ‑‑ because we beat some very good teams as well.  
  
Q. There's a lot of speculation because the Big ‑10 was so good that all the
Big‑10 teams after, now that they're not beating each other up any more, that
the offense might come out a lot more fluidly for all of you. How much
validity do you put into that?   
COACH SMITH: Well, everybody's a ‑‑ when you get to this point a lot of teams
haven't watched you play, but everybody has video on you and they have ‑‑ you
can watch games 24 hours a day. It used to be that it was difficult to get
footage, film on players and teams. But in this day and time, it's‑‑ I don't
disagree with that, I think that ‑‑ I hope that's right. I hope we can.  
You know, UCLA‑‑ it's the style of play that you compete against too‑‑ UCLA is
a team that they want to get it up‑and‑down the court, they have an
outstanding point guard in Larry Drew, II, they have their big men run the
floor extremely well.  
So having said that, I think we have a team that's sort of built to do that.
So I suspect that our guys will be comfortable playing this UCLA team that
plays similar to the way we want to play.  
  
Q. We asked Ben Howland the same thing about how he felt his players have
dealt with adversity this year and how he's dealt with it personally. Can you
talk about that a little bit.  
COACH SMITH: About how I dealt with it? Well, I've been blessed with ‑‑ Ben
has had his situation. Everybody's different. Every situation is different.
And how you handle it is all about how you handle those things. Because it's
going to come.  
Whether it's players transferring or injuries, whatever. But Ben Howland has
probably handled it as well as anybody in the country, under the microscope
that he's under at UCLA.  
In our situation, at Minnesota, where some of the losses or the tough, you
know, being inconsistent, that's the adversity that we have dealt with. Not so
much injuries, as we had the year before.  
But, again, you overcome it. And certainly they did it the right way. I mean,
they went on to win the PAC‑12\. So he did a remarkable job. We didn't do so
well in handling our adversity of not playing well, which it wasn't because of
injuries or transfers, it was just because I think our confidence was shaken.
But I thought we righted the ship when we had to, got some big wins when we
had to, and that's why we are here playing in the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, with UCLA's bench the way it is, just fairly limited, are you guys
looking to do some more pressing and things like that to try wear them out
early?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we haven't been very good in pressing this year. That's
something that we have hoped that we would be a better team extending our
defense, forcing some turnovers, more opportunities and more possessions by
turning people over. But we weren't very good. We have always been one of the
top teams in the league in steals. It wasn't, I don't know where we finished
this year, but we weren't very good.  
So those are areas that we have had to adapt and adjust to all year long. Not
being able to get the output that we wanted from our bench, because it doesn't
matter how many players you play, it's how good those players play that are
playing.  
So we haven't, so we have got to constantly look and try to find that guy that
can step up and do the job, Elliott Eliason has been the most consistent
player off the bench. Maverick has given us some good play off the bench
lately, they have been doing it most of the year, and I think has given us
some good minutes off the bench. But we would like to see more out of Oto and
some of the other players that we need to step up.  
So I don't know that‑‑ because they're a pretty good ball handling team‑‑ they
led the PAC‑12 in assists. So it's ‑‑ I'm not sure if that's the best strategy
to employ.  
  
Q. Do you have a preference, do you think that you found a preference
between playing a really long bench and playing a shorter bench? There have
been times in the Illinois game that you played basically six guys in the
second half.  
COACH SMITH: Yeah. I tried a little bit of everything, haven't I? I mean, it's
been up‑and‑down. We have tried to go with a deep bench, we haven't been
productive. We have gone with a short bench and haven't been productive. But
we have been productive too. It's been inconsistent.  
We have played a lot of guys and it's paid. And we played a few guys in some
games and it's paid off and vice versa. So just maybe if I would answer your
question, have I found it? No. A hell of a thing to be saying right now, isn't
it?  
  
Q. Maybe you can speak to this, having coached in Lexington, under a
microscope like you were talking about with Ben Howland, does that inevitably
affect a coach's psyche? Obviously even if they're not telling people, is
there a wearing affect to being under microscope like that in Lexington or in
L.A. like Ben Howland is?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we all have our ways of dealing with anything, whether it's
stress or pressure. And I know Coach Howland has done a remarkable job of it,
done an outstanding job. And he still has been able to ‑‑ and he won
conference championships.  
So it's there, it's real, it's out there. So, as coaches though, we deal with
that as part of the job. Part of any job, really. You have deadlines, you have
all types of things that go on. It's just that we deal with it in the public
eye and you deal with it with very fragile people that aren't fully developed
mentally, emotionally, physically. So there's that element in it. And we're
their parents, their surrogate parents. So you really take it hard when
something happens, good or bad, especially bad, that's going to distract or
detract that player from being the best they could be or growing the way you
want them to grow and helping the team be better.  
And then all the other psychological things that go along with growing up in
that type of, in the environment that we're in. I'm talking about media
scrutiny, social network. I mean, it's just remarkable. I'm amazed at how
young people handle it today. I mean I really am. I'm the biggest fan of the
young people, especially athletes, and the ones that I have the good fortunate
to coach and what they have to handle on a regular basis. And the choices that
they have to make constantly. I mean constantly.  
  
Q. All your film, except for maybe one game with UCLA, is with Jordan Adams.
What can you expect without him tomorrow?  
COACH SMITH: I thought that they played pretty good against a very good Oregon
team. And certainly they, looking down the stretch to see, that they have got,
I know they will have to use more of Norman Powell and David Wear. So they
have got some very talented people that were playing a lot of minutes to start
with. Adams was averaging 22 minutes a game, so it wasn't like he wasn't
playing. And so he's used some people. When I say that Coach Howland has used
his bench maybe sparsely, but people who did play have done a pretty good job.  
So I would imagine it's another opportunity for players like Tony Parker and
Norm Powell to step up and play well. I mean, usually that's what happens when
a guy sees an opportunity, they raise their level of play.  
  
Q. Tubby, you guys are actually a three point favorite in this game as the
11 seed over the six seed. Why do you think that is and do you see some ‑‑ how
do you see the matchup going?   
COACH SMITH: Well, I really don't pay much attention to who is favored. Every
team has to come out there and play well. I would imagine it's because of the
loss of Jordan Adams. That and the time that they had to prepare. But they
have had time to make adjustments, UCLA has had time to prepare for us like we
have had time to prepare for them.  
It's tough to lose a player of that caliber. He's averaging 15 points a game,
doing some good things. So I imagine that's why they have been ‑‑ other than
that, that's the only thing I can pinpoint.  
I think that it's based on us coming off of the last three games we played.
It's a tough one. But so we have ‑‑ I don't know. We have had the good
fortunate to play in a tournament last year with our team, maybe that has
something to do with it. We played well and we had pretty much the same people
back. But I couldn't tell you why.  
I think it's a good matchup. Although, they are very long and probably taller
than we are in most positions, probably every position. So that's, again,
maybe the depth, our bigs, we play a lot of guys. But you heard me talk about
the inconsistency that we have had there. But I think our guys are ready for
the challenge. We'll see what happens.  
  
Q. What does it mean to this team and this program to get back into the NCAA
tournament and to be here in Austin?  
COACH SMITH: Well, let's see? UCLA's been here what? 45 times or something? We
have been here 12. It means an awful lot. Fortunately, we have been here three
times, three of the 12 times, so we feel pretty good what we have been doing.  
We're still trying to grow the program. I think it's still, we still have a
long way to go. Obviously recruiting is important. Obviously this type of
exposure is very helpful to galvanizing people, getting people excited about
Gopher basketball. That's why it's important that we develop some continuity,
some consistency in making it to the NCAA.  
But it's not easy. There's a lot of teams, a lot of guys that would love to be
here. So we really feel good about this group and what they have been able to
achieve, and what we have been able to achieve with this program over the last
few years.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the student‑athletes of
Illinois.  
  
Q. Brandon, Colorado has said that Andre Roberson is going to check you at
the beginning of the game. What do you see from him on film on what's the key
to playing against him?  
BRANDON PAUL: Robinson's a real athletic kid. He lives on the rebounding and
he's like a double digit guy every night. I know he's real athletic, so it's
going to be challenge, but we put ourselves in position to be successful. And
I know my teammates are going to do a good job of getting me in positions to
score.  
  
Q. How concerned have you guys been with their length? Big team.  
BRANDON PAUL: I don't think we're real concerned. We're a pretty athletic
team. We got guys, that if our guys are smaller, they makeup with their
athleticism. They're a team that's has a lot of balanced scoring and a lot of
size. But as long as we play our game, I think we'll be in good shape.  
  
Q. Particularly for Sam and Tyler, answer the same question.  
SAM MCLAURIN: Coming from the league that we played in all year, we're kind of
used to being one of the smaller teams inside. So I think our body of work
this entire season has prepared us for a moment like this.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: We got a lot of size too. We have been going up against bigger
guys the whole year.  
  
Q. Tyler, when you have a big scoring night, is it because you're feeling
it, is it because of situations that leave you open? What are sort of the
ingredients that make for a game when you have a good offensive game?  
TYLER GRIFFEY: I just try to do whatever it takes to help the team win. When I
get an opportunity to score or to shoot to the best of my ability I take them.  
But a lot of my job is to do little things too, rebounding, boxing out, and
just playing solid defense.  
  
Q. Tyler, when you went through that long stretch there where you were 0 for
whatever on the 3's, can you talk about what the response and the support was
like from coaches and players, and how important that was and getting you back
on track.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Unbelievable. They knew I was in the gym, I was working so hard
trying to get one to fall. But coach just did a good job, he kept drawing
place up for me to get open shots. Teammates kept feeding me when I was open
and they all had confidence in me and I was able to knock down the next one.  
  
Q. For Brandon and D.J., you guys have said repeatedly you kind of want to
leave a mark or all of you want to leave a mark on this program. How important
is this week for you guys to take that step and to do something for the
program?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: It's a big step for us. Obviously we have been through a lot
in our careers. We're looking for the big matchup tomorrow. We just want to
have fun and go out there with a bang. It's our last ‑‑ this could possible be
our last game tomorrow, but at the same time we are going to come out and
fight and have fun at the same time.  
BRANDON PAUL: Opening up the season with the Maui, with that championship,
that gave us a lot of confidence for the year. So I think we did a lot of good
things this year to look back on as seniors regardless of the outcome
tomorrow. But like he said, we're going to go out and compete. We're not ready
for it to be over yet.  
We got a good team ahead of us in Colorado, so we're looking forward to the
challenge but we're going to compete and we're going to leave it on the floor.  
  
Q. Sam, you know these are unchartered waters for you, this the is the first
time in the tournament what's the experience been like?  
SAM MCLAURIN: Oh, man, it's been unbelievable. Getting that police escort to
the gym. That's pretty awesome. But, no, it's everything I expected it to be.
The team, a lot of the younger guys haven't experienced this as well. So we're
all pretty excited about it. And we're looking to do some good things
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about the new coaching staff and how you guys
embraced them and how early that process began and what it's been like for
them.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: It's been great. We have a mature team, everyone been in
since day one. We trust what the coaches have to say. Coming off a strong
season that they had over in Ohio, it was exciting. They got here, from day
one everybody on the team bought in. I think we showed a lot of maturity.  
BRANDON PAUL: Basically what he said, the coaches came in the with the mindset
that they wanted to win and they didn't want this to be a rebuilding year. And
we had the same mindset. A lot of people petitioned us to come in and just
play, but we competed, we wanted to win and we did that. Starting out early we
had a great non‑conference schedule and we finished in our conference good.  
So with them coming in and they put a lot of trust in us and I think we just
were on the same page and it just helped us build a relationship with the
coaches.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Coach and his staff have done a great job from day one.
Building relationships with us on and off the court and just in gaining our
trust. Each day that goes by, we know that the success that he's had last year
at this tournament and it's something that we can look forward and build on.  
SAM MCLAURIN: When they recruited me to come in, they were saying Meyers has
just left, first round, so a lot of people was doubting him. Saying that it
wouldn't be a team able to make the tournament. And this team hasn't been to
the tournament in a few years.  
So we all accepted the challenge. We knew it would be tough, but we knew we
had to fill the void that Meyers left as a unit. And we were able to come out
and do some good things.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to see Austin at all? Is there anything about it
from just getting ready for Colorado that you have done that you can share
that you've enjoyed?  
BRANDON PAUL: No, we pretty much, we went to the Vince Young restaurant and
ate there. It was really good steaks there. And Vince Young was in the house
so that was pretty cool.  
But aside from that, we have been riding around, getting to practice, to the
hotel and getting prepared for the game tomorrow. I don't think anything else
is really as important as the preparation for the game. So that's about it.  
  
Q. For Brandon, D.J. and Tyler, how does this experience this year compare
to two years ago in Tulsa?  
TYLER GRIFFEY: It means something special for me. Something I'm remember for
the rest of my life. Sophomore year, a couple years ago I wasn't playing as
much, so it's kind of special for me to be a major part of it.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: It was great. To see our name get called to be here.
Obviously it's one of the best tournaments in the country and it's just a
blessing, like I said. It's really that's really all. It just a blessing.  
BRANDON PAUL: A lot of kids wish they were in the position that we are in and
there's nothing more to say than it really is a blessing. This is the second
time we have been able to do this and we want to take advantage of this and
just get everything we can out of it. We want to look back on this when we're
a little bit older and say that we got to do this. So we're looking to go
forward in this tournament.  
  
Q. Brandon and D.J., Brandon you talked about going up against Roberson with
him guarding you, D.J., Dinwiddie will probably check you. Have you ever seen
defenders that big with that big a wing span? Any guys compare to them?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Well we're four‑year college players and we have been through
a lot, especially playing in the Big‑10, so many great players that have been
through our league. We play like 34 games this year and we experienced a lot
of things. So obviously they're pretty good guys, overall long length,
six‑six, six‑seven guys that can spread you good on defense, but we played so
many games this year that we should be ready to play them.  
BRANDON PAUL: There's not a lot of different ‑‑ I played against Victor
Oladipo the last few years, so I'm sure obviously he's the defensive Player of
the Year. He's a tough guy to go against.  
And I've seen all types of defense, so going against these guys I'm going to
look at it as if I look at every other game. I'm not going to take them for
granted, I'm not going to be like, oh, these guys can't guard. Clearly,
they're a good team that defend well or they wouldn't be in the tournament. I
just got to make sure I'm cautious, I take care of the ball.  
Scoring's not going to be an easy task, but at the same time I'm a gifted
scorer, I know that, the team knows that, so I'm going to look forward to my
God given abilities and my teammates and coaches putting me in a position to
score, because that's what I do best.  
  
Q. For any or all of you guys, knowing that Coach Groce has won in this
tournament as a 13 and a 14 seed, what are your impressions of that? What does
that mean to you guys?  
SAM MCLAURIN: It just shows us that if we listen to him and we execute the
game plan that he provides for us, it gives us a good opportunity to win. He's
won with lesser talent and we have the talent to win games in this tournament.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: It means he knows what he's doing. When he says something, when
he's had success at this level, we trust that when he says something, it's
going to work.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: He knows what he's doing. Obviously the staff, they do a
great job with the scouting report and just them as well, getting us prepared
for the game.  
So even though Coach Groce did get a lot of credit with for what he does, the
staff does a huge part for our game plan.  
BRANDON PAUL: Yeah, he's been here before, he's been where we want to go, and
as a senior, we, me, Tyler and D.J. we made it past our first round our
sophomore year. But Sam, none of us have been past that. And they have done it
a few times.  
So just having that coaching staff, they have had the greatest amount of trust
in us throughout the year and we're going to continue to move forward with
them. We're looking forward to the challenge tomorrow. I think that they keep
us prepared and we're going to stay prepared.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll start with an opening statement from Coach
Groce.  
COACH GROCE: Well, obviously I'm excited for the University of Illinois and
for our basketball program, our seniors, our players, that we have an
opportunity to be in ‑‑ I said all along, it's the world's greatest
tournament. But we're not just excited to be here. Now we are here, we took
step one, we have worked very diligently all week in preparation for
tomorrow's game against Colorado, a very good basketball team. And now step
two is trying to put ourselves in position to survive and advance.  
We have looked at it one game at a time all year, we're going to continue to
do that. Our total focus is on Colorado. Obviously, for us, we feel like it
starts with rebounding. They are a terrific rebounding team. We have got our
work cut out for us on the glass.  
But guys are looking forward to the challenge. And we're enjoying the
experience, but at the same time not totally swallowing it either because we
know we have got a game to play tomorrow at 3:40.  
  
Q. Apparently there's talk that Roberson will match Paul at the start of
this game. I wonder if you would just describe the challenge that Andre
Roberson provides because of his length and his rebounding ability and the
multiple things that he does well.  
COACH GROCE: Well, it doesn't surprise me, because he's done that all year.
He's guarded the other team's best offensive player a lot. He's, he obviously
is defensive Player of the Year in PAC‑12 for a reason.  
But I want to make one thing crystal clear. It's not Roberson versus Paul
tomorrow and Paul versus Roberson, it's Illinois versus Colorado. I think that
Brandon, as an older player, understands that. Obviously he's an important
part of what we do, just like Roberson is an important part of what Colorado
does. So we'll take that for what its worth.  
In terms of his talents and abilities, I think obviously everyone talks about
his motor, his length, his ability to anticipate, to get deflections, whether
it's steals or blocked shots. But the thing I appreciated the most watching
him is his intelligence. I think in addition to all those intangibles that I
just talked about that he has on the defensive end, I think his IQ's
tremendous. I watch him on film and then to see how he anticipates, his
vision, which also makes him a great defender.  
  
Q. I think it was Tom Izzo who said after the Big ‑10 tournament how
relieved he was to see a team that's not in the Big‑10 win the tournament
game. Do you feel the same way?  
COACH GROCE: No question. Obviously it was a lot of fun though. It was a
tremendous challenge all 18 games, plus the Big‑10 tournament. I think you
learn a lot playing against the competition that we played against, the venues
where we played, different styles that we played, the different coaching
philosophies and coaching styles as well.  
So it was great. We learned a lot about our team. And we certainly wouldn't,
we would do it all over again. It was an exciting race. But now we moved on to
‑‑ season three for us was the Big‑10 tournament, season four is the NCAA
tournament, and now our focus is on Colorado.  
  
Q. John, is it different for you playing with Illinois than it was when you
were a double digit seed at Ohio?  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, I've been asked that. Our preparation has been very
similar. Our mindset's the same. Last year we were looking at our first round
opponent and saying, what do we have to do to survive and advance against that
particular opponent.  
That's no different this year than approaching the Colorado game tomorrow.  
I do think the experiences that we have had in the past in the tournament has
certainly been helpful. There's no question about it. I know it's helped us,
helped me. Just little things, in terms of how you plan itinerary and when you
practice and how long and all those different things over the years that you
learn by being a part of the tournament. So from that standpoint, grateful for
those opportunities.  
  
Q. When you took over this program, did you talk NCAA tournament with this
group right away or did you want to see how they responded to you guys and
vice versa or how did the season progress?  
COACH GROCE: Honestly, the first thing I wanted to do was kind of evaluate
where we are in a lot of areas. Just kind of listen and watch and get to know
our players. That was the No. 1 thing. I spent a lot of time with those guys
as our assistant coach he's did as well. I'm one of those guys that really
believes you can't coach your players unless you know your players.  
So it's their team. I've told them that all along. I feel blessed to have a
chance to be at Illinois, it's one of the greatest institutions in the
country. I feel grateful to have a chance to coach this group. And I really
wanted to get to know them and find out, what do you guys want to do.  
Obviously, one of their goals, they wanted to have a chance to get into this
tournament. Knowing, as I instructed them and told them, hey, to have a chance
to survive and advance in the tournament, you have to be in it first.  
They were able to do that through a lot of, quite honestly, our guys call them
doubters and haters. There were a lot. There were a lot early. And then we got
off to a great start and then there was a lot after we got into the rough
patch there in the Big‑10 schedule.  
But they stayed the course. I appreciate the way they fought. We never
deviated. We stuck to the plan. The guys showed great poise. And we just kept
learning and getting a little bit better and getting a little bit better and
we were able to put ourselves in a position where we have an opportunity to
play tomorrow against Colorado.  
  
Q. What are you doing ‑‑ with so many seniors, what are you doing to try to
keep them loose instead of thinking about tomorrow could be their last game?  
COACH GROCE: If you would have went to dinner with us last night you wouldn't
have worried about loose. They were loose last night at dinner. They were
loose on the bus. My secretary has traveled with us for this particular trip
and she said to me, how often are they like that? And I said, oh, about all
the time.  
So we're ‑‑ we say all the time in this time of year and in general, we want
to be mentally focused or tight, but physically loose. And I think we have got
guys that are that way. Our assistant coaches do a great job of talking to
them, and again, it gets back to knowing your guys. Knowing what works for
them. And our group is, I think for the most part, been a pretty confident and
loose group.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, coach. We're going to let you go. Thank you.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with questions for the
student‑athletes of Miami.  
  
Q. If all four of you wouldn't mind just answering, it's really kind of the
first time big NCAA tournament, what has it been like so far? I know it's been
only a little amount of time. But what's it been like so far?  
KENNY KADJI: It's been great. We have been surrounded with a lot of people.
It's been fun. Everybody's talking about it. We can make a big run here we
think. It's just been nice and a good experience for us so far.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: It's been a lot of excitement. Especially for our university,
as a whole, being back into the NCAA tournament and having the chance to
really represent our university and our entire city of Miami in a positive
manner. So it's been a lot of excitement and really excited to play our first
game.  
SHANE LARKIN: It's been really exciting.  
  
Q. How about specifics? Anything specific that's happened?  
SHANE LARKIN: Well, like the send off when we left to go to come up here from
the university, there was a lot of people out there. A lot of media, just
asking us questions. And that was fun. So it's been real fun. Hopefully we can
just keep it up and keep playing more and more games to the championship.  
DURAND SCOTT: Couldn't agree with these guys any more. It's been an exciting
time. Just a great experience with my teammates and basically just living in
the moment.  
Just being on the bus with these type of guys and just to see the smiles on
their faces. The excitement going around the room, I'm pretty sure there's
some butterflies because this is our first time here, but I think we're ready
for the moment. We're well prepared. So we're enjoying the process.  
  
Q. What's the new haircut?  
JULIAN GAMBLE: I got a little mohawk going with a little bit of Chris Anderson
with what my teammates been saying about the Miami heat. So just trying to
increase the intimidation factor on the court.  
  
Q. Durand, all your teammates call you the heart and sole of this team, how
does that make you feel?  
DURAND SCOTT: I can't let them down. I know that at any given moment I have to
step up. Have to be there for them in any given way, whichever way they need
it. Mentally, physically, just go down for a loose ball, making a shot, making
a key defensive stop.  
But that wouldn't happen without these guys. They helped me to become the
player I am today. So I'm very thankful to have players like these two right
here at the podium with me.  
  
Q. Kenny, what was your reaction when you found out that Florida was kind of
in the same pod here, being that you started your career with the Gators?  
KENNY KADJI: I was excited. I get to see all my old teammates and old coaching
staff and everything. I don't have anything but respect for them. I just saw
them coming in here and everybody was happy to see me, happy to see them. It
was a great time, a great two years at the university of Florida. And I
couldn't be more happy that I had the opportunity to experience that?  
  
Q. Billy mentioned earlier this season that he felt like maybe just you
needed a change of scenery, a fresh start and that the talent was always
there. Just what was your mindset leaving and how have things kind of
materialized for you at Miami?  
KENNY KADJI: I wanted to start anew. And Miami was recruiting me out of high
school, so I went there. And my brother was going to school there, so that
sealed the deal for me. So, yeah, just a fresh start for me.  
  
Q. Durand and Julian, talk about the impact coach has made since he's been
here. Obviously pretty successful two seasons so far with him.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: The impact has been tremendous. It's almost hard to put in
words how he's really changed the culture of our entire team. And just around
the university as a whole.  
He's really gotten us back to worrying about the fundamentals of the game and
doing little things well. If you think about good teams, that he's what good
teams do, they're very disciplined, they do the little things well.  
And they're going to go out and give you a consistent, hard effort. It's
something that you're going to remember after you play them. So with that
being said ‑‑ just the amount of poise that he brings to the sidelines and to
every practice and at the same time he wants us to have a lot of fun. So just
him being around it's been really good for us.  
DURAND SCOTT: I couldn't agree with him more. He's a guy who came with the
right mindset to get things done and, thus far, he's been doing exactly what
he has said. We know this is a guy that came in and has brought in a group of
guys together and formed a tremendous team. And just embraced it and just did
great with the community and the fans and things like that. So it all started
with him and we just want to go out there and just make his word come true.  
  
Q. For Shane and Julian, can you talk about what it's like being in the
favorite role here, like Pacific was in here before. And how does it feel
going against a team like Pacific where they're just talking about how they're
hoping to have some kind of chance against the big time Miami team and you
guys have always been kind of the underdog for a long time. How does it feel
to be in this position?  
SHANE LARKIN: It's good feeling knowing that they respect us that much. But
they made the tournament just like we did. They won their conference
tournament. We did too. So they're a great team. We have the higher seed so
that's kind of what makes us the favorite, but they're a great team.  
We have watched film on them, they have great players, they're very talented.
So we've got to come out with a lot of intensity and focus and really lock in
on the defensive side of the ball. I think if we do that, we'll have a great
success in the game.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: Being the favorite is, it's a respect thing. You like having
that amount of respect coming from a different team.  
But at the same time you have to go out and play the game. It can't be a
situation where you look at the amount of credit and respect another team has
given you and thinking that they're going to go out and lay down for you and
let them win. They want to win just as bad as we do.  
And they have an equal chance of winning this game and a national championship
as anybody else, in my opinion, because you have to go out there and play the
game. I think that now in college basketball seeds mean a lot less because you
see these Mid Major teams beating these high major teams on a more consistent
basis. So we still have to go out there and play the game.  
  
Q. Shane, what have you learned specifically from Durand? What are some of
the lessons that you learned as a guard?  
SHANE LARKIN: Just to be a leader. Basically. He's very experienced, he's been
successful all four years here. He started every game. So just to be very
poised on the court. He never gets too high. He's an emotional player, he
shows his emotions on the court.  
When a big play happens, he shows his emotions for his teammates. And he's
always there to encourage you when bad things happen. So just to be a leader
and always have support for your teammates out on the court and watching him
play with the intensity he does, it motivates me to go out there and play with
the same amount of intensity that he does. So that's probably what I've
learned the most from him.  
  
Q. It probably seems like 20 years ago now from when we saw you play. But
talk about how your game has evolved and what you worked on to bring yourself
to this point. And for the other players can you talk about what Kenny means
to this team. Not just on the floor as well as over the court.  
KENNY KADJI: I've been able to do more things here at Miami, you know. Just
playing my game, shoot the ball more, put the ball on the floor, and get on
the post. I think that at Florida my role was a little bit different. I had to
be more of a defensive guy. And I was playing more in the post. Here I just
expanded my game and I put the ball on the floor, try to make plays and try to
score the ball more.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: He's brought a completely new dimension to our team. His impact
has been unquestionable, the impact that he's made on some of these games.
He's an all‑conference player. So it's always good when you can add an
all‑conference player to your roster. Him being ‑‑ the fact that he has been
on both the offensive and defensive end has really helped us in some of these
big time games. He's come up big for us.  
SHANE LARKIN: His impact is incredible. You know when he is not on the court
because the defense can shrink in. But with him as a stretch four, it puts a
lot of pressure on the defense, because you can't leave him open at the
3‑point line.  
And it opens a lot of driving lanes for me and the other guards. So his impact
is definitely huge and on the defensive side he's a great shot blocker. So he
intimidates people at the rim. So everything he does on the court is great for
us. Off the court he's a funny guy, he has a great spirit.  
PLAYER #2: He's always making people laugh. So he's just a great guy overall.  
DURAND SCOTT: Yeah, Kenny's great. It's a tremendous help to our team, because
he's so versatile. He's like a big guard who is able to put the ball on the
floor, who is always able to shoot, dribble, things like that. So he helps the
other four players on the court because he's so great with what he does. So
I'm very thankful to have Kenny and we want to keep rolling with him.  
  
Q. Coming fresh off of your ACC regular season winning and the winning the
tournament, any added pressure right now just to prove yourselves that being a
two seed rather than a one seed really proving to people that you do belong in
this tournament and you are a force to be reckoned with.  
JULIAN GAMBLE: I think this team wide there is no added pressure. I think we
play at our best when have a chip on our shoulder. So whether we're a two seed
in the East region are or a one seed overall I think we're going to go out and
continue to play with that chip.  
That's when we're at our best when we're really in attack mode and being
aggressive for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Shane, I read where you asked your dad to take all the NBA draft calls
that are starting to come in. All the attention. How big a help is that for
you to have a guy in the same house that has been through basically what
you've been through, he's been a star and knows how to handle all the
attention.  
SHANE LARKIN: He's huge. I can just go to him with confidence and ask him
anything that I'm feeling. I don't have to hide anything from him because he's
been through it like you said.  
So with all the questions that have come in, I can just go to him and ask him
what he thinks about it. All those good things.  
But right now I'm really just focused on the tournament. He's really helped me
with that. Because he hasn't put any pressure on me on which decision I should
make. He's just really been supportive and he's going to be here today. I'll
see him later on, but he just really wants me to focus on this NCAA tournament
and try to go out there and win these games with me teammates, because that's
the most important thing right now.  
  
Q. For you three seniors, but Shane, if you would like to weigh in as well.
Obviously it's a first time Miami's been in the tournament in a while, but you
guys have a very veteran roster coming in. How much does that help you and how
much do you draw ‑‑ do you feel like that's an advantage for you having that
kind of experience with such a veteran nucleus this season?   
KENNY KADJI: I think we have been through all the games. We have seen all
kinds of situations. With a guy like our coach who took a team already to the
Final Four and an experienced guy like Coach Reid, I mean I think that we can
play any type of game, fast game, slow game, it doesn't matter. And executing,
we're very good at, a very good team at doing that.  
  
Q. For Kenny, can you talk a little bit about the back issue that you had at
Florida, and then talk about how much weight you have lost and how much that's
helped you stay healthy and avoid back issues at Miami?  
KENNY KADJI: I had a herniated disk and I had to get surgery. It kind of ended
my season. So they wanted me to lose like 20, 25 pounds, just to move better
and don't put that much stress on my back and I think I did that. It's been
great for me. I haven't had a problem since. And I've been able to play and be
successful at playing basketball and being a contributor on this team.  
  
Q. What have you guys learned about Pacific this week and what is the
coaching staff kind of gone over what you guys need to do to get the win?  
JULIAN GAMBLE: We have done a lot of study on them. We do our personnel, we
look at their offensive and defensive schemes.  
Defensively they're very aggressive, they have a style where they kind of
choose a player, whether it be a guard or big man, to really full out denial,
where his man has no help responsibility.  
They have a very aggressive guard, and a lot of seniors as well, but they have
bigs that can shoot shots. So we have to really be able to guard the three and
rebound and get out and run in transition.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, gentlemen, we're going to let you go.
We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, first of all, we're very excited to be here. We're a
little bit surprised about the traffic problems you guys have in Austin. We
got here, but we got‑‑ we had a tremendous escort, the police did a fantastic
job of getting us here.  
Now we're very excited to prepare for our big game tomorrow against the
University of Pacific. We have got the utmost respect for Coach Thomason and
his club. And our players, this is the first time any of them will have played
in the NCAA tournament, so they're very excited as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. I read where you were telling trustees back before the season that you
expected things to be good. Talk about the confidence you had in this team
back then even before it started and the satisfaction you have now to be
here.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Last spring when we met with the team, we asked the guys what
kind of season they hoped for, and would they be willing to really sacrifice
and work towards that. But we saw the ingredients that we had and we felt like
if everybody made the necessary sacrifices that we could have a great season.
And all the guys did.  
They stayed all summer long. We had a couple of guys, Julian Gamble, who had
had a bad knee injury the year before and had to red shirt, he rehabbed that
knee, he lost 20 pounds. Kenny Kadji lost 20 pounds. The guys got in a lot
better shape. And as I could see things unfolding coming into the practice
season, in the fall, I could see this team could be very, very special.  
So when I made those comments to the board of trustees, it was with the belief
that if we could stay healthy and continue to make the sacrifices that the
guys were making then, and to continue to work at the level they were working
at, that this could be a very special year. Maybe the best in school history.  
  
Q. I know that you've told the players that you want to be the coach that
has the most fun at this tournament and you want them to be the team that has
the most fun. Can you talk about that and are you really having fun even
though there's a tremendous amount of pressure now, you're one of the top
seeds and everything. Are you having fun and can you just talk about that
whole fun factor?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, the very first thing is, yes, I'm having a heck of a
lot of fun. Last year we didn't get to play in this tournament, you know. We
were bummed that we didn't. And all the players were frustrated that we
didn't. So now that we're in the tournament and we have earned our way in
through the regular season performance and then also to be the tournament
champion, which means the automatic qualifier to get into the tournament,
that's very special. That's a goal that we had before the season that we were
able to accomplish.  
But when you come into a tournament like this, everybody is 0‑0, nobody's won
a game ‑‑ well there are few teams now that have won some in the NCAA
tournament. But we haven't played yet, so us and Pacific, we're 0‑0\. And you
start brand new. And I want the players to enjoy this. For especially our
seniors, this is the one and only time that they will get to experience this.  
What I told them fun is though is not fooling around, it's not being too
serious. Really what fun is, is playing well, being with your teammates, and
practicing well, playing well, performing well. Because basically these kids
have devoted their life to the game of basketball. They spent countless hours
working on their craft. And to have fun means execute and play really, really
well.  
  
Q. One, your thoughts on Pacific. What have you kind of learned this week
and how does it kind of fit into what you guys need to do to win. Then your
thoughts on coaching against Coach Thomason in his final year.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, Coach Thomason is basically a legend. Anybody that can
coach at the same school for 25 years like he has done deserves the utmost
respect. And he has mine and our team's. He has a very specific way of
coaching. Their team is very well disciplined. They run a lot of set plays.
They execute those set plays to perfection. They play several different
defenses and change those defenses constantly, giving you a different look
from time to time throughout the contest.  
We have prepared our team for all those eventualities. And we're going to need
to play very, very well and execute our offensive and defensive game plan if
we expect to move on.  
  
Q. I know it's early and we haven't even played a game in this tournament,
but is there any way to put into comparison to what you were able to do at
George Mason and going to the Final Four and getting this team to where it
is?  
COACH LARRANAGA: The first thing that is a little bit striking is we had great
senior leadership, older guys, actually guys who had red shirted, a guy who
went to prep school. We had three seniors in our starting lineup back then and
two sophomores.  
This Miami team has four seniors in the starting lineup and one sophomore. And
I think that combination of youthful enthusiasm and optimism with experience
and size and toughness, those teams are similar.  
But there's also a lot of differences. That George Mason team was not even
supposed to make the NCAA tournament, according to the experts. This Miami
team won the, not only the regular season, but the ACC tournament and has got
a high seed.  
But as I said, the seeding is not really an issue. Because once you get into
the tournament, everybody's good and you really need to play well to move on.
And that's what we told our George Mason team and that's what we're telling
our Miami team, to advance you got to play well.  
  
Q. You touched on it a little bit there, I was going to ask you about having
so many seniors and in an era when so many teams are built around freshmen who
leave after a year. How much of an advantage do you feel that gives you with
this kind of experience in this era of college basketball?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I thought it gave us a quite an advantage during the
ACC race, because a lot of the teams in the ACC are very, very young, start
two, three freshmen.  
That's not true tomorrow. The University of Pacific has a veteran team as
well. I think they're as old as we are. That means there's really no advantage
for either one of us in that regard.  
  
Q. Talk about Kenny. You mentioned earlier that he had lost the weight. I
covered him at Florida when he had back problems and struggled. Wondered if
you could talk about his transformation and how he has become the kid he is
now, the player he is now, sorry.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, when I first, my staff and I first arrived at the
University of Miami, we spent a lot of time trying to get to know the players.
And Kenny's got a unique personality and he gets along very, very well with my
assistant coaches. I've kind of been the guy who lays the law down.  
But one thing Kenny is a basketball fanatic. He follows the game. He watches
tapes. He knows everything about every college team and NBA team and that
makes him a little bit different than a lot of guys.  
When we told him to lose weight he told me he wanted to gain weight to get
bigger. And I said no, you got to lose weight because the game is running. And
you got to get stronger, but stronger is not weight, stronger is muscle. And
you got to live in the weight room, you got to lose the weight.  
And he did. He really dedicated himself. We already knew he was a great
3‑point shooter. One of the finest stretch fours in the country and has the
ability to make deep threes. But he's also 6‑11 and has a long reach and great
athletic ability in and around the basket.  
So we have tried to take advantage of all of his skills, his inside scoring
ability, as well as his 3‑point shooting. I think he's made a great transition
to this coaching staff and has helped us enjoy the success that we have had.  
  
Q. Shane was already asked in the opening press conference about the NBA
things that are, that he's now turning over to his dad, questions from people
who have NBA questions and all that. How do you keep ‑‑ he's only a sophomore
and you have so much at stake now. How do you keep him from getting distracted
from that kind of talk at this point?   
COACH LARRANAGA: That kind of talk is really the media talking and it's not
him or his family or the coaches or anybody. There's an appropriate time to
discuss things like that. Now is not the appropriate time. He's got a game to
play tomorrow and his focus is on playing as well as he can and helping his
team go as far as it can.  
  
Q. You mentioned having fun and kind of that being the theme for you guys.
Being a number two seed, there's obviously kind of a pressure that comes with
that. Have you guys talked about that at all and how that kind of fits into
what you guys need to do and how to handle it?  
COACH LARRANAGA: You know, again, I think if you start talking about how much
pressure someone is feeling, they start to dwell on that. If you talk about
how much fun you want to have, the players focus on that.  
So I don't talk about pressure at all. We talk about enjoying themselves and
playing the game they love and playing in the venue that they have wanted to
play in. Kind of make dreams come true.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 21, 2013

  

### [Larry Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20855)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Travis Wear](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22869)

  
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the UCLA student‑athletes.
Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. For Larry Drew, II, you're the only one on this team whose been to the
tournament before. Have you kind of taken it upon yourself to talk to the guys
and mentor them through this experience?  
LARRY DREW, II: Yeah, I feel like all year I've been doing that. Just being
the only senior on the team. And we're having a great freshman class come in.
Basically since day one, ever since our summer trip to China, I've basically
just been trying to step up as the only senior on the team and just try to
lead us. And I feel like I've been doing a pretty good job up until now.  
  
Q. What kind of things do you say to them this week?  
LARRY DREW, II: Just try to remain focused, to remain calm. Aside from just it
being a do or die, everything else is still the same. We're still going out
there and playing the same game we have been playing all year. Basically the
only difference is just the hype surrounding everything.  
  
Q. Travis, Minnesota is one of the best rebounding teams in the country. Top
‑10 in rebound margin. What are you guys thinking? Do you know what you're up
against tomorrow on the boards?   
TRAVIS WEAR: Yeah we definitely know what we're up against. We have made that
a main point in practice, rebounding. The team overall is extremely good at
rebounding. They don't shoot the ball particularly well, which means it's
going to be a lot of misses. We need to box them out. We need to go get the
ball and not leak out early in transition.  
  
Q. Travis, can you talk specifically about the challenge of going one
‑on‑one with Mbakwe if that does happen to you?   
TRAVIS WEAR: We have some pretty good bigs that we have played against in this
league, some big teams. Mbakwe, he's big, he's going to be a challenge, but if
I force him off the block, I don't think it will pose that big of a problem,
compared to some of the other guys I played against in the PAC‑12\.  
  
Q. Larry, how did the last few days of practice go when it comes to not
having Jordan. You only had that one night in Vegas. Maybe specifically for
you, trying to fit into some of those plays that Jordan was in for you guys.  
LARRY DREW, II: I think that everybody's been handling it particularly well.
Especially Norman. Norman has had a couple great days in practices these last
couple of days, he's really stepped up.  
The team overall has been stepping up in Jordan's absence. Obviously it's a
major loss to us, but Coach Howland and the rest of the coaching staff,
everybody's done a very good job in preparing us for the coming games.  
  
Q. Are you guys paying attention to the media right now? I know they're
calling you the underdog now and do you guys let that affect you or what kind
of effect is it having?  
LARRY DREW, II: Actually, our first practice back, our locker room had a bunch
of quotes and posts and stuff from just, I mean, people who might be doubting
us. Just from analysts or writers or bloggers or whoever it may be. Coach
obviously feels like ‑‑ well he's noticed it and he definitely wants that to
motivate us. So we got word that people are kind of counting us out, but we
feel like we have been proving people wrong all year. From the start of the
year, kind of coming off or coming out the gates a little bit slow, to winning
the conference, again, at the end of the day there's one ball, there's two
hoops and 10 players out there on the court and they're the same game, we're
just going to go out there and play it.  
  
Q. Larry, do you guys kind of feel like you have something to prove? Maybe
the team and your coach?  
LARRY DREW, II: I feel like that as a ‑‑ I know Coach Howland definitely feels
that way. He definitely feels like just from the seeding to us being the
underdogs, even with the higher seed, he definitely feels like we have
something to prove out there.  
Particularly me myself, I try not to feed into the media or what people are
saying, because, again, the game is still the same. But it's going to be
interesting to see how everything kind of just comes together. Because I know
we're going to be ready.  
Everybody knows what's at stake here, what's on the line. Even for myself,
this is my senior campaign, I don't have any more college games after this, if
I lose. So I'm definitely going to take it upon myself to just to do whatever
it's going to take to lead these guys to a victory.  
  
Q. Is this the first time Coach Howland has used quotes to inspire you guys?
Like quotes of doubt? Or is that something he's done before?  
LARRY DREW, II: I don't think. So I can't remember any other instances this
year. But he's a very passionate person in general. Even more so just as a
coach. So he's just trying to fire us up and I think it's been working,
because we have had some great practices these past couple of days.  
  
Q. For either of you, when you look at Minnesota's roster, is there one guy
in particular that you think, if we can stop this guy, that will be our best
shot?  
TRAVIS WEAR: Looking at their stats, they got a lot of guys that average 10,
11, 9, 10, so they're very balanced in scoring. Obviously the main thing that
stands out with them is their rebounding. I think our main focus is just going
to be to try to beat them on the boards. I think if we do that, keep it close,
we'll be fine.  
As far as shutting one particular player down, that's really not our main
focus. Just playing good team defense, contest shots, don't let them make any
easy ones, and rebound in transition.  
LARRY DREW, II: In my opinion the point guard is the one who controls and
dictates everything out on the floor, so being that their guard, he is the
leading scorer on the team, he takes the most shots, I do believe. But in my
opinion, if I take him out of the game, then the rest of the team will go down
with him. So I'm going to do my best to speed him up, pressure him, and just
do a good job on the defense end of the floor.  
  
Q. We hear all the time about how the Big ‑10 is the best conference in the
country. Just in what you've studied on film so far, or what you've seen out
of them, how does the style or brand of basketball differ from what you guys
play in the PAC‑12?   
TRAVIS WEAR: There's a lot of big physical teams in the Big‑10\. They grind it
out. I feel like a little bit more than the PAC‑12 does. But I think our
conference is going to fair very well in the tournament this year. I think
that we're going to prove that our conference is very tough this year and
equivalent to any other one across the country.  
But we know that Minnesota's going to come and try to grind it out and beat us
on the boards like a lot of the Big‑10 schools like to do.  
  
Q. Larry, you mentioned how this is your last year of playing college
basketball and you were really emotional after Jordan Adams went down in the
locker room. How has the process been over the past couple of days to get past
that and put yourself in a better place?  
LARRY DREW, II: Yeah, it was very emotional, just to see a player of Jordan's
caliber go down the way he did. If you watched the Arizona game, you saw how
many times he was getting hammered and just like slammed to the floor and he
was just jumping right back up. And then go knock down the free throws and
then for him to break his foot closing out on a guy at the end of a game to be
a key player for us. I think it just, it all just hit me pretty hard. I
thought particularly at a time when I found out.  
But honestly, after I got it out, and I was walking back to the hotel, I knew
I had to move on. We couldn't really be stuck on that forever, because we were
going to be playing again. So I shook it off and I got focused and probably
just after that point in time I knew that, okay, the season is not over, so it
didn't really linger too long.  
  
Q. Larry, what have you noticed from their defense on film and do you expect
maybe the type of attention that you got in the Arizona game in the PAC ‑12
semis?   
LARRY DREW, II: I haven't really seen too much of them defensively. The little
bit of tape that we have watched so far was them in transition, a couple of
their plays, and how they like to attack the glass. But I'm sure we're going
to be watching a lot more film of them tonight and tomorrow before the game.
So I have no clue how they're going to be defending me on the pick and roll.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, thank you. We're going to let you go.
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Howland.  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, excited to be here. Proud of the season that our team's
had thus far. Really excited about the opportunity to play against a very good
and very well coached Minnesota team. The film that we watched on them, they
were just really athletic, very strong and physical inside. Williams and
Mbakwe are just seniors. One's a six year senior and they post a lot of
challenges because their strength is rebounding, that's probably our weakness.  
So we're going to have to do a really good job with all five players in there
blocking out and doing their very best to try to minimize their outstanding
rebounding ability.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, with all the guys that Tubby Smith plays on Minnesota, are you
looking to counter that with more guys than typically you play or are you
sticking with the six guys that ‑‑  
COACH HOWLAND: We're going to play seven.  
  
Q. If you do have compounded foul trouble or injury or anything and have to
go beyond seven, what's plan B? Who are the guys that would come in?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well we would bring is Sooren in as our big and probably you
Aubrey in as our small right now and Dave Brown, one of our walk‑ons, that we
did put on scholarship at the beginning of the year, he sustained a sprained
ankle in yesterday's practice. Otherwise it would have been him.  
  
Q. After the Oregon game some of the guys said that they were uncomfortable
with the new adjustments considering Adams had just recently been out. How
valuable has this extra day of practice been to you guys?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well it's been more than an extra day. Going into the Oregon
game, that was our third game in three days. And we finished our game against
Arizona at 8 o'clock the night before and had a game in 24 hours.  
So there's not a lot of time in that sort of time period to make a lot of
adjustments. We took off Sunday and Monday, so we have had three practices to
prepare for this game. And it's obviously been very helpful because the key
guy that it affects is Kyle.  
Kyle's played the vast majority of his minutes since November as a four. And
now he's got to come back and play half his minutes minimally as a three.  
So what he has to do defensively and offensively transition defense‑wise, is
very different. And it was good that we had the opportunity to do that here
the last three days. I think that it's helpful.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how your players have dealt with some of the
adversity this year, whether it be some of the rumors about your future with
the program and transfers and injuries and things of that nature.  
COACH HOWLAND: So specifically what is your question?  
  
Q. How have your players dealt with adversity this year, different types of
adversity?  
COACH HOWLAND: They have been great. The fact that our team has accomplished a
PAC‑12 regular season championship, we got to the conference tournament
championship, losing arguably our best all around player in the last five
seconds of that Arizona game on a freak injury to his ankle. And then played a
game the next night without any time to really prepare for that change and had
them at I think 52 all with eight or 10 minutes to go.  
So I'm just really proud of our kids and I think that kids today in general
handle adversity so much better than any time before. Because it's constant.
I'm really, really proud ‑‑ and that's the key. They're more than great
lessons in athletics, one of the great lessons in athletics is learning how to
deal with adversity, get stronger because of it, learn from it, bounce back,
and that's one of the great things why you see so many kids that come out of
athletic back grounds or basketball or other sport, have so much success in
life outside of the world of athletics.  
Let me ask a quick question to you guys? How many of you people are here from
Minnesota in terms of the press besides him? Well, I was thinking today and I
want to remind you of this, because I think this is a great sideline to this
story between these two programs. Is that if it wasn't for a big Storm in the
spring of 1948, John Wooden would have been your coach. And it's such a great
story, I called Nan Wooden today, just to make sure, because I remember
reading it and talking to coach about it. That coach wanted to be the head
coach at the University of Minnesota coming from Indiana State. That was his
first choice. He was expecting a call at a certain hour from Minnesota, and
they had such a horrible Storm, shocking, that it knocked down the phone lines
and UCLA in the meantime called and he accepted the job to be the head coach
at UCLA.  
And then about an hour later when Minnesota called, he explained to them, I've
already given my word, and I'm accepted the position as head coach at UCLA.
How different history would have been written had that Storm not occurred at
that time. It's just amazing to me and I talked to Nan today about the fact
that they came out summer of 1948, and they worked out pretty well for
obviously the UCLA program and their entire family, who everybody is located
in Southern California. All of his grandchildren, great grandchildren, his two
kids, Jim and Nan, so I think that's just really a special story. His wife
Nellie, wanted to be in Minnesota, because she wanted to be close to mom and
dad. She wanted to stay close to her roots. And so our good luck.  
  
Q. Coach, Larry said that you had hung up inspirational quotes or quotes
doubting, doubting your team in the locker room. He said you hadn't done that
before. What was the intention for this game that made you want to do that?  
COACH HOWLAND: It's not the only game that we have done that. But purely,
purely motivation.  
  
Q. What kind of, why this game for that motivation?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, like I said, it's not just this game, but this game is a
big game, it's their biggest game of the year, because if you lose, you go
home. It's over.  
Basically I was just hanging up the quotes of the media and all the experts
talking about our team.  
  
Q. Do you feel like your team has been disrespected a little bit, especially
the fact that so many people have said Minnesota is even a favorite?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well Minnesota's really good team. I read they had the second
ranked strength of schedule in the country. I mean, they have beaten Michigan
State, they have beaten Indiana, they have some great wins on their resume. So
I wouldn't call that being disrespected for people to suggest that Minnesota's
going to win the game.  
  
Q. With the seven ‑man rotation that you're going with, how concerned are
you about controlling the pace of the game?   
COACH HOWLAND: We want to run. We want to control the pace of the game. We
want to play fast and push the ball.  
We'll look for every opportunity we can in transition. Then, if we don't have
something, we'll pull out and execute what we do ‑‑ we're best, our best
offense is transition offense that's, if you looked at our team this year, we
led the conference in transition baskets, most shots attempted, most points
scored, but if you look at our efficiency, our efficiency is probably the best
in transition when we have numbers, when we have the number advantage. So
nothing changes. These guys are in great condition. Larry's the old man, he's
23. He can go forever.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been said that the Big ‑10 is the best conference in the
country and probably the deepest. How does that style of basketball differ
from what you've played in the PAC‑12 this year and what have you seen from
Minnesota in that regard?   
COACH HOWLAND: Well, I'm really pleased to announce, as I walked out here,
that Oregon's winning, who I thought would win. I think Cal's going to win
today. I think Arizona's going to win.  
I think our league's really good. No question the Big‑10 was the best league
in the country this year, top to bottom. With seven teams in and four teams in
the top 16 seeds. But I think our league is very good and I think it's
prepared each of the teams in our conference because of the rigors of the
PAC‑12, to represent our conference and each of the respective schools very
well moving into this tournament.  
  
Q. You talked about how your players have dealt with the adversity this
year. From your standpoint as a veteran coach going through all this, it's
been pretty well documented, how have you dealt with that on the personal
level going through this?  
COACH HOWLAND: Adversity is a part of athletics. It's a part of what we do.
Every year has its adversity to it. So it's what we're used to. This is my
32nd straight year in Division‑I coaching and am very blessed to be able to
say that, to be a part of this wonderful game and so it's all good.  
Real adversity is someone out there who doesn't have a job. Real adversity is
someone whose trying to feed their kids and struggling to make it. Real
adversity is having your mortgage under water. And there's so many things that
are so much tougher than what we deal with in our world of athletics. I'm very
lucky, very blessed, and just feel really fortunate to be here today with you
guys and looking forward to our opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tubby was, is a coach who understands some of the expectations that a
program like UCLA has. Have you guys ever talked about what it's like to coach
at such an elite program whenever you've met?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, he was at Kentucky for 10 years, did a fantastic job. I
was there when they beat Utah down 10 at halftime to win the national
championship in his first campaign. We are both in Minneapolis in my last year
at Pitt when they were the No. 1 seed, we were the number two. We both ended
up beaten by Marquette and some guy named Dwayne Wade in the tournament. I
think my first year or second year Tubby's team beat us in the Wooden Classic
and then we turned around and we actually beat them when he was at Kentucky
over in Maui in November of 2006.  
So I have this great respect for Tubby Smith and all that he's accomplished.
And you look at his resume, starting at Tulsa and then to Georgia and Kentucky
and now Minnesota, I mean he's one of the, he's a Hall of Fame coach. No
question about it.  
It's just a real honor to compete against him as a fellow coach. And it
doesn't get any harder, because there's just nobody better. I mean, he's so
good.  
I was reading, for example, Minnesota's been to 12 tournaments in the history
of the program, and over the last six years he's responsible for one fourth of
those 12. And he does it with class and integrity. And he's a great example
for his players.  
  
Q. Following up on the adversity question over there, how do you react to
the reports questioning your future with the team and is it annoying to you?
Has it reached a point where you have to address it with your guys or how do
you just feel about it?  
COACH HOWLAND: I'm just here focused really on our game against Minnesota. So
coaching my team and helping them be the very best they can be. So we're
excited to be here and really excited about the opportunity to compete in this
NCAA championship tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the Florida
student‑athletes. We'll take questions.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys, just how much over the last two years being so
close, how much do you think that's driven you guys to gets back to this
point?  
KENNY BOYNTON: I would say we're a veteran team, last year was last year. We
can't dwell on the past. But right now it's a new season. We learned from our
mistakes from last year. We're ready to make a run in the tournament.  
ERIK MURPHY: I agree. Those things are in the past. But we have worked to fix
whatever may have caused that. We're just focused on Northwestern State right
now. We got to come out and be ready to play.  
MIKE ROSARIO: Just to feed off what both of those guys said. We can't dwell on
the past. That's something that coach teaches us every day, is just move on to
the next thing that's ahead of us. So I feel like with this season we have
been in every position. Every coming down to the stretch and in every game we
have been in all different types of situations this season. So I feel like
being in those situations has paid off for this round.  
  
Q. For all of you, a lot has been made of the fact you're 0 ‑6 in games less
than 10 points. Can you talk to the reasons why and whether someone needs to
step up in this tournament and be a go to guy?   
MIKE ROSARIO: I wouldn't say someone has to be a step up guy. I would just say
that as far as the level of concentration and being poised and in situations
in the second half, I feel like we have to still come out aggressive in the
second half and be in attack mode still. When we're up 12 or whatever the case
may be, or down 12, we still have to have that attack mindset.  
So I feel like with coach working on us in practice, on those situations,
being in those situations, again, I feel like we did a great job of being on
the edge and making sure that we make sure we take advantage of that
situation.  
ERIK MURPHY: Those things have happened. They're in the past now. We worked to
fix whatever caused that. I think as far as a go to guy, I don't think we need
that. I think we need to do it together. Which we're capable of doing. That's
one thing that we try to do on offense and defense is play together as one. I
think doing that, I don't think you need one guy to come up and step up.  
KENNY BOYNTON: I agree with Murphy. I think we just need to do it as a team.
Whether it's offensively or defensively, just take it one step at a time. We
worked on our mistakes and that's in the past, so we're in a new season, we
got to just get it right from here.  
  
Q. Looking at Northwestern State what is it that really jumps out to you
guys on video about them?  
ERIK MURPHY: Obviously they play fast, they play in transition really well. I
think they lead the nation in scoring.  
Obviously they're a high octane team offensively and they pressure the ball on
defense. We just got to be ready for that. We're just going to follow coach's
game plan and try to execute it as best we can.  
KENNY BOYNTON: I agree with Murph. They're a high octane team. They lead the
country in scoring, so we definitely got to do a good job on the defensive end
and I think that on their defense end, they pressure a lot. We got to stay
poised on the offensive end and we'll be good.  
MIKE ROSARIO: Just to add on what both of those guys said, I feel like the two
main keys for us is handling the transition defense, getting back in
transition, and getting to our man. And just handling their pressure.  
Just taking care of the ball and not making costly casual turnovers. I feel
like if we do a great job in those areas, I feel like we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Kenny and Erik, obviously when you guys got here, Florida wasn't too far
removed from consecutive national championships. And you guys talked about you
don't want to worry about the past. You talk about having the last chance and
how much do you guys really want to go out with a bang after everything you've
been through in these years?  
KENNY BOYNTON: I think that well me, Murph and Mike, I think our main thing is
winning. We want to go out as winners. Our goal is to get to the national
championship and win it. And nothing less than that.  
ERIK MURPHY: I agree with what Kenny said. We want to leave, us three want to
leave that legacy of just being winners. We just got to win every game we can.
Every game's its own game and we just have to try to come out and do what we
can to win that game.  
  
Q. Coach wasn't too pleased with practice leading up to the Kentucky game. I
wanted to know how the intensity of practice has been since the Ole Miss lost
and if there's a new focus and a new intensity in practice.  
KENNY BOYNTON: I think that practice has been good. We had a good practice
today. It's been intense. We have been going hard. So I think leading up to
this game practices consecutively have been good.  
ERIK MURPHY: I agree with Kenny. We always try to practice as hard as we can.
We have had a really heightened focus level, I think, just coming down the
stretch. I think that practice has been productive and we have all been
practicing hard.  
It's a new season, so we kind of had that just a little bit extra pop in
practice just from that coming down the stretch here.  
MIKE ROSARIO: I think the guys understand, at this point in time in March,
it's one and done. Right now, going into every practice that we have from this
point on, I feel like everyone's been on the edge. Everyone's been focused on
their job and that's one thing that coach preaches to us every day is just do
your job.  
I feel like all the players, the coaching staff, everyone with our program has
been focused up to this point. So I feel like if we keep doing that good
things will happen.  
  
Q. A lot of people kind of pooh ‑pooh'd the SEC this year, only three teams
got into the NCAA and now you've already seen two top schools, Kentucky and
Tennessee, go down in the first round of the NIT. Pretty big upsets too. Is
that something that you all should be concerned with going into this
tournament, not just the first game, but the whole tournament, that maybe
you're coming out of a conference that's not as tough as the others?   
KENNY BOYNTON: Honestly, not at all. We play teams in other conferences. Those
teams, losing, I don't think it has anything to do with us. I think our main
focus should just be taking everything one at a time. No matter who we play or
what conference they're in.  
ERIK MURPHY: I don't think it should be, I don't think it should worry us at
all. Those teams, they're not us. We are just going to take care of our
business. We got to play our game and they have no affect on what we do.  
MIKE ROSARIO: Our focus right now is on each other and Northwestern State. I
feel like with those two teams in our conference, we can't worry about that
situation or what happened with those two teams. But right now our main focus
is what's up next. And that's Northwestern State tomorrow.  
  
Q. Guys, do you have to expect they're going to be close games in the
tournament, correct?  
ERIK MURPHY: Yeah.  
  
Q. And how then, how better can you adapt to the late going than you did in
the regular season?  
MIKE ROSARIO: Like I said before, we practice on these situation. We know
going forward everyone is bringing their best shot every game.  
And that's what the NCAA tournament is about. Us being a team that we are. I
know that we have a target on us for being a number three seed and being the
experienced team that we are. We feel like that we got to come out, just
aggressive, and just be the Florida Gators. And I feel like, up to this point,
we just got to keep our focus on what's going on with our team and just be
focused.  
ERIK MURPHY: Those things, us with the close games and everything, that's in
the past. Can't do anything to change it now. We don't know what's going to
happen in the future. So we just got to focus on us right now and what we're
doing to prepare and then playing the game.  
KENNY BOYNTON: Those games are in the past. I think when the situation comes
again, as a team, we just are going to take every possession one at a time and
get it done.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you talk about playing against a team that plays so many
players. You guys are used to 32, 34 minutes a game. You're going up against a
team that's going to be constantly substituting.  
KENNY BOYNTON: Yeah, they still have only five at a time. All the guys are
productive. But we have reserves also. So we get a breather, we just got to
get our wind back and be ready to play, match their intensity.  
I think in this game it will be an offensive, the main thing will be our
offense not turning the ball over. So we just got to not get fatigued and keep
playing.  
  
Q. Kenny, maybe all the guys, this team is at its best when you've got four
or five guys in double figures. How do you get back to maybe that scoring
balance and ball movement that you had earlier in the season?  
KENNY BOYNTON: I think that with that, I think with our team, it's just
playing the right way. I think that if everybody has a mindset to make each
other better and play the right way, everyone will be in double figures in the
game. It will be a high scoring game for us. We worked on that in practice and
we just got to go out and do it.  
ERIK MURPHY: We just got to play together, play the right way, play smart, and
if we do that, we focus on being a high assist team and if we do that, we'll
be fine.  
MIKE ROSARIO: Just to feed off that, I feel like if our team takes advantage
of the defensive end of how we take advantage of the offensive end, that
creates offense for our team.  
And I feel like when everyone has the right mindset on the defensive end and
everyone's trying to be in the right spots at the right time on the defensive
end, it creates offense for our team. But to feed off what Murph said, you
know, 20 assists plus per game is a big margin, but we are capable of doing
it. I feel like that when we put ourselves in that situation of getting 20
assists in a game and less turnovers, we can be a really, really good team.  
  
Q. For you guys, you talked earlier about having played before, the sense of
urgency, but talk about how much experience the experience that you guys have
in the tournament can help as you try to make this run and also Will's return,
has that helped you very much, how much has it helped and does he seem like
he's back to getting closer to where he was before he went out?  
KENNY BOYNTON: With Will, I think that he's back to where he was. In practice
he's been active on defense and offense I think that with us, just finishing
our games, we just got to do it.  
  
Q. The experience though.  
KENNY BOYNTON: I think that me and Murph and Mike, Pat, Scottie and all of us,
being guys that have been in the tournament, we have been here before, we have
played in pretty much every situation in this game or this year. We just got
to get the young guys experience and get over the hump.  
THE MODERATOR: All right we'll let you go and take an opening statement from
coach.  
COACH DONOVAN: We're excited to be here in the city of Austin and also being
part of the NCAA tournament. I realize that we have a great challenge in front
of us tomorrow against Northwestern State. Coach McConathy has done a terrific
job with his team. A veteran team.  
I think everybody knows about their style of play and their system. So a lot
to get prepared for coming out of the SEC tournament and I know our guys, our
coaching staff and our program are excited about the opportunity to play
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your coaching against a team that's going to run like
90 players at you. And I don't know if you ever experienced anything quite
like that. Do you change your substitution patterns at all?  
COACH DONOVAN: No, not really. I think there's going to be one you're always
‑‑ for us we're going to sub based on fatigue, foul trouble, those kind of
things. But I also do think matchups. If there is a matchup to their
substitution that we need to change. But that wouldn't be anything different
than what we would normally do in a given game, so to speak.  
There's going to be some lineups that we could have on the court that may not
be great matchups for us and from the bench got to be aware of that. And maybe
make some adjustments or changes based on how big or small they are. But
that's something that we'll have to keep an eye on.  
But overall, going into the game, it's not going to be a situation for us, we
have got kind of our rotations and things that we need to do and some of those
rotations are dictated and predicated on fatigue, foul trouble and matchups.  
  
Q. Can you talk about some of the better teams you had that made runs in the
tournament, had some veteran players, and that came up big at tournament time.
Can you talk about how much experience plays once you get into this one and
done situation?  
COACH DONOVAN: Well I would say this; to me the most important thing this time
of year is maybe not necessarily the experience part of it. I remember in 2006
we came in with a very inexperienced team and we won six games.  
  
Q. You had some older guys though?  
COACH DONOVAN: Yeah, but I mean Horford, Noah, those guys played a little bit,
but I tell you what, you can have all the experience you want, but if you
don't play well a lot of that experience is wasted. I think the one good part
for us going into the game is at least our guys have been in this environment,
they have been in this venue, they have experienced this.  
Now it's a totally different set of circumstances, different team, different
year, everything's totally different. But I don't think our guys understand
all the things that you have to go through, because this time of year for a
young kid, if they have never been through it, it's a little bit different.
It's a little bit different. But I think the experience, if you play well, can
help you. But if you don't play well, I'm not so sure how much it helps.  
  
Q. Can you talk specifically about Erik and Kenny, just all they have been
through and just their last chance to ‑‑ I know that they want to be part of
more than just a regional final.   
COACH DONOVAN: I think that they're no different than any player that's never
experienced that. When you get into this tournament, I think that that's
everybody's dream and goal.  
I remember being a senior in college myself and going to, I remember going the
first two years, not even getting into post season play. And then we made it
to the NIT in my junior year and then, my senior year, made it to the Final
Four.  
I think every kid that gets into this tournament, that's a dream. I just think
maybe those guys have been a little bit more outspoken. I think if you checked
with Northwestern State or Illinois or UCLA or Minnesota, I think every kid's
dream ‑‑ I don't think there's anything abnormal about that for them wanting
that.  
I think they also are mature enough and understand that the most important
thing right now is what's in front of us today. Because tomorrow in this
tournament is never, ever guaranteed or promised. I think that they realize
what a challenge it will be tomorrow night playing against Northwestern State.
But I think that that's the goal in this tournament, to keep advancing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, a year ago, you went through this tournament without
Will. He was here, but he obviously didn't practice, didn't play rather. On a
personal level, how happy are you that he's got healthy enough with his
surgery and his back to where he is at this point and is able to play.  
COACH DONOVAN: I think he gives us a little bit more depth. He gives us
another defender, another rebounder. I still think‑‑ I think a lot of times
when somebody's cleared to play after injury, the normal response is he's
going to be exactly like he was before he got hurt.  
Usually a guy that's been out for a month, that's never the case. There's
usually a period of time that goes on. I still don't think ‑‑ he's much better
than he was going back to our Alabama and Vanderbilt game. But I still think
he's not at the level he was. I think he can get there. We'll need that in a
hurry. But there's no question from a depth standpoint and what he brings to
the table for our team, having him out there is certainly much more important
than having him sitting on the sidelines on crutches.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH DONOVAN: I'm happy for him. That's a hard thing, because I was with him
when we went through having a sit down and talking to him and he needed knee
surgery. And that he probably wasn't going to be able to play if he didn't
have knee surgery.  
Just going through what he went through, as you mentioned, last year with his
broken foot and missing this time, I mean he really, he cried about as hard as
a kid I've ever seen cry before. Because he wanted to play.  
The option was to wait and try to manage it, but it had gotten to such a
problem with all the swelling and the bone chips in there that he couldn't
have done it. And we needed to do it immediately or he needed to wait until
after the year was over with. But I think his initial reaction was, I can
play, I'll try it with it. But it would have never worked.  
So I'm happy that he can play and experience this. I think the one thing that
was probably frustrating to him when he did come back during the SEC, the end
of the schedule there, is that I think he put a lot of pressure on himself to
perform at a level that he wasn't capable of performing at because he was
coming off that injury. I think there was part of him that felt like he was
letting everybody down, because there is this big excitement about Will gets
back, he's cleared to play. And no one takes into consideration, well, you
know what, he's back, but he's probably really not back to where he was.  
  
Q. You seemed really emotional in the SEC tournament championship game. Was
that seeding or momentum or just every time you go out on the floor and does
your team feed off that?  
COACH DONOVAN: I hope it's not every time I go out on the court, because I
wouldn't be able to coach too much longer doing that.  
No, I think that sometimes in certain situations there's things you see going
on, on the court, you get emotional and passionate about what you want to see
from your team. When they're not doing those things, I can get animated.  
But this has been a great group to coach. They have been, they have gotten
along real well. We have had really good chemistry, they're unselfish, good
kids, they work hard. But I think every game, every situation's always a
little bit different going into these, whether it's the SEC tournament or the
NCAA tournament.  
But I don't go in with any preconceived notions of how I'm going to act or be.
But there are certain things that they know that probably are going to set me
off a little bit on the sidelines. More than anything else, just trying to get
them to fire up and compete and play.  
  
Q. To follow ‑up, a lot of people compare Florida and Texas athletics
programs. How would you say the interest in Florida basketball compares to the
passion in Florida football?   
COACH DONOVAN: Well, I've said this: This is the unique thing about Florida to
me being here now 17 years. In the southeast there is nothing sport‑wise that
takes more precedent over football. There is a southeastern flavor for
football that it is just there. I mean, I think it's a long, rich standing
tradition when you talk about Florida and Georgia and Alabama and Auburn and
Tennessee and all the teams.  
The difference at Florida, in my opinion, is the University of Florida, to its
fans, alumni and boosters, is bigger than any sports situation. And that's the
thing that makes Florida, I think, so unique is that people that are
supporting Florida, when Florida's playing, whether it be in volleyball,
baseball, football, basketball, the university takes precedent over any sport.  
There's a level of pride there in Florida, the Gator Nation, that thing. So
I've never ever, since I've been there, ever looked at it football versus
basketball or anything like that. I just looked at that I'm part of a great
athletics program and we're one sport and the goal is to have the best overall
athletics department in the country. And you need a lot of sports to do well
there. And that's the one thing that's been positive for me is I think
sometimes, at least back when I got hired, people always wanted to create a
divide between football and basketball. And create animosity. And that
couldn't be further from the truth of what the environment is at Florida.
Everybody supports each other, everybody helps each other. I've been at
Florida with Spurrier and around Zook and Urban and now Will. And I've had
great relationships with all those guys. And that's the one thing that I find
enjoyable about Florida is the people that represent Florida, when Florida's
involved, there's passion, regardless of what sport it is.  
  
Q. A lot's been made of you guys being 0 ‑6 in games six points or less. How
do you explain that? And in a tournament where most games or a lot of games
come down to six points or less, why are you guys in better shape now to
combat that?  
COACH DONOVAN: I don't know if we are or we're not. I think a lot of times
it's all how you want to look at things. Because we have beaten teams on our
schedule by 20 or more points twice as many times as we have lost close games.  
So I think in those situations, to me, the more experiences you have, the more
opportunities I think you have to handle those better. And for us it's been
different stuff. That's been probably the part that's been somewhat baffling
for me a little bit is it's been different things.  
In the Kentucky game, the last game of the year, we couldn't make a shot. We
missed, I think we were had five turnovers out of 15 possessions and went 0‑10
from the field.  
Against Mississippi we were 3‑11 I think from the free throw line in the
second half. For whatever reason.  
Those things have obviously hurt us. Turnovers have hurt us. I think a lot of
times people want to go back and look at the last possession, but to me when
you got a 12 point lead going into the second half against Ole Miss in the SEC
tournament, that wasn't an end of game problem, that was a coming out of the
locker room problem, where pretty quickly the game got tied up.  
So I would say this: I have confidence in our guys. I think that they have
confidence in themselves. When that situation comes up, we'll see how you
respond. I never ever think anything that happens in the past equals your
future. Just because, if we made every game winning shot, doesn't mean we're
going to make the next one. And if we miss every single game winning shot,
doesn't mean we're going to miss the next one.  
We have got to ‑‑ I think our team has grown and matured and gotten better in
some of those situations. I think we have made better decisions, I think we
have executed better. We have not finished plays like we need to.  
  
Q. You weren't too pleased with practices leading up to Kentucky, but how
has practice been lately? Is there a new intensity, a new focus? Are you
pleased with how practice has gone?  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, it was a little bit, I think coming off of playing three
games in three days coming out of Nashville, you know, we gave them off on
Monday to recuperate. I thought that we practiced hard Tuesday and Wednesday
and then practiced again here today. They have been pretty good.  
I think our guys understand that everybody's fighting for the same things
during the course of the year. You're using your non‑conference to prepare for
your conference. Then you're trying to compete for a conference championship.
Then you're trying to compete for a conference tournament championship. And
then ultimately what you want to do at the end of the day is you want to be in
this event. And I've always said, this event's like the lottery, you got to be
in it to win it. And that's what makes it so special is it's so wide open and
anybody can beat anybody.  
I think our guys are excited. I think ‑‑ listen, if you're not excited to play
this time of year, you shouldn't be out there right now. This is what college
basketball is all about right now.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the student‑athletes from
Pacific. Questions, please?  
  
Q. For Lorenzo and anyone else, could you just talk about what you know
about Miami, and particularly, for Lorenzo, going up against Shane Larkin?  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: First, I want to thank God, just for giving me this
opportunity, but I've been watching them over the year because they have been
one of the like surprise teams of the year in the NCAA. But I think they got
‑‑ they're real good. They run a lot of ball screens and stuff like that.  
Shane Larkin, he's a great guard. He can shoot the ball, basically, he's their
main person who distributes the ball and gets their team going.  
  
Q. Travis and Lorenzo, talk about coach and just what you are able to give
him as the last, his last season. Just the opportunity to send him out with
something even bigger.  
TRAVIS FULTON: It's a great thing to get coach to the tournament his last
year. That was definitely one of our main motivations this year.  
It's also a great opportunity for all of us, and even our assistant coaches
and stuff. It means a lot for us to get coach in the tournament here at the
end.  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: For me, that was one of my personal goals in the beginning of
the year, is to make sure that coach will be able it leave on a great note.  
For him, just giving the opportunity that he gave me. He offered me a
scholarship. So, I thought that was the best thing that we could do. And we
are here now. So I guess it's a great opportunity for all of us. And I'm
thankful that he can retire in a good way.  
  
Q. What do you think of Miami's size down low?  
TONY GILL: We know that actually they're pretty big across the board. Along
with their size, they're pretty versatile. Especially Kenny Kadji, being 6‑11,
being able to go out to the perimeter and shoot three, go inside, go outside.  
They're big and strong. They can go four deep on the front line. We just have
to match their toughness and be able to hopefully cause some sort of problems
down low.  
RODRIGO DE SOUZA: I think especially this game, we got to have everybody
trying for the rebounds. If we win the rebound war, I think we're going to
have a great shot to win the game.  
  
Q. Talk about, obviously, a 15 seed, some people would argue maybe Miami
should be a No. 1 seed. You guys saw what 15 seeds did in last year's
tournament. Does that give you something to look at?  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: It does, to a certain extent. But then again, we are here. We
weren't one of the teams last year, so we are here on our own thing. We come
here to win. It's not like we just come here to play the game, we are here to
win.  
We come here to have fun, and then another thing is, that a lot of them teams
look like‑‑ there was a team orientated teams as far as like passing the ball
and things like that. Being a team effort all the way around. And that's what
kind of team we are.  
And any one of us can get hot, as you've seen from the status, anyone can go
off for a great game. You never know who is going to do it.  
TONY GILL: I think come tournament time, anything can really happen. Whether
it's 15 over a 2, or whatever you want to call it.  
But I think it's just all about what team gets hot. Which ones are able to
play the whole 40 minutes from start to finish. I think teams that are
coach‑able at this point in the year and have positive attitudes and play
collectively with one another definitely have the best shot.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, everyone talks about Shane Larkin, but what do you know about
Durand Scott and his ability to make it happen?  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: Oh, yeah I know he's actually he had 32 I think against North
Carolina State, so he's actually, he's one of their main guards and he's a
senior, so he's one of their leaders on the team. He's very aggressive. He's a
strong ball handler and he's going to attack the rim hard. He could get hot
too and get on a shooting streak also.  
  
Q. Wondering, Tony, have you been watching UM all year or is it just in the
last couple weeks? When did you first sort of become aware that they're kind
of a hot team and when did you start following them?  
TONY GILL: I would have to saying when they got really hot in the ACC, when
they started off I think 10‑0 and they started getting a lot of attention. Not
just for me, but I think Nationwide everybody kind of got, became aware, of
who they really are and how good they really are.  
And they definitely didn't disappoint the rest of the year, winning the ACC
tournament along with the regular season out right. So everyone knows how good
they are, so it's no surprise.  
  
Q. This is, not just Coach Thomason as last year, but your guys' last year
in the Big West you walked off with the Big West title. You haven't been here
to this tournament in seven years and this is a real upperclassman driven
team. How much are you guys sort of taking in the moment and then how do you
translate that to getting focused and preparing for such a tough opponent?  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: As far as right now, I'm still like this right here the
interview and everything, I'm soaking all this in. But as soon as I step on
the court I'm focused. I've been focused since the media room. We had film
today and things like that, so it's going in and out, but once we step on the
court, I think I'm focused from there on.  
TONY GILL: We're definitely taking a little bit of time to soak everything in.
As fun as this process is, we can't get too caught up in the emotions, because
we're still here for a purpose and to play a ball game. So once the time comes
to start preparing, and getting on to the court, we should be focused.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys played Gonzaga this year, Cal, some other big teams.
Does any of that kind of stuff help when you're preparing for a team that's
physically superior? Can you recall back to some of those games or is it just
kind of an entirely new situation, depending upon the opponent?  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: I believe so, because mostly every team we played against
hasn't been bigger than us. And they have had a better opportunity on the
rebounding end. So, yeah, it helps a lot. Experience always helps.  
So you're going against anybody, you learn a lot of things. So, yes, it helps
a lot.  
  
Q. Any of you, what kinds of things would you say you do best as a team and
are you looking for any particular tempo in this game?  
TRAVIS FULTON: I think the big thing about our team is that a lot of us can
score and shoot the ball well. When we're moving the ball and getting open
shots for our teammates, we're really tough to guard.  
Because any one of our positions at times, can shoot the ball really well, and
that causes some miss matches for teams. I would say that's one of our biggest
strengths definitely.  
TONY GILL: I think that, offensively, we did a really good job of moving the
ball, getting guys shots, in certain spots that they can be successful from.  
I think our big guys do a good job of spreading the court and taking other
bigs on, kind of out of their comfort zone, making them guard on the
perimeter. Our guards do a great job of coming off of ball screens and getting
into the lane and finishing when the time's right.  
Defensively, I think we play really hard with one another and try to
communicate really well. That's kind of been one of our strengths being the
top defensive team in the Big West conference this year.  
But in terms of tempo, we just, I don't think we got to get into that, we got
to worry about what we do best and hopefully throw the first punch.  
LORENZO MCCLOUD: Another strength of ours is that we're a family. That's been
our motto the whole year. Us being a family. Things like that. It's like a
pool of brothers. And that helps motivate each and everyone of us. We can talk
to each other really talk to each other. And that helps a lot too.  
RODRIGO DE SOUZA: Being a family, being like supporting each other was a big
strength for us. If we take care of the ball on a high level, and rebound the
ball on a high level, I think we're going to be fine.  
  
Q. Obviously, you guys have been asking a lot of questions about Miami, how
good they are, that sort of thing. Does that creep into the psyche? Is there
an I know temptation factor that you might have to kind of go through at the
beginning of the game, or are you guys so experienced this late in the year
that that kind of thing doesn't matter?  
RODRIGO DE SOUZA: Miami's a great team. But we played a great team at the
beginning of the year, and the whole year too. We played Gonzaga, we played
St. Mary's. It has a lot of distractions going on.  
But we are lucky, and we know what we have to do. We trust each other. We
believe that if we play well, if we do what we're supposed to do, we will be
fine. It's just another basketball game. If we do what we're supposed to,
we'll be fine.  
TONY GILL: I think as long as we understand that we still have to stay within
ourselves, try to do what we do best. And as far as the intimidation factor,
we just have to treat it just like any other game. Because at the end of the
day they still put their shorts on just like we do.  
But there's the No. 1 ranking, number two arranging, whatever it is. It's
still a basketball game that comes down to X's and O's and coach‑ability and
see who comes out on top.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Gentlemen, we're going to let you go. Thank you for your
time. We'll take questions for Coach Thomason now we'll start with an opening
statement and then we'll take questions from the room.  
COACH THOMASON: We're sure happy to be here in the NCAA tournament. It's
always been a great experience, the times we have come here and played.
Obviously, playing Miami is a great challenge, they're a great team. Probably
one of the teams that can win a national championship.  
I have a lot of respect for Jim. I think they're well coached and we got our
hands full. We know that.  
We got in here a little late last night, but we're trying to enjoy Austin. I
did walk down sixth street last night and I didn't realize how many bars they
had. But I didn't see any of my guys there, so we're off to a good start.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Obviously a tough matchup, but could you have scripted a better way to go
out?  
COACH THOMASON: Ask me about four o'clock Friday. We're trying to make a
better script. This turned out really well. The school did a great job our
last home game. I had a lot of former players comeback. We played Long Beach,
the first place team, and beat them by 20.  
Had a great reception afterwards. Got to catch up with, not only ex‑UOP guys,
but some of my high school guys were there. It was a great evening. To top it
off and go win the Big West tournament, pretty special. We're enjoying it. I
think our guys are pretty happy about going to the NCAA tournament. And now we
got to refocus on making sure that we are locked into Miami. Because if you
don't get locked into the team you're playing, if you play a NCAA game, you
have no chance.  
  
Q. Did you get in late on purpose or were you delayed?  
COACH THOMASON: We were a little delayed. We wanted to practice at home. Four
out of the last five weeks we have been on the road. The one week we were at
home we were on spring break and that doesn't help academics too much. So we
wanted to get to class, we wanted to practice at home. We had a scheduled 3
o'clock flight that I think left at five. So there was a two hour delay. But
we're still ‑‑ a couple of our guys are still on California time, so that was
okay. Had a great day to go through today and we'll be well rested tomorrow.
So no problems.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about Shane Larkin, but what about Durand Scott? What
does he bring?  
COACH THOMASON: They all bring something. When you design a team ‑‑ a guy
asked me, design a team that you want. I said, I want a quick point guard that
can shoot, penetrate and pass that's got speed. I want two wings that are 6‑5
and strong. One can really drive and score outside and one can shoot. Then you
want a 6‑10 four man that can go outside and drive. And you want a couple big
guys inside. I think I might be describing Miami.  
So a couple people told me, Scott, he only shots 31 percent from the three and
then I'm watching the North Carolina State game, he had 32, he hit five
threes, he looked pretty good to me. So what a tremendous athlete, to be a
defensive player and to drive like he does, he's aggressive. But they have a
good patience about them, they understand each other, and one of the strengths
of a basketball team sometimes is letting players have great nights. And their
team does that. They don't try to say, well, he's having a great night, I got
to go get mine. They just let those guys have great nights.  
  
Q. What's the biggest thing you're stressing with the team in terms of
preparation for both not only the game but handling the moment?  
COACH THOMASON: Handling the moment is you got to do that every night. We had
to handle the moment our last two road games in the league. We hadn't done
well and we had to go in there and we got up 20, got up 15. We probably lead
the country in points given up after getting leads. But we seem to win the
games though.  
We had pressure all three nights in the Big West tournament. So we have played
pressure games. This will be another pressure game. We want to play
basketball, No. 1. I think you should worry with winning with four minutes to
go in the game, we call that winning time. You got to get after loose balls,
take charges. And these guys don't have a lot of weaknesses to them and we
have got to either create some weaknesses or just hope that maybe a couple
guys have that bad night. If they have a bad night and we have a great night,
you never know what can happen.  
  
Q. You talk about Miami having good patience. Obviously they have five
seniors that play along with Larkin and make up the brunt of their minutes.
How evident is that as far as their experience, how much does that translate
on the court, and in this era of so many one and did done freshman stars, how
unique is that for them?  
COACH THOMASON: Well it's unique. Miami hasn't been a powerhouse in basketball
over the years. So maybe that's the chance to have more five year guys.  
As they become more of a powerhouse they might be recruiting guys that might
be one and done also. So you can't blame a guy for going to college and if the
NBA wants to draft him in the top, for him to go. I mean you can't blame
people for that. That's their livelihood, it's their future. They make a lot
of money.  
But I think Miami having the seniors really gives them a strength. Jim being
the type of coach he is, they stress defense, they play smart, they're not
real complicated. But they really do things well together. I think he has the
patience that allows them to do the things they have to do.  
  
Q. Your personal thoughts on matching up with Coach Larranaga. I know we
talked about your respect for him as a fellow Mid Major kind of guy and then
what you kind of, I know it's a busy day and a lot going on, what kind of your
game plan is for this day and what you kind of hope to accomplish with it with
your team.  
COACH THOMASON: Well, Jim has changed college basketball when he took his
George Mason team to the Final Four. It opened up the door for Mid Majors
saying they can go to the Final Four. Now if you look at the scope of
basketball, there are Mid Majors that are becoming Mid Major, major teams.
Teams that charter flights and spend a lot of money. They don't want to go to
the NCAA, they want to win a national championship now. And that's why Butler
went twice. And I still think Butler going twice is the most amazing thing in
basketball since John Wooden went and won all those national championships at
UCLA.  
So there's people now that have changed the game. I think Jim's done that. I
really like guys that paid their way in coaching and now they get a chance to
play at a large school and see his coaching take over. There's probably some
coaches that I would rather not end my career losing to, you know, what I
mean. There's a few out there, but Jim's not one of them.  
Now me compared to him, if I could go out and play 18 holes right now, me
against him, and the winner advances, I would take my chances on that. But I
don't know how good a golfer he is.  
What makes me nervous is when I look at his ‑‑ I think they talked about all
to these goals he sets in all these areas and I said, I need to get out of the
game, he just is so well prepared and does such a great job. So, but I think
it's going to come down to players. I'm not going to be worrying about Jim
when that game starts. I'm going to be worrying about Larkin and Scott and
those guys.  
  
Q. Two questions. One, can you, from the opposing stand point, can you
describe Shane Larkin, what makes him so good and then also did you watch
Miami all year or was there a point at which you really started paying
attention to them and said, whoa, this team is really doing something special
this year?  
COACH THOMASON: Well, I watched them during the year once in a while. I don't
watch a lot of college basketball because you're watching five, six seven
films on the team you're playing next. But I do watch some. I've seen them.
But I didn't really pay attention to them.  
When I was driving back from the Big West tournament on Sunday morning I
called my son and he's a high school coach and does a great job and I said,
hey, I think they're on at 10 o'clock Miami against North Carolina, could you
scout them for me. Because that might be some matchup we have.  
So he said, dad, they're really good. I mean, so that doesn't make me feel any
better. So I watched them, I watched the Wake Forest game, the Georgia Tech
game, because I wanted to watch them lose a little too. But I also watched
them win games. But I'm not watching the Duke game at Miami, I'm not watching
that game.  
  
Q. What about Shane?  
COACH THOMASON: Shane's just, you know what he does? He's so fast. He doesn't
even look that fast. He just kind of hesitates. I think the hesitation, I
always say players should use hesitation. And then when the fast guys
hesitate, what they do is they set you up to kind of relax and then they go.
He can drive both ways. He can pull up a 15 foot shot, but what's really good
is he can shoot a three.  
So it causes you a lot of problems. And they run so many on ball screens and
double on ball screens and I like to tell Lorenzo and Rodrigo, just keep him
out of the paint. Wouldn't that be good coaching to say, keep him out of the
paint. But he's pretty darn good. I'm not for sure if we can really stop him
too much. We got to just contain him as much as possible.  
  
Q. Unlike the other seven host sites, here at this in Austin there's no team
of regional interest and most all the tickets have been bought by local fans
or Texas fans. What reasons would you give the people here to root for you
guys tomorrow?  
COACH THOMASON: Well, we were in Salt Lake the last one I was in against
Boston College when they were in the ACC. And they got off to a pretty good
start, but we hung in there. And the second half the whole stadium was
cheering for us because they like the underdog, they like the major upset. And
I think if there's going to be a home court advantage is, if we play really
well and have a chance, that people will get involved with our team. Because
we'll be a scrappy team and we'll be an underdog team and I think people like
that.  
And with the matchup, that was one of the things I was concerned about is
playing somebody that it's in their backyard. You go play Ohio State the
second seed, they're playing in Dayton, Ohio. So them coming here, that helps.
Them not really being in the NCAA's, that helps too, because it's their first
NCAA game. So all that stuff kind of helps a little. The thing that doesn't
help is just watching them play.  
  
Q. When did you first meet Jim and how well do you know him? You obviously
respect him. Do you know him?  
COACH THOMASON: No, I never met him. I never met Jim. Sound like we're
buddies, huh. No, I always admired him as a coach. I was very happy when he
got that job. Now for what reason, I don't know. But I like guys that kind of
do a good job and move up the coaching ladder and what a great job he's done.
But to watch some of the films about all of his goals and everything, I mean
how do you not admire that? A guy that is that organized and does all those
things. My assistants say, hey, tomorrow, if we win, what's the plan? If we
lose, what's the plan. I say you know after the game's over we'll get a plan.
I don't want to be thinking about losing, I don't want to be anticipating
winning, I just want to make sure our guys, we all are prepared. When I go to
the game, every game with this team especially I have a clear mind. I just
coach the game. There will be guys that have played, maybe don't play, maybe
guys play more than they have, whatever can somewhat make it work. And if I
can just trust myself, then maybe the players can trust themselves and we'll
see how it works out.  
  
Q. Last year we saw two 15 seeds win and I think Lorenzo was in here talking
about what he sees the similarities is those were team oriented teams. They
played together. And that your team has a lot of that. Talk about that aspect
and is that what it takes?  
COACH THOMASON: Well, before when I've come to the NCAA tournament we have had
some players that are still playing overseas. We have had guys like Christian
Marker and that, guys that are really good basketball players and really good
size and we played Pitt, I thought we should have won, we did. Providence, I
thought we could have won, we did. Boston College we lost a tough double
overtime game.  
But this team doesn't have those players. So we have to do it as a team. And I
really believe if you get your teammates to be better, and you're looking out
to help them all the time, the team could be really successful. And we have to
have a great team effort.  
Our team has to bother Miami. I don't think our individuals are going to
bother Miami too much. They played against Duke, North Carolina, all these
teams that have great players, great guys they know about. They're used to all
that. But we got to get our team to bother them somehow.  
  
Q. Talking about the previous times you've done this. Any plan for today?
Try to keep the team focused, anything you want to try to get out of this warm
up day?  
COACH THOMASON: We're going to spend 40 minutes working, shooting and shooting
free throws and getting used to the arena. Then we'll go over to the practice
facility and we'll get through our walk throughs. Today's a double walk
through because we play 10 players and we have to make sure they're all going
through everything because the shoot around time at 8 o'clock for 20 minutes
is, that will probably be optional for our players tomorrow if they want to
come over and shoot, they can. For 20 minutes, that early, I don't know if it
make that is much sense since we practice and we get on the first game anyway.  
And then our guys will have a good lunch and take a nap and we'll have a great
barbecue dinner tonight in Austin and enjoy it. They will do the regular
routine, have a meeting tonight and then the night before meetings, I don't
attend, my assistants kind of go over the film again, going over the scouting
report, handling any issues that's up.  
One of the things about players is when you are nervous or you have fears, the
more you admit them and talk about them to me the better it is. So if there is
any, our guys ‑‑ I don't like these guys that say, nothing's bothering me, I'm
not scared, you know they're not going to play very well. So you have an
opportunity to get that out and play.  
I remember one of our players, Mike Webb, when we were playing at Kansas he
says, coach, I've only played in front of 500 guys in junior college, they got
16,500, I'm kind of nervous about that. Then all the other guys started
talking about how much fun it is and this and Mike went out the next day and
played great against Kansas. But I think if he didn't admit that, he had no
chance. So I don't know if there's any fears or anxiety, but you want to be
excited. If I have to do a Knute Rockne tomorrow to get my guys ready to play,
we got a problem anyway, don't we?  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the student‑athletes from Northwestern
State. Questions?  
  
Q. Could all four of you guys talk about the style you play with so many
substitutions and does it ever get discouraging to know that you're coming out
of the game?  
SHAMIR DAVIS: Well everyone knows we go five man rotation about every three to
four minutes. Just try to put pressure on the offensive players. We pick up
full court and everyone knows that they're going to come out. So that's one
thing about our team, everyone's going to play. At any given moment,
everyone's going to play. Whether you're tired, whether you're hot, whether
you're cold, you're going to come out. So we all know that coming into the
game and we try to bring all our energy.  
JALAN WEST: I think that we don't get discouraged because everybody holds each
other accountable. We try to wear teams down so if one come out and do their
best, the next player come in and try to do their best also. I think it helps
us out as a whole by wearing the other team's offensive players down, the way
that we pressure and get after it.  
DEQUAN HICKS: I wouldn't say so much discouraged. I would say we know we got
fresh legs coming in so we can go in play our hardest for three minutes and
then get the subs in for fresh legs. Get their three minutes and then we can
come back in and add on to it. So I don't say discouraged. I say it's a big
part of our success.  
JAMES HULBIN: I agree. It's not discouraging if the first five go out and set
the tempo, then the second five will come out there and try it and keep the
tempo going. Stay with the defense pressure, make sure the pressure's up high
and just run our lanes and just play team basketball.  
  
Q. The fact that this school is able to pull a 14 over a 3 in 2006 when you
guys beat Iowa, your school, how much confidence does that give you, that can
you do it again tomorrow and knock Florida off?  
JAMES HULBIN: It gives us a lot of confidence. Everybody is just reminiscing
on the 2006 team. We just pretty much trying to set our pace for our own
memories in the future, future players at our program too. So we're playing
with a lot of confidence, we just play our game.  
  
Q. With that being said, how important is it for you guys to set your own
legacy as a team. A lot of people talk about that 2006 game. But how important
is it for you guys to set your own legacy with a win against Florida?  
DEQUAN HICKS: I think that it's very important for us, because we don't want
to just be faced off one game, known as one game. We want to be known as a
whole, a whole alumni, not just one team, one game, one shot. Just a whole new
look.  
  
Q. Shamir, talk about what you do know of Florida? You look at a team that's
been so close to being to the Final Four the last couple years, won national
championships back to back years not too long ago, and they got a couple
seniors who really feel like they have something to prove. Talk about a team
like that and how dangerous they are.  
SHAMIR DAVIS: Everyone knows coach Billy Donovan does a great job with his
players. They have a great defensive team and also they can score. They got
bigs on the inside and a lot of great guard play.  
We watched them a couple times this year, even though we're kind of busy with
our own schedule, but we caught a couple of their games and we know they like
to get up‑and‑down the floor also. That kind of matches up with what we do
also, so it ought to be a good game.  
  
Q. Coach McConathy, when he sells you guys on this style of play, what kind
of sacrifice do you have to make, I guess, to play 15, 18 minutes?  
JALAN WEST: I think the sacrifice we make is just trusting your teammates,
knowing that you're not going to be in the game the whole time, even if you're
hot. You just got to trust your teammates to get in the game and do the same
thing that you were doing and that's doing your best and that's what I think
we do well.  
  
Q. For Jalan, I notice you hurt your ankle during the Stephen F. Austin
game. How is your ankle feeling and will you be a hundred percent for
Florida?  
JALAN WEST: I wouldn't say a hundred percent. No percentage. I think it's
good. I think I'll be fine. I think my teammates will just keep the intensity,
keep me confident in it and I think I ought to be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, we're going to let you go. We'll take an
opening statement from coach.  
COACH MCCONATHY: Just excited about being in the NCAA tournament. I've been
away from here for a few years and glad that our kids could experience this
and be here with the opportunity to continue to play in such a great event.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the genesis of your style of play and I don't know,
did it come from hockey? And also do you ever have a hard time getting a kid
to come to school because, hey, coach, I'm out after three minutes?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Well, a former coach that passed away told me I wouldn't play
for myself. But it kind of evolved in junior college back in the '80s for one
or two years and then picked it up back in the '90s at Bossier Parish
Community College. The reason that I did this was because we had so many good
players I was having a lot of moral issues. So I figured out that if I played
10, I could at least keep 10 happy. And that would be a little bit easier.  
Now we were having several good players there at the junior college I was at,
Bossier Parish Community College, and that's kind of where it involved at.
Years ago, Perry Clark at Tulane ran something similar to this, but his second
wave though was a posse, is what he called it, and I think that was in the, I
want to say that was in the maybe the early '90s.  
But they had a specific purpose of trap, of running presses. Our situation is
generally we're just doing the same thing, we're running the same offense. I
haven't got creative enough or I'm not smart enough to be able to put two
groups doing two different things. But I think that to answer the second part
of your question, I think that it's a great recruiting tool, because a kid
coming in when he's a freshman has an opportunity to play.  
But on the back side of that, they have to remember, when they get to be
juniors and seniors, that when they were freshmen they had an opportunity to
play and they need to be aware of that.  
A little bit of a struggle sometimes when you bring junior college players in.
DeQuan Hicks, Bryce White, probably have adjusted to our system, as well as,
any players that I've ever had in 14 years with the exception of Chris
Thompson that played on our first NCAA team. And that's because he had already
done it for two years, because he played for me in junior college.  
  
Q. I know it's been a much different team than 2006 when your team won as a
14 seed over a three. Talk about that experience and just, I mean how do you
want this team to view that as far as moving ahead?  
COACH MCCONATHY: The 2005, 2006, these two teams have a lot of parallels but
then there's some differences. That team was built off of a cohesiveness
because they had grown up as babies. There was 11 freshmen, and then the next
year, and then on to that to winning a conference championship, getting
knocked out in the championship game. And then that year coming in winning the
championship and winning the tournament.  
This team can really get the ball up‑and‑down the floor. That team could, but
really not to the efficiency level that this team could. The difference there
would be we played good defense there, but I really think that this group has
some really good passers, not that the other team didn't. But this team, it
just seems like the ball never sticks and the ball is pushed up the floor so
quickly.  
There will be times when we're coming up the floor in games to where they have
scored and I look up and we have got three passes and we're laying the ball in
or shooting six foot shots, or it's four passes and the post man's passing to
the wing, cut to the bucket and laid the ball up. I think that the efficiency
in passing has been a big plus for this team.  
  
Q. Talk about the up tempo style that you guys play. Talking to the Florida
players just a minute ago, that's all they really talked about was just the up
tempo, the way you guys run the court. You substitute five in at a time, and
that seemed to be one of the concerns they had playing you guys. Talk about
that and how that really helps you guys out knowing that that's the style that
you've been playing.  
COACH MCCONATHY: Well, I just think that it's who we are. We played that way
all year and we have got to continue to do that. I think it helps us because,
when you look at our stat line, we get it from different places every night.
Sure we got four guys that are averaging in double figures, but it might be a
Brison White that comes in and has 22 points or one game he had six steals and
15 points. I think 15 minutes he played.  
So you're getting it from a lot of different areas, a lot of different times,
and maybe sometimes not very many minutes, but they're very efficient when
they're in there. I believe that DeQuan Hicks was, per minute in the game
playing time, that he was the leading scorer per minute that he played. So
efficiency is an important part there.  
That's just who we are and I just really think that that's been a good thing
for us. I think that our kids have a unique bond and they like their identity.
And they enjoy playing and having fun playing the game. And happy players make
sometimes good players. So we like that.  
  
Q. After watching Florida on film what are your impressions, initial
observations I guess, of their defense and how well the players fit
together?  
COACH MCCONATHY: They're real good.  
(Laughter.)  
They're real good and very, I'm just so impressed with the talent level, but
the team and the program that they have, but the ball never sticks.
Defensively they're always in position. They're going to make it extremely
hard on you to be able to get anything easy. They're going to mix up their
defenses and they're going to make you try to make you make mistakes. I think
one of the keys there is that you got to take care of the ball and not let
yourself get put in a position where you have live ball turnovers, where
they're going down and getting layups.  
  
Q. I'm curious, you faced the No. 1 scoring team in the country three times.
Is there any similarities between Stephen F. Austin and Florida that your team
can be prepared for?  
COACH MCCONATHY: I think both of them are so well coached, such great
defensive teams, but I think too the efficiency of their offense and the fact
that the ball moves, they have their system, they stay with their ball
screens, they do so many things, in, out, pick and pops, all the different
areas that they have that are efficient in their game that make a huge
difference and make it ‑‑ there's a little difference between Stephen F. and
Florida, because of the fact that Florida's going to nail threes. And they're
going to shoot threes where Stephen F. Austin is not going to take very many
threes.  
  
Q. Talk about facing three SEC teams this year. I know it was earlier in the
year, but did that help you in any way preparing for Florida?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Well I think any time you get to go in big venues and large
conferences and successful conferences like the SEC it helps you. I think it
helped us to see where we were. More or less along the lines of if you belong.
If you look at the scores on those games, we lost to A & M by 13, I think 15
or 17 to Arkansas, right after Christmas, but it was a much closer game than
that. It's one of those that kind of got away from us. But we were right in
there hanging in there.  
Then LSU early, we got down early and then we came back. Of course, I don't
know if that was their first home game, it was one of the first ones. Of
course John Jones and I kind of ‑‑ I'm a little bit older than him, but we
grew up together. So I knew he would be ready to put a whupping on me. And he
did.  
But I just think that the fact that we played those teams and we sought
caliber of play helps when you come play a Florida, of course, who won the
league. It helps that other teams were not in the top, but still I think it
helps you to have played those teams.  
  
Q. This is the only site of the eight that doesn't have a local or regional
type team and most all the tickets were sold to local fans. So what kinds of
things does a, as an underdog, do you guys bring to the table do you think
that could get people pulling for you tomorrow night?  
COACH MCCONATHY: You didn't hear? I went out and took a bank loan out and went
and bought a bunch of T‑shirts. It might be me standing out passing them out
tomorrow. No, I didn't do that.  
But I understand that the fact that if we come and compete ‑‑ and we are
local, six hours across‑‑ that if we come and we really compete and give
people something to identify with, because that can be a good thing. We don't
have any Texans this year, we have had some in the past, but just thankful for
the opportunity to be close to home, because it's great for us to be able to
get some of our fans here. And we have had a group that has been fun to watch.
I think that if we come and compete to the level and take care of our business
like we should, I think that they will really like this Demon hoops squad.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about their guards and your guards. Because it seems up
front both are talented at the one and two spot. How do you see that playing
out tomorrow with regards to whoever can play the better game and of course
get their team in the right situations to make the plays down the stretch?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Well, guard play is always so important. They have very
talented guards. We feel like our guards are very, very talented. A little bit
different in the fact of size, that we're a little bit smaller. Shamir is a
little bit bigger guard in arm length. And I always say that you don't measure
them from the top of your head, you measure them from the end of their
fingers, because that's what they play with. But Shamir's a longer kid that
can get to the bucket and Jalan is very, very quick. I think he's as talented
Jalan is as talented with the ball getting into the lane and hitting people
where Shamir's a guy that drives and is able to get it up and strong enough to
get it up there and be able to cushion himself to get the bucket in.  
I think a lot of it will have to do with the defense and who can keep each
other in front of them. I think that will be a key factor. Hoping that our
guards are, can get inside of theirs. But I know that they're very talented
and very defensive oriented and will do a great job of protecting straight
line drives.  
  
Q. Florida's had a lot of close games, I think six of them were within a few
points at the very, very end. Do you feel like if you guys are close with
Florida that you'll be able to be on top in the game situation like that? You
have the strength to overcome and be the ones to finish with the win?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Well, I am very hopeful that we can be close and we can be in
the position to where we can make a play at the end to win a ball game.
That's‑‑ being a guy that tries to get the ball up‑and‑down the floor as quick
as possible, but this group has a unique ability to be able to play fast, but
then also play slow enough to take good shots and in the last probably four
ball games, one, two, three, well last probably five games we were caught in a
situation to where it was not all just getting up‑and‑down the floor, it was a
slower pace game at the end and we were able to overcome that and be able to
win the game. So I'm confident in our ability to be in a tight game to be able
to finish.  
  
Q. You got pretty emotional at the end of the championship game. The first
question you asked or first thing you said you were so proud of Roman Banks.
Roman Banks is within three of Gonzaga with two minutes 41 seconds left. So
talk why you had so much pride in Roman Banks and the Southern Jaguars and
Louisiana basketball?  
COACH MCCONATHY: Roman Banks played at Shreveport High School. Roman Banks was
the coach at Southern University at Shreveport when I was coaching at Bossier
Parish. He played on the team that beat Kentucky in Rupp Arena for
Northwestern State. He's an in‑club graduate Hall of Fame. Any time one of
your guys does good, graduates, you know, you got to feel real good about
that. And we're excited for Roman. And also he coached in the Southland
Conference as well as the assistant for several years at Southeastern
Louisiana. So that's important.  
You know, and in our culture today sometimes it's not very, for whatever
reason, we need to be happy when somebody does good. And it's just good to see
somebody do well. Whoever it is. So we're just really excited for him and
hopefully he can continue his quest to get a win.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about Northwestern State and Southern
being not two of the giant programs from the state of Louisiana, but you're
out in the forefront representing the state, and the top ‑tier of men's
basketball.   
COACH MCCONATHY: Well, that's interesting you ask that. I might mess this up
and have to act dumb, but I think since 2001 nine programs our size have
gotten to the NCAA tournament and have had more than two appearances.  
Southern has had, I believe, two since ‑‑ two in that period. And the same
year we went in 2005, twice they went, we went as well. And now we're both
back in it in 2013. Of course that was with two different coaches, but I do
think it's important, because Louisiana has a tremendous, rich history of
basketball. And for Southern University in the south and Northwestern State
Louisiana in the north to be able involved in an event of this magnitude does
a lot for the state, it does a lot for individual schools, individual
programs.  
I mean, it's just awesome to see the enthusiasm that's out there from our
students, from our towns people, from Shreveport, Baton Rouge, Alexandria. And
it's really and truly, I mean Louisiana, and Texas being right over here next
door to us would be the same way ‑‑ of course, Texas is a little larger than
Louisiana‑‑ but when one of your teams does well, it's just good to feel good
for somebody else.  
And, I mean, I just think that there's great basketball in Louisiana. We got
13 out of the our 17 kids in our program from Louisiana. And that just speaks
a lots for the talent level. And we want to be able to continue to get those
Louisiana guys to stay home.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with the Colorado student‑athletes. Take questions,
please.  
  
Q. Guys, last year you had obviously some good senior leadership that
manifested itself in March. Did you guys take that upon yourself to kind of
fill those roles this year?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Definitely feel like we took it upon ourselves. We only had
one senior, we had to help each other out. I feel like it started with the
juniors and it trickled down to the sophomores and freshmen. So we're in this
together. Everybody plays for each other. And that's what we preach every day.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: We have great senior leadership this year too. I'm sitting
next to Sabatino Chen, our lone senior, but our most important leader. And
then our leader number two right here, Dre. They just kind of do it by
committee. So they lead our team beautifully.  
SABATINO CHEN: Yeah, I think these guys said it best. It's just been a
collective team effort this year. And that's what we're going to do in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Andre, how does it feel to be back home or close to it, and could you
talk about it for a little bit. Tell us about what kinds of friends and family
you expect to be in the house.  
ANDRE ROBERSON: It feels great to be back in Texas where I consider home and
also close to Antonio where I'm from.  
Definitely I have a lot of friends and family coming to the game. I tried to
get as many tickets from coach as I could. Definitely I'll have a lot of
support out here, along with our alumni. So it should be a pretty good
support.  
  
Q. Andre, what's your health like? I read stories about you being ill the
last couple weeks of the season. What's it like and do you feel like you're
ready to go for the game tomorrow?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Definitely feel like I'm a hundred percent. Ready to go. I'm
back to normal. I had a viral illness a couple weeks back. But I feel good, so
I should be ready to go.  
  
Q. Andre, coach said you're going start out on Brandon Paul. What's the
strategy there?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Try not to give him any breathing room, dictate where he goes,
not where he wants to go. Just be aggressive with him. Try not to let him get
shots off because he's a dangerous player and he likes the three ball. So we
have a great game plan for him and I'll have to execute it.  
  
Q. Spencer, can you talk about what the Colorado basketball program is and
is it one of the better kept secrets in the country as far as its future and
how good it could be?  
SABATINO CHEN: I think it's up and coming. We have been doing great things
ever since Coach Boyle got there. And I think we're a little under the radar,
but each year we get more and more notice.  
I think we still have a lot of potential left.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: I second what he said. When coach was recruiting me he
talked about wanting to build Colorado into a perennial Top‑25 program and
that being his dream job. I think you see the strides that we're making
towards that. We have had three straight 20 win seasons. We had post season
play each time. Two of them being NCAA tournaments. We got a great recruiting
class, we got an NBA player. And we just are going to continue to try to get
better and try to keep playing good basketball.  
  
Q. You were here last year, you won last year, what do you take from that
going forward and does it make you want to advance further this year?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Definitely we want to advance further this year. Last year I
just felt like it was a stepping stone.  
We wanted to win the next game. But this year I feel like we can go all the
way. Especially with this year being down, what everybody's saying, definitely
feel like we can definitely go out there and compete with the best. So we're
going to have to just take it to the next game.  
SABATINO CHEN: Last year was just great to make the tournament, especially the
way we did, winning the pack 12 tournament. Or else we will probably wouldn't
have made it.  
So this year, with all of our experience I think we want to just build
momentum, keep winning the next game and go as far as we can.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: Yeah, they said pretty much everything. Each team that
makes it to this tournament feels they have a shot to win the championship.  
Each team takes it game by game. But they just want to win the next game and
try and compete and hopefully they win it all. That's what we want to do as
well.  
  
Q. For all three of you, as you've done film study of Illinois what have you
seen so far? What kind of challenges do you think they will post and do they
remind you of anybody you've seen earlier this season?  
SABATINO CHEN: Biggest thing I noticed is that they play lots of defenses, try
to throw you off. Big thing on offense is coach said they average like over 20
3's a game. So they live and die by the three. So if they get hot they can be
a really dangerous team.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: They shoot 24 3's a game. They have two big scorer's in
Richardson and Paul. Paul's a great playmaker as well.  
You want to make him as inefficient as possible and you want to hopefully
limit their efficiency from the 3‑point line because those are the two things
that make them dangerous when Paul is getting off and getting his teammates
involved. And when they're capitalizing on the 3 point opportunities.  
ANDRE ROBERSON: They're a great 3‑point shooting team. They get out and run.
Brandon Paul and Richardson, they score, and they definitely kind of remind me
of Washington or a little bit of UCLA. Getting out and running and shooting
the three ball very well.  
  
Q. Does last year's experience give you guys a different approach to this
year? I'm sure you were just in a whirlwind a year ago after winning the pack
12 tournament. What does that do for you guys this week?  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: Experience is always a good thing. It kind of settles down
a little bit, because it's not your first time. That kind of goes with
everything in life. So it's the same in this situation.  
At the same time it doesn't really do much for you in the sense of your
matchup because you're still going to have to go out there and compete and
they're going to compete as well. And you're just trying to win the game.  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. How does last year help you this year?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Last year helps this year definitely. We have guys that played
last year and definitely experience helps us. Definitely it's not all about
experience though. It's always going out there and competing and just being
aggressive.  
I feel like we did a great job of doing that last year and just coming out
firing and playing loose and confident. And I feel like if we do that this
year we can go far.  
SABATINO CHEN: I think mostly just for us three, just because we have been
there before, we'll just treat it like another game. And with the guys on our
team that haven't been there, we'll just try to give them as much help as we
can. Try to calm them down and I think we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Andre, you and your sister are both playing in the NCAA tournament. Can
you just talk about that family affair, I guess. Have you talked about it much
with her? Especially since she had to come back from that injury and now she's
getting a chance to do what you've done.  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Yeah, it's definitely cool to have a sister, not just playing
in the NCAA, but also at the school.  
But it's just great now that we both made it. Both programs are up and rising.
And I just kind of gave her a little tip of what we did last year and she
definitely kind of took it well. So it's pretty cool to have her in the NCAA
as well.  
  
Q. Andre, talk about your recruiting process and which Texas schools came in
on you late? Did you even consider them? And what attracted you to Colorado?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Yeah, my recruiting process, I was kind of a late bloomer. I
didn't really get recruited until after junior year. And that's when all the
schools started coming in. The big schools didn't really come in until I
started playing in high school the season. And I definitely took a trip up to
Colorado for an AAU tournament. Because I really didn't want to make a
decision yet. I was still searching around.  
But I took a trip up to Colorado, went to Northern Colorado, to meet Coach
Boyle because he was the head coach at the time. Even though I took an
unofficial to Colorado. So I went to go meet him and then later he signed to
Colorado and I took an official visit up there.  
But the Texas schools, they started coming in late. After everybody and
Colorado came in. Since they were in the Big‑12 at the time. And I kind of
took that as disrespect. Just kind of recruiting me late. Not really in the
beginning since I'm in Texas and all. So I just felt disrespected. So I just
felt like going to another Big‑12 school in this conference and kind of
getting back at them.  
  
Q. Which Texas school looked at you?  
ANDRE ROBERSON: Texas came in late, Texas Tech was early, A and M didn't look
at me and Baylor didn't either, so.  
  
Q. Spencer, talk about Andre's rebounding and what it brings to the game and
how it helps you guys control the game.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: Well our program is based on defense and rebounding and we
have the best rebounder in the country and arguably the best defender in the
country. So when have you a guy that's the best in the nation at what your
program is built upon, then it just makes everybody else's job easier.  
You have a guy that you can say, hey, I want you to shut down Jason Washburn,
who is a very good center at Utah or hey, I want you to shut down Brandon
Paul, who is a prolific two guard. So when you have a guy who can guard the
two through the five on the collegiate level, I mean it makes our whole team
just better. And it's easier to play different people. We can go small, go
big, and continue to be a great defensive team.  
  
Q. For Spencer and Sabatino, how much did you guys miss Andre when he was
gone as far as defense and everything like that goes?  
SABATINO CHEN: We missed him a lot. I think you could see that right away.
With the back to back Oregon State games. We lost the game at home and then we
win a game with him in the tournament. It just makes everyone's job easier,
like Spencer said. And without him we lack some depth that we have when he's
in the game to.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: His rebounding on the defensive end limits them to one
possession and then on the offensive end it gets us extra possessions.  
And it kind of limits our versatility on offense because when we have the two
wings and the big in, Josh and Dre, we can choose to post whoever has the
smallest man.  
If one has a bigger man we can drive him and then put that one on the wing. It
just makes us a lot more versatile. And that's what him and Xavier Johnson
kind of bring to the table. They are both players that can go inside and out
and pretty much just do it all for us.  
  
Q. All year long we heard about how great the Big ‑10 was and in the NCAA
seeding process, some of the PAC‑12 teams got seeded fairly low. Do you guys
have any kind of conference going on here too? Conference pride?   
ANDRE ROBERSON: Definitely. With the Big‑10 being talked about all the time I
feel like our conference has grown a lot since last year. With it being down
and all. I feel like we're definitely going to show it when we play. Because a
couple of us are matched up with a couple Big‑10 teams. So I think we're going
to show what we got.  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: For sure. Any time you have arguably actually probably not
even arguably, the best conference in the country and a conference that has
been maligned very recently and has kind of gained traction, I mean we want to
prove that we're as good as a lot of people think we are and that we play good
basketball on the West Coast. Yeah, we're rooting for each other. I want UCLA
to win their game, California, Oregon, Arizona to win theirs, even though
we're conference foes, but in the NCAA tournament you kind of root for your
conference to do well.  
SABATINO CHEN: Yeah, just to go out there, I just think maybe just because our
last year our conference was down so much that it probably hurt us a little
bit in the seeding process. But this conference is a lot better than it was
last year, it's like night and day. So I think we could compete with the
Big‑10\.  
  
Q. What separates Coach Boyle? What makes him such a good coach? Anything
that makes him distinctive?  
SPENCER DINWIDDIE: For me it's because pretty much everything that he's told
me in the recruiting process and now that I'm here he's just been a very
honest guy. So when you can build that type of trust and have you a
relationship with your coach in that manner, then it makes you want to run
through a wall for him. If you believe in him and you want to do something for
him, I mean that just makes you play that much harder and you see results of
what he's preaching also produce wins, so there's no down side really to it.  
SABATINO CHEN: I would say just the biggest thing would be his honesty from a
non‑basketball sense. He tells you exactly what he wants you to do, he doesn't
like play games with you or anything. And then basketball wise, he's a great
just player's coach. He makes you individually a better player.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen, we're going to let you go now.
We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH BOYLE: Well, it's great to be back in the NCAA tournament. Great to be
in Austin, Texas. We're excited. Our team just got done with a very spirited
practice, our guys are dialed in, and hopefully ready to play well tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Questions?  
  
Q. How does that change as far as Big ‑12, PAC‑12, and do you think maybe
the PAC‑12 is even a better fit as much as you recruit California?   
COACH BOYLE: Well, I think it's a good fit for our university on a lot of
different levels, not just athletics. So we were excited about the move. We
were certainly, it was bitter sweet, because we love the Big‑12, had a lot of
great history there. But it has been good for us in terms of opening up
California recruiting and if you look at our roster, we have got a pretty
heavy influence there. We still have a Texas influence, Andre Roberson,
obviously, we signed Andre from San Antonio when we were still members of the
Big‑12\.  
But in the landscape of college athletics now, we're not the only school to go
through it. So you got to make the most of it. I think we have. I think it's
been a positive thing for our basketball program. But we miss the Big‑12\.
It's good to be back in this country.  
  
Q. How is the leadership of this team evolved throughout the year after
losing the seniors last year?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, I think the three guys that were up here preceding me is a
good indication of how it's evolved. I think it's been a work in progress,
Sabatino Chen being our only senior has kind of, was kind of our leader by
default early. But he's really become more vocal as the season's gone on.
Andre has really grown into that role. I think he's a guy that certainly in
the locker room has everybody's ear, has their respect. And Spencer, I think,
has made some strides in that regard as well.  
So I think that was something as we started this season coming off of last
year's NCAA team and three seniors who were great leaders has been a positive
thing for us. But it has been a work in progress and there's been some bumps
along the road. With you but I think those three kids have emerged and we got
some other guys capable of it as well.  
  
Q. You've mentioned that Andre's going to start on Brandon Paul. What was
the thought process behind that?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, matchup. When Josh obviously starting our big guy and then
Xavier Johnson, we'll start on their four man who is really a pick and pop
guy. If they start ‑‑ if they go big with two post players, Xavier Johnson can
guard him. So it really allows us, matchup wise, to get Andre on Paul and then
Spencer can guard as well and obviously Ski will guard their point guard. So
Spencer and Dre are our best two perimeter defenders and we're going to put
them on their two best offensive guards production wise, so it really works
out well. Obviously Jeremy and Sabatino Chen when he they come in, it will be
kind of a rotating deal as the game goes on.  
  
Q. What do you see on film that's the key to guarding Paul?  
COACH BOYLE: The key on film is you have to be there when he catches it. He's
got deep range, he's a he's got the green light. He'll let it fly when he
catches it. So I think being there on the catch and the one thing Andre's got
is he's got great length, he's got great athleticism. He's going to have to
get through a lot of screens. He'll get some bumps and bruises tomorrow, but
using his length and athleticism to be there on the catch and play Brandon's
shot high is the key. Because he's got a quick release and he's a very capable
shooter of getting hot and we want to try to not let that happen.  
  
Q. As far as recruiting goes, how many top players do you feel like D ‑I
players, Colorado in‑state produces year and how do you sell Colorado?   
COACH BOYLE: Well, Colorado I've always said this, is a, what I call a
cyclical state. It's not like Texas, it's not like California, where you know
year‑in and year‑out you're going to be able to recruit some blue chip type
basketball players. Some years there's going to be more than others. There's
always going to be some, but you don't know how many. Last year was a good
example. Josh Scott and Wesley Gordon were two big time recruits, big time
players we were able to get both of them. This year we didn't recruit Colorado
very heavily in the 2013 class. Next year, there's some good ones coming.
Following year there's some good ones coming. But there's not the depth in the
recruiting classes that you're going to find in a state like Texas and a state
like California.  
That's why we signed Dustin Thomas a kid from Texarkana in November, we're
very excited about him. So we'll always recruit Texas and California when we
can't get the players that we need or that we want out of Colorado.  
  
Q. How about for selling the school.  
COACH BOYLE: Selling our school?  
  
Q. Lack of basketball tradition.  
COACH BOYLE: Well, we have got tradition, the problem is our tradition is
spotty. We have been to a Final Four. It's been since 1950s. We have been to
multiple NCAA tournaments, it's been since the 1960's. So we have had pockets.
We have got Chauncey Billups, obviously, at the end of his NBA career, who led
his team to the NCAA tournament and then the 2003 team.  
So we have had pockets of success, we haven't had sustained success. In terms
of selling Colorado basketball, we sell the opportunity to come and make your
mark on a program and leave your stamp on a program and build a legacy. I
think you see the players in our team right now, Andre Roberson, Spencer
Dinwiddie, Josh Scott, all the guys that are in our program that have come to
Colorado to do that is appealing. If you've never been to Boulder, we have got
a lot to sell. It's a beautiful place to live, a beautiful campus, a beautiful
community. We have got everything we need to be successful at Colorado and
it's just a matter of believing it and getting young machine and their
families to believe it.  
  
Q. The players were asked about how last year's experience might help them
this year. Does that also apply to you and your coaches having been here last
year?  
COACH BOYLE: I don't know. I don't see it so much as coaches. You're preparing
for a team that you haven't seen before, just like we had to do for UNLV last
year. This year it's Illinois. And if you're fortunate enough to advance, it's
a quick turn around. We have done that in Charleston and Puerto Rico the year
before. So from a coaching standpoint I don't see a benefit of having been
here before. I think that you're more familiar with what goes on and if that's
helpful, it's helpful. But I don't think it helps you win games. I think it's
just business as usual preparing your team and getting them to play well.  
  
Q. With such a limited window of time to get acquainted to a foreign
opponent do you really focus in on Illinois's big wins or do you kind of get a
mix?  
COACH BOYLE: We look kind of more at their recent games and they have had some
big wins in there, obviously. You look at some of their close games where you
know how teams that have played them close. But we have looked more at the
last five, six games more so than going back to an early game. We watched the
Gonzaga game, because obviously that was a good game for the Illini and beat a
heck of a team. But mostly the more recent games is what we dial into. Not
worrying about who it is. And you also look to see teams that play like you
defensively and maybe offensively and see what worked or what didn't work.  
  
Q. Talk about what you have seen in Brandon Paul and sort of, he seems to be
‑‑ some games he just dominates and other games he's not necessarily the
scoring guy. What do you see from him and how do you try and deal with him?   
COACH BOYLE: Well, he's a heck of a player, obviously. He's got great size. I
think that one of the things you see with a guy like Brandon Paul is he's the
focal point of everybody's defense. So I think that's why you maybe when you
see him play every game you feel like, oh, there's some, maybe some
inconsistencies there. Well, there's every defense that is going up against
Illinois has got Brandon Paul in the forefront of their mind. And we're no
different.  
So he's a big guard. Again, he can put the ball on the floor. He can shoot the
ball from deep. And they run a lot of screens for him. You got to be there on
his catch and understand that he's a big shot taker and he's a big shot maker.
He's going to make some tough shots and we know that. It's just we have got to
try to make him work for everything that he gets and make sure everything
comes over our hands.  
  
Q. How does your Kansas background shape you as a coach and I understand you
used to shut down Bill Self at Oklahoma State.  
COACH BOYLE: (Laughter.) Yeah, Bill and I always joke that he liked playing
against me because I was the only guy he could guard and I liked playing
against him because he was the only guy I could guard. So we played against
each other for four years.  
But my Kansas background helped me having played two years for Ted Owens who
recruited me there, really prepared me well and then obviously Larry Brown
came in. It's helped me in my coaching background in dealing with young men.
And usually when you take over a program, I took one over at Northern
Colorado, as a head coach, and now at the University of Colorado three years
ago, it helps you understand what young men are going through when they go
through a coaching change. That's helped me a lot. It's given me a great
understanding that Coach Owens, as successful as he was, and Coach Brown, as
successful as he's been, Hall of Fame coach, two totally different
personalities, two totally different styles. How you can be successful being
yourself in this business. And it's given me a great background.  
But I think the best advice I think I was given and I think Coach Brown gave
it to me when I got this job was, just be Tad Boyle, be who you are, don't try
to be somebody else. But those basketball minds, along with guys like Mark
Turgeon and people that I've worked with coming up as assistant coach have
helped form me.  
  
Q. Were you a bit slow?  
COACH BOYLE: I was slow. Yeah, I wasn't a step slow, I was two steps slow.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.
