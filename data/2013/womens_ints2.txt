# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  70  
Penn State  66

  
Q. Mia, where did it get away from you guys the second half?  
MIA NICKSON: I'm not sure of the exact time, but I think that they just came
out second half with a little bit more firepower, a little bit more
determination, getting off of the offensive boards, getting open looks, things
like that. You know, around that six‑minute mark, I guess, if I had to guess.  
  
Q. How tough is it for the seniors for it to end this way?  
MIA NICKSON: I mean, it's really tough. We worked really hard to get here. You
know, the last four years have been great starting from where we were until
now, where we are right now. Of course we wanted it to end better, but it's a
tough one. It's going to be hard to swallow, this being our last game and
everything. But we wish the team great success, and we're looking forward to
what they're going to do next year.  
  
Q. It seemed to be a game where both teams just went on big momentum swings
either way. Did you feel it kind of slipping away towards the end when they
started knocking down shots, or did you feel like you had another run in you
towards the end of the game to kind of pull one out?  
MIA NICKSON: I thought we did have another one. Like you said, it was a game
of momentum. We just didn't have enough time. I think that's what it came down
to. They did what they needed to do in the 40 minutes, and we just didn't.  
  
Q. At what point did you become aware that Kenney wasn't going to play for
them, and as a coach, do you fear what they did, which looked like they
rallied and they played with a lot of emotion, especially on their home floor?
You feel you have an advantage but at the same time you think they might have
one, as well?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Regarding Kenney, I didn't pay any attention to whether
she was playing or not until we got to the arena, and I just came into the
game assuming that she would play, and when she didn't play, I didn't think
that that was going to be a negative necessarily for them. I thought it would,
like you said, be something that they would rally around. They've been a team
all season that played through adversity and seemed to‑‑ any kind of
adversity, they kind of used that as fuel, and certainly that happened
tonight, that they had some added emotion, and along with the home crowd, and
that was fantastic, giving them an added boost of energy and adrenaline.  
  
Q. How important do you think it was that they got off to that 8 ‑0 run to
start the second half after it seemed like you guys had taken the momentum
into halftime?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Yeah, that was pretty big. But I knew that we felt like
they would have a run in the second half, you know, and we bounced back from
that and were able to get a five‑ or six‑point lead after that. It was a game
of runs, and I thought if we had gotten off to a little bit better start, I
thought we started the game, and we had our chances to go up maybe six, eight,
zero, and we didn't knock those shots down, and it seemed to give this crowd
life. We missed a couple of open shots that we had early.  
  
Q. Maggie Lucas was obviously your best scorer and she didn't have a really
good game today. Tell us what LSU did and how frustrating it was just to try
to get her into the offense, especially late in the ballgame?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, it wasn't frustrating at all, because she's had
games throughout the season where she hasn't shot the ball well, and I thought
she got some pretty good looks, and they just didn't fall down for her.  
But some other people got going. I thought Nikki Greene had a very productive
offensive night, Ariel Edwards was very productive offensively for us, Alex
Bentley was very productive offensively. Certainly we wish Maggie would have
made some shots, but I don't think that had anything to do with‑‑ it wasn't
frustrating, so to speak. She got good looks, she didn't knock them down, so
that's basketball. That's the way it goes some nights.  
  
Q. What did you think of Webb's impact in the game both offensively and
defensively?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I thought her biggest impact was offensively. Yeah,
I thought she hit some really tough pull‑up shots, and I think a big momentum
boost for them was she hit a three towards the latter part of the second half,
and I think it even put them up one or cut the game to one. But I thought that
was a big play, and it gave them a lot of momentum to close out the game.  
  
Q. I think you had like three buckets over the last seven plus minutes.
Offensively what made it tough for you guys to score over that stretch?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I mean, they did a good job defensively of trying to
clog the lane. I thought we got some good looks in the paint that didn't go
down, and that pretty much was it. You know, I thought‑‑ I thought we got
pretty good shots. We went inside, and stretches of the game it was good for
us. Down the stretch we didn't‑‑ we got some good looks for Maggie down the
stretch, they just didn't go in.  
But of more concern was the fact that we didn't get stops late in the game.
You know, if we could get a couple stops, I mean, the last basket that they
scored that literally posted Maggie up in the paint, that's a tough play. I
felt like they got‑‑ they made a couple‑‑ a few big shots down the stretch,
and defensively we've been better than that, and we just needed to be a little
bit better defensively the last three minutes of the ballgame. And we've done
that throughout the year. We've had stretches of games or different games
where we've held teams scoreless the last five, six, seven, eight minutes of a
game, and we didn't do that tonight. Down the stretch they pretty much, when
they needed a basket, they got a basket. So defensively I felt we could have
been a little bit better.  
  
Q. I guess now all the 3 seeds are out and this is probably an example of
how cruel and surprising this game can be. You guys probably have a little bit
deeper and more experienced team but not quite going as far. Can you comment
on that?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Comment on what?  
  
Q. Just all four 3 seeds being out.  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I'm not quite sure where you want me to go with it. I
mean, it's a tournament. People lose. Upsets happen. So I mean, it is‑‑ that's
part of the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your seniors, what they've meant for you and your
program?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Yes. It's really disappointing for our seniors, because
they have given so much to our program and they have given so much to their
teammates. They are the reason that we're in this position and that we were
able to reestablish Penn State as one of the nation's elite programs on the
backs of Nikki Greene and Mia Nickson and Gizelle Studevent and Marisa Wolfe
and Alex Bentley. And we certainly had hopes that we would be able to advance
in this tournament for them. But it won't happen this year, but we will
certainly carry their spirit with us into the future, and as we compete next
year and the year after that and the year after that, the spirit of these five
seniors will resonate through our locker room and carry us to great heights,
greater heights than we've reached. They got the ball rolling, and now it's up
to their teammates who are coming back, their future teammates who are still
in high school right now to take what they started and to push it farther,
higher, deeper, stronger, and that's the challenge, and that's what's great
about being a pioneer and being women of character and women of courage to
come to Penn State and to reestablish a tradition.  
And so their spirits will live with us long, long after their days of wearing
a Lady Lion uniform. I couldn't be prouder of them.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  70  
Penn State  66

  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Really proud of our team and what they did tonight without one
of our leaders in Jeanne Kenney. It was just a courageous effort on these
seven young ladies, and coming away with a great win against a very, very
tough Penn State. But I'm so proud of the two ladies sitting to my left. They
deserve this. They have worked extremely hard, and we've still got some more
basketball to be played.  
  
Q. How much did you think towards the end of the game of the Tennessee game
when it was so close, how much did that cross your mind?  
BIANCA LUTLEY: I wasn't really thinking about the Tennessee game, I was just
thinking about what I need to do to make sure that the game ended the way that
Coach Nikki and I'm pretty sure everybody in the gym wanted it to end, and a
lot of people didn't believe in us, but we came out and did what they were
supposed to do.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I'll add to what Bianca said. Tennessee's loss was not really
in the back of our mind, but what was in our mind is this is our last game
here, and we have to take care of our house really. We just came out there and
said that we're going to buckle down. We don't want a repeat of what happened
last year. We wanted to give our all in our last game. We had to do that. And
everybody just stepped up.  
  
Q. Adrienne, maybe I just noticed it because it was happening right in front
of you, but it seemed like you were trying to make your way to one spot on the
baseline and trying to take all your shots. Is that your spot and is that what
led you to putting up 29 points tonight?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I would say my favorite shot is the baseline shot, either side,
but I mean, it's really coming off the dribble, getting around the ball screen
was what I really had to do for us to win. Just shots were falling during that
time.  
  
Q. Adrienne, I think it was a career high for you in points in what would
have been your last game had you not won, and I wondered if you could just
talk about the mindset, the assertiveness and what you learned about yourself
in this game, and then for Bianca, talk about playing with four fouls for the
last 12 minutes and coming up big in the end.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I came into this game thinking that as a senior and being one
of five‑‑ two senior upperclassmen that I had to play my hardest in our last
game because it's do or die. And it's winner advance or loser go home. But I
really had to assert myself trying to come to the ball and finding open gaps
when my teammates were either penetrating or someone doubled on
(indiscernible).  
BIANCA LUTLEY: When I picked up my fourth foul and went to the sideline,
everybody was just telling me keep my head up and help my teammates from the
sideline, and once I got back in, I adjusted how the ref was calling, and I
was just making sure that I wasn't then trying to pick a ball from a big man,
just playing smart.  
  
Q. After the sluggish end of the first half you came out in the second half
and went on a run. Did coach tell you anything that led to that spark?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Coach fired us up in the locker room at halftime, really
talking about how we got our lead in the first half and also how we lost it.
But what it really came down to was our heart and our effort on both ends of
the floor. So we really took to heart what she said and came out and executed
at the beginning of the second half.  
  
Q. Adrienne, great defensive job against Maggie Lucas. What was your
mentality, and was that important to you not just to slow her down but to hold
her to nine points? That's something right there.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, Maggie Lucas is a great player. She's a threat in the
three‑point areas and coming off ball screens and inside the screen knocking
down that shot. So my goal was to keep her from catching the ball, and whether
that's going under the screen or fighting over that way, she has no‑‑ the
passer has no angle to pass her the ball. And the coaches really pressed upon
that in practice the past two days.  
  
Q. Adrienne, I know you guys this year and last year got used to playing
through adversity and injuries. But still, to not have Jeanne tonight, for her
not even to be here to cheer you on, can you just talk about did that rally
you guys? How were you able to deal with that?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: We did not want our last game to be played with seven players.
All seven of us got together and really came together and played for our fans
which were out there and everyone who had supported us, and we also played for
Jeanne, because for me Jeanne has really been a leader for us on the court,
vocal, getting stops on defense, coming down, taking charges, and I wanted to
see her play one more game. That was my motivation at the beginning of the
game, that I wanted to play this game and have Jeanne Kenney out on the floor
with me.  
BIANCA LUTLEY: I think without Jeanne, everybody was missing her, but at the
same time we knew that we had to come out and get the job done so Jeanne would
be able to travel with us and hopefully she would be able to play with us on
Saturday. We miss her.  
  
Q. The whole time, the last few days, were you preparing not to have Jeanne,
and what did it do to your game plan?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We prepared not looking at Jeanne not being with us, but with
the seven that we knew had to go ahead to play, what we had to do. We also
talked about being in this situation before where we only had seven active
bodies. There's been times we've only had six in the course of a game. But
this team found a way and they stayed together when they were making their run
at us, and we were able to weather the storm. Once it got to late game, their
play calls were where they needed to be, ours were, and we were able to get
the stops we needed down the stretch.  
This was a great basketball game. It was fun to coach. Coach Washington has
done a phenomenal job with Penn State, and again, we're just very, very proud
to be able to get on the court again to play another game.  
  
Q. Obviously Adrienne made a lot of noise with the 29 points, but probably
more impressive were her defensive efforts. She was on Maggie Lucas like a
glove for the majority of the game. Can you talk about what she did that make
her so effective tonight?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Adrienne Webb, and I've said this before, is one of the
hardest working players I've ever coached or been around, and her competitive
spirit on the defensive end allowed her to really have the attitude that you
have to have when you face a player like Lucas, who does a lot for her team.
So it was going to be a battle of Webb versus Lucas, if you will, and Webb did
what she needed to do. She stayed true to our game plan.  
And then on the offensive end, because of her conditioning, she was able to
really get some great looks and knock down some shots, but her mental
toughness is something that she has fostered throughout the offseason, and so
she's been training for this type of game, this type of environment, this type
of situation.  
  
Q. It seemed like this game had phases, and I'm sure if someone had told you
that Plaisance was only going to score eight points you would have been quite
scared, but it seemed like you had phases, you had the phase where Adrienne
was going off and you had the phase down the stretch. How was this game to
coach with just how kind of weird this game was with your top scorer not being
on and their top scorer not being on?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Theresa has commanded double teams, and we play out of
them. If she sets great screens, then we can be efficient offensively, and
that's what she did, she did some good things for us, although she wasn't
scoring the basketball, she did have some good looks.  
I was proud of our two seniors for stepping up and making the plays down the
stretch. That's what your seniors are supposed to do, and that's exactly what
they did.  
We didn't shoot the ball, Theresa didn't shoot the ball extremely well,
neither did Ballard, but then when you can get our centers, Derryal and
Shanece McKinney to step up and give you anywhere from 10 to 12 points, that
makes up for a Plaisance. So everybody did their part tonight in picking up
the slack where it was needed.  
  
Q. What do you think are Jeanne's chances of playing on Saturday, and is it
a concussion, and why did she not come to the game, or I guess it was better
for her not to be here?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Yes, it was better for her not to be here. We want her to be
symptom free. If we get the go‑ahead for her to play Saturday, we'll do so.
Again, we won't risk anything. But this team really has rallied around Jeanne,
and like Webb said, they want to be on the floor with her. She's one of our
leaders, and if they need that motivation come Saturday, if Jeanne isn't with
us, then I'm sure they will use it however they need to. But we hope to have
her ready to go on Saturday.  
  
Q. I know it's way too early and obviously your emotions are high, but do
you know anything about Cal, and what do you expect from them on Saturday?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Cal has a veteran squad, and Kyra Dunn has done a great
job for them being a leader, a guard that's really nice off the bounce, and
then you look at their players inside, they've got some active, athletic
players. Caldwell does a great job for them, and they've got a balanced
attack. Their guard play is pretty strong as well as their post game. So we've
got to be ready to, again, defend a team that can score inside and from the
perimeter.  
  
Q. Did Jeanne watch the game at home, and how crazy do you think ‑‑ I know
she's hurt, but how crazy do you think she was going having to sit there and
watch that at home?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Jeanne, I'm sure she was screaming and yelling and
probably shouldn't be. We just really have taken the necessary steps to make
sure that she stays calm and not get herself too aroused, but how can you not
be in a game like this. And I know that she is extremely proud of her
teammates for the way they played, and I know that they‑‑ like Bianca said,
they miss her and we miss her on the bench. But again, Jeanne has left her
print on this team, and they carry her with them in everything they do.  
  
Q. Did the crowd fill in for Jeanne?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: They did. They did. You know, when you have the support and
the fans and how rowdy and loud they were, they gave us that extra energy, if
you will, that we needed. Obviously we had to create the plays, but they
brought it home for us.  
I could see our team really taking in the atmosphere here, and it was a great
atmosphere, especially for our seniors, knowing that this is their last game
at home, and we just appreciate the fans who have stayed the course with us
and who continue to believe in us when things looked a little bleak. But this
was an unbelievable crowd.  
  
Q. You've been at LSU for two years and you've already racked up an
impressive number of wins. Talk about the possibility of this being the game
that you look back on that really helped build and solidify your program.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, you know, each game that we played this year has helped
us get to this point. When you play a team like Penn State, playing in the
SEC, you're going to see great guard play, you're going to see great post
play. This game is definitely going to be one of those memorable games because
of how special it's been, the journey thus far with this team. The other thing
I'll say about this year is that when you lose five seniors a lot of people
talk about you're rebuilding, you're going to be young, and this team has
really just relished around the idea that the game does not know their age. We
had three returning players that saw quite a bit of minutes last year, and
everybody else is new.  
You know, that says a lot about them as basketball players. But again, this
game, it's March, and anything is possible, and as long as these young ladies
keep going out there and putting it on the line and laying everything they
have out there.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
Q. Wondering before I ask the question, is there an update on Jeanne?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, at this time Jeanne is going to be reevaluated. She's
feeling a lot better than what she was yesterday after taking that, having
that collision. So we are still waiting to find out more, whether Jeanne will
be able to go or not.  
  
Q. For the players, whether it's seven or eight, Penn State is an up ‑tempo
style, and how are you going to deal with that with the numbers that you have?
  
THERESA PLAISANCE: You know, playing with Jeanne or without Jeanne, we have to
be ready to go at all costs. We've played against teams like Kentucky and
Tennessee all year, pushing the ball up and down the court and we fought
through adversity all year long, driving down to seven and six at times and we
had two and three players out.  
This is just going to be another test to see if we can push through it like we
have all year long.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: To elaborate on what Theresa said, we have been in adversity
all year, we have been up‑and‑down with different players getting hurt, and we
just have to go out and play hard tomorrow, and whether we have seven, eight
playing, or we have six, seven playing, we still have to go out there and play
our game.  
  
Q. Adrienne, no one has asked how you feel; how did you manage to get
through that without having some kind of injury last night?  
COACH CALDWELL: She has a hard head.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I have a pretty hard head. I don't know, I guess the adrenaline
just kicked in and just got me right back up. But doing fine and be ready for
tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Also, about the game, considering that you played them last year and they
have a similar team and you have similar players; is there a little bit of
déjà vu? Does it feel like maybe a big SEC game, a team that you're familiar
with, playing in your home arena again? There's a lot of things that are
familiar about last year's game.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Absolutely, but there's a lot of things that are familiar. Some
players are familiar, than others, but it's a new season, it's a new game, and
we have to go out there and play to our potential. And even though we have
seen like Maggie and Nikki Greene on the inside, we have to kind of know their
game and know their number, basically.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I honestly don't even remember the game from last year up
until last night when we had to watch game film, and then things started
clicking and I started to get those flashbacks. But you know, this is a new
year. We have a completely new starting lineup, and you know, we have new
things to offer this year. So I think it's going to be a different game with
some similarities.  
  
Q. How are you guys different than the team that played Penn State last
year?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, we are a lot different. First of all, we don't have
the five seniors, four of which played in that game, pulling us through this
year. We depend a lot of Boogie Barrett and Courtney Jones to get us through,
and this year we have a lot of new weapons. We have a lot of new guard play.
We don't have the same setup as last year. We have me inside, me and Shanece
battling on the inside this year and maybe not relying on that quick game that
Boogie and Courtney brought, slowing down a little bit on the inside.  
We also have a lot of versatility with Bianca being able to drive and dish out
to Webb or whoever spots up on the outside. And a great addition to this team
is Danielle Ballard. She brings a lot offensively and defensively, and that's
a great addition to this team, and you know, I think Danielle is going to do
well against a team like Penn State.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Yeah, our teams are very different from going to a lot of upper
classmen last year to maybe two or three to actually really play‑‑ missed a
lot of last year and having a lot of newcomers that are stepping into that
leadership role. But we've had a lot of adversity but we've fought through it
as a team.  
So we have gotten better, each and every game, each and every practice that
we've had.  
  
Q. Since you've had the opportunity to go back and watch the film from last
year's game, obviously Maggie Lucas was the big star of that game. How would
you all describe her as a player, and what are you looking to do tomorrow
night with her?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, I certainly know Maggie Lucas as a friend and I know
that Maggie Lucas is an extremely hard worker. You know, there's not too many
times that you won't catch her in the gym and that just shows in her game
play. I think she's averaging 22 points this year, and you know, that's just a
testament to her like working really hard.  
So yeah, a lot of attention is going to be on Maggie Lucas but there's a lot
of other players that they have that can do us a lot of damage, too. Alex
Bentley, senior point guard, she's not looking to go out with a loss, and I
know we are fighting for our seniors, too. And also you have Nikki Greene on
the inside, one of the most dominant posts in the Big Ten Conference. They
have a lot of weapons and so do we.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I realize that Maggie is one of their assets on their team, but
you really can't just take away her and not worry about everyone else. You
have to be on your toes on each player on the court, because on any given
night, each person can actually go off.  
  
Q. You come into this game having won eight out of nine and probably feel
like it should be nine out of ten. Can you talk about how that may be an
indication of figuring things out with some of the new players as the year
went along, and how much confidence that gives you coming into this game
against a strong team like Penn State?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Starting off this year, we had a lot of ups and downs. We
won some, we lost some, we really struggled on the road. But that just showed
our lack of maturity and lack of togetherness. As we got through the year and
got to Tennessee you started seeing a team that was more united and more
together.  
And since Tennessee, I feel like we have been playing more as a unit instead
of individuals and not that we were unconsciously being, you know, individuals
before then, but we really started to mesh and really started to build that
chemistry that, you know, we are starting a completely new starting lineup,
one of us being a freshman, and you know, it's hard to adjust to different
styles of play.  
We are finally getting a feel for each other and ever since that Tennessee
game, we seemed to mesh pretty well, and we have just grown as a group since
that game.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Theresa put everything into words. We have matured over the
year. We have really become a close‑knit group of ladies and it shows in our
play each and every time we step out on the court. I mean, referring back to
that Tennessee loss, after that, we really came together and matured as a team
each and every game.  
  
Q. Sometimes when there is that much roster overhaul it can take teams time
to sort out. Obviously there's been adversity that's come with only having
seven or eight bodies, but in a way do you think it's an odd kind of blessing,
there's no room to hide, and just by necessity, you had to be plugged into
spots and operate?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Definitely, the biggest show of that would be Derreyal
Youngblood, a freshman that we are expecting a lot out of in the paint. She's
come in, started off the year being too aggressive and over time, you slowly
see her developing into a D1 athlete that's doing a great job. We can go to
her inside and we just know she's going to power through and get a finish,
some big time rebounds from her.  
And also Danielle Ballard, she broke the record for the steals, not just
defensively, and offensively she does so much and creates so much for us.  
That's just two of the players that have done a lot for us this year, and just
being able to grow and adapt to each other's game and it's something that we
had to do, it took a little bit longer than expected but it eventually
happened.  
  
Q. Would you talk a little bit more about your friendship with Maggie, in
the locker room, she talked about how you went to AAU ball; how hard is she
going to be to defend?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Maggie and I have been friends, we go way back. We really
got close on the McDonald's team, we were on the same rock band team, we won
that championship. We have been very close ever since then. But Maggie Lucas
is one of those players that, you know, she's a special player.  
I know she works so hard, and she has a deadly release. You know, hand down,
man down; if you're not ready at any split second, she'll just release it and
doesn't matter who is guarding her. I don't think it really bothers her who is
guarding her; that shot is going up. Maggie Lucas is going to be a tough
person to guard strictly because of that fast release.  
  
Q. Specifically what was the injury to Jeanne? Was it a concussion or head
injury?  
COACH CALDWELL: They obviously wanted to be cautious on everything, and so
they did some tests, ran some tests last night and she passed some of those.
She did some good things this morning.  
We obviously want to re‑evaluate and see how she's feeling, a lot better.
She's being evaluated by doctors now. Any time that she would be diagnosed
with a concussion, our athletic department, we definitely would not take any
unnecessary measures to get her here. If she's out and they come back and say
that she is, that's what it is. Jeanne is one of those players‑‑ we told
Jeanne, we need to know, how are you feeling, because she would literally
fight her way back if she could.  
So she's being very up front and honest with how she's been feeling, so that's
been a positive, but she's been feeling good. So we are going to obviously
wait to see what the evaluation leads to after today.  
  
Q. What about her makes it so you have to be sure that she is being
completely truthful ‑‑  
COACH CALDWELL: She's a competitor. I'm not saying that she's a fibber, but
she's a competitor. She is someone, you know, we have had to at times, I've
told her, I've said, you're not going, you're not practicing today. I would
have to pull her from practice.  
She would not pull herself. And talking and working closely with Mickey, our
athletic trainer, we would literally force her to not practice because she
always wants to be out there on the floor. But she's been banged up and her
teammates understand that there's times when she will need to sit out on some
of the runs or things that we are doing up‑and‑down.  
But then she's always the first one to try to get back into drills and we're
like, Jeanne, you're fine, you know the game plan, don't worry about it. But
she's that type of player, which you love. You definitely love someone who has
that competitive spirit who isn't a quitter, and she's definitely a fighter.  
  
Q. You've had to be creative all year with the lineups with eight, but if
you get to seven, is that a little too much subtraction? What do you do if
you're at seven; is that going to be a suitable number?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, as long as three of them don't foul out, we'll be okay.
We have started different lineups this year. When Jeanne was banged up after
the Missouri game, we came back with Lutley and she played extremely well last
into for us. Being a senior, she has the experience and she's been to
postseason play. She understands what is at stake here and obviously she's
going to do everything in her power to help her team win.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up to that, it's going to sound odd to ask this, I know
coaches like to have as many options as possible, but has it been something
unique in having eight and giving you‑‑ just knowing, this is what I have to
work with, reduce the stress in planning what the team can do?  
COACH CALDWELL: The one thing about having eight players is they have become a
lot tighter. When you're traveling, it's a smaller number. They definitely
have their own personalities, but they have kind of taken on this, "Eight is
Enough" and what does that mean, eight is enough. Eight is enough for us to
come out every day and compete and play the way that we want to play.  
This group has been fun to coach. I have been overly thrilled to come every
day to practice because our practices are now really short, so it seems like
their attention span is there. Because they know we can't go long because we
don't have the bodies.  
The other thing is there's a different level, sense of urgency on their part,
because they know that you cannot keep looking down the bench is: You're going
to play. It's not an option. They cannot hide, and they all understand their
role for this team. And if someone does not do their role or they are, you
know, not having a great game, we only have maybe one other person that can
step it up.  
So they are taking on a little bit more ownership of this team, which is what
you want all the time, because it is their team.  
  
Q. How do you deal with a player like that in this situation, do you bring
her the game plan and try to tell her? And Derreyal didn't play last night,
any particular reason for that? One assumes she's going to have to play
tomorrow night.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, Jeanne, she probably was already on synergy last night
watching the game, knowing her. She's a very smart player, and you know, she
will pick up what we need to do. We have done a loot of walk‑throughs before
because we have been pretty banged up. We have done mental scouting reports
where it's just really focusing in on the film work, the film, would, the film
work.  
The question with Derreyal Youngblood, the game last night was a very up‑tempo
game. You had a team‑‑ one of the best teams in the country, that had four and
five players that could shoot the three. So we knew that was going to be a
challenge for Derreyal Youngblood, but she's also been in that situation where
she's had to come back and had to battle against teams that have power post
players and she's been successful.  
So we look for her to get some valuable minutes for us tomorrow night because
she definitely can contribute and help us.  
  
Q. How surprised were you to see Penn State again?  
COACH CALDWELL: You know, I haven't really been on any of the selection or
been to any of‑‑ the committees, how they do the brackets and things like
that. I know that when you see a team like Penn State, arguments can be out
there for them, they could easily have been a 2‑seed or a 3‑seed.  
I was more surprised to see Green Bay. They are one of the best 11‑seeds that
I've seen in a long time. I do think that they are a team that with Green Bay
that easily could have been where we are at. But with Penn State, you know,
it's a situation where you've got teams that are hosting, and so you know,
you've got to send someone somewhere. You know, we are the type or I'm the
type where I look at the bracket and I know it's totally out of our control;
so that I was more surprised, more so with Green Bay.  
But Penn State is one of those teams that you've got to play the best and they
are one of the best teams in the country, and we understand that second round
games are going to be tough and challenging, and that's just the draw that we
got.  
  
Q. I'm looking at Shanece's game and she just stood out to me more than
anybody except the threes from Adrienne, when you look at size from Penn
State, they will probably try to exploit their physicality inside and when I
look at your bigs, they don't have the same kind of style, but with Theresa
playing out behind the arc, is that an advantage compared to maybe the
physical play inside and can maybe Shanece's and Derreyal come in and be
physical down low?  
COACH CALDWELL: They definitely can. Shanece and Derreyal Youngblood have
shown that they can compete and defend some of the best players in the
country. You know, you think about Nikki Greene, she's definitely one of those
players that you've got to have a conversation about, but so is Kelly Bond
with Texas A&M. So they found success being able to battle
All‑American‑calibre type players.  
Theresa gives us an opportunity to expand our offense because of her ability
to shoot the three‑ball. With that said, everybody knows her game and
everybody knows exactly what she can and can't do.  
But we have got to make sure that we continue to put her in the most
successful situations, but she's going to have to be able to have that power
presence as well, because Plaisance can score in the paint and we are going to
need her, we are going to need paint points against a very aggressive
man‑to‑man, get into you type defense. We are going to have to be able to
handle that pressure and Theresa is going to be a big part of that.  
  
Q. Falling apart question. Seems like the breaks you've had have been
fortuitous, because it gives you a semblance of a rotation, three in the
front, five in the back; do you feel like things broke in your favor that way,
that you can actually maintain some semblance of normalcy ‑‑ looking at the
numbers, realistically, can you maintain somewhat of a normal rotation out of
all that?   
COACH CALDWELL: We can. We have got versatility and we have got players that
can play more than one position. Theresa Plaisance has played one through five
for us this year. Bianca has played one through four. So they give us an
opportunity to have different looks on the floor.  
You know, Danielle Ballard is that player that can play one, two and three,
but she is one of the best rebounding guards at the point position this I've
seen in a long time. We have been asking a lot from her to help out on the
board.  
Adrienne Webb, she is somebody that has put in the time, the hours, to be the
player that she is now‑‑ and her level of competitiveness right now is at its
highest. And I don't know if that has anything to do with her being a senior,
but at this time of year, she's definitely zoning in to what we have to do.  
So the leadership is there from your upper classmen, as well, and we have got
freshmen that are really looking to follow. And so when you have that
combination, anything is possible.  
  
Q. Theresa said she didn't really remember last year's game but I'm willing
to bet that's a different case with you.  
COACH CALDWELL: Yes.  
  
Q. How long did that stick with you after the season last year, and did the
possibility of a rematch excite you a little bit when you guys won last
night?  
COACH CALDWELL: You know, you go back and you look at the last game that you
finished, and as a coach, you critique yourself in what can we have done
better to get this team ready to play at Penn State. And so you go into the
off‑season and you meet with your staff and you talk about what you need to do
in the fall.  
This team responded and they responded in a big way, and now that test or that
challenge faces them again. The one thing about playing a team that you've
played before is obviously you know their game, it's not going to be anything
that, you know, they know who Nikki Greene is. They know who Lucas is. They
have a feel for what they are capable of doing.  
If this team wants to win tomorrow night, we cannot play the same way we did
last year. We can't rest on the fact that we could of, would of, should of. We
have to totally, if you will, erase last year and focus in on who we are today
and who we will be tomorrow. And we are a totally different team.  
This team reminds me of a team that came together like the Bad News Bears, you
know, when they weren't really good early, and then they just plugged away,
plugged away, and their confidence started to build. And that's what's
happened is this team has learned to play through adversity, but also, to
smack it back. And that's something that last year's team, we didn't do that
all the time. We kind of did, but this year's team has been very resilient.  
And so, you know, I'm proud of them for getting themselves in position to
compete again against a great team like Penn State. And you know, Theresa
Plaisance is going to be key for us. She is not the same player that she was
last year. She has evolved and became in my opinion one of the best post
players in the country.  
Adrienne Webb is playing like a woman on the a mission. And then we have a
phenomenal freshman in Danielle Ballard and if everybody else can see what we
see and we feel that's capable of, this team, they can do anything, once they
put their mind, but more importantly, their hearts to it.  
  
Q. One thing I'm sure you want different from last night is perimeter
defense, but you're limited and try to play without fouling too much; how did
you feel about your three point defense last night and what needs to be
different maybe in this game?  
COACH CALDWELL: The thing about a team like Green Bay is they are one of the
best three‑point shooting teams that we faced all year. And a lot of teams
that play a matchup zone, you're going to give up some threes.  
Where we have got to be better is the one‑pass away, and I thought we missed a
lot of those assignments because they were coming down in that trail spot,
where our bigs are pretty much trained to come down and they run to their spot
in our match‑ups. We have got to be better in that area.  
But guarding the three‑ball, you know, it's a hard‑‑ it's a hard game when you
have‑‑ when you play a team like that that has four people on the floor that
can shoot the three. You know, and they pass the ball extremely well. They had
about 20 assists.  
Green Bay is good, and a lot of teams, not just our team, have struggled in
being able to defend the three ball but a lot of teams have struggled in
scoring against them. And so we were able to put up enough points, if you
will, to win the game‑‑ but I like Green Bay. I wish they were still in the
tournament‑‑ not against us, but I like watching their style of play. I love
the hustle of his kids. I love the fight and the determination they had. They
are a fun team to watch. They weren't exactly fun to play against but they
were very fun to watch.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
Q. For the players, what do you guys remember about last year's game against
LSU and how maybe are they different than maybe the way your guys are
different this year around?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I remember that it was a pretty physical game. LSU is a physical
team and I think we are, too. Just making sure we take care of business on the
offensive and defensive end and I think both teams have gotten better within
the past year.  
NIKKI GREENE: Like Alex said, very physical and last year very athletic, and
so us contributing on the offensive and defensive end, it should be a really
good game.  
  
Q. Playing Louisiana, a little deja vu, it's a little bit unusual for an
NCAA team to see the same team two years in a row, does it feel like a
conference rivalry or something like that?  
ALEX BENTLEY: The area is familiar but we are two different teams now from
last year. LSU has changed, we have changed, so it's a whole different
ballgame now.  
  
Q. Did either of you ever watch them on television this year?  
NIKKI GREENE: Yes.  
  
Q. And? Tell me what you saw, what you thought. Do you have any memories of
it.  
ALEX BENTLEY: They get up‑and‑down the floor well. LSU is a good team. They
have had a good season, and they deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament and we
are excited to play them tomorrow.  
NIKKI GREENE: I totally agree. I did not get to see them play this year but I
did watch the first half of the next game, and they are physical and two big
post players, athletic guards.  
  
Q. Compared to last year, what do you feel like makes you all a better team?
How come you all are better this year as compared to last year at this time?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I just think with a year under our belt, that that experience,
you know, we have been here, we have been to the Sweet16, we played in the
NCAA Tournament, and you know, we have just learned a lot over the course of
this year compared to last year.  
So we are just better in that aspect. And obviously individual workouts and
people getting better at their skill sets have been important, too.  
  
Q. Alex, you guys have scored 80 ‑plus in all games you've played thus far,
is it just an anomaly? Do you guys like the shooting background? Is there any
explanation for it?   
ALEX BENTLEY: I just think we have a well balanced team. We have a well
balanced attack. We have post players, a lot of them that can score in the
lane. We have guards that can‑‑ all of us can score and that's the reason why
we get a lot of points up there on the board.  
  
Q. Unlike last night where they had one big person and this team has two,
and Cal Poly was amazed how many big people you guys have, but can you talk
about the importance of your guards, having to take over or do differently,
because you have more of an even match down low?  
NIKKI GREENE: Because LSU have two big players, I feel like our post players
are able to still dominate and you know, defend their post players as well as
our guards. Our guards are athletic and we are able to defend Alex and Maggie
and Dara. So being able to defend the athleticism, I think we'll be able to
handle their pressure.  
  
Q. If we ask this question last year, being only from four and a half hours
away, was there much interest on your part or LSU's part when you were being
recruited?  
NIKKI GREENE: Penn State and LSU were in my Top‑4 my senior year of high
school, but after building a relationship with Coquese, my decision was made
to go to Penn State.  
As far as LSU had high interest but I felt more comfortable coming to Penn
State.  
  
Q. Touched on this already a little bit, where do you feel specifically
you've improved from a year ago at this time? What areas do you think you're
better in and how do you think that's going to impact tomorrow night?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think we have improved across the boards. I think we play
better balance inside‑outside game. The guard looking for the posts and the
posts are able to kick out to the guards.  
That's something we have definitely improved on and our defense has definitely
gotten better and it's been a focus all year and see it better on the
defensive end. You know, we've been working hard at it every day in practice,
and you know, I think we've caught on and we've started to understand how to
play together on defense.  
  
Q. Alex, you and Nikki had big games down low. What does that do for you and
Maggie specifically?  
ALEX BENTLEY: You know, it's huge, but I mean, going into games, we see what
match‑ups are going to be best and we knew that, you know, our post players
were going to be important to contribute.  
I mean, they played a phenomenal game last night, all of them, all of our
posts came to play yesterday. So you know, we are proud with our performance
and we can't be here without our post players.  
  
Q. Did you have a larger rooting section than normal for last night's game?
This is pretty close to home, relatively speaking. How has that been for
people that followed you to play here?  
NIKKI GREENE: Last night I had a pretty good section. My mother and my father
came up, a couple of coaches‑‑ it felt great. It's not like the big crowd at
home but it felt good to have some family members cheering Penn State on and
myself.  
  
Q. When you were looking at them, it looked like you were looking on in
amazement or fear of what they might stay.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Probably a little bit of both. (Laughter) more amazement
than fear, more amazement.  
  
Q. I assume you would not want to have as slow a start offensively as you
did last night.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Definitely we don't want to start off slow. But one of the
things I think this team does is we have to get a feel for the game, so even
if we do start off a little slowly, I don't worry too much about it because
that's kind of who we are. It takes us a little bit to get a feel for the
game, get a feel for the team. They understand the game plan intellectually,
but understanding experientially every night, it's different.  
It takes us sometimes a little bit to get going and see how the game is going
to be played. But then once we get going, we are generally okay.  
  
Q. How is LSU different this year, do you think?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I think one way they are different is Plaisance, she's
a problem. You know, she's a matchup nightmare. Just what she can do with her
size at 6‑5, shooting it from the outside, putting it on the floor, creating
her own shot, creating for her teammates and then being able to score down
low; certainly last year, LaSandra Barrett was able to do the same thing, go
inside‑outside but LaSandra Barrett is 6‑1 and Plaisance is 6‑5\. That's a big
difference.  
You know, certainly they don't have as much depth this year as they did last
year, but they still rebound the ball very well. They are playing the match‑up
zone very, very well, making it tough for you to get shots and figure out what
they are doing.  
So you know, they have been a team that I think across the season, you know,
with integrating so many new players, not necessarily new to the team, but new
roles, having bigger responsibilities, it takes some time for to you kind of
gel and they started to figure it out the last seven, eight games of the
season, who they are, who their identity is, how they need to play and what
they can do well and be successful at.  
And I think they are now playing their best basketball of the season, and
playing with a high level of confidence and playing on their home floor in
this environment. You know, that's tough. That's tough to play against.  
So we have got to be ready and, you know, we've got to be ready to defend
their physical play, keep them off the boards and try to have an up‑tempo
game, because that's what we like to apply.  
  
Q. Given the up ‑tempo game you like to play, and they only have seven or
eight players depending ‑‑ to what extent do you think that could be a factor
that you could exploit?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, I'm hoping it will be a factor. But the
thing is, they played with limited numbers all year. So they know how to play
with seven people the whole game. I mean, that's not something new to them.
It's not like they have been playing ten, 11 people and the last week or two
they have had injuries. This is something they have dealt with all season
long. I don't see this as something being a big chink in their armor, only
having seven people at their disposal. That's what they have dealt with all
season long and they have dealt with it very, very well.  
I just, again, we want to dictate the tempo, and one of the ways they seem to
start to have success with slowing it down a little bit late in the season, so
again, I think it's going to be a contrast in styles. You know, we want it
up‑tempo. They would probably like it a little bit slower.  
So you know, we'll see which style can kind of win out.  
  
Q. Do you know Nikki at all or do you have any coaching relationship besides
her recruiting trail?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Yeah, we're friends. We've been friends. We played against
each other in college. Although both of us are so old, we don't remember the
game very much. But you know, we've become friends as well as colleagues and I
have a tremendous high regard for what she's done, what she's accomplished as
a head coach. Certainly, you know, being a part of the Tennessee coaching
staff for so many years and having so much success, I mean, she's one of the
future superstar coaches in this league; in the country, actually. So what
she's done with this team this year, given their injuries and limited numbers
is phenomenal. And when we're not playing against each other, I'm certainly
rooting for her success.  
  
Q. Have you ever been, as a coach or a player, in a situation where they are
in where you have such limited numbers and you're trying to fight through
that?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, as a player, you like having limited numbers because
that means you don't come out of the game. I'm sure their players are excited
about that. They know coming in every game, they know they are going to get
plenty of run and lots of sweat.  
You know, with TV time‑outs and time‑outs you can take, you know, I think
having seven, eight people is plenty. I just don't think it's‑‑ I don't think
it's something that hinders you from being successful. So you know, when I was
at Notre Dame, and we made it that we won the National Championship, I think
we only played eight players, so I'm not feeling sorry for Nikki Caldwell.
(Laughter) She'll be fine.  
  
Q. Is it at all intimidating to coach against somebody who wears shoes like
Nikki does?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Did you see how high my heels are? (Laughter) They are not
as fancy, not as much animal print, but, you know, the heel is pretty high.
I'm only 5‑6 but on game day, I'm like 5‑10\.  
  
Q. What I asked Alex, how are y'all better as a team this year compared to
last year?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Alex kind of hit it on the head. I think in two particular
areas. I think we are more experienced, you know, having returned the bulk of
our team from last year, and playing in these type of games. So I think our
experience in understanding how long these games are, is one of the things
that makes us better.  
But I also think probably the biggest area we've gotten better is defensively.
I think we play better team defense. Statistically, I think across the board,
our defensive numbers are better, and that's helped us when we have nights
where we have not shot the ball well. We're able to stay engaged and we are
able to make squeak some out and if we have not been successful, we are at
least able to keep it close. So I think our defense, and offensively I think
our balance offensively is a little bit better. I think we play better
inside‑outside or outside in, depending on the game and the team and how they
are defending us. So I think we have just a better offensive balance and so
those three things.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

Penn State  85  
Cal Poly  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well their size really presented some major problems for us,
both in just entry passes and for us to get into the offense, it made it
really tough for us to have any kind of flow because of their defensive
presence. And then they had their post game, they're just some big mama's. The
big mamas were throwing us around like rag dolls. But they played an awesome
game both offensively and defensively. They were very clearly the superior
team today.  
  
Q. How much did the 3 ‑pointer at the end of the half‑‑ how much did that
hurt?   
MOLLY SCHLEMER: Well I was ‑‑ it was pretty, I take responsibility for it, but
she's a great shooter, player, and she's made the Big‑10 Player of the Year
for a reason.  
So I knew that taking away her right hand, I didn't do that and she punished
me for it. So she just had some amazing shooting and that was an incredible
shot to shoot it over me, because I'm kind of tall.  
CAROLINE REEVES: I also should have taken away her right hand so it was a very
good shot. It was a moment to go into the half down 10 points but she's a
great player and we just had to try to come back from there.  
  
Q. Molly, first 10 minutes you had 12 points and then they kind of stretched
you down a little bit until I guess midway through the second half there. Did
they make any adjustments on you at that point?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: They began to front me a little more because they started off
just playing behind me and that's my favorite thing for a defender to do. So
they got more in front of me and it got harder for the passing lane from the
guard to get to me. So they did a great adjustment today.  
  
Q. For coach and Caroline. Talk about their full court press and kind of the
pressure they put on you and how that kind of caused y'all problems.  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well, for us, Griffin, who was injured in her last game of our
conference game, she's handled that responsibility almost solely this year.
And Caroline has been one of our leading people to get out on the break. She
runs her butt off so hard. So for her to make the adjustment from sprinting up
the court to actually having to stay back and inbound the ball. We didn't get
the same kind of movement that we normally get where Kayla was trained to just
grab the ball out of the net and inbound it quickly and go.  
So that was really a disruption for us. Had we had Kayla, I think that we
would have not had as many problems. Caroline did an excellent job I felt like
of making decisions with her passes, but we just weren't in our flow because
of that change in personnel.  
CAROLINE REEVES: One thing Kayla brings is pushing the ball really hard. So we
did get past their press, it was just a little slower than normal, so.  
  
Q. Molly, coach said it pretty well about the big mamas. What was that like
trying to deal with so many big bodies coming at you?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: It's completely different from our conference. They're the
biggest people we have seen by a long shot.  
But it was a good experience to play against people my size who I'm not really
used to, and I was wondering what it was like and it's really difficult. They
pushed us around, they have strong bodies. But it was like nothing I had ever
experienced before, at least three of their players were at least all my size
and that never happens.  
  
Q. For all three of you, it wasn't the outcome you wanted, but just the
whole season up to this point, you beat the odds and come here for the first
time. What does this whole experience been like for y'all and what do you take
away from it?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well I'm really proud of our team. I think that we represented
Cal Poly well and I hope that we represented the Big West well. They
definitely are first class people and I think you can see that by how hard
they played. And they weren't as gifted athletically as our opponent today,
but you couldn't fault their hearts, that's for sure. And I'm really, really
proud of what they have accomplished.  
  
Q. Caroline, yesterday you seemed to be in a just glad to be here type of
mode. But you went out and competed well in the first half until that, until
that shot sort of did it . Tell me, how do you feel like y'all overcame that
sense of wow and at least through the first half played them pretty heads
up.  
CAROLINE REEVES: I think it was just realizing that we're just out here
playing basketball. We're just going to do the same thing we do every day,
just keep working hard. So it was encouraging to stick in there with them and
yeah, so that's about it.  
  
Q. Faith, how big a factor was their depth in this ball game?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well, usually as I said, we normally maybe see one big. It was
like a wrestling match. Tag team, Brutus comes in and pounds somebody and then
Dino comes in, you know, Thor. They all come in. And it was just a constant
barrage of just trying to body Molly as much as they could there. It was
really effective.  
And we only got one Molly and she logged a lot of minutes for us today and
we're proud of her. It just seemed like a little unfair of a fight, to be
honest. It felt like five against one. Because they just got their tag team
going on.  
  
Q. In particular where do you feel like it got away in the second half?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: I thought we made a couple critical errors as far as saving
loose balls and coming in getting easy lay‑ups. They pounded the offensive
glass and any time they got on the offensive glass it was going to be another
layup. So we felt like we didn't do as good a job as we needed to know the
defensive glass. I thought that them knocking down a couple threes too really
kind of crushed us a little bit. We had a difficult time from the 3‑point line
tonight and normally Ariana can knock some things down for us and between our
guards I think we were like 3‑35 or something crazy like that. So because of
their size and their athleticism, there's like, okay, let's take the first
shot that we can take because we may not get another look. And I felt like we
rushed some of our shots, but again, because of their size, they're just so
big everywhere on the court. We had six‑four sometimes guarding our five‑five.
So our guards really couldn't get past them either, they were so athletic. So
anything we had, mismatch‑wise, I felt like we probably, at the 17 or 16
minute mark in the second half, I want to say that they knocked down a three
and I felt like we just never could recover.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

Penn State  85  
Cal Poly  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, the shot you hit at the end of the first half and what kind of
momentum did that give you guys heading in the second half?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I was just coming down the floor, I didn't think I had a good ‑‑
I just don't want to force it right before the half so I just held it out and
waited until I could get a shot at the buzzer. But when I took it, I didn't
think it was like the best shot I could have made, but it went, so, yeah, it
was just really good.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MAGGIE LUCAS: It was more momentum. But I thought the biggest thing was just
coming out defensively in the second half. I thought that's what really got
our momentum going.  
  
Q. Describe how physical a style of play y'all have. This was two games for
you without getting a foul after you fouled out in the game before that. So
just talk about how do you play as physical as you're able to do without
getting a foul twice in a row?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: She's very, very, smart. Yeah, the refs don't see it.  
(Laughter.)  
MIA NICKERSON: I think you just have to like, know when to get the foul and no
when not to. Just be smart. I've been playing college basketball for five
years now, so I had the experience to just let them get a lay up and try and
get it back on the offensive end, or try not let them get the ball and things
like that. It's going to be physical, I love playing physical, so you just
have to be smart about it.  
  
Q. Talk about the job that you and the bigs did down low, especially on the
boards using your size in the second half, especially?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I thought we did a great job. I thought that we kind of took the
game over.  
Especially on defense, when they shot it, we got the defensive boards, along
with the guards to kind of change the momentum a little bit of the game. It
was just one and done for them. And then our offense, we were able to attack
and get second chances. I thought we did pretty good for all of us that were
in there.  
  
Q. Maggie, it seemed like it took a really long time for your offense to get
on track. Was that first game jitters, Cal Poly doing something, or were you
guys out of sync for awhile? Thoughts about that?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: It might have been a little bit of jitters. But we were able to
get in rhythm and like said before, it comes from our defense. When we're able
to get out in transition and get post pancakes and layups and stuff like that,
that's going to get us moving. I thought once we addressed our defense more,
that's when our offensive flow really got going.  
  
Q. Talk about what the challenge was like guarding Schlemer underneath the
basket?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: She's a great player. She has a great touch around the basket.
Even better than what film shows. So it's difficult to guard up against her,
but she didn't have the ball at one possession, then that hurt their offense,
I felt like, so we just tried to do the best that we could, just play physical
with her. We knew she was going to get her shots and make basket, but we
wanted to just give them one shot and be ready to do that and so I think we
did a pretty decent job.  
  
Q. Since you don't know who you're going to play, could you talk about maybe
playing LSU or playing Green Bay.  
MIA NICKERSON: We don't really have film yet, but I know they're both very
talented teams. So we got to go in mentally pretty much the same, but just
ready to do whatever coach tells us. Whatever the game is going to be.  
COACH WASHINGTON: They don't know anything about who we're going to play yet.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student‑athletes and take questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Faith referred to your girls as big mamas out there. I don't know if you
heard that before. But how does having so many big players, just in your
practice preparation, those things you can do and could you tell me, is
everybody knows about the physical style of play on the men's side in the Big
‑10\. What about on the women's side, do you pride yourself on being maybe the
most physical team in the Big‑10?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think to play in the Big‑10 we have so many good coaches
in the Big‑10 and we have so many good players. And certainly when we play
night in and night out in the Big‑10, it's physical. It's fast, there's a lot
of different and a lot of very offensive styles that you have to prepare
against.  
So we want to be a team that can play a lot of different styles and we can
play against small quick teams, we can play against bigger physical teams. So
having the depth that we have in our post really is a plus for us I think.  
  
Q. Talk about how you thought your team rebounded tonight, especially Talia,
she had big boards for you tonight?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought Talia was big for us. Huge. She had a fantastic
day. I thought she did a really good job defending Schlemer. She got her
points, but the thing we wanted to do was just make her work and make her work
really hard to get touches and to get quality shots.  
I thought early in the game she got a lot of her baskets off offensive
rebounds when we had to help, when our rotation, help rotation was there and
she got free and made some offensive rebounds.  
But Talia came in the game, I thought she was big, I thought she was
aggressive defending her and the rebounds that she got were key for us getting
out in transition and getting some easy baskets.  
  
Q. What do you think the shot at the end of the half did for you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: It might have gave them a lift, but it was short lived after
I walked into the locker room and talked about the other 19 minutes and 55
seconds of the half.  
So I'm not sure it was a big lift, but Maggie's right, it was our defense, we
did a better job defensively the second half in con I think at that the ball
and contesting shots and making them take tough shots and we just didn't ‑‑ in
the first half we didn't do quite as good job as we needed to. But starting
the second half, our effort was a lot better.  
  
Q. You guys didn't manage the first 10 minutes well, maybe that layoff was a
little bit too long for you guys. But talk about the way your defense stepped
up from that point on and really got the ball rolling for you guys.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought we were a little bit more aggressive defensively.
And really Cal Poly, they're small and quick. Sometimes you watch teams on
film and you can't, one thing you can't gauge on film is how quick people are
and you can't gauge on film how strong people are.  
So I thought it took us a few minutes to adjust to their little guards
shiftiness and their speed with which they played with. They played hard and
we knew they would do that, they played hard, they played aggressive, so it
took us a little bit of time to adjust to their speed and their quickness and
how they wanted to play. But I thought once we adjusted and we did a better
job of keeping them in front of us, things seemed to work out better for us on
the defensive end.  
  
Q. So you must know something about LSU or Green Bay. You played LSU before
of course. Talk about playing either one of them?  
COACH WASHINGTON: It's certainly a contrast in styles. LSU is a team that's
playing a lot more zone and they have got Theresa, who is playing some
fantastic ball right now, inside/outside threat. She can put it on the floor,
she can do a lot of things. They're a very good rebounding team. And they got
good speed and quickness on the perimeter, close to what we have seen in
Big‑10 play in terms of personnel and bigs, traditional bigs. But they play
the matchup zone and the matchup zone is difficult to prepare for. We don't
see it on a nightly basis.  
In contrast, Green Bay is a team that they spread you out, penetrate and kick.
A little bit more similar to Cal Poly, the team we played tonight. But they're
a fantastic 3‑point shooting team and they're a very good team defensive team,
even though they're undersized in comparison to BCS level schools, they do a
fantastic job of being aggressive, fighting for the ball, their help side
defense is outstanding, and they're an outstanding team.  
And I know Kevin from having been in the Big‑10 and the way that he likes to
play, he's able to motivate them and move pieces around. You just have two
contrasting styles and I'm excited to watch this game and to see how it
unfolds.  
  
Q. Talk about the confidence, shooting 47 percent, four players finishing in
double figures, especially with what happened against Michigan state in the
Big ‑10 tourney.   
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, first of all, Michigan State, we don't even think
about that, we don't talk about that. That game is so far behind. So in terms
of where you put this game, it's one game and we put it behind us and we move
on to the next team.  
Just because you shoot well against one team doesn't mean you're going to get
the same shots the next night. So we don't celebrate and we don't put our hat
in what happened tonight, we have to focus on the next opponent, because
they're going to be different opportunities and they're going to be different
challenges that we have to focus on.  
So it comes down to discipline and determination, being determined to be
disciplined, to execute the game plan, whatever that's going to be, and as
long as we focus on that and focus on the next game, I think we'll be in good
shape.  
  
Q. Sometimes the box score can be a little misleading, but in this case all
your big girls combined for like 33 rebounds, out rebounding them. Is this one
of those games where the stats do tell the story in terms of your size
advantage and how you asserted it?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think so. I think rebounding was a key for us. The way
that they exerted their influence and their impact on the game on the boards
was big for us, especially in the second half. Giving us second chance
opportunities but also rebounding the ball and allowing us to go in
transition, that certainly was big.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  75  
GREEN BAY - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd like to make an opening statement, then we'll
direct questions to the student‑athletes?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, I'll tell you, Green Bay is one of those teams that you
don't want to play. A lot of credit to his kids and how hard they played and
how hard they fought back. But I was equally proud of our team for not folding
down the stretch and able to come away with the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. What do you think contributed to them making a big comeback in the second
half?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, with every great team, you know they're going to make a
run at some point in the game, and at that point, that was their run to try to
get our lead back. But we really buckled down that last few minutes. We felt
we're not going to lose this lead. We're not going to lose this game.  
Credit to Green Bay; they were a very great team and very strong in every
aspect of their game, but our will to win that game really shows how much that
we really want to be here and how we're underestimated a little bit how we can
finish out games.  
  
Q. Adrienne, can you talk about the collision with Jeanne late and what
transpired there?  
ReplaceName1:  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, I was originally supposed to go long, and Jeanne was
supposed to come to the ball, but I think she went a little early. We were
both going hard, so I mean, that's always a good thing, but you really don't
want to run into your own teammate. But I have to say I really can't complain.
We were both going hard trying to come get the ball.  
But I probably could have maybe rerouted it or she could have waited a little
more. You really can't say anything about timing. It probably just comes down
to that.  
  
Q. Adrienne, if you would speak about getting to this point, what this has
meant to you to go through the season? You said at the end of the regular
season you wanted to come back and play a couple more games, and now you've
won that right to do that. Just the goal of that and now that you've finally
gotten there?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: The goal is to continue. That's playing hard. I really don't
want my senior year to end in a loss. Not just for me and Bianca, but I want
to get past the second round for the underclassmen. Whether that's Theresa or
all the way down to Derreyal, we really want to give it my all each and every
game so that we can advance in the tournament.  
  
Q. Theresa, did you feel a little bit of relief after the game was over, the
fact that had he had a never ‑say‑die attitude and kept coming back like the
terminator in this game?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Most definitely, you know. Green Bay has never lost a first
round game in the NCAA Tournament. They have a great group of girls that will
do anything to pull out a victory, and that just shows. They came back from a
17‑point deficit it was, never giving up, never stopping. They tightened up
their defense a lot, and started driving to the goal. Their guns were hot from
the outside, also getting to the rim, that created a little bit of trouble for
us. That final buzzer was a huge relief for us. Because Green Bay is such a
great competition and such a great team, that anything can happen.  
  
Q. You mentioned the three ‑point shooting, and they reeled off three in a
row and cut it to six with three minutes left. What was the sense there? It
seemed they had gone to press to set you guys up, force some quick shots,
hitting the three. What was the feeling at that point to see the lead going
away?   
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, you have to calm yourself down in order to try and stop
the run. You have to buckle down on defense, gather your team up and say,
okay, we are not going to let them score on this possession. We have to get a
stop. We just really did that.  
After they got that last three, I think coach called the timeout, and she
calmed us down. It makes you realize that we have a lead. We don't want to
lose it.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We realized before the game even started that no matter how
much of a lead we had, we knew they were going to make a run. They're not just
a team to fold under pressure. They're great competitors and we knew they were
going to make a run. So when they started scoring, I think 43 out of 5
back‑to‑back baskets for them. They were really doing a great job getting to
the goal and stepping out with that three shot.  
There was just a sense of urgency that we needed to just click and get it done
and buckle down even more.  
  
Q. Adrienne, right after halftime, y'all closed up the first half on the 7
‑2 run and at the beginning of the second half you found those two early
threes and you all jumped out to an even bigger lead and got the lead up to
double digits. What was it coming right out of halftime that you were able to
find those open shots?   
ADRIENNE WEBB: I would have to say I knew that I had to step up and play my
role in order for our team to win. That was knocking down those open shots.
Our defense was on point, and when I had the opportunity to score, I had to
take it. So finding‑‑ and because of my teammates also finding me.  
When Theresa is doubled or say if there's a penetration and they doubled, I
was open for that kickout. So just knowing that I have other teammates that
are going to create also helped create shots for me is an extra benefit, and I
didn't want any of my team to go down with a loss.  
  
Q. The threes were really falling early in the game for them. But they came
in shooting a lot of threes and making a lot and y'all not so much. But y'all
stepped up and made a ton of threes today. Was that something you did in
response knowing that you can shoot that or what?  
COACH CALDWELL: Yeah, we started playing our inside game. So when they lock up
inside, you have to knock down the outside shot, And Theresa did a very good
shot job of that, Bianca did. I came in a little bit. But we established an
inside presence early in the game which made them collapse on the inside. When
they do that, you have to knock down your outside shots.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, coming in, we knew they were a three‑point shooting
team, and a three‑point game really hasn't been our strength this season at
all. I think some of these shots were a bit lucky. I must say I did call the
bank on that three‑point shot. I knew it was going off the backboard the whole
time.  
But I think just coming out and being put in that situation where you feel
like you have to knock down that shot just puts a little bit of pressure on
you to knock down that shot. Webb did a great job coming out early in the
second half and knocking down a few, and Bianca at the end of the shot clock
knocking down a big one. That could have been a turnover, but it was a
three‑point play. So just little key moments that really helped us out in the
end.  
  
Q. Theresa, I know in the second half you got in foul trouble. Just talk
about how you were able to keep your composure despite being in foul trouble?
Especially at the end where you know things got a little physical?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Just coming out with four fouls, it's sometimes to adjust.
I haven't been in much foul trouble this year, but coming out with four, I
just tried to stay positive with my teammates. I have all the faith in the
world in my teammates and I believe what they can do. I don't need to be on
the court at all times for us to win.  
We have a lot of different weapons. They did a great job of picking it up when
I came out, and I tried to be the best cheerleader on the bench when I was.
And when it was time to come back in, I had to play composed and maybe not
take that iffy block or get out the way if it's a blocked charge call. I just
have to play it safe for a little bit.  
  
Q. How big was it having this game at home? In terms of everything, whether
it's sleeping in your own bed, obviously the crowd is into it as well, is that
big for y'all?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Definitely, the crowd played the biggest part in this win.
There was some time in the game where we were struggling a little bit. We just
turned to our crowd and they were right there, cheering us on the whole entire
time. There was one play, I remember, I didn't know how much time was on the
shot clock and the girl shot it, and I caught the rebound, and I was about to
go on the fast break and I couldn't hear anything. The buzzer went off for the
shot clock violation. I had no idea because the crowd was so loud.  
We appreciate all the support and all the love that these fans give us,
because without them we really wouldn't be able to maybe hang in as tough as
we did.  
  
Q. For either player, when Bianca hit the three that stunted that run they
had made inside of 5 minutes, kind of hung the follow through there. Went down
the court and came back with the three ‑point plan and drive. I wonder if you
could illuminate what it is about her personality that allows her to play with
that swagger in that critical moment?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Bianca is an all‑around athlete. Looking at her, she seems
so laid back and so composed, so, I guess, chill, you could say. Coming on the
court, she has that thing about her. She can do it all; she's an all‑around
player; she can take the drive, take the three, post‑up, you know. Basically
everything.  
Bianca's personality, she's actually really goofy and a happy‑going person.
Just that coming out of her is a little taste of what we see in the locker
room. She's just a great teammate and a great person to be around on and off
the court.  
  
Q. Talk about, obviously, it's the tournament. Knowing that if you lose, you
go home. Now you've got to focus on another team in two days. Can you talk
about how you'll try to carry that momentum into the game against Penn State
in two days and try to keep it going, and try to live that dream of making it
all wait to the final four right down the road in New Orleans?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: This momentum is going to be key for us because Green Bay
is not a pushover team. They're a great team. They were on a 24‑game win
streak, so we were a bit intimidated coming into this game. So carrying this
over to Penn State is a big key for us. Penn State is also a great team. They
have a great outside shot in Maggie Lucas and Alex Bentley. And their inside
game of Nikki Greene is unbelievable. They're an all-around game that we need
to match up against. The momentum coming out of this win will be key for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Caldwell.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have an update on Jeanne's condition? Have you had a player
that's been beaten up like this like a football player during the year?  
COACH CALDWELL: I know, Jeanne Kenney, bless her heart. She has been on that
floor more than the free‑throw line, if you will. If you think about how many
times she's taken charges and stood in there and been banged up. But I don't
have an update at this moment, but we hope that she bounces back.  
  
Q. Was that game more physical than you thought it might be, as physical as
you thought it might be? It seemed to me that that team was a little more
physical than I thought they would be.  
COACH CALDWELL: No, having watched Green Bay and followed what they're capable
and what they have done this season, you're not ranked nationally, you're not
24‑game win streak without being physical, without having the toughness about
you. That's one of the toughest teams that we've played.  
I mean, you know, we talk about how tough the SEC is. They could easily stack
up with anybody in our conference. They're one of the best teams as far as
just finding their teammates. Their penetration to kick, their feel for where
everybody is, everybody knows where they're supposed to be, what spacing that
they should have. A very, very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Having played and coached in tournaments before, how big is home ‑court
advantage in terms of everything from the crowds? Just being at home and doing
your normal routine and everything?   
COACH CALDWELL: Well, it's definitely an advantage, if you allow it to be.
We've got an opportunity to play another game at home, and we don't have to
have the wear and tear of travel on us, especially for us having a small
number on our roster with 8 active players. It definitely helps us in that
regard. It also helps when you have the crowd. You want that support, but more
importantly, you want the fans of women's basketball.  
This is an unbelievable environment to play in. This team understands that we
have another opponent to face, but if you look at what their record is at our
place, it's their home court, if you will, with the 1‑0 record against us. So
it's really, at this point in the ballgame, it goes back to how are you going
to play this game and what‑‑ are you going to execute your game plan better
than your opponents?  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Ballard's play there late, giving you guys a
little spark there to at least block some of the momentum and another push. It
seemed like she did enough to stem the tide for you guys?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, Ballard all year has grown as a player. She's shown us
time and time again how she can change the complexion of a basketball game.
She definitely performed tonight like a veteran. The game did not know her
age. She was very composed. She made some baskets, some big basket when's we
needed them, but more importantly, she got some key rebounds as well. I liked
the play of Ballard for us late game. I thought she did some really nice
things for us.  
But her teammates have fuelled her confidence because they believe in her. She
also has a unique relationship with our two seniors where she wants to play
for them, and she did just that tonight.  
  
Q. Could you also talk about Theresa and how she has turned it on her junior
year to the point where she's become one of the top players in the country?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, when you think about the transformation of Theresa
Plaisance from last year to this year, it's incredible. It started with her
taking on ownership in the off‑season and really transforming her body and
really getting in great shape, which then made her mentally tougher. This year
she's got teammates that have rewarded her with that hard work. She
understands she needs a Jeanne Kenney, Adrienne Webb, Danielle Ballard, Bianca
Lutley. She needs McKinney who now allows her to play off the ball a little
bit. But Theresa has really taken on this persona of an All American for our
team. She's playing like that. She commands double teams. You have to pay
attention to her on your scouting reports.  
But her ability to not only give you a power game inside and also her ability
to spread the offense and the things that she does on the defensive end, she's
definitely one of the best players in the country.  
  
Q. If you'd be kind enough to offer us a glimpse into your mind when 18
points became 4 points and there were 5 minutes left? What is going on with
you there?  
COACH CALDWELL: When we got our lead, I literally thought this is too soon,
because this isn't us. We're not that team that have blown anybody out or got
ahead of anybody in that manner often. So I did, I felt that way. I also felt
the team that, when the lead was dwindling, that we'd been in that situation a
couple of times.  
But if it did get to late game, I saw a team that knew how to play down the
stretch. Because we've played down the stretch and we've known how to lose. So
they know what that feels like. It seemed to me that they had the composure,
they had the confidence to really finish off this game against an opponent
that was bringing everything at them: The dribble drive, the three, the
penetration, the kick.  
I mean, this team, Green Bay did a phenomenal job in executing their game plan
down the stretch. But we equally did so on the offensive end.  
  
Q. What did you tell them when you called the 30 ‑second time out in the
middle of the 9‑0 run early cutting to the lead? How much did you remind them
of failure versus trying to give them the practical steps and advice there?   
COACH CALDWELL: Do you really want to know what I told them?  
  
Q. Go ahead.  
COACH CALDWELL: Having played, so I talked to them about being a player. There
are players that get a little tight. I felt like we were that team right now.
I said, we're tight right now and we're playing that way. You've got to play
this game loose. You can't be hugged up on your play. You've got to be on the
help line.  
Honestly, I said some other things, but it was along those lines.  
  
Q. You've always said the first couple minutes after halftime are incredibly
crucial and you came out and just went on a big run to start out. Adrienne
Webb was a big part of that. What allowed you to do that coming out of the
half?  
COACH CALDWELL: What allowed us to do that was our team got the defensive
stops that we needed and we were able to push the ball a little bit more in
transition. We got some dribble drive looks, which led to penetration. Their
support defense is very strong. So we were able to be patient on the offensive
end, get some ball movement, some ball reversal, and we weren't quick shooting
the basketball. So I felt as though we were in rhythm, and that allowed us to
get the lead.  
  
Q. I have to ask, where in the world did you find those shoes and how would
you describe them?  
COACH CALDWELL: My stylist (Indiscernible), and I would describe them as edgy.  
  
Q. Just a little bit of a glimpse forward with this game being so physical
and Jeanne going down, and Theresa going down in a scary moment in the second
half, you've always said that 8 is enough and you'll have that motto. But was
it a little bit scary with how physical this game was knowing that you'd have
to turn around and play a game on Tuesday?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, we obviously don't want any injuries, and with our
numbers, we can't afford to have any. But it was a little shaky there with
Jeanne, and then obviously Theresa, because then we go to six. But this team
has played that way. We've played that way all year where we've had six bodies
here or that were capable, because we've had sickness, and we've had some
injuries, and they've learned how to manage the time and the game and come
away with a win.  
So, you know, we're going to obviously take this night to enjoy what we need
to, as far as what they accomplished tonight. And then at 12:01, we'll channel
our focus to Penn State. With you we've played this way all season, so this is
not anything new for us.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  75  
GREEN BAY - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Kevin Borseth, head coach, Adrian Ritchie,
Jenny Gilbertson, and Sarah Eichler.  
  
Q. Sarah, I wanted to ask you this first. You guys do go down 18 there, but
what did you talk about at that moment, and did you know you still had one
more rally left in you guys?  
SARAH EICHLER: I definitely think we fought as hard as we could. There is
nothing you can do at that point when you go down 18, and at that moment you
have to ban together, fight, and we did that. Made it a close game, but we
just didn't pull it out in the end.  
  
Q. A lot of people would have said that you might be pressing them to go at
their pace. You guys seemed to do a good job forcing them into some turnovers,
and making them make some mistakes. Can you talk about the shift of the press
and what made you all so successful in terms of executing that to maybe get
yourselves back in it?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think it was once the jitters wore off and they realized we
were here to play and we realized that we can dictate them instead of being
the ones on the other end. So by giving them a little pressure and making them
think twice about their passes is what we were trying to do, and make them
speed up a little bit more than they wanted to.  
  
Q. Throughout most of the first half, you all were staying really tight with
them and seemed like you were playing a really aggressive brand of defense. As
somebody who hasn't watched you play all year, is that kind of your usual
mentality or is that what you try to do to kind of play ball with LSU
tonight?  
SARAH EICHLER: That's something that we practice and preach every day,
definitely. It's always been our focus. I think that we did a great job
executing in the first half. We talked about the most important time of the
game is that first five minutes after halftime, and they came out and went on
a huge run, and it gave them a lot of momentum. So I think that that stretch
there was hard to come back from.  
We battled and we fought and we played more defense and we did what we could.  
  
Q. You guys look up at 18 with 12 minutes left, you haven't been down that
much. What sort of mentality in that sort of situation? Do you look at
chipping away at it? Was there anything you could do to make a push there?
What was sort of the approach when you're looking at that big of a deficit and
that much time left?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Well, 12 minutes is a lot of time left in a ballgame, and I
think we did a good job of rallying together and coming together and saying
let's get this done, let's get going, let's get focused, and I think we
stepped up and we were fighting really hard for that period of time.  
  
Q. Jenny and Sarah, I know we talked about their size and everything. How
did you feel you matched up in that capacity, and obviously still being able
to hold through, I think you were right there with them for rebounds in this
one?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think as far as size match‑ups go, I think it's hard to
play against someone that is that much taller than you. But Bre and Steph are
really long, and they are a couple of inches shorter. But it's all about our
help defense. They pass in and we trap to get it out and we rotate from there.
So it's more of a fly around kind of thing instead of a one‑on‑one physical
match‑up, but I thought that we handled it pretty well.  
  
Q. Adrian, I just wanted to ask you, I know it's been a big ride for you in
this area with basketball. Just on your career, can you reflect on what this
has meant to you and your family coming from De Pere and being able to play in
Green Bay?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Yeah, it's meant everything to me. Growing up, watching the
program, watch Coach Borseth make Green Bay what it is now. It's the biggest
gift to me, to have my family here, I just feel so lucky to be part of this
program and to have played four years. It's really hard to go out like this.  
We won every single first round of our career, so to go out like this is a
little bittersweet. It's hard to swallow right now, but still proud of what
we've done and of my senior class for sure.  
  
Q. I know you guys deal in numbers. So No. 5 came out in the second half and
got open looks and hit those early threes. Is that something that LSU did or
was that a lapse in your defense at that point?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think it was a little bit of both. I think we definitely
had some lapses. I got lost and 5 had an easy lay‑up and things like that.
That was a little uncharacteristic of us. A lot of it was LSU; they're a great
team; they're a 6 seed for a reason. They play on their home court, and
everything seemed to be going for them.  
But I think it was also a little bit of our lapses, and just things went their
way. Sometimes that happens. We tried to rally as much as we could, and we
fought as hard as we possibly could, because that's who we are. We're not
about to fall over because you're in your home court and everything's going
your way. That's not who we are, and how we're raised, and how we're raised in
the culture of this program, so we tried to do our best.  
  
Q. Jenny, I wanted to ask you, coming into today, your career high was 14
and having 15 out there tonight. For you to go out this way is a tough loss.
But what did you think about contributing tonight given how much you girls
stress being able to have the next girl come up and step up?  
JENNY GILBERTSON: A career high doesn't really mean anything to me at this
point because we lost the game. So I think anybody 1 through 15 on our team
would step up if they needed to. I could count on any single one of them, so I
don't know. Doesn't really mean a lot right now.  
  
Q. Would the rest of you seniors just kind of (Indiscernible).  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Obviously, it's great to play in front of our fans. We've had
a great run. We've had a great four years together. We know each other really
well. We're like sisters, you know, on and off the floor.  
It's been a great ride. Our careers have been amazing. To win that many games
is more than any student‑athlete can ask for. Anyone who is a competitor,
anyone who is an athlete, anyone who has ever been good at anything wants to
win. So just that in itself is special and winning is special, and we don't
take it for granted. We definitely don't.  
Looking back on those numbers in a few years, maybe after the hurt goes away a
little bit, it will be something that we can be really proud of.  
  
Q. Adrian, before the game, you spoke about how 1 through 5, you can all
shoot the three or you can shoot from the outside. Did we see that in the
second half, the rally you guys made and the barrage of points?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Absolutely. Just like Jenny said. We can trust every single
girl who steps on that floor, and Jenny stepped up huge tonight. She's been
doing it all year. It's no surprise to us, but I guess it was a surprise to
LSU because they weren't guarding her and she hit those shots. That's what
we're all about.  
It's about everyone can make three‑point shots, but it's about taking that
role if you're called upon, and it's why it made it so special. It's hard for
other teams to find one player to stop, because then Jenny is going to step up
and make two threes, you know what I mean? So it's something that we pride
ourselves on, and we're quite happy that we can deliver the ball in many
different ways.  
  
Q. Just your overall thoughts of the game, and how your girls battled and
how proud of them you are?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, we got down to the last possession, really. Our goal was
to get a stop against one of the best defensive teams in the country. Our goal
was to get a stop at the end of the game, and they did. They got the stop.
They blocked out, but was a little too small to grab the rebound. If she did,
that gave us an opportunity to get a three on that.  
But that's how our kids battled to start the second half, first half we turned
the ball over too many times and the game came down to points off turnovers.
That was really key. To start the second half, they had some shots. Had a deep
one, banked one, 32 hit her second three of the year. 3 was two for two from
the arc in the second half. So they turned up pretty good three‑point shooters
having not shot one all year long, you know?  
I thought our kids really rallied. They came back in the second half and
really rallied, got it down to one possession. Didn't look like we were going
to get it there, but we got it there, and we had an opportunity. So I was very
proud.  
  
Q. You called that timeout. What did you talk to the girls about at that
point to try to get that thing turned around?  
COACH BORSETH: The key was to try to get stops, but we just couldn't get any.
Every time we got to the end of the shot clock, they made it. Then we tried to
get out and spread a little bit, but they didn't want to speed up. Not much we
could do to speed them up. We kind of just had to play at that pace and hope
that they would get misses.  
They made shots. To their credit, they had to make them and they did. They hit
a couple at the end of the shot clock and banked one of them. As it was, we
got to the other end of the court, and what we did on the offensive end at
that point, I don't know if we missed shots. We had a couple of them blocked.
They played really well in a stretch that I thought was the determining factor
in the game.  
  
Q. Your offense was so perimeter oriented, but you had a lot of success
inside. Were you at all surprised and frustrated that you didn't get to it
sooner?  
COACH BORSETH: To be able to score it inside there? We did, but we dropped it.
The first half we turned the ball over three, four times in the post. We got
down there the first half the same way we got there in the second half. And
two times we dropped it and lost it. The other time we threw it out of there
and got deflected going out of there, and Megan had one blocked.  
But we had it down inside of there. Second half we told the kids, when they
drive, step to the short court, catch it and take it to the rim immediately.
Don't think about it. Even in the first half, we hesitated a little bit and
didn't take it there. Good observation. They are pretty big though around that
basket.  
  
Q. When the girls do lose Adrian there and getting fouled out, what did you
think of how they responded at that time? Lot of different girls stepping up
right there?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, Jenny Gilbertson is probably one of the best shooters
that we have, period. So for her to make shots certainly didn't surprise us.
Key for us the whole game was to try to find rhythm. I thought we did a pretty
good job. Other than the end of the first half where we dropped a few balls,
had some turnovers, and, again, that was the key.  
I thought we played well. Scored 43 points in the second half, gave up 40.  
  
Q. Going off that, the game got really physical in the second half. You had
two players foul out, four for LSU. Was that kind of a way or planned as a way
to get back into the game?  
COACH BORSETH: We didn't have a choice. We couldn't just sit back. We had to
battle. Our kids were battling. They were going after loose balls and taking
gambles. That's just part of the game. You know, we didn't have‑‑ yeah, we had
to be physical. We had to go after it. We had to try to get after the ball,
dive on the floor, try to deflect something or anything we could to get that
ball deflected and get neutral. I thought our kids did a pretty good job of
doing that. That really helped us.  
  
Q. Would you touch on the senior class for us?  
COACH BORSETH: Pretty special. Yeah, how well they've done. They really are a
remarkable bunch of young ladies. They say you make a living by what you get,
you make a life by what you give, and those kids got a lot. They got a lot.
But I think they gave a lot more than anything.  
They gave to the University, they gave to the city of Green Bay, they gave to
the little kids in the area, gave them something to look up to. They gave to
each other. You know, that's pretty big; it really is. I'm very proud of them,
and they should be very proud of themselves. Left a very lasting mark on Green
Bay women's basketball, and it will be very hard to duplicate for anybody.  
  
Q. Just a follow ‑up to that. As you look to reestablish your brand of
basketball at Green Bay, how much did that senior class help you kind of get
what you want going forward with your foundation?   
COACH BORSETH: I hope they were paying attention because next year those five
seniors are gone and it's almost like you're starting over again. To some
regards you are because you have the players that have least experienced that
type of desire and that type of drive and that type of togetherness. You know?
We're hoping that that carries over.  
Those kids sat there and watched and learned a lot. They are really great
leaders in their own ways. We've had a lot of those over the course of time
where our senior leadership is really‑‑ our younger kids have fed off senior
leadership, and that's been going on for a long time. We're hoping to continue
that streak as we move forward.  
  
Q. Coach, seemed like you guys coming into this tonight know if you wanted
to get an open floor game with them. But it seemed down the stretch that
benefited you going into the press. It seemed they showed a little bit of
youth there?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, but they just spread it and wouldn't let us speed them
up. So the clock kept getting away, and late in the shot clock, they hit
something. We tried to speed them up. Of course we tried to go after them and
double them and do whatever we could to create as fast a shot as we possibly
could, but it worked. We had some shots and had some misses on them. We tried
to shoot more threes. That was our goal tonight to get them to shoot threes
because we thought that would help us on the offensive glass.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Cal Poly.  
  
Q. What's it like being at the NCAA Tournament and being there?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: It's a dream come true for all of us. We're enjoying every
moment of it. It's a great team bonding experience, and we're all really glad
we're here and that we've made it this far.  
  
Q. Caroline, I know you are traveling and everything else, but obviously
you've probably been paying attention to the men's tournament. Are you all for
Florida Gulf Coast? Putting yourself in that frame of mind?  
CAROLINE REEVES: It's definitely exciting seeing them win. It's encouraging
that we have nothing to lose, and we're excited to just go play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Molly, records are made to be broken. But being the first to do something
is something that doesn't go away. Talk about the feeling of being on this
first Cal Poly team, people remembering you and your team for getting this
far.  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: It's a crazy opportunity that we have worked for. It's surreal
and hard to get used to because Cal Poly has never been here before.  
But like I said, it's crazy and just taking it all in. We've worked really
hard for this moment, and we're just enjoying being here.  
CAROLINE REEVES: We're just excited to be here. It's been neat to see where
the program has come and seeing it improve every year. This is my fifth year,
so I've got to see a lot of things happen over the years. It's great for Coach
Faith to have the opportunity. She has been here for so long and given so much
of herself to us, so it's a really neat thing.  
  
Q. Ladies, obviously playing Columbus State and Cal earlier in the season,
what does that do to help you prepare for the team tomorrow?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: I think the athleticism of both of those teams issimilar to
what we will see tomorrow. It was a while ago in the early season, so we just
have to remember what we did in both of those games. We have to keep going on
what that was and playing our game and not letting other people take us out of
what we're doing.  
CAROLINE REEVES: It was helpful to just‑‑ the physicality of those games, just
having the experience and knowing what to expect in these games. So I think it
helps put us in the right mind‑set of how we're going to need to play and just
that it's going to be a battle every play, can't take any plays off.  
  
Q. Caroline, thoughts on Maggie Lucas, one of the stars of the game right
now, and having to go up against her?  
CAROLINE REEVES: Yeah, Lucas is an excellent player, really, really good
shooter, quick shot, green light on whatever. So there's going to have to be a
lot of pressure on her, a lot of trying to get her into her second looks,
maybe not her primary options, a lot of help on her from other teammates. It's
definitely going to be a battle and just try to make things a little difficult
for her.  
  
Q. What made you guys so good during your stretch run at the end of the
season?  
CAROLINE REEVES: What made us so good? I think just hard work, just really
focusing on each individual play and knowing that it wasn't going to be handed
to us. Try to have the same mind‑set, whether we were winning or whether we
were losing.  
If we made a score, great. Now let's go play defense. If we turned the ball
over, hey, let's go play defense. I think it was focusing on individual plays
and knowing the game isn't over until the buzzer sounds.  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: Staying together as a team. We worked really well together
toward the end of our conference, letting go of our mistakes and not dwelling
on them, just playing together. We're one of the leading assist teams in the
nation, I guess.  
So that has been to our benefit. Just sharing the ball, playing together and
staying together and being friends on the court helps us.  
  
Q. Molly, you talked about this is a dream come true, but now you got a game
to play tomorrow. Why are you confident y'all can win this game tomorrow, make
it more than just, hey, we finally played a game on this side of the
Mississippi River?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: We have just been watching the NCAA Tournament and how there's
been a bunch of upsets. Anything is possible, and confidence is key. We have
to go out there, have a good practice today and just remember what we do,
because when we do what we do, we do it well.  
We just have to go play our game and know that anything is possible and
nothing can stop us if we have the right mind‑set.  
  
Q. Caroline, you mentioned nothing to lose earlier. Do you see yourselves as
underdogs in this ballgame?  
CAROLINE REEVES: Yeah, we are underdogs just because we're undersized. But I
do think we have a lot of heart and we play hard. I think sometimes that can
be a better team.  
So our goal is just to play really hard. It's potentially our last game, so
why not go for every loose ball and pull an upset.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Good luck. Let's start with
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you and the program to get this NCAA Tournament
berth?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: We see the quality of student‑athletes we have at Cal Poly;
they're exceptional. Everywhere we go people are impressed by the character
they have. After the game, you're going to see them pick up their water cups
from the bench. You're going to see them gather their towels and put them in a
neat pile. You will see the locker room spotless. You will see how they have
character on the court and compete.  
They're the right kind of people that NCAA wants represented in this
tournament; and Cal Poly is privileged to have them representing them. They're
first‑class, and this is a first‑class experience for them to have. We're so
proud to be able to represent our great university and our outstanding
conference as well in the Big West.  
  
Q. I know you lost two key players over the course of the season.  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Actually three, all over 6 foot.  
  
Q. Did they all make the trip with you?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Two made the trip; one did not.  
  
Q. Who didn't?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Maddison Allen, 6'4" center from Australia.  
  
Q. She is the one who didn't come?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: She did not.  
  
Q. Obviously, the desire to play for these players and this motivation, is
there any concern that those kinds of emotions can hurt your focus? How do you
deal with that and the loss in the Big West final is so fresh?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: The loss of Griffin is substantial for us. She had everything
coming through her. Even though she is our 4 player at 6‑foot, she is somebody
that handles the ball. She is leading our team in assists, second in rebounds,
kinda the heart of the team.  
We have an award that we give every year to a player that represents what we
call the "unbroken spirit." A herd of horses is unbroken and that's what she
is, too. There is a "never quit" attitude about her, and she was the recipient
two years if a row for us. So the loss of her is significant to our program,
certainly for this game.  
Caroline Reeves is going to fill in as best she can, swing from the 3 spot to
the 4 spot. We're thin at the forward spots, so hopefully we won't get into
any foul trouble. But it will be a physical game and they have excellent post
play. So we're going to do our best to hang as tough as we can with their
great players.  
  
Q. The players were saying ‑‑ it almost came through like we're just glad to
be here. How do you instill in them that you have a game and a chance to win
and your season is on the line?   
COACH MIMNAUGH: Anytime you take the court you're always in a position that
you could win or you could lose. Our team, we're workers. Nobody is going to
have us in their top 25 and on the "USA Today" poll. Pennsylvania State is
deserving of that. We are hard hat, blue collar, dive on the floor, take
charges, box out, do‑whatever‑you‑can kind of team. Anything can happen with
those kind of teams.  
We got to our championship game in the Big West tournament. I was reminding
them because I was at N.C. State for a few years when Jim Valvano was there.
So I told them about that Cinderella team being able to march through, and
they were inspired by the fact that you could overcome a lot of things,
injuries included, if you play together.  
Our team has done that this whole season long and we talk to them about throw
your hearts over the bar and your body will follow. You're going to see a
whole lot of hearts out on the floor tomorrow and their desire to win.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Penn State?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: They're tough, really tough. As the girls said, very athletic.
Size is going to be a major problem for us. We have two dinky guards‑‑ I'm
kind of dinky myself; I try to have at least three dinkies on the team, so I
can talked to somebody.  
Molly it's always like, hello! But they're going to be much bigger than we
are. We can match some places in the quick department. We can't in the post.
Molly is a good, strong post player. She hasn't, except playing against
Oklahoma State, she hasn't faced playing somebody as big as she is, so that's
going to be a challenge for her.  
We're going to start out with a committee trying to play Lucas, and that's
going to be a big‑time job. Caroline Reeves is going to start out on her. We
will try to keep up with her zillion screens she has, and hopefully we can
wear her out.  
  
Q. Talking more about Penn State, it would seem to have, I guess, good
coaching, talent, and experience, probably a trifecta for a successful run.
How do you see that?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: I see them really well‑coached. They run excellent sets,
things that are going to‑‑ things that I think exemplify the strengths they
have on the team. They make it tough for you, because not only do they run
Lucas off the screens, but at the same time they're posting you up their bigs.  
So there is no great opportunity to stay on double teams on the court. We'll
do our best to give support, as Caroline Reeves said, with the ball screens
coming off those. We're going to be totally isolated on the post play for a
bit and how well we can have pressure on the basketball will give us a little
bit of time to try to get around the post and try to do a better job defending
them.  
Well, I can't say that they're used to it, because I've seen them play quite a
few teams and they've been really, really strong and they're going to be a
battle. They're really well‑coached and obviously their players are excellent.  
  
Q. We're working on a story at the AP about how coaches have competitive
playing backgrounds as well, and I'm trying to illustrate that. Your thoughts
on ‑‑ I don't know how much you get out on the floor with your players and
work them in practice. But you played and Nikki played and Coquese played. How
do you think you would do against any of these coaches in the tournament
one‑on‑one, or what do you know about them as players?   
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well, they're all great players, much better than I ever was.
I remember when I was‑‑ my first Division I coaching job was at North Carolina
State, and when I was there I was a graduate assistant to start out with. So I
was on the court a lot against Andrea Stinson and Rhonda Mapp, and I remember
getting back on defense and we were doing this drill, and I would always get
in because I would take charge and be really tough.  
Andrea Stinson is coming at me, and I got her. I got her, and she crosses me
up and gave a reverse layup and I had her, I had her; and that's probably what
Ms.Washington would do and Nikki would do. They're all really, really great
players, and thank God I don't have to get out on the court anymore.  
  
Q. You come to win and at the same time it is a first for your program, for
your players. How much did you want them to balance the goal of concentrating
and practicing and preparing to win a game, and yet you're in a different part
of the country and the thing is a novel experience for you for a lot of
different reasons?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: This is a fantastic opportunity. We just had final exams all
this week for our winter quarter, and I can tell you that I'm just glad we
were able to go to dinner last night. Caroline Reeves, our mechanical
engineering student, normally brings her books and homework, and she is
writing away doing her computations. I don't understand any of it. She didn't
have to do that last night. She could come here and be free spirited. We are
largely a team of faith‑minded people, so never bet a against a coach whose
name is Faith because anything can happen!  
  
Q. Can you talk about your reflexes on Kay Yow and how well you knew her?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: She is just the best. Anybody who was blessed enough to be in
her presence would know how special that was as an opportunity. I was playing
basketball overseas in Australia and I sent my resume out to 50 different
colleges, and the one thing that Kay and I shared is our faith in Christ. I
had put in there that I was part of Athletes In Action. I just had done a tour
with them. I got all these different letters, places that I had never even
really heard of. Obviously, I wrote it on the novel where I was sending my
resume to. But I get a call from America from Kay Yow and she wanted me to
come and be her coach, and I just‑‑ Kay Yow? Kay Yow? Kay Yow? I get to coach
with Kay Yow? I was going crazy!  
The opportunities that she gave me to get into coaching and as a human being,
I will never forget. It's just been a journey to see the kind of perseverance
that she had. When the girls‑‑ they hurt their finger or whatever, I'm like,
you know, Kay Yow went through three battles with cancer. I think your little
finger is going to be just fine, go on out there!  
She taught me about perseverance and keeping the faith and how to run a
program. I've been fortunate to be around some really good coaches, and she
really talked about the wholeness of a program, how to help students get jobs,
how to make sure they have study hall arranged and get all the supports they
need in place.  
I didn't have that back at Loyola University in Chicago. We were all just
smart and left to our own devices. For how she was able to‑‑ to love is one of
the great things that I think she‑‑ I feel bad she never got to win a national
championship, because she deserved that. And the ability to love your players
and not just have it be a business is something that was refreshing to see at
that level because I know it doesn't always exist. That's something I try to
do with my team members is love them.  
I feel really bad, my first head coaching experience I was at University of
Evansville and I had just lost my mom and wasn't really available emotionally
to the kids the way I wanted to be. I try my hardest, but I feel bad for those
kids that they didn't have the kind of experience that I got to enjoy in
college, Kay gave her players, and the experience that these Mustangs get to
enjoy; it's vastly different. It does start with loving your kids, and I think
we got that in place.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, best of luck tomorrow.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon. The LSU Lady Tigers are with us, Coach Caldwell
and players Adrienne Webb, Jeanne Kenney and Theresa Plaisance. We'll start
with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. I just wanted to know with the run you guys made late in the season up
until that loss against Georgia, what was the difference there compared to the
rest of the season that you hit a hot streak?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: The difference in that was we were doing the little things.
Coach put the emphasis on defense and rebounding, and in all those games you
would see that we were outrebounding our opponents and our defense was there,
and we were keeping it to a low percentage game.  
We had to keep doing those things and battling back and it worked out for us
then and we'll see how it works in the future.  
JEANNE KENNEY: I felt we matured following Texas A&M and our Tennessee game.
Losing that Tennessee game in the last couple seconds, it just‑‑ it shows that
you have to play forty minutes, play until that clock hits triple zero. I
thought that was our turning point, and we all started caring a little bit
more about our seniors and this is it. I just felt like we grew up a lot.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: As they said, we started focusing on defense and started coming
together as a team. After the Tennessee loss, we kind of brought ourselves
together in saying that there weren't‑‑ speaking of our seniors, me and
Bianca, we weren't going to let us go out bad in the last six games of our
season.  
  
Q. Adrienne, how do you prepare for such a versatile player like Adrian
Ritchie, who leads her team in stats with points and rebounds?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: It comes down to when we broke it down in practice. We really
keyed in on where she gets her shots and where‑‑ how she receives the ball and
not only focusing on her. We have to lock up on everyone else so that they
don't go off in the game, also.  
But just applying‑‑ it really comes down to defense and knowing personnel, how
they get shots, how they, you know, penetrate and kick. It really breaks down
to knowing that you haveto cover everyone on the floor.  
  
Q. When did you find out you were playing Green Bay? What do you know about
them? I know you check on the stats and stuff, but what have you been
preparing for this week?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Green Bay getting that draw we knew it was going to be a
tough game. Right now they are 29‑2, and that's probably one of the best
records in the nation. Not only are they 29‑2, but they are on a 24‑game
winning streak which is highly recognizable and doesn't go unnoticed by
anyone; and we were ranked one week out of the season and they were ranked
throughout the whole year. They're tough competition and they shouldn't be
taken lightly.  
JEANNE KENNEY: We thought they were going to be a 6 seed, so it's just
preparing for anybody that comes our way. Everyone has done their job to get
to the NCAA Tournament. We're lucky; they're lucky, and just taking it in
stride. We will play whoever comes to us.  
  
Q. You said you all expected them to be a higher seed, so going into this
game what's the attitude? Is there a calm with how y'all have been playing
lately, or is there nervousness that y'all drew a bad seed?  
JEANNE KENNEY: There is never a calmness in playing any team. I feel like we
have prepared and we're going in there prepared, and I feel like confidence is
very important. Our coaching staff has done a great job of preparing us, and
we know Green Bay is a great team.  
You have to keep everybody‑‑ you can't look past anybody or anything.
Everybody is their own team, and we're going to do our best.  
  
Q. Going along with that, a lot of times when we talked to Green Bay
throughout the season they said it doesn't matter where you're ranked, when
you start the tournament it's a clean slate. Is that the mentality that you go
into the tournament with as well?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Definitely it's a clean slate; it's a whole new season. Just
going in there and being humble about being able to have this chance to play
in the NCAA Tournament, it's a great feat. So taking one game at a time, you
can never look over anybody or any play.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Second what Jeanne said, everybody has to go down the same
path. You have to win the same amount of games. We're fortunate to be on our
home court and not everyone has that, but everyone has to win the same amount
of games to get to the Final Four.  
So the bottom line is whoever comes to play that day is going to be the winner
and you keep on moving.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I believe Jeanne and Theresa covered it. Honestly we're lucky
to be in this NCAA Tournament and lucky to be playing at home, but it's a new
season. Seedings don't play a factor in it. You have to go out every game and
play under control.  
  
Q. Talk about the mismatch. Green Bay hasn't seen your height all season
long, so talk about that as a strength for you guys.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We do have a height advantage but on the defensive end we
are going to have to match up with smaller, faster athletes. On offense, we
will stick with the postgame; but defensively the advantage is on them because
we have to be able to defend and guard their outside game and their
penetration and kick and knocking down that 3‑point shot which is deadly for
them.  
  
Q. I know you guys were 8 ‑9 when this happened, but in 2004, LSU host the
first two rounds, played the regional in Washington and the Final Four was in
New Orleans. Is there something extra special of playing at home and the goal
is playing someplace that you know is 80 miles away?   
JEANNE KENNEY: It's definitely extra special, being able to play your whole
way through the first couple of games and Final Four in your home state is
definitely a great perk. We haven't looked that far ahead yet. We got Green
Bay Sunday.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I was at that Final Four game in New Orleans way back when
and it was‑‑ so many years ago! It was a great experience just sitting in the
crowd and growing up in New Orleans, you know, that's‑‑ LSU is who I wanted to
play for, and being able to wear that purple and gold at the Final Four was
tremendous.  
I'm in that spot, having the opportunity to play on that court again is a
great one. But we need to come out and play ever game like it's our last and
keep fightin'; and if we get there, then it's a blessing, and it's a blessing
itself.  
  
Q. I think Green Bay is the 10th ranked opponent you have played this year.
How has that readied you for this tournament?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Right now every team is good, so you have to go into every game
playing your all, knowing‑‑ carrying over what you went over in practice into
the game, because it's win or go home. It's not really who is ranked in the
preseason; it's what you have in front of you right now.  
JEANNE KENNEY: I feel like it doesn't matter about rankings. It's about how
prepared you are and how focused you are and how prepared you are to play the
team that day. Rankings don't matter; so it's one game at a time.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Earlier in the week before we knew what the seedings were,
before anybody knew about the tournament Coach told us in postseason play you
can't worry about the seeding or the name, you just have to come out and stick
to your game plan and play your game, control the things that you can control,
and everything else will fall into place.  
  
Q. Jeanne, we're trying to illustrate how coaches in the tournament now have
great playing backgrounds as well and if the basket was broken down to one
‑on‑one games. How do you think Nikki would do?   
JEANNE KENNEY: She may have just had a baby and torn her Achilles tendon, but
she'll beat anybody that comes her way. Her competitive nature is
unbelievable, and it rubs off on us, too. So that's a good thing. She'll beat
anybody. Be scared!  
  
Q. At practice the other day you guys broke out gold shoes. Is this what
you're wearing tomorrow? Oh, you got 'em out, okay. You guys had the pink
shoes you wore for a while. I love that. It was good luck. Then you lose to
Georgia in the tournament so they are retired, I guess. So now you're starting
a new streak with the gold shoes? What do you hope to get from the gold shoes
and are you superstitious?  
JEANNE KENNEY: I apologize. It's probably not appropriate, but they're the
same brand just a different color. So if you're superstitious it goes a long
way. Doesn't matter about shoes, we just got to come out and play.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We like the style of shoe a lot, so we stuck with the pink
shoe; and after the first couple of games we were winning and we said
everybody wear the pink, wear the same socks, do the same thing, listen to the
same music, keep going.  
We wore down those pink shoes pretty good, so she decided to give us a new
pair. Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. Jeanne, have you or anybody played Nikki one ‑on‑one? How did it come
out?   
JEANNE KENNEY: Last time she played against us she tore her Achilles tendon.
We watched some previous game footage while she was at Tennessee‑‑  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Quite a competitor.  
JEANNE KENNEY: Quite a competitor.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you and good luck.  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. A lot of talk about seeding when you looked at Green Bay's record, 29 ‑2,
and they're an 11 seed. Do you think the committee made a mistake?   
COACH CALDWELL: I looked at the bracket and I thought, we're going to have a
tough road. But the competitive side of me is, you are going to have to play
the best; you're the top 64 teams in the country that's left.  
Like I told Theresa and the rest of the team, that's something that's totally
out of our control, but what is in our control is how hard we are going to
come out and play tomorrow, what's going to be our attitude. Are we going to
have the spirit of a warrior?  
We talked about all those things, but I was also complimentary of the body of
work that our team has done to get to this point, because there was a period
during this season where we could have tanked.  
They stayed the course. They matured. They grew together, and we're just
grateful to be able to come out, and again, practice today while teams aren't
practicing, a lot of teams aren't playing. I've been around for a while where
you can't read too much into the bracket. You just need to read into your
team. That's what I've learned to focus in on is what our team has to do, no
matter who is above us or below us on that basket line.  
  
Q. With Green Bay, what did you know about them this week, and what are you
preparing for when you see them with this game?  
COACH CALDWELL: First, they're a well‑coached team. You don't win consecutive
games, 20‑plus in a row and not be well‑coached and prepared.  
Two losses on the year, that's a pretty impressive record. They've got a team
which we have seen similar style of play when we played Florida Gulf Coast and
Missouri. They can shoot the 3 ball. We've got to be aware of that with the
match‑up zone we're going to have to extend our bigs.  
That's what they were talking about is going to be a challenge for them. They
understand that. We're 6'5" and they're not about, but they're capable and
skilled at their respective post positions. The one thing about Green Bay that
I like a lot is their ability to share the basketball.  
They have a balanced attack. They do a great job of finding the open player,
and they had a very patient way of playing the game. So that's why they've
been very useful. On the flip side, to me, they have been one of the best
defensive teams we have seen in a long time, as far as lending support and not
overextending, not doing anything outside their comfort zone, again, a very
mature basketball team.  
  
Q. You've seen similar teams. You lost to Florida Gulf Coast ‑‑  
COACH CALDWELL: And could have easily lost to Missouri.  
  
Q. What do you do different this time around?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, after the Florida Gulf Coast we were a different team
than we are now. We have started‑‑ and I've said this a lot, we finally
started to like defense. We don't love it, but we definitely started to like
it.  
If we can continue to like it a little bit more today, a little bit more
tomorrow in the shootaround, and keep going, then I think our defensive scheme
can help us. This team has gelled, so that made us different, because now
we're closer.  
We have had a lot of adversity that hit us, but they have also found success,
and they found it in a big‑time way by going through the last six, seven games
of our season and really performing the way we needed them to. We're going to
take all of that with us into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Nikki, with only having eight, nine girls for the majority of the season,
what has been the challenge in keeping them fresh and getting that kind of run
out of them that you did at the end of the season?  
COACH CALDWELL: We tried to keep practice light. We try not to go over two
hours. Their attention span is probably a good 60, 70 minutes on a good day.
So we try to get everything that we need in, in that 60, 70 minutes, and then
at that point it's fun time, like we do competitive shooting drills where
they're against the clock, and we put 'em on teams.  
It baffles me that, you know, I'm from old school where you practice two and a
half, three hours, sometimes over that, Coach Summit back then you didn't have
rules, but I will say this: We are trying to get the most out of them, and
with only having eight bodies in practice you have to be pretty creative.  
The other thing we have done is if they want to watch scout tapes, they can. I
stopped making them do it. I made them‑‑ before, here is your film, watch it,
what have you. Now, if you want to, go ahead; if you don't, don't worry about
it.  
So they now do it on their own and they're owning up to that, so I guess you
kind of trick them because you can watch. But I'm not going to enforce it, and
I will know if they did or didn't. But it's making them take ownership of how
they want their season to play out.  
  
Q. Going off that, y'all have had a lot of injuries, you come in with eight
and you've got this motto "eight is enough." But with less than a day until
the game, what's the final assessment on how healthy this team is and how
y'all will be able to go through the tournament?  
COACH CALDWELL: We're about as healthy as we're going to get; this is it for
us. They understand that. Jeanne Kenney has been banged up all year, but she
has been such a warrior. She has played through every injury there is. Our
strength and conditioning coaches, they understand when we're weight training
let's do everything in moderation.  
We're rehabbing, doing everything we can. But this time of year, there is no
excuses. There is no reason, there is no reason for you to say, I can't go,
unless you're unable to go. But right now every one of our players, all eight
of them, they're ready to go.  
  
Q. How much do you expect Jeanne Kenney to play tomorrow, since she has had
a couple of weeks to rest from your last game. Starting lineup? The bench?
What are your thoughts?  
COACH CALDWELL: Jeanne is somebody who‑‑ she is going to be ready. You can
tell by watching her in the press conference, but she was the first one‑‑ I
think she talked about this after the Tennessee game, she was the first one
after we lost the first to say, "We don't want our seniors to go out this way,
and I'm going to do everything I can to make it a great year for them and
finish off the year for them."  
And she is going to do whatever role we need her to do, off the bench,
starting player. We may have options there, but she definitely is going to be
playing.  
  
Q. You said earlier they don't make a lot of mistakes. I believe they have
the fourth best turnover ratio in the nation. What do you have to do to
counteract that?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, we can't make a lot of mistakes. We can't go into this
game with 20‑plus turnovers. We've got to take care of the basketball as well.
When you have a team that's played as well as they have and have the maturity,
the leadership, the experience, you got to stay true and not have those plays
where you're not focused.  
That's when they're going to be able to capitalize on that maturity. We're a
team that when you look at us on paper, do we press? No. Do we run our
match‑up? Yes. We're simple in our action, but we got to be precise.  
Again, against a team like this, you respect every player that's on the
roster, because this time of year anything and everything can happen.  
  
Q. When Green Bay found out they were going to play LSU they didn't know
much about your team personnel ‑wise, but they knew your name and they grew up
watching you. Is it more exciting to be in the NCAA Tournament as a coach or
as a player?   
COACH CALDWELL: As a player. I will tell you, and sometimes I forget I'm a
coach and I have to be on the sideline, but when you're a player it's
different because you've done all those sprints, you've had those 6 a.m.
workouts, you've cried, you've laughed, you've been on the back of the bus
with your teammates, you've traveled, you had to get up to go to class; you
experience it totally differently than you do as a coach.  
Not that the journey is any less, but I would love to be playing again,
especially, they got new shoes? We had one pair; you wore those out. They get
pink, gold, purple; they get all this stuff. So our contract is very good to
us.  
I will say this: As a player, you have more control over the game. Coaches
will tell you we would love to have control over the game. We have none. We
have 0. We can call a play, but ultimately, do they run it? It's up to them.
It's their choice to execute the game plan or not all you can do is provide
the shell.  
I would love to be playing today especially when you look at where women's
basketball is today. It's definitely a lot more grandiose than it was when I
played.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you say about Theresa's development, her coordination,
her game, just over the last three years? Where does that come from?  
COACH CALDWELL: She'll probably tell you DoBee, her mom. But Theresa is that
player‑‑ I recruited Theresa when I was out at UCLA, so I got a chance to
watch her in high school. I thought, wow, she is an L.T., and my coaches know
I label people, and what does that mean? She is a lazy talent; she is a
talented player.  
But she has lazy in her game. She'll tell you that, too. I've told her this,
but I will say she is no longer L.T. she is talented. She took the off season
in transforming her body, conditioning, making sure she came back in great
shape which transformed her mentality.  
So she is now mentally tougher than when I first met Theresa. She is someone
who‑‑ I don't think she even realizes everything she has done in such a short
period of time as far as statistically where she stands in the record books
here at LSU, but also nationally.  
I put her up against anybody in the country as far as one‑on‑one, her game,
she can shoot the 3, go off the bounce. She can post. So she is skilled in
that area, and she has more upside to her.  
She is one who is starting to like defense. It was interesting that she
commented on the defense because she made the SEC All‑Defensive team which is
great for Theresa, but it was her work ethic over the summer which has
transformed her into the player she is this year.  
  
Q. How surprising to hear you talk about shoes earlier (Laughter). Again,
the point is to illustrate the competitive background of the coaches as
players. If it was one ‑on‑one, coach‑on‑coach bracket, who would you consider
the favorites? How do you think you would do?   
COACH CALDWELL: I'm going to be competitive; and, you know, I'm going to do
whatever I can. I was that type of player and probably still am, if I was out
there. If you needed someone to take the charge, I was going to do it. If you
needed someone to take the extra pass, I was going to do that. I could box
out, I believe, in defense; and I could shoot the ball and triple pass.  
So I would do everything I possibly can to put myself or my team in a
successful situation by doing that and focusing in on the little things. I
know the coaches here, especially with Coach Washington having played; and we
played against each other, you know, you don't get to this point without
having some type of competitive greatness in you.  
There's a lot of opportunities here for our team and for the other teams that
are here if the team if you will, will take on the spirit of their coaches
it's going to be a great weekend, a great tournament all the way through here
at Baton Rouge.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to our first press conference of the Baton Rouge first
and second round site. We will ask Coach Washington for an opening statement
on her season and the game coming up. Then we will take questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Alex, what are the challenges of facing a team that you didn't know a lot
about until recently?  
ALEX BENTLEY: We've got to make sure we pay attention to film. Our coaches do
a great job of preparing us for games. So, yeah, we don't know much about
these opponents, but we're going to know plenty. We have to focus on the game
plan.  
  
Q. You're playing a team you don't know much about, in a school you probably
haven't heard of before this week. Did you get lessons from the men's
tournament, Florida Gulf Coast, nobody heard of of them until yesterday. Do
you respect all your opponents and this is a big deal to be here, this is the
first time.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: You know, we see that everyone in the tournament is capable of
beating anyone. Everyone is very talented. Cal Poly has a lot of strengths.
So, you know, we go into the tournament and we don't take them lightly.
They're a good team and they're here, obviously, so they deserve it.  
ALEX BENTLEY: We just want to take it a game at a time, focus on who we're
playing and take it a game at a time to advance.  
  
Q. The familiarity of being here a year ago, knowing the facilities, knowing
the surroundings, does that help you prepare for this year's tournament?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think it does. I think it's nice that we're familiar with the
area. It's fun to come back and play here. I loved playing here last year, so
we're excited to be here.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I agree with Alex. We loved playing here last year and we're
excited to be back.  
  
Q. Alex, if you would comment about the Naismith Award?  
ALEX BENTLEY: Oh, yeah, I'm very honored. I couldn't have done it without my
teammates.  
  
Q. Alex, your thoughts as a senior now that the NCAA Tournament is here?  
ALEX BENTLEY: It's crazy. This season flew by very quick and it's been fun.
We're excited to be going into the NCAA Tournament. Yeah, it's bittersweet.  
  
Q. You both said you loved playing here last year and it feels like a time
warp for you. Why did you like playing here, the confidence of events last
year or other factors?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I love the facilities here. It's a nice place to play. It was
just fun, yeah.  
ALEX BENTLEY: Yeah, I agree with Mags. The facility is awesome, the place is
great. It's a good area, and there were plenty of fans out there last year, so
an exciting environment.  
  
Q. You said you guys had a good week in practice, able to sit back and
really work on what you guys needed to after the loss to Michigan State.
What's it going to take to make a deep run from what you guys learned after
that loss?  
ALEX BENTLEY: We have to stick to the game plan. That's the plan, take it one
game at a time, listen to our coaching staff.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I agree with Alex.  
  
Q. Penn State has been in the tournament 25 times. Tell me your reasons for
coming to Penn State and what the program means to you. You've never been to a
Final Four. How much unfulfilled are you about not doing that yet?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: One of our coaches, Maren, played on the Final Four team for
Penn State in 2000, so she has been there. And one of the things about me
going to the Penn State program was I believe in Coach Washington, and I
wanted to be a part of it.  
ALEX BENTLEY: A agree with Mags. When Coach was recruiting me, I bought into
what she was telling us. We can rebuild a program, do great things at Penn
State and we all bought into that. We're trying to reach our goals.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Best of luck to you.  
Q.Now that you've had a chance to look at Cal Poly, what are your
impressions of them?  
COACH WASHINGTON: A well‑coached, hard‑working team. They have a pretty
dynamic player that they're centered around in shore measure, their post
player. She's very good. She's tall, big, wild. So they're going to present
some challenges for our post defense, and they surround her with good
perimeter players who like to drive and kick, and when they can get their feet
set.  
They can get open, and once they knock 'em down they're a good‑shooting team.
They have good balance, get through close up driving lanes quickly. They're
very good with their help rotations, and they're aggressive in defending the
way they like to defend.  
So, as Alex said, every team in the tournament is good. They know how to play
to their strengths, whatever those are; and that's one thing that we've
noticed in watching film of Cal Poly is they play to their strengths. They do
the things they do well and they're consistent with those things. I'm certain
it's going to be a challenge to our team Sunday, tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wanted your take on my question to the players as well? I
wondered if you had talked to Nikki since you got here and if you're still
talking about babies this year? What's going on?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, I feel the same way that they did, you know.
When you get into the NCAA Tournament, one of the things that's cool is if you
get sent to a great basketball environment. It was fun playing here last year
because the crowd was into the game. They're knowledgeable fans. They showed
up for all the games. It's just a great environment.  
Like they said, the facilities here are outstanding; it's a great arena to
play in. Our kids, our team, our coaching staff, we like playing in great
basketball environments. We would much rather play in a filled arena than play
in an empty arena.  
So it's great. The people here, that southern hospitality is outstanding. It's
just a fun place to be. When we saw the bracket come out we're like cool,
we'll go back to the south and the 80 degree weather and great fans. We were
pleased.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WASHINGTON: Oh, Caldwell, I thought you were talking about Nikki Greene
on our team. I was like, she didn't have a baby! Nikki‑‑ we were just out
there talking about family, and her daughter is 1 year old now. My daughter is
3. So, yeah, we have a lot of parallels in our careers and in our personal
lives.  
It's always cool to catch up and to be able to talk‑‑ moms, we can talk about
our kids forever. You don't have to worry about us having nothing to talk
about when we're together.  
  
Q. You said the other day the team was healthy and everything. Any chance we
could see the mother hen, as you put it, playing anytime in the tournament?  
COACH WASHINGTON: No, she has not been cleared. She got cleared to play about
30 seconds senior night, but medically she is not able to go.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you were pleased when you saw where you guys were being
sent. In a way ‑‑ maybe we covered this ground last year, but in a way would
you like to see the tournament evolve to where the men's is where you have the
eight sites instead of trying to drum up support by playing at home arenas?   
COACH WASHINGTON: If we grow to that point, that would be awesome; and clearly
that's not where we are. I don't think it takes away from the tournament at
all. It makes for some fantastic basketball environments, LSU being one, you
know. All 16 first and second round sites are pretty good basketball
environments.  
So as a coach and as a competitor, I don't mind. I don't mind the challenge of
going on the road and playing. We do it all year long. Half our games are on
the road anyway. It's just fun. It's basketball, and it's the best tournament
in women's basketball. So we're excited to be a part of it.  
  
Q. What are the challenges of facing a team who may seem like it has nothing
to lose up against you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, we don't look at it that way. We don't look at it as
Cal Poly is a team that has nothing to loose. We look at it as Cal Poly is a
very good team that has earned the right to be in the tournament and earned
the right to play against us, and we look at it as we have earned the right to
play against Cal Poly.  
Our perspective is we know we are going to see a formidable and worthwhile
opponent and we prepare for them just that way. We don't prepare any other
way, and we think it's two good teams that will tip off at 4:15 tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sounds like you are happy with the team's mind ‑set coming here,
opponent, all those things being in the right frame of mind; is that correct?
  
COACH WASHINGTON: Absolutely, absolutely, seedings and all that stuff, I think
that's great for fans, great for media, something to talk about, gives an aura
of, you know, David and Goliath in every single game. I think that's what
makes the tournament exciting, because you have that element.  
But as competitors, we don't‑‑ Penn State, we don't see it that way. We don't
look at the seedings and say this is supposed to happen or that is supposed to
happen. They got the Player of the Year in their conference, and she is very
good. They've got some very good players and we haven't seen 'em.  
So we've got to come into this game and understand that we've got to execute
our game plan. I would assume they're looking at it the wait a minute say.
It's basketball, you know, it's basketball, it's not about who is supposed to
do what. When you start looking at sports like that, who is supposed to do
stuff, that's‑‑ you know, that's not who we are. That's not who Penn State is.  
We are not looking and thinking about making a deep run or any of that kinda
stuff. We're concerned about being our best tomorrow against Cal Poly, and
then whatever happens at about 7:00 tomorrow night, we'll start talking about
that. But right now the only thing we're focused on is how we're going to slow
down Schlemer. How we're going to keep their guards out of the paint, and how
we need to execute and what we need to execute to be successful.  
  
Q. They've had some kids hurt. How crucial do you think depth is going to be
in this ballgame?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'm hoping it's something we can draw upon. They do have a
couple of injuries and probably don't have‑‑ certainly don't have the rotation
that they would like coming into this game. I'm hoping that our depth and our
ability to continue to throw a bunch of different looks and bodies on the
floor will be a positive for us.  
  
Q. When a team is as good as yours offensively shoots 22% in a game, that is
obviously noteworthy. How much of a concern is the last outing?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We did not eat our Wheaties on that day, so we'll change our
bio. We will have a different pregame meal and we will be ready to go.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WASHINGTON: Nothing too exotic. We don't need upset stomachs, having
this Cajun food.  
  
Q. You talked about Schlemer, how important is Nikki's play going to be,
especially staying out of foul trouble for you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: When she is on the floor, things run smoother for us. So we
need her on the floor. But I have confidence in our post rotations. Nikki has
been in foul trouble a number of games this year. So if it happens, we're used
to it. We know how to play in that situation, in those scenarios.  
But certainly when she is out there, she is a difference‑maker for us, and
hopefully she can play a lot of minutes.  
  
Q. We are at the stage of women's basketball where there are a lot of
coaches who were successful players. I wonder if you ever ‑‑ do you ever
wonder when you run into some of those women, if we were one‑on‑one how would
we do today or how do you think you would do against Nikki or things like
that?   
COACH WASHINGTON: We do like the guys, whose got the rings. Whoever has the
most wins‑‑ I don't know. Mostly we look at‑‑ thank God we played back then
because if we had to play now against these girls and athletes and how tall
they are, we would be in trouble, little point guards, me, Dawn Staley, and
Jolette. We would be in trouble. We're thankful that we're old and out of
shape and can't run around on the court with the young girls.  
THE MODERATOR: Good players make great coaches. Coach, thanks a lot.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Green Bay. We are joined by Coach
Borseth, Lydia Bauer, Sarah Eichler and Adrian Ritchie.  
COACH BORSETH: We're excited to be here, nice, warm weather. Inside your
buildings are a little bit cold, you might want to turn the heat up.  
Excited to be here, worked hard obviously to get our opportunity to compete at
this level, and we're ready for the games to begin.  
  
Q. Obviously, you guys have been around these teams making the NCAA
Tournament experiences. What has the mood been like, and what is it like
preparing for this?  
LYDIA BAUER: We're excited. As seniors, this is our fourth time here. We want
to make our last run, a good one. Just the excitement has been fun to see and
bringing the younger girls, seeing them as well. We're just excited to be
here.  
SARAH EICHLER: Obviously, there is a lot of excitement that goes around this
tournament as we've matured, us and the senior class. It has been more
excitement than nerves this year, so that's nice to see, and all the energy
that the younger girls bring to our team.  
We get along so well and it's nice to be able to spend some time with them
away from Green Bay in an exciting time like where there is no pressure from
school. We're on spring break, so we can hang out and have fun. It's a special
time of year for us.  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Also, just being here is something we don't take for granted,
and we put in the work all season and now we're here. We can just now take
this moment to prepare for LSU.  
  
Q. Adrian, for those of us who haven't had a chance to watch your team play
this year, you shoot a lot of 3 ‑point shots, and I think you are the leader
in that category. What kind of a weapon is that for your offense, and is it
the trademark of what you do?   
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Trademark is strong. It's definitely a good thing for us that
we're balanced, and literally 1 through 5 on our starting 5 can shoot the
three, and that makes it hard for other teams to guard us, and match‑up
problems, and we have that one more pass.  
If they close up on one person, we can one pass, one pass, so no matter who it
is, we believe that girl can knock down the shot. That's a reason why we got
here this year and basically our whole careers here and the fact that we can
all shoot is one of our strengths for sure.  
  
Q. Adrian, they mentioned when they came up here about their size and that
being an advantage, but they talked about your speed and having to match that.
Do you think that can be an advantage for you guys going into this game and
what you do?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Yeah, we hope that our defense turns into offensive transition
and we can beat teams down the floor. We take pride in being in better
condition and we play forty minutes. I think a lot of teams can hang with us
for a certain amount of time and in most cases we outplay them or we can last
longer.  
We hope to use that against LSU and we hope to push them in transition.
They're a fast, athletic team and we look to make sure we can control that
aspect of their game and use it in our game to benefit us.  
  
Q. Sarah, what can you and the other post players do on Theresa Plaisance?
What do you see out of her as a player?  
SARAH EICHLER: Obviously, when you look at LSU‑‑ yeah, I got it. We deal in
numbers more than names, making sure I knew what number she was.  
Obviously, she is a big presence and we don't play many 6'5" people in our
conference, and that's definitely going to be a challenge for us, being a
smaller lineup. But that physicality is going to be a big part of this game,
and if we can match that and play at their level inside, and she'll be our
point of focus. But we will do an okay job of balancing out.  
  
Q. Sarah, if I read Justin's notes right, this is your 132nd game, more than
any player in program history. Did you anticipate playing right away when you
came here? What have you thought of that run?  
SARAH EICHLER: Obviously, it's a huge thing to play in the most games in the
history. It's a really cool thing to be a part of, and I think coming in my
freshman year you kinda come in and you just do what you have to do at that
point. There were some injuries that ended up leading to me starting in the
first place and playing in my freshman year and that kind of built the
confidence in my team around me that I was able to play in those games.  
Hannah came back after she broke her finger, and she got her starting spot
back. But staying in the lineup as one of the top 6, players was huge for me
and my confidence. I think playing with these girls for those four years has
built our team chemistry.  
For playing that long together, us three know each other very well and it's
beneficial going into games, knowing where Lydia is going to cut; and Adrian
likes the catch the ball when she is ready to shoot. Those little things that
some teams don't have because there aren't as many seniors or people that
haven't been playing together as long as us. So I think that gives us an
advantage.  
  
Q. Talk about the challenge coming here and playing on their home court,
such a big game from across country to do that?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Last year we played Iowa State on Iowa State's floor, so that
experience is something we can build off of, and we won't be as nervous coming
into tomorrow's game, playing LSU on their home floor. So it's something we
have done before, so we can eliminate those nerves and focus on just playing
and playing hard for forty minutes.  
  
Q. Adrian, you guys lost a close game last year, something that serves as
motivation going into this year?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Absolutely, I saw a picture where me and Megan Lukan, our
point guard, were looking off, and in the distance behind us you can see
Kentucky celebrating. That's motivation for me because I can see how close we
were to that upset and to the Sweet 16.  
It's definitely in the back of our minds and we're competitors, Green Bay.
We're used to winning and we like to win. It's the tradition of excellence and
the culture that we can't get enough of. It's definitely something when
everybody is on the line, especially for us three seniors. And now there are
two other teammates who are seniors; we're going to put everything on the
line, and we're ready to play against LSU for sure.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about the long winning streak you had. Not in the context
of ‑‑ obviously doesn't mean anything if you don't continue to win, but what
does it mean in the context of what does it symbolize in terms of the culture
of your program, growth, culture, chemistry?   
LYDIA BAUER: Coming in as freshman, that's something that you learn quickly
about the tradition and the culture of winning, and it's something that is
built into you over time. I think it's something we continue to pass on to the
younger girls.  
The winning streak isn't so much our priority. Our priority is to focus on the
next game to keep winning and to put Green Bay on the road map in these
tournaments.  
  
Q. Adrian, with having seven freshmen on this team and going back to your
freshman year, how important is this experience to keep that culture going
after you five seniors are gone?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Very important. Seems like every year we have been here
someone graduates, and you say, how can you fill that position and that void?
So while you're here with your freshmen, as long as our career lasts you pass
on those values and you show them by examples and you hustle forty minutes for
every single time and not just show up to practice sometimes mentally. You are
there every single day and those are the morals and the intangibles that not
everyone against you see.  
But the girls who share your locker with, those are the ones who know who you
are, and if she can see you fighting every day, especially the freshmen look
at the juniors and the seniors, that's why we need the program that we have at
Green Bay, and that's why we keep it going.  
  
Q. You look at the past five or six years, even before Coach Borseth, how
close do you all feel about changing the perception as not one of the best mid
‑major, but a program that should be in the top‑20 mentioned every year. Do
you feel like you're close? What do you feel you have to do to change that?   
ADRIAN RITCHIE: I definitely feel that we're close. In our minds, we don't
think we're a mid‑major. We strive to be our best. According to the national
rankings right now, we're near 20th; and in the past we've been up to 9, 11,
things like that.  
It's not so much for us to reach for a number, to define success as far as our
season goes or something like that. But we see the progress that we've made
freshmen year getting an at‑large bid after we were upset in our conference
tournament to now we're seniors and expected to be here. At least from our
standpoint, we expect to win that Horizon Tournament and expect to make a deep
run in the tournament.  
I think we've come somewhere. We feel we have put our impact on it moving
forward and we just hope that the country can see that from their point of
view as well.  
  
Q. Adrian, can you talk about No. 10 and No. 5? And the challenges they
present on the perimeter from the outside?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Sure, No. 10 is a very good player. Coach made apoint that he
notices how other teams pay attention to No. 10, and I think that says a lot
about the player she is.  
Their opponents don't want to see her get going. She is a senior leader on
that team and we know that she can do damage. We're going to have to pay
attention to her on that weak side and make sure we are closing out on her
hard so she can't get open three's.  
No. 5 is the point guard; everything runs through her. She as a nice pull‑up.
She is a lefty and those two‑‑ how we can play defense on those two will sort
of dictate how their offensive possessions go and the rhythm that they can
find. They're two very important pieces of why they are a good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Kevin, I know defensively everything you guys have done this year. How
big of a test will you be for LSU defensively?  
COACH BORSETH: They provide elements that we haven't seen before. When you
dissect a team you see kids around the basket that are big, that can play both
offensively and defensively. We haven't seen that size yet this year. You look
at the perimeter and you see the quickness and the strength of the quickness
that they have, you know, we haven't seen a lot of that either.  
They pose problems inside and out for us, both offensively and defensively.
The key for us is to do what we do and see how we shake out.  
  
Q. You play LSU every once in a while in the NCAA Tournament. Talk about
going back to Green Bay after spending a few seasons away.  
COACH BORSETH: I was in Green Bay for 9 years and spent five years at the
University of Michigan. Green Bay was home. My children were born there;
family is close to there. Being at LSU, being at Green Bay are two different
animals. They really are.  
Things on the upper stage in the BCS level are really‑‑ it's all‑‑ I felt it
was all about the job, not about your life. I thought from my perspective that
living was important and I get a better chance to live my life at Green Bay
than on the higher stage, and it didn't have anything to do particularly with
University of Michigan.  
LSU put me in the same feeling, but I feel at home in Green Bay and I'm able
to live and my life just feels better.  
  
Q. Kevin, taking a Green Bay team back to the NCAA Tournament, first time
since Natalie and Nicole, what did that mean to you to prepare for a
tournament again not only as a coach, but being in Green Bay?  
COACH BORSETH: It's funny, I don't know that I'm the guy that prepared them, I
feel like Matt should be up here, because these are the kids that he's groomed
over the last three years. He had the luxury of having the players that I had
for the last four or five years, and now I've got the luxury of having the
players that he's got and these kids are special.  
We were inspecting film today and I said, I wonder how we're going to cover
this one situation, and they said, well, we talked about it and this is what
we're going to do; and I said, really, you ought to tell me how you're going
to do it, too, because that might not be a bad idea!  
They've got a lot of plans. They've been really well taught over the last
three years of their career. In some regards, I've injected some of my
believes; a lot of things have been instilled over the course of time that
they have had here, so in some regards I'm along for the ride.  
  
Q. Coach, I look across the seeding lines and Marist is playing and they
have had success in this tournament. They're stuck in the 12 line. This
program has made a Sweet 16 run; they've pushed Kentucky. What does it take to
maybe change the perception this time of year where a seeding line can matter
‑‑  
COACH BORSETH: That's really a good question. I think in the men's field in
particular you can see what the Butler men have done, they've got to a Final
Four. I think for a mid‑major to be recognized as someone who deserves a
higher seed you're going to have to play against really good competition, the
LSUs and the big‑time schools, and you're going to have to beat them; and,
two, somebody is going to have to make a run to the Final Four to get there.  
Before anything like that happens, I think we're all probably going to be in
the same category. Doesn't change how we feel about our program. I'm quite
certain Gonzaga and Marist and Green Bay feel good about our programs. We want
to have more respect, but I think our kids are blue‑collar kids who work hard,
really proud of what we accomplished.  
I think when we play against teams, they have a great deal of respect for us
and they have to prepare for us. But until one of us makes a Final Four run
and beats teams in preseason‑‑ Green Bay did that the year they got the
at‑large bid, ironically they pushed Michigan out. It was a bittersweet moment
for me.  
But that year they had beaten Penn State and some bigger schools in the
process which had gotten the credibility up high, so preseason beating good
teams is pretty important.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got a very experienced lineup, several seniors in the
starting lineup and Green Bay 5 straight NCAA Tournament experiences. How does
that experience help you coming into the situation?  
COACH BORSETH: It means a lot. It doesn't guarantee you're going to win or
lose a game, but when the players step on the floor they're not going to be on
a foreign planet. They've been in hostile environments before, been successful
doing that. They've been in the game when the‑‑ has been around their in the
case. They've seen some of this stuff before. It can potentially end your
season.  
I think they're wise enough in that regard to savor the moment, play as good
as you can during that period of time. Doesn't guarantee you win or lose a
game, but it does guarantee that you play well; and I think that's what you
want to do at this time of year is to play your best.  
  
Q. You're going to do some things to contain Theresa Plaisance. How
difficult is she to defend in? She can pop out any, the perimeter, bring the
ball up, play the post ‑‑  
COACH BORSETH: She is not the only one you got, either, that's the bad news. A
bunch of 'em have the ability to score, but she presents a challenge because
of her‑‑ she is so multifaceted. If you guard her with someone small, they
take her down low and throw it over the top. If you play behind her she reels
around and scores. If you don't cover her properly on a ball screen, she picks
and pops and buries a three.  
We do what we do. I don't think you're going to see any smoke and mirrors from
Green Bay. Our kids are going to sell everything they have and do what we do.  
Interesting, at the beginning of the year one of the games we were playing I
said to the players, we're going to‑‑ the key is to dance with who brought
you, and one of the players looked at me like, what generation did you come
from? But in all reality, that's what we're going to do. I don't know that you
get to this stage and try to pull a rabbit out of your hat or magic up your
sleeve. You have to do what you do and do it really well. I think all the
teams in the tournament have to be able to do that.  
So while we're focusing on Theresa and the players on their team which are
very good and very well‑coached. On the other side of the ball, we got to make
sure we do things to make them have to guard us equally as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you were talking about strength of schedule. You probably didn't
help schedule this year's games, but is that something you might talk to Nikki
about after of the game and ask to schedule them preconference?  
COACH BORSETH: This is probably a decision for a different day with the
conferences starting to expand now and all the TV revenue. My opinion, all the
revenue that's involved now there is a potential for your conferences to get
so bid they might add more conference games which might limit the number of
games we can get.  
We're feeling the squeeze in our area Big 10 with the Wisconsin's and the
schools there. They're not sure how big that's going to get or nonconference
games they will be able to schedule. The key for us is to be able to play
nonconference games like that on our home floor for two reasons. One, it gives
us a chance to be able to compete on the big stage to build our resume down
the road; and, two, to play on our court to allow our fans to be able to see
good teams come up, because we've got great basketball fans in Green Bay.  
Just like in Baton Rouge, they want to see the teams come to town. If LSU
would be one of those teams that would be willing to trek north to Green Bay
we would serve 'em some nice, warm snow. It is as warm outside as it is
inside. It would certainly be nice to do that at some point down the road
because good competition is fun for our players and fun for our fans to be
able to watch.  
  
Q. I can tell just from the short time that those three were up there,
they're smart and you mentioned they come up with a game plan of how to fix a
situation. Is your team a heady team, smart? Do they win games that way, or
are they as talented as these mid ‑major programs?   
COACH BORSETH: They're gritty. They're really gritty. They literally sell the
farm with every play. They're a determined bunch of young ladies. I don't know
that they're overathletic. They're relatively skilled, but they're driven,
smart, they understand‑‑ kinda funny because I'll come in at halftime and I'll
ask one of the assistant coaches what is that play they're calling, and one of
those guys will yell, they're playing No. 2; and they're listening when
they're on the court. So they are smart, and they're gritty and that gives
them a chance in every game they play.  
  
Q. Nikki talked about the size and talked about matching up with your speed.
Do you see that as an advantage?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know who has more speed. You try to get in a running
match with 10 and 32 and find out how fast you are. Those kids are pretty
athletic. I don't know where our advantages lie, I'm not sure. Our advantages
lie, from our perspective in our grit. We're gritty and driven. Our kids are
pretty smart. I think that's the area that have to play off. I don't know that
we're bigger or stronger than them or faster than them, I don't know that.
When we get on that floor that whole thing is going to come into play. The
good news is there is only one ball, only one person can have it at one time.  
So our key is to guard that ball, and on the offensive court we have to share
it to create an advantage and make shots because you can't hold teams to zero.
This isn't soccer and it's not hockey. Points are going to go on the board, so
we're going to play well on both ends of the court.  
  
Q. How much of that grit is naturally there when they get on campus? Past
couple of years under Matt there was a red shirt policy in place there, these
girls come from the similar size high school programs in the area. They
obviously see each other. They come in with grit when you get them?  
COACH BORSETH: I think some of it is grit, but a lot of it is a learned‑‑ it's
a trained response. It really is. We're going to roll the ball on the floor
and you have to get three in a row and you stay out there until you get three
in a row. So you figure out quickly that's what you have to do. They're well
trained, highly intelligent people, very good communicators, very easy to work
with.  
They weren't recruited by big schools and not that they came in with a chip on
their shoulder, but they were young ladies who desired to compete at the
college level, and so when they get a chance to play against bigger schools
they strap up and play a little harder because they want to be like those
players.  
They're a fun group to be around and it's‑‑ the drive that comes with it,
again, part of it is training and part of it is burning desire inside, too.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on the kind of winning that this team has done and
what that signifies, understanding that it doesn't matter tomorrow.  
COACH BORSETH: It's been amazing. I remember the first year‑‑ second year I
was in Green Bay we went to Old Dominion and they had won five or six
championship in a row and Wendy Larry was coaching out there, and I thought
that was amazing!  
At whatever level, that's amazing and for us to be able to do it for 15 years
is unthinkable, it really is. We have been challenged the entire while,
different programs have challenged us, but our kids have done a great job of
rising to that challenge. For the players leaving here now it's a feather in
their cap.  
Tiffany Moore was a gal that played at Green Bay for me, and probably one of
the best players I had, sent me a note after we graduated four of our best
players, all seniors, and she said, I don't know, you don't know how we're
going to do, but, Coach, for whatever reason the players in this program know
what's expected of them and somebody will rise to that challenge.  
I think that's happened every year there, players underneath the underscored
kids‑‑ somebody made reference to the seven freshmen are watching and waiting
and learning in the process. It's been a fun ride so far. But like you said,
it's past now for the most part. We have to build for the future as time
presses forward.  
  
Q. Can you recall the first NCAA Tournament game against LSU inEugene. They
were number one seed. Did that game in any way help your program? I don't know
you didn't win, but does that help your program that you gave them a tough
game?  
COACH BORSETH: That was the team that I was referring to that was probably our
best team, the little guard was tough and Elizabeth picked her, first time
down the court. I said, what are you doing guarding her so close?  
Boom, she picks her pocket. Then she threw the ball back to that girl. She
went to the length of the floor and rammed it to the rim in a hurry. I said,
we probably shouldn't do that. But it was a close game. I don't know if this
was 7 or 10 points, but we played 'em close.  
Our kids were gritty at that time. If you draw a comparison, I think the
comparison with the amount of grit is similar to the kids that you see right
now. You know what you're going to get when they step on the court.  
From a coaching perspective, I think you learn that you can turn up the volume
and listen because the kids kind of go. They can't hear a lot they're just in
a zone. So for me going through that period of time in that game against LSU,
tomorrow's game will draw some similarities, in some regards.  
  
Q. Do you hope the awareness will give you a little more notoriety?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know. That's the thing, I don't know. I think we beat
Washington that year out there. We haven't played in any neutral sites. That's
probably the bad part. Every time we played in a neutral site I think we won.
But I think that was the year that was probably our best team and it's the
first NCAA game we'd won, so maybe turned a few heads.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

NOTRE DAME  74  
IOWA  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach McGraw, an opening statement and questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH McGRAW: I was really pleased with our perimeter defense. I think our
goal was to guard the three‑point line, and we did a good job of finding
Printy and Dixon on the three‑point line. Overall, I thought our press
bothered them a little bit at the beginning of the game. Got us off to a good
start to start the second half.  
But Kayla McBride was phenomenal in the first half against the zone. She got
any shot she wanted and was making just about every shot she took. But Sky did
such a great job of running the team, forcing the tempo. Getting the ball into
K‑Mac's hands in the first half, and just an overall great floor game by
Skylar, and a fantastic game by Kayla.  
  
Q. Kayla, 24 points in the first half. Your previous career best was against
Connecticut, and your new career best in the NCAA Tournament. Talk about
getting those kind of numbers against really tough competition?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think I owe it to my coach and teammates because without them
I wouldn't be getting open shots. But I think it shows the balance on this
team. When you look at what Jewell did, had her career high the last game. Sky
was able to put up big numbers, along with Natalie Achonwa, it just shows how
balanced we are and how unselfish this team is.  
  
Q. Skylar, on that late and ‑one there, it seemed like you almost looked to
the crowd and said this is our house. I wonder if that's what you said, one,
and two, more so, what was it about this team that allowed it to finish the
season without ever losing on the road?   
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think this team has played in so many tough atmospheres. We
played (Indiscernible) versus Tennessee, and any Big East road game we played
in, we got their best crowds. So we're used to the experience that we've had
playing on the road. Iowa was another tough environment we had to overcome if
we wanted to keep dancing.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on it a second ago, but you decided to open with I
think it was a one ‑two‑two press. If I'm mistaken, correct me. But you opened
with the press, and then it seemed to generate some turnovers. Talk about that
decision to use it and then pull it off?   
COACH McGRAW: It was man‑to‑man, and we were trying to double team with our
best defender Ariel Braker. She was trying to get it out of Logic's hands, and
we were leaving Doolittle open, and I thought it was pretty effective to start
off.  
  
Q. Kayla followed up her first double ‑double this season with her career
high in scoring. How much better is the team when she's playing the way she
has this weekend?   
COACH McGRAW: I think when you make that many shots, you're going to look at
it offensively, and everything will seem to flow a lot better. I was really
pleased with the three‑point shot. She's more of a mid‑range jump shooter. But
she got to the rim a little bit, shot some threes and mixed it up offensively
tonight. So it makes it easier when somebody's getting us off to a good start
like that and it takes the pressure off of everybody else.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

NOTRE DAME  74  
IOWA  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH BLUDER: I guess I want to thank our fans for supporting us in this
championship. For them to come out tonight, 8:40 at night tip, and for them to
come out and support us really means a lot. I'm appreciative of our
administration also for putting on this tournament and giving us the
opportunity to play at home again.  
Tough to say goodbye to three really good seniors. Just a tremendous group of
women, great leaders. That's probably the hardest thing about tonight. It's
not really the losing; it's just that the season is over, and you don't ever
get to coach them again, so that's kind of tough.  
We struggled to score tonight. Which the first half we scored okay; second
half we couldn't buy a bucket. For us to go 0 from the three‑point line is
pretty unusual. Turned the ball over too many times, gave up too many
offensive rebounds, and you have to expect almost a near perfect night to beat
a team like Notre Dame, and we just didn't have it tonight.  
  
Q. Samantha or Bethany, it seemed in the first half you were able to keep
pace with them. But it seemed every time they needed to answer, they had an
answer, and then it was a little overwhelming. What was it they were doing
that allowed them to do that?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think they're just a really good team. Obviously, we were
looking to stop their runs and go on runs of our own. But some of the time we
couldn't do that as well as we could have or should have, and they capitalized
on that.  
  
Q. Samantha, can you talk a little bit about what a challenge it was to try
to run the team and on one hand, scoring, rebounding, assists all those
categories were there. But you had a tough time with the turnovers as a team
and personally. What did they do defensively that made that part of the
challenge?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think that trap gave me a lot of trouble. I didn't give us a
chance. In a lot of those situations, I didn't handle them the right way. But
they had pretty good ball pressure, and I let it disrupt me too much. That's
pretty much what it was. I wasn't composed enough, and we, as a team, at some
points weren't composed enough. We turned the ball over, and our time for
opportunities to kind of chip into the lead a little bit and then let them
score again. So it was a defensive effort along with the turnovers.  
  
Q. Can you talk about where you build from this and how do you look ahead in
the next couple of years?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think we have a good core coming back. Obviously, losing our
three seniors is a huge hit to us. Two starters with names like Morgan
Johnson, Jaime Printy, that's not going to be easy to fill, but I think we
really have some good people to come back and build off of, a lot of
experience still coming back, and we're a team that's willing to work really
hard. We work really hard all the time: Preseason, postseason, during the
season, in the summer. So we just have to keep that attitude and build on what
we have.  
  
Q. Lisa, can you talk a little bit about how much potential Samantha has
over the next two years to grow as a player?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, she's had the advantage of being able to come in here and
be a starter since her freshman year, and I think that's a real advantage to
just have that experience to come in here and play. She's been able to play in
three NCAA Tournament games now, I think that's going to be tremendous for
her. This year I think her leadership, she deferred a little bit off of the
floor, and rightfully so, to our seniors, and next year she's going to have to
pick up some of the slack there, become more of an off‑court leader, a vocal
leader, as well as an on‑floor leader.  
So I think the future‑‑ and I know Sam turned the ball over too many times
tonight, but I love having her lead our team, and I have full confidence in
her leading our team the next two years.  
  
Q. We talked about how balanced Notre Dame was. But just talk about how
tough it was to guard someone like Kayla McBride? It seemed when you guys got
a run, she always had an answer. And it just seemed that you cut it to six or
you cut it to eight, she would hit a couple of big three ‑pointers at the end?
  
COACH BLUDER: In the first half, that was the case. She had 24 points in the
first half. We held her to four in the second half. So a little bit better job
there. So, yeah, she got loose for too many shots, especially in the zone. She
had three threes in the zone, once again Player in the first half. And she
wasn't shooting that great from three‑point range coming into this game, but
we proved to everybody that she certainly is somebody that needs to be
reckoned with outside there.  
Yeah, every time we kind of got it close in the first half, she'd come up with
a big score in the second half. Got stagnant, and then they scored from the
free‑throw line way too much in the second half for us.  
  
Q. Now that you've spent a long weekend with Notre Dame and seen them up
close twice. I wonder if you could assess their National Championship
chances?  
COACH BLUDER: I think they're tremendous. That's what I told the team after
the game is that it was a great season for us. Don't hang your head about this
loss. Everybody seems to always remember your last game. It's not right
sometimes to always remember your whole season by one game.  
But I told them, we lost to a great team out there today, a team that's
probably going to be playing in the National Championship game. They have such
great balance. They have really good teamwork. They pass the ball really well,
and probably don't get enough credit for their defense. I think their defense
really bothered us, especially their pressing. They kind of set the tone with
that. Their ball pressure was very good. Their help side defense was very
good. They're not that tall, but they do a good job fronting and providing
help side.  
So I think that they have a great team that plays well together and they have
all the components. Don't have that huge center, but they make up for it.  
  
Q. What did you say to the seniors as they came out?  
COACH BLUDER: There is not a lot of time when they're coming to the bench
there. I told Jaime not to cry. She started to do that. But I just feel
appreciative of everything they've done for us in the last four years.  
  
Q. What is your view of the Iowa future after this tournament and this
season?  
COACH BLUDER: You certainly hate to lose those three seniors. Two of them are
starters for us. But at the same time, Bethany played really well for us
tonight. I think she showed signs of what she can do on a consistent basis.
That's when you go to Bethany. She's had these sporadic performances, but we
need consistent play out of Bethany. And hopefully we'll get that out of her
this summer and next year, because I think she's got a lot of ability.  
Sam at point guard, great experience there, so I feel good. We're sitting good
at the point and the center position. Theairra had a nice game for us at
times, takes the ball hard for us and doesn't back down from anybody. So we
returned three starters, but you could almost say four starters with Melissa
Dixon coming back as well. So I feel good about what we have returning.  
  
Q. What was different about Bethany's play tonight? Was it just confidence?
Was she more open? What did she do differently to get you guys the big buckets
there?  
COACH BLUDER: Bethany has been like that most of the year. It's like she can
have some really, really good games, and then kind of hide for the next five
games. I think Bethany understood that we needed her tonight. She gets some
confidence. She hits a couple of those short corner shots and gets confidence,
and it's amazing what confidence can do for a kid. That's how you get on a
roll offensively.  
We just couldn't get Melissa on a roll tonight, and couldn't build the
confidence there. So I'm really happy with Bethany having the game that she
did tonight.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: We are thrilled to be here this morning. Had the opportunity to
work last night and that was a lot of fun for us. I just remind the team
before we came in here about, that was a great victory last night. That is a
team that beat Duke just two weeks ago, a team that beat Big Ten championship
Penn State. That was a really good win for our program.  
Really, really happy for our seniors, proud of our basketball team but also
proud of our fans. The Hawkeye fans were amazing last night. We had the
third‑best attended site in America of the 16 sites. Again, it was loud in
here. They were behind us. We could feel it. Their energy was wonderful, and
just looking for that same type of energy and atmosphere in here again
tomorrow night against Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Seven wins over ranked opponents this season, and you look at the way you
finished last night, clearly when you're on, you can pretty much play with
anyone. How do you bottle that and get that for 40 minutes like you'll
probably need tomorrow night?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think you're going to‑‑ you know, could be the last
game of your season. You don't want it to be. So if tomorrow doesn't get you
up for anything, nothing really would.  
Playing against a team like Notre Dame, obviously a great team and
nationally‑recognized for being a great team. Just you've got to be ready for
it. We had nothing to lose going to this game and we are just really excited
about the opportunity that we got.  
  
Q. Morgan, talk a little bit, right now Florida Gulf Coast, everybody is
talking about them because they are Cinderella and they have shocking people.
Do you ever think about how it might be good for your sport overall if you
guys could pull off a win over Notre Dame, because people would pay
attention.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think it's a great opportunity, looking at the bracket
yesterday, there was just four upsets in the bracket. Just for women's
basketball in general, it would just pull, draw the nation's eyes on us as a
program and women's basketball in general. So it's a great opportunity for us
to prove that women's basketball has something to give to this nation.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, you're veteran players, you played AU ball at
the highest levels. What's the different between the kind of elite teams, not
necessarily UCONN or Notre Dame, but the teams that make it to the Sweet16 and
make it to the Elite 8 and teams that just get in the tournament, what is that
next step? What do you see in those teams that are not there?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I would say playing for 40 minutes. You have to be able to
play 40 minutes. In a tournament, obviously it's March Madness and anything
can happen. You have to be ready for 40 minutes of basketball, and you have to
put your best game on, otherwise, you can go home.  
We have seen it in the men's tournament, two seeds have been knocked out and
one seed has been knocked out, so you just have to be ready and take every
possession like it's the most important one.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think we are consistent in fundamentals all the time. They
don't have to worry about boxing out because that is something that's a
sustained thing through their entire season. So just having those fundamentals
consistently are important to get them to the next level so they can focus on
other things.  
  
Q. Morgan, there's a difference in the rebounding numbers; can you talk
about how important the rebounding will be for you and how do you close those
numbers out?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think we just have to execute on boxing out, and I know
that's really always the answer, but going after the boards after you box out
and just being consistent with that and not having them let out, coming out
straight out the gate and letting them know we are here to battle and we are
going out on the floor with everything we have.  
  
Q. Sam, Notre Dame is a team that scored almost a hundred points the other
day. Do you want to play an up ‑and‑down game with them or try to slow it
down?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think we just have to play in control with whatever we
do. We are going to look to push when we can. You can't force anything too
much against them. Can't give them any extra opportunities. But I mean, if we
can push, we would like to. But you just have to be controlled, make them
work. Got to score within two, obviously; they can put up big numbers.  
  
Q. You pride yourself on having balance on the team and you look at Notre
Dame and they have players like Skylar and Jewell Lloyd, a freshman. How do
you have to counter their balance, as well? Seems that's going to be
definitely a challenge.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think that we just have to be‑‑ everyone has to be on point.
There can't be any let ups with who is on the floor. Just continuing to move
people in and out of the rotation with flawlessness and just everyone being on
point, because all of them are good. They play for Notre Dame and so all of
them have the ability to score and do good things.  
  
Q. In recent years, has there been a women's basketball upset that you guys
remember or that you kind of followed or got into it at all?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: No, not that I remember. I think it's a huge deal, even when a
No.1 gets knocked out, even if it's by a No.2, which technically isn't that
huge of an upset. The last two years have been the same through No.1 seeds
with those four teams up there. It does not happen very often in women's, and
I think I was telling somebody before, maybe Coach, but we need a little more
'Madness' in women's basketball, too, so why not start with us.  
  
Q. Seeing stuff on tape, what makes you think you can win this game?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: To be honest, I think we just have the ability to turn it on
when we play good teams. We normally play at the level of competition, and if
that happens that's going to be awesome for us. I just think that we have this
belief inside of us that we can do anything and that we can win this game, and
I think that is just belief in ourselves and in our program. It really just
gives us the ability to do amazing things.  
  
Q. Going with the same thing, how big or how good for women's basketball
would you guys be winning Tuesday?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I think it would be tremendous. Obviously for our program
it would be amazing. It would help in a variety of ways, but also I do think
it would be great for the sport of women's basketball. I think people want the
upsets. People get excited about the Florida Gulf Coasts and why not let them
get excited about the Iowa Hawkeyes after tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you talk about dealing with Notre Dame's balance offensively? And is
there a certain area you want them to shoot from? Do you want them to take a
lot of three ‑pointers?  
COACH BLUDER: It's impressive, their balance is something I really love
because it's something we try to stress in our basketball team and I think all
good basketball teams have that balance, have that inside‑outside attack. But
yeah, we would love to force them to take more outside shots. Yesterday I
think they had 56 paint points, and it's hard to win a game when you're giving
up that many high‑percentage shots.  
  
Q. Their only loss was at home against Baylor, so they have not lost on the
road, beat Connecticut twice at their place, at Tennessee. You're hosting; how
do you make it tough for Notre Dame to play here? Seems they are not rattled
on the road, so how do you try to get them rattled tomorrow?  
COACH BLUDER: Every streak comes to an end sometime. They have won 27 in a row
and that has got to get boring, doesn't it, for them?  
So you know maybe they will take it for granted. Maybe they will be in a
situation where, you know, they are highly favored‑‑ there's nobody in America
that's betting on the Iowa Hawkeyes except for those women that are in that
basketball locker room right now. But I told them, there's going to be a lot
of people cheering for them and behind them to win this game, because I think
everybody would like to see an upset like that.  
  
Q. They will go on a run and a spurt, and the teams that can stay
competitive seem to handle it better. How do you go about that, as far as time
‑outs or whatever, trimming down a big run by Notre Dame?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, you only have so many time‑outs that you can use. Yes,
that's the first thing you think of. But also, I think changing up your
defense, trying to change the looks that they are getting through changing
your defense has got to be the next thing, because you can't just keep burning
time‑outs. You're going to run out of those. Hopefully get a spark like
Melissa provided for us last night and getting the crowd into the game through
our own offensive production would also be really good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding and just how critical of an area that
will be tomorrow night?  
COACH BLUDER: We talked about that with our team and it is really one of the
keys in my opinion, because Notre Dame is such a good rebounding team and they
have a lot of people that hit the boards. Last night, we didn't do a very good
job on the rebound, but it didn't hurt us, because they didn't make us pay for
them. Tomorrow, Notre Dame is quite capable of making us pay for them. And so
we have got to make a conscious effort of boxing out, getting a body on
somebody.  
You know, last night, Wilson was a load to box out. She had us out‑weighed by
a lot and she was a tough, tough person to box out, and give her the credit
for doing a great job in there.  
  
Q. What's the difference between, say, a team ‑‑ it's the same thing I asked
these kids, between a team that makes the NCAA maybe or is on the verge of
making the NCAA, and the teams like Notre Dame that are sort of perennial
Sweet16 kind of teams, not necessarily like the elite teams, but that just can
make that extra step. What do you have to do to make that extra step?  
COACH BLUDER: I think it's consistency all year long, because if you're
consistent all year long, then you tend to get those top four seeds, and we
all know if we have those top four seeds, our ability to advance in the NCAA
Tournament is a lot stronger, a lot more likely.  
So I think just having that consistent play all year long gets you the higher
RPI and will get you the easier seed and get you the easier pass to the
Sweet16. Notre Dame certainly has that. I think that you have to have
consistently, in not only your wins, but I mean, they just score at an
unbelievable rate and they defend, too.  
So having both sides of that is excellent. They just have so many different
people that can score. But in my opinion, it's just having that consistent
output all year long in the win/loss column.  
  
Q. What did it mean last night for you guys to win first time in a couple
years in an NCAA Tournament game, but winning an NCAA Tournament game here at
home, what did it mean for you and the team?  
COACH BLUDER: And winning it big, too, that was pretty fun as well. Having the
opportunity to be able to enjoy the last couple of minutes and not sit on pins
and needles, but to enjoy it. It meant a lot to our players. Our seniors,
again, it gives them another opportunity to wear the Hawkeye uniform and play
in Carver‑Hawkeye Arena, and again, last night proved to us and Hawkeye fans
that we can do that.  
  
Q. If you're looking for the upset tomorrow night, how big a role will three
‑point shooting play?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, I think that we are going to have to find a way to score
with them. They just are explosive offensively, and so we have got to knock
down shots. We have got to hit those threes tomorrow. It's important for us to
be able to do that and we have to force them into taking more contested shots.  
If they get those type of paint points‑‑ yes, they are going to take some
threes and they are definitely going to make some threes, they have some good
three point shooters, but we would rather have them shooting from there with a
hand in the face than in the paint right now.  
  
Q. We talked about the good of the game and the good of the women's game.
Skylar has 300,000 Twitter followers, more than any male or female college
athlete. How has she been an ambassador to the women's game?  
COACH BLUDER: She's been a terrific ambassador. She's been the face of women's
basketball this year. It's great that we get that kind of coverage and that we
have somebody that embraces that role.  
You know, she's a tremendous player, but she also seems like she's a really
cool kid and a good human being and she's embraced that role of being that
star power for women's basketball this year. I think she has more security
here than Barack Obama when he comes, and that's okay for us, because we need
somebody like that in women's basketball.

### [Natalie Achonwa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21816)

### [Jewell Lloyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25261)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach McGraw does not have an opening statement so at this time
we will take statements for the student athletes.  
  
Q. July, maybe talk a little bit, as a 1 ‑seed, how do you maintain a focus
no matter who you play, and not so much overconfidence, but maintaining a
level, how do you guys do that?   
JEWELL LLOYD: I think we just had to focus on our goals and what we want to
accomplish. It's just another game for us. We focus like any other game and we
should be fine.  
  
Q. Natalie, could you talk a little bit about what it takes to be able to
handle the challenges of the road and the challenges of a quick turnaround?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: I think it's all about your mental approach and how you take
your day‑to‑day basis. We have a day in between to kind of refocus and look
forward to the next team in Iowa, and I think it's about how we take this day
and how we utilize this day. Coach does a great job of setting us up for it
and we'll look over it today and just kind of prepare for tomorrow.  
  
Q. And the challenges of the road?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Iowa has a home‑court advantage here, everyone knows that.
We've played a lot of great away games this year and I think it's just about
focusing on what we are going to do and how we are going to play, and just try
to take the crowd out of it.  
  
Q. In general, what challenges does Iowa provide?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Iowa has some post shooters and a big presence overall. They are
a smart team and run a motion offense. It's just about playing team defense
and it's like a shell drill (ph) for us, so making sure that we are sticking
true to our principles and playing great defense.  
  
Q. For either one of you, do you watch the other women's games, or when you
watch the men's, do you ever root for the underdog? You're a 1 ‑seed yourself
but do you get caught up and root for the underdog like anybody else?   
JEWELL LLOYD: You always want to watch a good game, really, and it's like
watching basketball and to see the outcome, that's basically all I've got for
that.  
  
Q. Natalie, I don't know if you've had a chance to look at Iowa, or if you
watched much of the game last night, what do you think of Morgan Johnson?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: They are very tall and lean. One plays back to the basket but
they work well together and work with their team and their motion. I think
it's just going to be about being physical. Iowa is physical and we are going
to play physical and it's just about who out‑thinks their opponent, basically.
Both are very smart teams and it's just who is a step ahead.  
  
Q. Jewell, you had Butler and Newsome yesterday and now a tandem of Printy,
Logic, Dixon; what do they challenge defensively compared to Tennessee
Martin?  
JEWELL LLOYD: They are all good guys and they can shoot the ball really well.
Logic is a good passer, so just containing the ball with her. So sticking to
our principles on our defense and we'll see where that takes us.  
  
Q. Tomorrow is an 8:30 game, it would be 9:30 your time. What do you do
during the day and how do you stay sharp for such a late game?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: I think we played some big Monday games this year, and we had
some late games already.  
It is a long day. Game days are always long days when you have a night game.
It's just about getting your feet up, resting, watching some film and just
spending some time relaxing and mentally preparing for the game. You don't
want to get too relaxed where you're sitting around all day; but just the same
approach we've had for other night games.  
  
Q. Jewell, on Sunday what did Coach talk to you about during the game about
identifying shooters and can that carry over to playing Iowa?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Talk and communication, making sure we find them in transition,
always have a hand up and like I say, stay with our principles on defense, and
it really comes down to our D that we always work on in practice and that will
transfer over in games.  
  
Q. Natalie, you had a nice milestone yesterday, 1,000 points in your career,
now that's kind of out of the way and keep your focus on each opponent?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Yeah, definitely. I didn't know I was that close though. It's
a great milestone to achieve and I'm blessed to be a part of that 1,000 Club
at Notre Dame. Now looking forward to the next game and kind of putting that
behind me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the offensive balance of this team and do you just
react to the way the game is going, or do you have some thoughts going into a
game on who is going to have some advantages when it comes to scoring?  
JEWELL LLOYD: I think if we just move the ball unselfish, we've got to be
smart with the ball and I mean, that's basically‑‑ stay true to our game plan
really.  
  
Q. This week everyone is talking parity and such with the men. Is the
women's game missing that a little bit do you think?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I thought you saw some minor upsets yesterday. But
overall, I think when you're playing on a neutral court, anything can happen.  
So I think in the men's game, there is a lot more parity than there is in the
women's game, but you saw that all year long, with who is No.1, the rotating
thing. Where in the women's game, the top five didn't really change much all
year long. But I do want to go on record saying that I did not hope (ph) for
any 16 seeds in the first two rounds.  
  
Q. You built this program, and there were times when the program was not the
kind of program that was sort of automatically put into the Sweet16 and the
Elite 8. What's the difference now between teams that almost always are making
the Sweet16 and the rest of the field?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think success of the program is judged on how you do
in the NCAA Tournament. We have been to ten Sweet16s and I think we were a
good program, but I don't think we got the notoriety that we would expect
until we got to the Final Four back‑to‑back.  
So four Final Fours and I think finally, our program is on an elite level. I
think it takes that really to get the respect from the people in the country.  
  
Q. (No mic).  
COACH McGRAW: They have to be better. I think our recruiting has definitely
changed and we are getting more McDonald's All‑Americans on our team. You have
some special players like you have with Skylar, but you have to have good
players around them like Kayla McBride and Jewell Lloyd and Natalie Achonwa,
you have to continue the recruiting, that's the rough part of the program, you
have to continue. It's a job that's 24/7, 12 months a year, never ends, you go
from one class to the next, and you have to continue to bring in elite level
players in order to sustain that.  
But for us, it's always been about chemistry more than talent, and there are
some top players in the country that we don't really want on the our team.  
We want them to fit in and play well together and be unselfish and
team‑oriented. So for us, it's a lot more about the fit of the player than
where they are ranked.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a little time to digest yesterday's game, what was
your evaluation of that, and I guess overall, where your team is now in
reference to trying to make a run here?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, offensively, we were on. We shot the ball extremely well.
Eight turnovers in the game, and you know, I thought it was a very good game
considering we had not played since, I think 11 days since our last game. I
thought we would be a little rusty but we really came out and looked sharp and
I was really pleased with that.  
Defensively our team defense has done a lot better. I think Butler had just an
outstanding day but still managed to hold them to 60 points and beat them by
30. Overall I was pleased with the rebound and the defense with the exception
of some individual parts on Butler.  
  
Q. You have a young lady who grew up nearby in Des Moines, can you talk
about Markisha, and what do you see for her in the future and her role with
your team and maybe her development, how it's gone?  
COACH McGRAW: She plays a really big role for us. She comes in behind Natalie,
she's playing some quality minutes. She played quite a bit in the BIG EAST
Championship game against Connecticut when Natalie got in foul trouble. She's
a steady presence in the lane, works extremely hard, wants to be very good and
she's very, very coachable and I think she's improving dramatically.  
She has been a defensive physical player for us. She's the best screener on
our team. The guards love playing with her because she sets a great screen.
She's the one that is not afraid to bang inside and I think she's got a really
bright future with us.  
  
Q. Just going off your question, is it more difficult to sustain being an
elite program rather than getting there? And do you see any up ‑and‑coming
programs, do you see challenging Connecticut yourselves, Stanford, Baylor,
etc.?   
COACH McGRAW: I think it is difficult to sustain. I think you get there‑‑ we
got there in 2001, and it took us a little while to get back. And you know, we
went to a few Sweet16s in there, but it wasn't quite the level we wanted it to
be at. So I think we are back there now because of our recruiting.  
And I think you are seeing a little bit of a changing of the guard. You know,
I think when teams are able to win at Connecticut and win at Tennessee, I
think you can see that the two marquis programs in women's basketball are
being challenged a lot more frequently now. And I think around the country,
with the leagues changing, I think that's going to change things. I think with
us going to the ACC, it will be interesting to see how the new conference, how
Connecticut fairs.  
I think the ACC will be a really strong league for us and hopefully that will
become the best league in women's basketball.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the evolution of this year's team? You had to
replace three starters from a year ago and you had three freshmen coming in
and another that had not played the year before, and a phenomenal growth from
the early part of the season, can you talk about the depth, the strength and
the quality of the team from top to bottom in the course of the season?  
COACH McGRAW: We have a lot of questions coming into the season, losing three
really good players, three starters, four seniors and two WNBA first rounds,
so we had a lot to replace. We started talking about that in April and what we
needed to do to replace them. Natalie has made great strides and we knew Kayla
McBride was going to be a great player but having an All‑American year has
really solidified her spot nationally.  
But you have freshmen coming in that are untested, they are great players in
high school but you don't know how they will react at the college level, this
level especially. Lloyd had a phenomenal season, Rookie of the Year, one of
the best in the country. Michaela Mabrey, surprise player, injury last year
that did not allow her to play as a freshman, gave us great minutes and
continues to give us great minutes. Michaela gave us great minutes off the
bench.  
So our freshmen continued quite a bit along with Ariel Braker, an unsung hero
to us. I think our players have really developed throughout the year, they
have gotten better and more confident and I think we are growing as a team.  
  
Q. Will it take another generation of kids for the women's game to be where
the men's game is?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't think you see many game‑changing players. I think in the
women's game, there's a few at the top that can come in, but you know, you
look at Connecticut, the No.1 recruiting class in the country, Jefferson, No.2
player in the country, Top‑10 player‑‑ it takes a while to adjust to the
college game.  
You have to be a really special player to come in and make a significant
contribution as a freshman, and I think the number of players that can do that
nationally is pretty small. So, yes, I think it will take another generation.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, this is kind of the scenario you didn't want was
playing a home team in the second round. What are the pitfalls of that for you
guys?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think we've been road‑tested and we're battle‑tested. We
are undefeated on the road, so that's kind of the message we are sending our
team in going to Connecticut.  
We have gone to a lot of tough places on the road. So we know what that's
going to be like. The crowd is going to be against us and there are going to
be a lot of people cheering against us. You would hope that we get some Notre
Dame fans out there to balance that out, but we're ready to go.  
  
Q. What can you say about the balance of Iowa? You had Samantha Logic
yesterday had a double ‑double, Melissa Dixon had a couple of three‑pointers
to get them back in the game; what can you say about the balance of Iowa and
is that going to be a challenge for you guys?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, Samantha Logic had maybe the best game of her season so
far, double‑double. That's a fantastic accomplishment for a guard to have, and
she played extremely well. She's the key to their team. Her assist to turnover
ratio is impressive.  
She runs the team, she's a part player and makes them better. I think she is
definitely somebody that's a challenge for us. You know, Printy and Dixon,
great three‑point shooting ability and so you have to go out and guard on the
perimeter. And then you have the inside presence.  
So they have got a really good balanced team. I don't think you can leave
anyone to go double anyone else. I think you have to really play them straight
up. So I think it's a challenge for us defensively.  
  
Q. Skylar was just warming up stretching yesterday and fans from Iowa and
Miami took pictures of her stretching. She has 300,000 Twitter followers. What
has she meant overall to the game in general?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's the face of women's college basketball and it's
been great for women's basketball, because we are attracting a fan base that
we've had ever had before: People in the entertainment industry are watching
our games. The casual fan is now tuning in to see what Skylar is going to do.
She's got the headband nation following her.  
I think she's done great things for the game and I think the WNBA team that
drafts her is going to hit the jackpot because they will see a rise in ticket
sales, communities, wherever they go. Every game we went to this year, we
probably set an attendance record for most of the players we went because
people just want to see Skylar, and she gets a bigger cheer from the opponents
than anybody. Usually you would expect some boos in that but she really is
very well respected nationally and it's been a great thing for women's
basketball.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  69  
MIAMI - 53

  
COACH MEIER: Well, I think I jinxed them in the press conference, when you
asked me the key to Iowa and I said Samantha Logic, because, boy, she must
have heard that. She was phenomenal.  
I don't sugarcoat much and I think it was a shockingly poor performance by us,
on the offensive end, just shockingly poor. And when I saw that, I'm trying to
compliment my team because we were just clicking and so confident and so great
in the time we had off together and just really felt like we solved a lot of
our issues.  
So I'm shocked in a very positive way. Disappointed for them but just can't
believe our percentages, even today in the shoot around, we shoot over 80
percent on the free throw drill we did and can he aim out and didn't get over
50 in crucial moments.  
I have a lot of faith in this team, and I'm really disappointed. But I can
tell you, Iowa has got some basketball players, basketball players, they play
basketball, they are composed. The ball means more to them than it means to
us, and that's a heck of a compliment to them. Their guards controlled the
game the whole game. They were strong with the ball.  
We were very loose with the ball and we were staring at Pepper, like, that was
our offense and I thought she responded to that call. But we're more than
that, and that's why I'm so disappointed and shocked.  
But you know, I don't want to take anything away from Iowa offensively. A lot
of their defensive game plan caused us to hesitate and get on our heels and
really not be the aggressive, quick‑strike team that we need to be in the
first half of our offensive possession. So very, very, very disappointed and
just really, like I said, shocked.  
  
Q. You were able to work the ball inside early in the first half, did you
feel like you had gotten some control or had the momentum then? And then what
changed in the second half? Why were you unable to get inside?  
SHAWNICE WILSON: I did feel like I had control. I just felt like we went away
from what was working and I was getting the ball inside. Just kind of working
through our offense, I think we went away from that. I think that's like the
main thing. But I felt like I had control inside.  
  
Q. Morgan, Coach mentioned that their defense caused you fits. What was it
about them that kind of threw off your offensive game?  
MORGAN STROMAN: We just weren't being aggressive, the aggressive team we
normally are on offense and that shut us down and we needed to score.  
  
Q. Defensively, you guys were pretty strong the first half and it seemed
like they were having a little trouble there with your athleticism, but in the
second half, they got open for threes, particularly Dixon made three in a row
in a short period of time. What changed? Did they do anything differently than
they did the first half or did they just execute better?  
MORGAN STROMAN: No, they still played their game. We knew that they had great
shooters and we were open and they were able to hit them.  
  
Q. You said a minute ago that the ball meant more to them than it meant to
us. You did out ‑rebound them, I think by 16; was that what you were talking
about or was it just loose balls? Elaborate more on that.   
COACH MEIER: Well, 24 turnovers, and I didn't see a press. We just really were
very loose and very much‑‑ I thought our guards spent a lot of time with their
shoulders, one shoulder to the rim instead of two shoulders to the rim. So we
played a lot of perimeter reversals and didn't really get a piece of the
paint. We are good at that.  
They had two guards that had 36 points and we had two post that is had 30.
That was the game. I thought our interior defense was phenomenal with Johnson,
but we know that was it. Our two posts probably had to have more than 15 each
for us to win it, if that's how it was rolling with us. And I think in usual
times, we were just about to get a great look inside and we were a little
careless with the ball, passing on our heels. It really hurt us.  
Then we had so many‑‑ we had 25 offensive rebounds and only turned into 17
second‑chance points. That's almost hideous. I mean, you've got to get those
balls and you've got to put them back in. It can't be‑‑ 25 offensive rebounds
has to be at least 25 points.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Melissa Dixon coming out, two three ‑pointers?   
COACH MEIER: Well, you know, that's what she does and I just think that's one
of the more dangerous people coming off the bench in the country because of
her mental toughness. She can just come in cold, come off the bench cold and
strike you down.  
I have high regard for their mental toughness and high regard for the IQ of
their guards. This matchup, like I said, I really thought it would come done
to their guards handling our pressure and getting a little bit free and
hitting down a antibiotic time shot and how many points could we get in the
paint to counteract that. That's what I thought it would come down to.  
I'm really pleased with our rebounding numbers. I mean, we really did that
part, Part A; but we didn't turn that into success Part B, and they did. They
got an open three in a crucial moment, they hit it and that's a huge credit to
them and their coaching staff. They did a great job.  
  
Q. I noticed Iowa's changed defenses several times, man, 2 ‑1‑2 and a
different zone in there, too. I'm sure you expected that but did that disrupt
your offense any?   
COACH MEIER: I mean, I guess you could say yeah, I wasn't upset‑‑ I wasn't
like rattled by it or anything, but maybe the rhythm. They did a nice job
picking their spots there. But you know, we had our vision. We had vision. It
wasn't‑‑ it didn't feel like our vision was taken away and that's why we lost
our composure. Perhaps a matter of our timing.  
Just want to say, did a great job, Iowa hosting this event, just big‑time
classy place, classy environment, great administration. Thank you for having
us.

NOTRE DAME  97  
UT MARTIN - 64

  
COACH McMILLAN: I thought that the game was ‑‑ and I don't know, I don't have
the running total thing. In the first half, there was about four minutes to go
maybe, I don't remember, it was about a 6‑point game and Notre Dame had to go
to a triangle in two because they couldn't guard these guys. I thought that
was a tremendous tribute to what these two are able to do.  
But you know, they are a great team, and we got killed on the glass. Rickiesha
got hurt; just slaps you in the face because she's the only one that we had
that could go in there and try to rebound with us. I think that we may have
set an NCAA record on rebound margin.  
But it was‑‑ once we kind of lost control of what we were trying to do,
couldn't get it back. And we talk all the time about three possessions is
going to be a game, and the three possessions were when they had to go man
because they couldn't guard these guys and went to a triangle. And when we
couldn't get back, it just kind of snowballed from there.  
But I thought that Notre Dame's quickness bothered us, I thought their size
bothered us, and I thought that there was some problems that we couldn't
simulate that we didn't have much of an answer for.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what a game like this means against Notre Dame? I
think it was one point shy of an all ‑time record for an opponent against
Notre Dame.   
HEATHER BUTLER: Well, it definitely meant a lot, because coming in here,
everybody is like, who is UT Martin, nobody knows who we are. And going
against the No.1 seed team, you want to come out here and prove that, you
know, we can play with Notre Dame, and we are just going to give it all we got
and that we are a team with heart that plays hard.  
Coming out here, they are a very good basketball team, obviously, and I think
what Coach said, we got destroyed on the glass, that's what killed us. But I
think it definitely meant a lot and we definitely learned a lot from this
experience.  
  
Q. What did you do going in after the first couple of minutes? The size
seemed to affect you and then you adjusted. What did you do to adjust to
improve?  
HEATHER BUTLER: Well I'm used to going against bigger guards, but bigger,
athletic and quicker‑‑  
COACH McMILLAN: Everybody is bigger than you.  
HEATHER BUTLER: As I said, I'm used to it (laughter). But obviously what I was
doing wasn't working.  
And so I had to just tell myself, okay, relax, just take your time, go in
there and if you have a shot, shoot it. And if not, kick it out. I finally
relaxed. I was kind of like a little too tense in the beginning, all over the
place, but finally I told myself, okay, if it's there, shoot it.  
  
Q. When you're banking in threes, do you feel like that you're on your game
then as far as shooting?  
HEATHER BUTLER: Yeah, I mean, it feels good when the backboard helps you out a
little bit. Like I said, I just shot it with confident and I mean, like I
said, if the backboard helps you out, it is kind of a good shooting night.  
  
Q. Coach referenced about four minutes ago, you were down by seven, what
happened in those last four minutes?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: We wasn't getting back like we normal lay was in the game but
then they would take a shot and miss it and they would get the rebound and put
it back in. That's mainly what happened. That's what I thought happened.  
  
Q. When you were banking those shots in, think the first one that went off
glass, I don't know if you realized, but you gave like a Michael Jordan shrug
and smiled; did you realize you were doing that at the time?  
HEATHER BUTLER: When I banked it in, yeah, kind of like: Hey, I mean, what can
I say. I mean, like I thought it was completely off. I thought it was going to
break off and go out‑of‑bounds but it didn't, so it kind of shocked me, so
that was my reaction to it (smiling and shrugging shoulders).  
  
Q. You and Skylar are usually the top scorers in the game. How did it feel
to keep her down around your level, because you were a low scorer in this
game, too.  
JASMINE NEWSOME: I really didn't think about it that much. But going into it
we were just saying keep her and No. 21 from scoring and make somebody else
score, so that was our goal. I'm pretty proud that we did that but at the same
time, we didn't rebound very well.  
  
Q. When one or the other of you is on, maybe is making a lot of shots, do
you try to really work hard at setting the other one up? Were you really
trying to get Heather the ball because she was knocking them down?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: Yeah, basically. Most of our plays are ran through one of us,
and if one of us is on, that's who is going to get the ball the most. We
usually feed off each other but today I was kind of slow and she was on.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what Heather did out there today against
a team that's been pretty reputable on defense this season?  
COACH McMILLAN: Well, anybody that watched this game, Heather, I think we list
her at 5‑5 or 5‑6\. She's not; she's about 5‑4 or 5‑3, and what that young
lady does is absolutely amazing. I was fortunate to get to coach her in high
school. I was fortunate that she followed me to UT Martin and I'm fortunate
every day I get to be around her.  
You said something about the banked shots going in. I don't know if she's
banked one all season. But one of the things that I know is that when you do
things right and you do them right and you do them right, things tend to
happen good for you.  
And you know, you would think banking a shot, she's not on; and that when she
banked the first one, I said, we are going to start throwing her the ball
because she'll be mad at herself because she banked it and she'll start
putting them in, and she did.  
You know, the challenge that she has every game, is amazing, and you know,
Notre Dame is no different. The thing that I do know is that she sees that
challenge all the time, and she kind of relishes in the opportunities. She's
one of those rare kids that looks at situations and says: What can I do to be
my best in whatever given situation I've gotten. And she got an opportunity to
play against All‑Americans, and I would think‑‑ (looking down at stat sheet) I
can't see, I apologize. I'm getting what happens at 45 years old. I would
think, 37 points, pretty good day against a No.1 seed.  
You know, the thing about those two is that Jasmine is going to be the one
that is the most he excited for her. So really, she put on a little show, and
I wish we could have had some rebounding help to maybe change some of the
outcome of some of those plays.  
  
Q. Was it strictly a height issue on Notre Dame's part as far as the
rebounding is concerned, or were there some other factors that played into
that?  
COACH McMILLAN: Well, I think the first thing was that Rickiesha sprained her
ankle in the first six minutes of the game and she averages about 12‑‑ well,
she's been averaging about 11 or 12 rebounds a game for us over the last ten
games, and she's also our biggest kid in there that will disrupt the other
team just because of her size. So when she went out, we were not a little
worried, we were a lot worried.  
But what Notre Dame is, people don't give them enough credit for, they are
long. You know, their wing span is a lot longer than their height. They are
not a big team, but their arms are so long that they get to stuff that they
are not supposed to get to, and they are so athletic that it's hard to keep
people in front of you.  
And you're just talking about great basketball players that see things that
you don't see and put you in situations where you have to help and where you
have to help, and now they have a rebounding advantage and they are going to
take advantage of that. It's a snowball.  
I'm disappointed that our kid didn't battle more on the boards. I would have
expected more fouls on boxing out or more fouls going up for second shots or
stuff like that. Would have expected it. But I didn't get it except for my
little 5‑6 guard that comes in.  
So I'm a little disappointed in our post for not giving it more of a battle.
But they are a great rebounding team and they have always been a great
rebounding team because of their athleticism and they are so deceptive. They
get to stuff that you don't think they will get to, what, eight alley‑oops in
the game, that's pretty good.  
  
Q. You said yesterday inside was going to be a struggle but obviously you
had faith in the guards, but could you have even imagined a game that Heather
had today, 37 points like that?  
COACH McMILLAN: Well, I wouldn't have expected‑‑ I'm going to be mad at her
because she missed three free throws. She could have had 40. We have to have
that game from our two guards, we have to, because that's what we are built
around.  
The matchup for us was a nightmare because there wasn't a player on the Notre
Dame team that we thought we could take a lot of advantage from, and so I
thought that Butler and Newsome were going to have to have monster games in
order for us to be able to compete, and they did that.  
And somebody said it, I guess four minutes to go, it's a 6‑point game, and
they went to a try anal and we missed four straight wide open shots that kids
have to make, and they went down and scored. And I thought that that kind of
turned the whole tied of the game.  
But you know, to think that those two guards could go out as a 16 seed and
combine for 52 points and one of them get 37, you can't ask any more. What
that says is that I need to fire my recruiting coach, whoever recruits
rebounders, and we need to find somebody that can go get on the glass, and we
have got to find some people that can make some more shots. You can't get into
a 1‑16 matchup and expect much different, because of the way‑‑ the culture
that we are in.  
And I thought that there were some things that needed to go differently that
didn't. Some of my predictions were correct. It's just, you've got to play
yourselves out of this game in the middle of the season, and that's what we
didn't do this year.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  69  
MIAMI - 53

  
COACH BLUDER: I'm just really happy for this basketball team. They wanted this
win. Our fans were terrific today. They came out and supported us and we
really fed off that, especially in the second half. I thought it got very loud
in there.  
Sam Logic, I mean, she really was extraordinary today. Again, there's not many
point guard in the country that are going to average double‑double with
rebounds and points.  
Melissa Dixon was a great spark off of the bench for us again in the second
half. First half we kind of had some unusual lineups in there with some foul
trouble and we withstood that and we also withstood their 25 offensive
rebounds, which was kind of tough to swallow. But when you look at how many
points they scored off those offensive rebounds, you can see they only scored
17, and we scored 15 points off the offensive rebounds, so in the end it
wasn't that much of an advantage for them.  
Very, very proud of our basketball team and excited to be able to stand and
play again on Tuesday night in Carver‑Hawkeye Arena.  
  
Q. Sam, after Coach Meier's comments about needing to stop you yesterday,
did you feel kind of responsible to take the game into your hands tonight?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I don't think to take it into my own hands, just to be
composed and not let whatever they are going to try to throw at me rattle me.  
Obviously I have a great team around me and they can't just focus on one
person, as I said, and it just ended up that it was me tonight‑‑ that you
can't stop anyone, and anybody could end up being the leading scorer and it
just ended up being me today.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about staying composed when they got very helter ‑skelter there
in the first half and maybe you were the one calming influence. Talk about
your role in that, how did you prepare?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: That's what the role of a point guard is, just being the coach
out on the floor, being the director of everything. When it was going like
that, you just had to take a deep breath. We had the home crowd, we were not
playing well, we had foul trouble in the first half and only down one. We just
really had to stay in the game and pull away at the end. But ending the first
half well, like Coach said, different lineups that we are not used to was
really big.  
  
Q. Melissa, it seemed like your guys really took off when you hit those
threes early in the second half. Halftime, you had no points, two fouls and
three turnovers and somehow you were able to turn that around. Talk about that
stretch, about a minute and a half where the game really changed.  
MELISSA DIXON: I was really rested going into the second half (laughter) we
ran our set plays really well. They switched on a couple of the screens and
allowed me to be open and my teammates made some really good passes to me.  
  
Q. Talk about that a little. How do you find that ‑‑ how did you find it?   
MELISSA DIXON: You just have to have a short memory and you just have to know
the next one is going in and to have that confidence that the next one was
going in, and I was able to do that in the second half. And my teammates also
had a lot of confidence in me, so that helps a ton.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about the confidence this team has facing a team that tries to
press you?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, it's really helpful, you can't really, again, key in on
one person that‑‑ we have Jaime, B and Melissa, we can all bring it up and or
when Patricia came in or Kathy came in and played some big minutes in the
first half; just to be able to guard that is difficult. Instead of having one
person that you rely on to bring the ball up, like we can run and do our
offense through anyone, so that's really huge.  
  
Q. This is for Sam or Melissa. When you are the home team and you've got the
crowd, could you guys feel a little bit that that crowd was waiting for
something to happen and maybe when Melissa hits the shots, then they can
finally let loose; could you guys sense that?  
MELISSA DIXON: Definitely, we had the best fans. Our Hawk fans are incredible
and to be able to play on our home court was so huge and they were behind us
the whole time so that really helped I think.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, definitely in the first half, we just tried to get back
into it more. When we started off the game, they were great and then we let
the lead get away from us a little bit.  
But going into halftime and coming out in the second half, you really want to
start strong and that gives you a little bit of momentum and gets the crowd
into it, too.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Melissa, her output there, you guys were down seven,
did you feel that the game was starting to slip a little bit before she caught
fire a little bit?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It was pretty early in the second half still, so it wasn't
slipping in our minds. We just knew we had to get our defensive stops. We ran
our sets, like Melissa said, really well and we had the utmost confident in
her coming in even though not playing a lot in the first half, to do what she
does best.  
Knocked them down definitely got the crowd back into it. It never felt like it
was slipping away or anything, especially when you have shooters like her on
your team.  
  
Q. Sam or Melissa, any preliminary thoughts on your matchup Tuesday with
Notre Dame and the challenges going up against them?  
THE MODERATOR: Sam, we'll start with you.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, you think about it a little bit, seeing them win before
we did. But obviously before the game, we were focused on Miami. Now we get to
think about it a little bit more.  
Again, we have a home game. Hopefully have a great crowd behind us again. But
we have no expectations or no pressure on us, I don't think, having a team of
that calibre on your home floor is just something to gain from.  
MELISSA DIXON: I think we all think that we don't have anything to lose and we
have this incredible opportunity to have Notre Dame come play on our home
court. So that helps a lot.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a game where you had 53 rebounds on you?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, for us to get out‑rebounded by that margin and still find
a way to win, I feel very good‑‑ I don't feel good about the rebounds but I
feel good that we found a way to win despite that, even though the heavy
rebounding advantage for them.  
But it is amazing they have 25 offensive rebounds and only have 17 points
where we have 14 offensive rebounds and 15 points. So it really did not turn
into that much of an advantage for them, even though they were ‑‑ obviously we
don't want to give up that many offensive rebounds.  
Good commercial, Bob, that's on the air right now.  
  
Q. What were you doing defensively to disrupt what they wanted to do?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I hope we had something to do with it. I think our zone
spread it out, getting hot hands, made them make some cross‑court passes that
they really didn't want to do and I think it took some time off the clock for
them.  
I'm extremely happy that we have 16 turnovers and they have 24 turnovers. I
thought coming in, we kept hearing, defense, defense, and then we kind of
turned the table on that as far as the turnover area.  
  
Q. What was the big difference in the second half?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, you know, we got down seven and then Melissa Dixon came to
play. You know, she has three threes in a minute and a half, I believe, during
that stretch. And then Jaime Printy got one from not far down the time line
there.  
You know, we had an 18‑point swing I believe in six minutes and when we hit
some of those threes, it really got us going. I think that's when the crowd
did get into it.  
Somebody asked that earlier, but I think when Melissa hits those threes and we
are down seven and all of a sudden she hits two threes and we are down one, I
think this place was ready to go and they got behind us and I think then we
were just on a roll.  
  
Q. Can you talk about winning an NCAA Tournament game on your home floor,
does that feel good after five years ago you couldn't do it?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it feels really good. You know, any time you win a game,
it's great. You win at home, it's special. You win in the NCAA Tournament,
it's amazing. And it's amazing for our seniors.  
Those three seniors get to play another game in Carver‑Hawkeye Arena and that
means a lot to them. So I'm glad for those three seniors that they get another
opportunity to suit up and come out the tunnel in Carver.  
  
Q. What about Notre Dame?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I have really not looked forward to them. I've always
been‑‑ my philosophy, one game at a time, and I have assistants that do that
for me and they will have a report for me when I get up there.  
But I'm not a person that looked ahead so I have not watched any film on them
and I am probably the only person in America that has not seen them a whole
lot on TV. They have been on TV in the Bluder house, but I have also been
doing homework with my children and doing dishes and things like that when
they are on, so I really haven't sat and analyzed them.  
  
Q. This is kind of off the game, but in this year, prime example, you don't
see the upsets early on; why is that? Is it because you're playing on home
court?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, there are 15 home court sites this year, so there are
quite a few. But I don't think that's any different than what we've had in the
past. We have always had kind of significant home courts. You know, there's
not‑‑ you know, there's just not as much parity in women's basketball as there
is in men's basketball right now, and that's unfortunate.  
And you know, until we get the parity‑‑ and it's getting better. Because it
used to be, you could talk about three teams that were going to make it to the
Final Four and you knew those. Now, hey, we are talking about eight or ten
that could possibly make it, and I think that's good.  
But yeah, we need to get the parity between the ten to 50, would be really
nice.  
  
Q. A couple times after you got that lead, Miami got it down a little bit.
What did you tell the team to keep that going, keep building?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we got it down to nine at one time after we got a
significant lead. We talked about the team, they are going to come out and
press and they are going to start changing up the defense and doing some traps
in the full court and bring up the intensity on the defense.  
So just keeping our composure against them and we said three frees, defense,
box out and obviously didn't help work too well, but taking care of the ball.
Those were the three keys in the last, eight, ten minutes for us and in my
opinion was keep playing the defense, keep trying to box out, and let's just
take care of the basketball.  
  
Q. I know you probably weren't paying too much attention to what else is
going ton in the tournament, but that's now six Big Ten teams that are in the
second round, about as many men's teams that advanced. The men get a lot of
press obviously and talk about how strong they are, but how strong can you
speak to is the women's side of the Big Ten?  
COACH BLUDER: And you're telling me that all six of our Big Ten teams won in
the first round for women? That's tremendous. So six teams stand in the Final
32.  
You know, this year, we were the second‑best rated team in the conference, or
in America, and I think this kind of proves that. Obviously we'd like to move
it up a notch, but very, very happy with the success. It has to be the best
success that we've had in the NCAA Tournament for the Big Ten Conference,
that's tremendous.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

NOTRE DAME 97  
UT MARTIN - 64

  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Butler had probably the best individual game anybody's
had against us all year long. She was phenomenal, 37 points. We went to the
triangle too late in the first half to try to contain her for a little bit. I
think we slowed her down for four minutes but she played extremely well. What
a great performance by her.  
I was really pleased with our offensive play today. I felt we got great
balance in the scoring column with Natalie Achonwa, Jewell Lloyd, getting
their career high, Kayla McBride getting a double‑double. Really pleased what
we were able to do offensively. Shot the ball extremely well. I thought we got
a lot of good shots, a lot of good layups and attacked their zone very
efficiently.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk a little about today's game? It seemed like you
scored every possible way there was to score. Can you just talk about what you
took advantage of out there?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Think we are a very unselfish team and we move the ball really
well and we find the open person, so I moved and cut and we had great passers
and they found me right under the basket and my shots would just fall in.  
  
Q. For any of the players; they got within four points of you guys twice in
the first half there, and then you just sort of jetted away from them, what
was the difference there?  
THE MODERATOR: Kayla, will you tackle that one?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think it was just getting our transition game going, and it
started on defense. They missed a couple shots and they got our transition
game going and getting easy layups.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about the accomplishment of reaching the 1,000
‑point mark for your career? And second, just talk about the rebounding margin
today.   
NATALIE ACHONWA: I'm really happy to have the opportunity to reach 1,000
points. I didn't even know until someone told me after the game.  
And in terms of rebounding, I think that was one of the things we wanted to
take advantage of. We wanted to make sure that we picked up as many offensive
rebounds as we could, as well as on the defensive end. I know K‑Mac had a
double‑double so she did a great job on cutting even from the three‑point, to
get a couple rebounds.  
  
Q. Kayla, just talk about trying to guard Butler? I know you were one of the
players ‑‑ how frustrating that was, she banked in two three‑pointers, she had
a four‑point play; can you talk about what that was like to try to slow her
down?   
KAYLA McBRIDE: She's the top scorer in the nation for a reason. She can score
in a lot of different ways. She's very quick off the ball screen and she knows
when to pull up and when to shoot the three and when to go all the way to the
basket. She's a great player. We had a lot of trouble with her as everyone
saw. So you know, give her a lot of credit, she plays hard and she's just a
great player.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Jewell did out there today, alley ‑oops,
3‑pointers, put backs, all the different ways she can score?   
KAYLA McBRIDE: Yeah, I think Jewell can score in pretty much any way possible.
She knows when to cut. She's learning. She's a quick learner. She can hit the
three. She can shoot the pull‑up. She's a bigger guard and she can post
smaller guards up. She can score in a lot of different ways. She is moving
without the ball, cutting, getting offensive rebounds, she did it all. I think
she had a really strong game tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about, obviously Butler goes off with this monster game
and yet you guys still win by 33 and there was really never a point in the
second half where the game was in doubt. Can you just talk about how good your
team is that despite this monster effort of hers, you were able to win pretty
decisively.  
JEWELL LLOYD: We just had to stay together and when we come together as a
team, we play really strong and defensively. You know, talk and communication
is always a big thing. We get better at talking and stuff like that, but we
played really a tough defense and stay together‑‑ I think, you know, we can be
one of the best teams around.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding today, just having a margin like
that?  
COACH McGRAW: Huge, 49‑14, honestly I didn't even see the numbers until
afterwards. I knew we were doing a pretty good job. I thought offensively we
really went after it. Aerial Braker I thought did a really nice job inside.
You know, I think that we're capable of getting to the back board and boxing
out, and I thought we did a really good job defensively. They only got five
offensive rebounds and so that was definitely one of our goals tonight. Really
pleased with that.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate a little bit about Jewell Lloyd, career high, and just
the different ways she can score?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, you go into your first NCAA Tournament game and you
wonder how the freshman is going to do. You look back at her previous career
high against Baylor, and you think, she's definitely a gamer. I think she'll
be ready. But you never know if she's going to come out nervous, and she did
not. She had a phenomonal game.  
The thing she's going doing really well is moving without the ball, and that
is a hard thing for a freshman to learn. And she's really doing a great job of
cutting and moving when Sky has got it, and they are finding her around the
rim which is something that we want to take advantage of more.  
We worked on looking at her for the lob, especially against the 1‑3‑1 and I
thought we were really effective in that but she did a really good job
offensive rebounding, which she's really been working on that, as well.  
So I was really pleased with her overall effort and just how she didn't stand
around and settle for jumpers. She really went after the basket and I thought
she was really efficient.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Natalie reaching 1,000 points? And then can you talk
about McBride, she's really been on a tear here at the end of the season.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, Natalie, I was so happy for her to get her thousandth
point. Looked at that earlier in the season and wondered if it would happen in
the Tournament.  
She's doing a really good job of scoring around the basket. I think she's
looking to post up a lot more. She's rebounding more, offensive rebounding put
backs and doing a great job from the free throw line.  
So it's nice to get that out of the way, because I know that she knew she was
close, she didn't know how many she had, but it's nice to get that done so
that we can really focus on our next opponent.  
And Kayla McBride, she's an All‑American. She's playing great basketball.
She's played well all year long, very steady, very consistent and did it all
tonight, really happy, mostly with the rebounds for me, and that was the
biggest thing for her.  
  
Q. When you look at Jewell's game, 15 shots on the 27 points, some people
might look at Butler's 37 on 30 shots; but talk about her efficiency on the
offensive end.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, she really got great looks. She took two threes but the
rest of her shots were right around the basket. She's starting to use her
jumping ability. She's posting up a little bit more which is something we've
been working on with her, so if she can shoot the ball that efficiently, we
can get her the ball more and get her more shots.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 23, 2013

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Morgan Stroman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25234)

### [Stafanie Ydestrom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25235)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH MEIER: Everything that's been done in the history of the sport, really
neat for our players to understand the halfcourt, how it started, so we are
really embracing that. Very, very thrilled to be at such a classy site, so I
want to thank the university of Iowa and the NCAA committee for the bracket.  
Unfortunately we are a little bit used to playing on someone's home court and
it's not anything that is, you know, detriment. We love crowds. We love
playing in big moments, big games, and we have done it all year in the ACC.  
So we are ready for this. And we really feel, of all the teams, I think in the
nation, we have had a long time since we have played a game, but it's been
great for us. And sometimes I haven't felt that way in this position, waiting
so long to play an NCAA game.  
But this particular team, and my entire coaching career, I've not had a team
that wanted to get better so much. And every opportunity they wanted to get
better, they embraced, every practice: Coach, let's watch film; Coach can I
have time; Coach, give me something to work on; Coach, what can I do
differently in the NCAA Tournament that I wasn't doing all year. That's my
team. They missed a lot of their spring break, spent a lot of time together,
spent it in the gym and they have been happy.  
And so for me, I know that we have done our job in terms of we are ready to
play our best basketball of the year, and we know we have got a great opponent
ahead of us in the University of Iowa.  
  
Q. Morgan, what have you seen in Iowa's post play, specifically, Morgan
Johnson?  
MORGAN STROMAN: They have really nice size and they are versatile. They can
just come out and shoot a 16‑, 17‑foot jumper, and that's really all I've seen
on film. But we are just going to use our quickness to beat that.  
  
Q. How do you excel playing a low game in the tournament?  
STEFANIE YDERSTROM: I feel great about it. Like Coach says, playing in front
of a big crowd, and I'm just excited. I've never been to Iowa before, and it's
something different and that's what the NCAA Tournament is about. So, I'm
excited.  
MORGAN STROMAN: Same, as well. Just excited to be back playing. It probably
didn't really matter where we were playing. Just ready to play. No more
practice.  
I love practice, though, but, you know, just being out there on the court and
just my teammates, it's exciting to be back out there.  
  
Q. Coach Bluder has been pretty adamant the last few years about not liking
the time away between the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA. Seems like a lot of
the big conferences, including the ACC, do play that same weekend. You seem to
be embracing it; how come?  
MORGAN STROMAN: It's just time to get better. We have so much time off where
we can have our team chemistry and get better individually and just enjoy the
moment before we get in the game, but then you have that anxiety where you are
just so ready to play again.  
It has its ups and downs but it's time to get better as a player and as a
team.  
STEFANIE YDERSTROM: I agree, just embrace that opportunity to get better in
the tournament. Anything can happen so you have to get ready. You can't really
change it, so you might as well just make the best out of it.  
  
Q. Coach, Iowa has been a little streaky. In what you've seen, what is the
key when they are playing well?  
COACH MEIER: I can't tell you everything‑‑ Samantha Logic is critically
important. That Purdue game, they are unbeatable when she plays that way.  
I thought that was one of the best responses by a women's basketball team the
entire season where they had their backs against the wall, coming off a
five‑game losing streak, and just their demeanor, their mentality. They were
so determined to win that game, and that's what kind of launched them I think
into the postseason.  
I look for stuff like that. I have a ton of admiration for a coach and
coaching staff that can get their kids off the mat like that and get that
response, at Purdue. But that was by far her most incredible game of the year.
I think that's the first thing that jumps out at me is her play.  
  
Q. You've beaten Duke and Penn State; when you're playing well, what in
particular are you doing well?  
COACH MEIER: You know, details, communication and toughness, that's it. So we
have a young backcourt. We've been spoiled the four years prior; I knew who
had the ball and I didn't have to call many plays, or they made it on the fly.  
This year, it's been in the details and communication. Those things go hand in
hand, the communication, a quiet team is a certain is team, a loud team is a
certain team, and that's where we fluctuate and that's when we don't play well
versus we do play well.  
And then our toughness is just something that I think, you know, there's no
question in those particular games and games where we really, you know, let's
just say out before my ranking or something like that, we were tough as nails.  
  
Q. I think you have some ties to the University of Iowa, some siblings. Can
you explain that?  
COACH MEIER: I don't know if you want to know this‑‑ I wanted to come here. My
high school coach, he had to bring me in‑‑ I have two sisters‑‑ well, anyway,
I could give you a whole bio. But, Brady Bunch: Widow and widower got married,
eight of us, and two of them matched up as twins and they went through school.
I had two sisters that graduated that both came here and then I had a brother
that's two years older than me that came here.  
I spent a lot of time here. I did all the trips in the Van with mom and dad.
True story, my high school coach said: I think you're kind of good, because
some schools are looking at you, where do you want to go and I said,
University of Iowa, because I was so close with my family and I had so many
siblings. I was great at the time but probably wasn't good enough‑‑ I'm not
bitter‑‑ (laughter).  
  
Q. Who happened to be the coach at Iowa?  
COACH MEIER: Coach Stringer. I still have the letter‑‑ no, just kidding, I
don't. (Laughing).

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's been a great season for us so far. We're thrilled with the
No.1 seed. We had just so many great things happen for us this year, led by
these two right here, Skylar and Kayla McBride have had fantastic seasons and
now we're anxious for our second season to begin.  
  
Q. Skylar, first off, how are you feeling?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I'm fine.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you just talk a little bit about the challenge of playing
against smaller guards? How successful have you guys been against that this
year?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think we've come a long way for that. They're great guards.
They can create a lot on offense, and we have to be able to contain them, the
bigger guards, the post. Everybody is going to have to do their job.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about being a 1 seed that may be playing farther away
from home, in Iowa territory?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I mean, it doesn't really matter where we have to play. We're
here, said and done, and I don't think you worry about that now. It's just
about worrying about University of Tennessee Martin.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Yeah, I have to agree with Sky. I think we've played in a lot
of different environments coming out of the Big East and even the
non‑conference schedule that we're pretty much ready for anything.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk a little bit about what you expect (inaudible)?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Absolutely. I think their confidence has come a long way. If
you look at Madison Cable, Markisha Wright, Michaela Mabrey, they've
contributed in so many different ways, and I think we're going to need them a
lot down the stretch.  
  
Q. Skylar, in terms of the 2,000, 500, 500, what area are you most pleased
with with that accomplishment?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Probably the assists. It is great to create for people. To get
500 assists, and 500 made baskets, you've got to credit the teammates for
that. Over the years I've had the luxury of playing with people that just
moved so well without the basketball. Natalie Novosel, Becca Bruszewski,
Brittany Mallory, Kayla McBride, Natalie Achonwa, the players I've been able
to play with over the years, Lindsay Schrader, just been great players, just
to name a few. It's movement without the ball, and I think that's what
ultimately matters, not just finding them but then being able to catch and
finish.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the mindset you have to have, the lessons you've
learned from playing six games each the last two seasons in the tournament?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well I think we understand what it takes to get there, and I
think, like Kay‑Mac said, just the conference schedule that we play is so
tough, and I've said this before, you're playing elite level Final Four
through 16 games all the time, and I think ultimately that's what really
prepared us for the tournament, coming in with such a tough conference. Eight,
nine teams go every year the past couple years, and it's just been a great
conference to play in and help prepare us.  
And then Coach McGraw does a great job of making sure we're prepared one game
at a time, and I think that mindset is important because you don't look too
far into it. Last year we could have gotten anxious and looked to the
championship with the expectations on our team, but we kept that
one‑game‑at‑a‑time mindset, and I think that's helpful going into the
tournament.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Absolutely, and I think with our team, players like Kayla and
Natalie, Ariel, who have been to the championship every game, they can help
the younger kids out, and myself and Kaila Turner, also. But the upperclassmen
experience that we've had in the tournaments and our success kind of helps the
freshmen because they feel like they have people that have been there and done
that, and it kind of eases their mind.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this team's mental toughness, just the ability to keep
your composure and all those comebacks you've had this season?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Yeah, I mean, I think at the beginning of the year a lot of
people looked at us as a young team, not as experienced as most teams, even
though we have a lot of upperclassmen who have experience. But I think the
confidence and belief that we can win every single game, I think it's carried
over to the younger kids, and I think that their confidence has grown a lot,
and they can go out in different situations and be ready for anything, and
that's what mental toughness is. We've come a long way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenges of Tennessee Martin and the two guards,
Butler and Newsome?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Two of the best guards in the country, both in the top 10 in
scoring. They can shoot the three, they can put it on the floor, they can
attack the basket. Their assist‑to‑turnover ratio is good. They're as good a
guards as we've seen all year long, and it's going to be a challenge for us
trying to contain them.  
  
Q. Is this the kind of game where you try to get to their bench? Is that
pretty much where the battle lies?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think at this point I think most people are
shortening their bench and playing probably six or seven people, so I don't
know that that's as much a factor right now. I think everybody wants the best
players on the floor as long as they can keep them there.  
  
Q. How would you characterize the play of Markisha Wright this year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She was thrilled. She was the most excited person in the room
when she saw we were coming back to Iowa. I know the ticket requests are going
to be unbelievable for her. She's had a great year for us. She has played a
big role in recently the Big East Tournament, the last game against UConn with
Natalie Achonwa in foul trouble, she came off the bench and did a great job,
is good at defending. She's a physical post player, like what she's doing on
defense. She's a really smart player, picks things up really quickly, really
pleased with her progress this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jewell Lloyd's development? I know she's a freshman,
but it seems like she's already been tourney tested, so to speak.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she really has. She's been in some big games and she's
played well, had a career high against Baylor. She played well on the road in
a lot of games we've had. I love her attitude. She wants to get better every
game. Every day at practice she wants to get better. She keeps asking what she
can do to get better. She is an incredibly talented player who has unlimited
potential and definitely a bright future at Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Did some of the men's upsets Thursday and Friday help get this team's
attention?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's always good to see that. Of course we're cheering
for all the No.1 seeds. But I think it's good because I think it's a
realization that that can happen to you, and I think it puts you on guard a
little bit more.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of your inside players and also about
Carol Owens, just what gifts she has as a teacher?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Carol is the best post coach in the country. She's a phenomenal
teacher. She played the position, she knows exactly what they need to do, and
she is great about delivering her message. She challenges them, and they know
she cares about them but she can get on them pretty hard, and they respond
really well. Natalie Achonwa having the best year of her career, regional
all‑American. She is going to be just a force for us on the block. Ariel
Braker, I don't think you can say enough about the progress she's made this
year, definitely our team's most improved player, kind of the unsung hero of
the group doing what she does best, defending and rebounding and never trying
to step out of her role, just trying to do whatever she can to help the team.
But her progress has been phenomenal this year.  
And Markisha Wright, same thing, I think great growth as a player, has gotten
better almost every day and has given us really quality minutes this year.  
Really pleased with our post game overall this year.  
  
Q. On this 26 ‑game winning streak with some tough competition, what have
you learned about your team or what's the most exciting thing for you about
that winning streak?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the resilience. They're an amazing group. They come in
after a win and we're going to watch what we did wrong. We don't really look
at what we're doing well so much as how we can get better, and this is a team
that relishes that. They love to be challenged. They want to get better. So I
love their attitude coming back to practice every day with an eye on the goal
and never wavering from it. I don't think we've looked past anyone all year
long. We've risen to the challenge in all of our big games and have just had
some amazing wins because of the confidence, I think, of the group, certainly
led by Skylar.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH McMILLAN: We are excited to be back in the Tournament for our third
straight year. It's a tremendous accomplishment for these guys to have come as
far as we have with some of the issues that this team has had to go through.  
They have put us on our back for the last month of the season, and you know,
you don't want to be playing a 16, as you can see from the games that are
going on today. But the opportunity to be back and the notoriety that it
brings your university, we're real proud and looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how well you and jasmine play as a tandem,
because you're both prolific scorers and assist ‑makers and all those steals.
  
HEATHER BUTLER: Well, we definitely I think go well together on the court,
because she's a very good ball handler, and she definitely goes to the hole
very hard. When she does that, that kind of opens up for our shots on the
outside and for my shot.  
And so when she does that and goes to the lane hard, then we get our shots on
the outside. And if they don't help on us, you know, then she gets to go to
the lane. I think that definitely, we are very compatible with each other on
the court that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the matchup with Notre Dame's guards,
what are concerns and where you see some advantages for you guys?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: I haven't really thought about that, advantages, because I
haven't really seen them play this year. But I think we match‑up very well
with them, because like I'm sure they won't like really be worried about us.  
We are just going into the game with the mind‑set that we have nothing to
lose. Like we have played against good guards before, so I think we are
prepared for it.  
  
Q. You've played Stanford, you've played Baylor; does that take away a
little bit of the "wow" factor, playing a No.1 seed?   
JASMINE NEWSOME: Yes, I believe it does, because like I said, we played those
teams so we know what they are getting ourselves into.  
HEATHER BUTLER: I think definitely, that's why we schedule the big teams
during the year, Baylor, Stanford and Purdue and all of the big teams to kind
of prepare ourselves for the end of the season, for like tournament time right
here. And I definitely think that it got us prepared for now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the transition game, what it means to your
offense, and how efficient you guys are at that this season?  
HEATHER BUTLER: Well, during the beginning, we kind of looked to push the ball
a lot, and kind of toward the end, we kind of like looked to slow it down
sometimes and kind of speed it up when we had a good shot on transition.  
But I think coming into this game, I think that we've just got to be smart
with our possessions. If we have a fast break against, what, on five or
something, then we need to take it. But if not we need to slow down and run
our offense and execute and get a good shot.  
  
Q. You guys have won eight in a row, what's been the key to your success
during that winning streak?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: I think it was like one day in practice or something, Coach
came and said that he was like basically going to take over and we were going
to play the way we were supposed to play. Basically we knew that we had to win
games to like get a top seed in the OVC tournament and then once we got to the
OVC tournament, like we didn't want to lose. We didn't want to go home.  
  
Q. To both Jasmine and Heather, once you realized, whether it was freshman
year, or sophomore year that you guys kind of had the ability to become the
scorer you both are now.  
JASMINE NEWSOME: Oh, start with Heather.  
HEATHER BUTLER: First year when you're coming in, I didn't know what to expect
at all. Going against bigger colleges and bigger girls, because I wasn't used
to that in high school. And once we started playing those bigger teams, and we
started scoring, I definitely realized, okay, we definitely have a chance to
play with these people.  
And ever since, you know, playing that first big team, I remember realizing,
like Vanderbilt, we played Vanderbilt and I remember thinking, we can play
with these girls. We can't get intimidated. We've just got to go out there and
just play ball.  
JASMINE NEWSOME: Basically I just wanted to prove that I belong on the court
with bigger names, people. I just wanted to go out there and show people that
maybe overlooked me that I belong on the court with the same players.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Notre Dame's inside game and the challenges Achonwa
and Braker pose for you?  
COACH McMILLAN: Besides the fact that they have an inside game and we don't,
would be the first challenge. Those kids are overlooked. The guards get so
much attention for Notre Dame that you overlook those guys, and you can't,
because I think that‑‑ that may be a little bit of a key. You saw when Achonwa
got 20 and 20 a couple of games ago, you tend to think that that's a weakness;
and I thought the last time they played their last game in the championship,
that's where Connecticut tried to expose them was down low and it didn't work.  
So if that's not a weakness, we know the guards weren't a weakness, somebody‑‑
y'all have an idea what the weakness is? Give us some help here, guys. I do.  
I think that they are very team‑oriented players. They are not worried about
the spotlight. They are not worried about anything. They are kind of
blue‑collar kids. They do all the grunt work, I guess you could say. They are
the kind of kids that you have to have on your team if you're going to make a
run, and when you've got people that will sell out to doing the job that those
guys do, you see a great basketball team.  
  
Q. What's going to be the most critical element for your team to be
successful, the transition game, the ‑point shooting?   
COACH McMILLAN: The officials. If the officials blow the whistle, it's going
to be a different type of game. You know, we traditionally get to the free
throw line quite a bit but we play‑‑ this is the third NCAA Tournament, we
played Baylor, we played Stanford, we played Purdue and what happens in the
big game is that we shoot about half as many free throws as we do in any
other, normal game. But we don't run anything different.  
The teams are bigger, but the handshaking and the bumping is the same as it
always is. I don't know if it's that they think because you're in a
bigger‑name game that those are not as many falls or I don't know what. If we
average ten free throws, which is what we've done when we've played big teams,
it's going to be ugly.  
And the opportunity for us is, what if those two little guards that were
sitting here can get‑‑ we did it with Baylor. And if we can do it again with
Notre Dame, get them in foul trouble, and get them sitting over there on the
bench; I would like to see those guys sitting over there watching more than I
would to see them out there playing. They are great guards and I enjoy
watching whenever I can, but I would rather see them sitting over there.  
Butler and Newsmoe have the potential to cause some foul problems for people,
but the big question is going to be, are they going to call it. Last year in
the NCAA Tournament, playing Tennessee we said going in, we didn't want to be
intimidated, especially being from Tennessee. We told our kids to foul the
first possession, foul. I said, I don't care what you do; you've got to foul,
because we have to send a message that we are not going to be intimidated.  
And I had a little girl that fouled four times and the fourth one was called.
And she came over and apologized and said, "Coach, I grabbed her onceand they
didn't call it."  
I said, it's going to be a long night for us if they are not going to call
that. I'm not understating it; that's going to be the biggest thing, are there
going to be chances or four kids to get to the free throw line. If we are
shooting two free throws or four free throws, there's no way. We don't have a
prayer.  
And they are so good defensively, my gosh, they can switch everything. They
can defend us anyway they want to on the perimeter. They can change up ways
they defend. There's no real weakness for us to exploit, which is the
challenge. We don't want playing the big teams when they have a big slow post
kid even if they are an All‑American, so they will come out and try to defend
the kids on the perimeter, so we will try to do that. Or they may not have two
guards that can defend on the perimeter ‑‑ well, Notre Dame can do all those
things. There's challenge after challenge after challenge that's lined up for
us. We are going to need some help.  
  
Q. Were those two overlooked in the recruiting process because of their
size? How were you able to get them?  
COACH McMILLAN: If you saw them when they walked out of here, they looked more
like cheerleaders than basketball players. They are both interesting stories.
Butler played for me in high school since she was a ninth grader. I coached
her. When you ask her, when I got her, I said, you're going to have to shoot
for us.  
And she says, "Coach, that's not what I do, I'm a point guard, I don't shoot."
We started practicing and I sat her on the bench and we started practicing
without her. And we took a water break, and she said, what are you going to
do; and that was the last time I ever had to tell her, don't shoot and.  
What she did after that was phenomenal, broke state records, did all kind of
stuff. When I got the job at UTM, she was the one that we wanted to come with
us, and for obvious reasons. Being 5‑4 or 5‑5, you are going to be overlooked.
But she's a tough matchup to keep the people in front of you.  
So I had a connection with her, having coached her in high school, and the
strange thing was that jasmine was from milling ton high school in Tennessee
which is where I started. That's where I had my first job, and her family knew
that I had been there before and had done some research and her dad and I
talked, and he wanted her to come up there and play.  
And so you know, to get both of those kids was just a phenomenal coop for us,
but they weren't choosing. They only had two or offers on the table when they
were seniors, so I don't think today it would be that way because two Top‑10
scorers on the same team is probably not going to get overlooked but we were
fortunate that they were.  
  
Q. How has your team grown from the start of the season?  
COACH McMILLAN: We had a team last year that was in the tournament, and we
started four sophomores. We were in the tournament two years ago against Duke,
we started five freshmen I think.  
So we have gotten a little older. Well, at the end of last year, after this
game last year, we got home and the next day I had two walk in that quit and
just didn't want to play anymore. They are just going to school right now
getting to work on their degree.  
And that really put us in a bind because we had not recruited to fill that,
and so this year was a challenge at the beginning of the year because we were
trying to fill some holes that we didn't know we were going to have. So that
got us a little bit of a slow start.  
And plus we had scheduled thinking we were going to have those kids and be a
mature team heading into that process. Playing Stanford and Baylor, we had two
freshmen out there, and Lord, help those kids, golly. But then we've lost kids
for the season at various times, and every time we seem to think we are about
to get going somewhere, we lose another kid for the season. And I think at one
point we were down to seven players.  
I think we may be back up to eight right now, I don't know, we'll go in the
locker room and we'll see. And it's been a challenge, and she‑‑ her answer
was, you asked the question to Jasmine what was the change, what happened, and
literally that is what happened. I'm laughing, because I knew the kind of
answer you were looking for, and that wasn't it, but that is what happened.  
We just walked in one day and said, look, guys, we know what we can do, we
know this is the kind of team we need to be. Let's get rid of all this other
mess and let's go. Those two bought in and did it. It's been a strange year
for us with as good a team as we've had, with all the injuries and all the
different things, it's just been something that's every time you turn around,
you expect something else to hit you.  
This team, that's why I didn't think they would have the wherewithal to make
it back. That's why I'm proud of what they have been able to do.  
  
Q. USA Today released the voting for the coach's poll and you and a lot of
other coaches, after Notre Dame beat Connecticut in January, was still putting
Connecticut ahead of Notre Dame. Can you elaborate on your voting philosophy,
if you don't mind?  
COACH McMILLAN: That is a hard pole. I didn't think it was that hard until I
did it, because, it took me about till the middle of January to get
comfortable with the way I was voting. It's the first time I've done it.  
And so, what I did, and it was not right, and I guess I probably shouldn't be
saying this, but I would look at what‑‑ I would vote and I would look at‑‑ the
next week would come out and compare how it was and whatever, and I think
there's only one week that I was a real intelligent voter and I looked at, how
did I vote the week before and changed that based on the results. I let myself
get tainted too much by what‑‑ the pole came out, if that makes any sense.  
So it took me about till mid‑January to become an intelligent voter, where I
was looking at the way I thought it was and then taking the results from the
week and putting it back into the way I thought it was, rather than going with
what all the other voters were doing.  
Does that make any sense? They send you a list of how everybody did, and,
well, I would look at that list and I would vote based on that list and it
took me until mid‑January to go, I don't care how everybody else is voting and
do what I think it should be, which is what I should have been doing at the
beginning, which I guess was pretty dumb.  
I don't know when I put Notre Dame 2, but the truth is I would like Notre Dame
and Baylor to go play again and see if we might flip that vote. We've played
Baylor and Stanford, and now we'll play Notre Dame. And they are all great
teams. For a while there, you can vote those guys 1 through 4 and don't worry
about it, and especially when you saw them play each other, you saw that
happening. Hope that wasn't a bad answer, if I don't get in trouble‑‑ it was
honest.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: Well, it's great to be at home. Obviously this time of year,
still in the NCAA Tournament but to be at home is pretty special. This
afternoon was kind of weird, I'm at home cleaning my kitchen, not sure if
that's what most coaches are doing at NCAA Tournament time. That's what I was
doing. The team is coming over tonight for dinner. Unusual day for us, as far
as NCAA Tournament goes, the day preceding those.  
We are really looking forward to having the opportunity to host and have this
tournament on our home court. I think it's a great privilege for us to be able
to host. I want to thank our administrators for doing all the extra work that
has going in to putting on a tournament like this, securing the bid and then
also all the work that they have done in putting on a first‑class tournament.  
I think the fans, the Hawkeye fans that come out are going to see some great
basketball and they are going to enjoy this national tournament here in Iowa
City.  
  
Q. The seniors want to leave a legacy and now that you're in NCAA Tournament
time, advancing past the first round, what does winning a game mean to maybe
how you guys want to end your career?  
JAIME PRINTY: Since I've been here we've only won one NCAA Tournament game,
and that was my freshman year. Being able to play at home and in front of our
own fans and on our home court is a huge advantage for us and we are all
really excited. Just hope we come out and win this first one so we have a
chance to play again at home.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: It's just an amazing opportunity, any opportunity to get to
play here on this stage in March Madness is really extremely awesome. We are
excited to play that game and as seniors we want to go out of this building‑‑
one at a time, but we are excited for them both.  
  
Q. What have you seen from their center, pretty solid player.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: She's really tall. She's 6‑6 and she moves her feet well, gets
up‑and‑down on the floor really well so transitioning is going to be key
against her. She also likes to turn and get this quick shot. She's a good
shooter and just being able to pressure her is going to be really important.  
  
Q. Their coach kind of talked about, she thought the way to shut down the
Iowa offense is to keep you from distributing the ball. Have you had teams do
that? How do you counter?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think you can't really focus too much on one player on
our team. We just have so many different weapons, so many different games,
that I don't think a team can really completely stop our team stopping one
player. You definitely just have to use the tools that I have around me to get
our offense going and keep everything under control. So they can try to; but,
it's not just one player on our team obviously.  
  
Q. They are a pretty good offensive team, what are you going to have to do
to counter that?  
JAIME PRINTY: I think we just need to play the style of basketball we like to
play and get each other involved and really have a variety in our offense.
They also like to press a lot and we have been working on that a lot this
week, breaking the press with confidence and taking care of the ball. I think
that will be huge this game.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I agree, I think we do a good job moving the ball‑‑ if we keep
moving well and break their press (inaudible).  
  
Q. Having these tournament games here at home, does that seem to increase
the amount of time when you guys are out and about on campus or at the grocery
store, whatever? Do people mention this? Does it strike you as more of a local
happening?  
JAIME PRINTY: Yeah, I've been, I mean, out and about and a lot of people have
told me they are really excited to watch you go and how excited they are that
we get to play at home; that they are going to not have to travel to come
watch us play. That's exciting and hopefully we'll get great support from our
fan base.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It's nice to have it close to home and also for a lot of us,
not a far drive for families, and that helps out a lot, too. But our fan base
is great all the time and having a national tournament hosting it, definitely
hope will increase that.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: We all went to the men's game last night and we got a big
standing ovation. You just can tell that the Hawk fans are really here to
support athletics, whether it's men or women's basketball. They have been
supporting us this whole time, whether it's Tweets or on Facebook. They have
done a great job showing us they are here to support us all the way through.  
  
Q. It's been 16 days since you're last game, and I know Coach has been
against a long layoff; the Miami people said they embraced the break, gotten a
lot better. What in your mind ‑‑  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think we have focused on what was hurting us a lot,
especially against Nebraska, Big Ten Tournament. Just boxing out, which we'll
really need to focus on tomorrow. You know, and just going through all of our
stuff and everything like again. But on the defensive end, especially, I think
we have been focusing on improving ourselves in that aspect.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: A lot of what Sam said; we worked on, everything, back to
basics a little bit. We just continued to grow with the program, go back to
those basic fundamentals and work on those every day. That's been really good.  
JAIME PRINTY: A lot of times during the season we don't have time to work on
yourself because you're always getting ready for the next opponent. That we
can we had where we didn't know who we were going to play yet, we focused on
ourselves and worked on things that could make a difference in these upcoming
games, so I'm pretty thankful for that.  
  
Q. At the men's game, you were wearing ‑‑  
MORGAN JOHNSON: Yeah, everything's completely fine. It's just totally
precautionary. Everything's good.  
  
Q. Before the end of the season, you lost five straight, you beat Indiana,
Northwestern and you beat Northwestern again. In that win streak there, did
you start to see what we had seen from the team earlier this season? Because
it looked like with the struggles that was not looking good for your
tournament hopes at that point.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, it's all how you look at it. I look at we won four of our
last five; I look at it the other way around. In our last four‑game stretch,
we had two games against Top‑25 teams and we had three games that were on the
road, and we went 3‑1 in that series. I think that's a really good. And so I
think at the end of the year, we got things together, we played very well, we
ended up winning four of those five games, so I think things are good.  
  
Q. So much of what any season comes down to is what is done in March. How
much do you talk about that? Like Jaime said, you had the one victory when she
was a sophomore. How much do you talk about that; hey, let's make a run or
what do we do to make a run?  
COACH BLUDER: No, we don't talk about making a run. We talk about winning one
game at a time and that's all that really matters is the next game that we
have ahead of us. We are just happy to be playing at home. Yes, we'd like to
play two games at home, but right now it's all about one game at a time.  
  
Q. What's on the menu? You said the team was coming over for dinner
tonight.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, you know, some of the favorites. I'll give you a hint: I'm
not cooking, so they will like it, and they probably won't get sick, so that's
good. A little lasagna, a little chicken, good stuff.  
  
Q. You've had time to kind of spend a week on Miami, what's the scouting
report on them, without giving too much away.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, excellent defensive team as you know, just by looking at
their numbers. Excellent defensive and rebounding team. Their center is very
good. She's been playing really well, especially in the last few games. Her
numbers have really went up. She has been shooting the ball very well on the
paint.  
So then, you know, their press is something that we have got to be thinking of
because it's something they have done a lot of, and we have seen it on and off
during the year, but not consistently.  
  
Q. There's a number of coaches who have kind of proposed the idea of playing
the first couple of rounds ‑‑ home court situation. Why is it important for a
team to have the opportunity to host games?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, everybody complains that there's not enough parity in
women's basketball, and this is the only way we are going to develop more
parity is by having more home sites and not just the same 16 sites every year.  
If we do that, that's the way it used to be and we went away from that because
it wasn't good for our sport, so I don't know why we would go back to that and
it wasn't good and we went away from it. I think we want to continue to grow
our game.  
We have to grow parity, and that means improving the teams that are 16‑100 or
16‑50, and those are some of those people that get to host now. And the Top‑16
are definitely getting their share of host opportunities, as well.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA  65  
IOWA STATE - 60

  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all I certainly want to thank everyone at Gonzaga,
did an amazing job; the people of Spokane, Washington, it was honor for Iowa
State to be here and I want to thank earn, Joel, his entire staff, amazing,
amazing event. Gave our kids memories of a lifetime, and it was an honor to be
here and play in this facility and be around these people.  
Certainly want to thank the NCAA Committee for giving us the opportunity to
play in this tournament.  
Certainly want to congratulate Georgia. That's a great basketball team. It was
a great women's college game. That's what the NCAA Tournament's about.  
And I'm very, very proud of our team, very proud of our effort, and one or two
missed shots here or there, that's this tournament. But certainly proud of our
effort and excited the way they represented their school and their fan base.  
Thank you to everyone for everything they did. It was an amazing event.  
  
Q. So what's the range of emotions after the final stretch, and what were
you thinking as you made the 19 ‑1 run and then they come right back, what was
going through your mind?   
ANNA PRINS: I mean, I think when you're in a situation like that, you know, I
think honestly I don't really remember it.  
All I knew and all we knew as a team, that we needed to keep pushing the ball.
We needed to keep playing the way that Iowa State plays. And you know, it was
a really fun stretch at the end when we started to hit shots and, you know,
started to get back in the game.  
You know, unfortunately, it didn't end the way that we wanted, but I think you
know, this will be a great memory for all of us and I'm just really proud to
hope be alongside these girls and it will be a great memory.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, everybody was just really excited. It was a fun game.
We lost to a great team, great players.  
I mean, just to play against a team that tough, especially our last game, I
mean, there's not a better way we would want to go out. We gave it our all. We
left everything on the court. We never gave up, especially in the end. That's
just‑‑ I mean, I'm proud of each and every one of us.  
  
Q. Chelsea, at 51 ‑37, some of us down on the press row were thinking,
you're running out of gas out there. But were the players thinking that, could
you tell that you still had an extra burst in you?   
CHELSEA POPPENS: As a team or‑‑ yeah, we never give up. It's been in our past
few games that we've been through, we've never backed down. We've always just
kept going, kept grinding. Kept trying to make one shot after another.  
There's never a point in time where we're completely gassed. We have so much
heart on our team that just being down isn't going to stop us from trying to
come back, working harder. There's always going to be a little bit of energy
left for us, enough for us to leave it all out there.  
  
Q. Can you walk me through that shot awed, 60 ‑59, they had just taken the
lead and you got into the lane, was that a play call or anything, and what did
you think of the look you got? It looked decent but there was a lot of bodies
in there, as well.   
NIKKI MOODY: It wasn't really a play call. The play broke down and Coach
Fennelly always says, try to get out of a bad play. I saw the lane and just
tapped it.  
  
Q. Anna, after you took that four ‑point lead was there defensively anything
you didn't think you did as a team that you regret, or is it just Georgia
making some big shots and nothing you can kind of do about it?   
ANNA PRINS: Well, I think when it comes down to it, Georgia is a great team
with a lot of great players on it. They made big plays at the end. You can
always look back and say what if, what if, but like Chelsea said, we gave it
everything we had, and I think as a whole, just trying not to look back at
what we didn't do but what we did do.  
And again, Georgia is a great team and I think they just made some great plays
at the end.  
  
Q. Did you feel comfortable with the distance of that three ‑pointer with 18
seconds left?   
ANNA PRINS: Well, I mean, I knew that time was running out and we needed to
get a shot up. You know, I'm disappointed it didn't go in, but you can't look
at that.  
  
Q. Can you just sum up what this season has meant to you, just to get that
second place finish and 24 wins this year?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, this past season has been great. I couldn't ask for a
better group of girls to have‑‑ like for Anna, too, for our senior year, we
had so much great chemistry. We all were there for each other, we played for
each other, we played to have fun and we played for the right reasons.  
It's just great to go out, like end our Iowa State career with such a great
team, such good memories and so much bonding. The season's been great and
really successful, and I'm just really happy to have made it this far.  
ANNA PRINS: It's been an amazing year, I know Amanda Zimmerman, Chelsea and I,
we've had a lot of talks where we are super proud to be on this team. I will
never forget this year‑‑ sorry (eyes tearing up).  
This has been the most amazing experience of my life, and I will take a lot
from this. I feel completely prepared to go into life now. I can't even put
into words how much this whole experience has meant to me.  
Coach Fennelly and the girls and the coaching staff and just everyone who has
done so much for us, I'm just so grateful and I will always remember this. So
yeah, I can't really put it into words.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked the girls, that wild final nine minutes where you come
back and then they hit big shots, how do you put that into words? Have you
seen anything like it?  
COACH FENNELLY: They call it March Madness for a reason. That's college
basketball. That's the way the game should be played. A great women's college
game in the NCAA Tournament, great for TV.  
Certainly appreciate the Gonzaga fans coming out and hopefully we gave them
their money's worth. You know, our kids kept playing. It's 51‑37 and I got
into them a little bit, and just challenged them to finish. We take great
pride in finishing everything we've done, good and bad. And they did and they
gave themselves a chance to win, Georgia came back, hit some big shots.  
Probably haven't in a long time shot the three ball like they did today; but
that's what great players do, hit big plays, hit big shots. We hit them, they
hit them.  
But what I told our players is, whatever happened in that 51‑37 time, to the
time the game ended, whatever they did inside themselves, take with them the
rest of their life, that was special. Average teams don't do that. Average
kids don't do that. The kids who wear an Iowa State uniform do that, and I was
very proud of that fact.  
  
Q. You were up, 56 ‑52, was it just a testament to Georgia, as well‑‑  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, 6:52 they got a dribble drive, kick to the corner. Barb
hits a shot, tough shot, and then we are up one and there's a scramble play.
Pop ends up on the floor and her man, Armstrong, is trailing, and we just
couldn't get there in time. It was a scramble and Kidd hit a big shot.  
Kind of like us, we hit a couple open threes in transition and then they came
right back, but two big plays. And they ran the back big play for the lob and
we didn't defend that great. You know, like Anna and Chelsea said, there's so
many plays that go either way in a game like this, but our kids competed, and
that's‑‑ I've always told them, you know, when the season does end, be able to
walk out of the building with your head up and appreciate your effort and your
teammate's effort.  
Anyone says Iowa State didn't compete like crazy tonight, come see me. I'll be
out in the hallway real quick, so we'd love to talk to you now that the season
is over.  
  
Q. The string of three ‑pointers they made in the first half, you came out
in a 2‑3 zone; what was the strategy going in, and did you expect that
shooting?   
COACH FENNELLY: We were trying to change defenses a little bit. We tried to
play zone, because we wanted to stay out of foul trouble.  
The strategy was, they are not a great three‑point shooting team. You look at
their numbers, they are 27 percent on the season, and we wanted to keep people
in front of us. Jasmine James hits two, and she's hit three all year. That's
NCAA Tournament basketball. A couple other kids, same thing.  
But we tried to change defense, because we wanted to stay out of foul trouble.
We were really worried about them pounding it at us. And we got to halftime,
the score tied, felt pretty good about it. The plan was to play a lot of man
the second half; if we could get to the second half, that's kind of what we
did.  
Defensively we were okay. I don't have any real problems with it. Kept them
off the free throw line, almost every three they made is either a great play
by one of their players or a coaching mistake by me. The two threes that
Jasmine James made, for sure, is on me because I said don't cover her on the
three‑point line. She's 3‑for‑28 on the season; I'm going to let her shoot it
every time. So those are the things that you have to do this time of year, and
great teams make plays, and they made them and they deserved to win because of
it.  
  
Q. You also really clamped down on their leading scorer for the season,
Hassel, and she was looking quite frustrated for the first half; was there
something special you were doing there?  
COACH FENNELLY: The thing you try to do with a great post player like that is
limit her initial position, don't let her get two deep.  
And then Anna did a great job; and Chelsea, we just said, make her score over
the top of you. She has a lot of counter moves. Don't let her push you up the
lane and shove you up the lane and get a lob. Make her hit a tough shot over
the top of you. And I thought for the most part, they did a good job of that.
For a kid that gets the looks she get to go 3‑for‑12 defensively, that was a
pretty good effort.  
  
Q. When you look at the season's big picture, do you see your image
reflected in this team, how they approach stuff, kind of more big picture?  
COACH FENNELLY: My image? Oh, no. If it does, that's a huge compliment to me,
because that's an amazing group of kids, and I love coaching this team. They
gave me something back that I thought I lost. I really‑‑ I mean that.  
To be around them every day and to see how hard they worked at things, and the
progress they made, and the way they cared about one another, and the way they
wore a uniform that means so much to so many people, amazing. It's hard to end
it. It's going to end sometime, but there's no regrets. Just I told them, no
excuses, no regrets. We have none, and we are very proud of that.  
  
Q. What was it that you lost, you said that they gave back?  
COACH FENNELLY: I lost a little bit of belief in people understanding and
wanting to do things the Iowa State way. There were kids on our team in the
past that didn't get it that weren't fair to the Lindsays of the world and
other former players that had worked to hard to build a program that is so
special, with so many special people. There's no way to quantify that. And I
did not want to be involved or around people that didn't get it and understand
it and believe it and live it and love it, and this team did. I will always be
indebted to them before that.  
Everyone at Gonzaga, thank you so much and everyone at Spokane, amazing,
amazing. The atmosphere here was fantastic and thank you forgiving our kids
something they will remember the rest of their life.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA - 65  
IOWA STATE - 60

  
COACH LANDERS: It was very much the game that we thought it would be, and we
have nothing but respect for Iowa State and the job that they did. They were
very good tonight. They shot the three ball very well. They took advantage of
their size in the paint and Prins played that out exceptionally well. Just a
well‑coached game from Iowa State's part. They did what they needed to do, and
really did a nice job with it on the defensive end. They were on point.  
You know, we didn't get as much as we would like to have gotten out of
ourselves offensively or out of our sets, but our players really did a nice
job of making plays throughout the game, and particularly at the end of the
game when we had lost the lead.  
But it's the kind of game that we thought it would be. I thought Iowa State
defensively was very good. I thought that Georgia defensively was
extraordinary.  
  
Q. I saw you looking pretty impressed by a stat there ‑‑  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: Jasmine James with eight rebounds, that's crazy.  
  
Q. That's actually the segue to my next question. You guys had spoken of
wanting a legacy, to change something towards the program, can you go into
that a little bit and what did you see out of that tonight?  
JASMINE HASSELL: You said change, right? I think our seniors, when we first
got here as freshmen, our theme was change. Ever since then, that's been our
theme kind of because we came in at a point in time where Georgia needed a
little change, and as you see, we continued to change and do some big things
for Georgia.  
JASMINE JAMES: One of the things that had to do with change was getting back
to the tradition of Georgia basketball and the tradition of Georgia basketball
is Sweet16s, Elite 8s, Final Fours, competing in the National Championship
games, not just to go to the NCAA Tournament.  
So to win this game tonight and to be making that step to be going to the
Sweet16 and trying to compete in order to try to work to get to the Elite 8 is
definitely a step.  
THE MODERATOR: Georgia's 20th trip to the Sweet16, third all time in NCAA
history.  
  
Q. The third senior in this group is not on the podium, but can you talk
about an Marie's play tonight? Seemed like she was all over the court even
with four fouls.  
JASMINE JAMES: I think Anne Marie was huge today. She really made some great
plays and knocked down some huge shots that allowed us to gain momentum as
well as keep momentum. Whenever we really needed something that I felt like it
was her or Cobi, they were both huge today.  
But Anne Marie, she was great, and it's definitely great to be able to see her
play as well as she did tonight. I feel like she's been battling with her
ankle injury all year and now here it is, that's the Anne Marie we know and so
it was great to see her back out there like that.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I definitely agree with Jasmine James. She played awesome
tonight and did what she had to do.  
She said in the huddle we had, she's like, "Guys, this can't be our last
game." Of course, she's a senior, and just to see her come out and give it her
all was amazing.  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: I think coming off a game like she did yesterday, it's a big
statement of who she really is and how good she can really play, and she just
had a real big game for us tonight.  
  
Q. When you see that the team only had five turnovers, and Iowa State was
commenting that they were just going to let you shoot the three pointer, and
so I wanted your response to both of those things.  
JASMINE JAMES: First off, to comment on the turnovers, you know, it was one
thing that we focus on is try to take care of the ball as much as possible. At
this point in the season, the NCAA Tournament is a possessions game. You can't
just throw away possessions and throw away the ball and lose opportunities to
score the ball. So overall, we did a very good job of taking care of the ball.  
And as far as them letting me shoot the three pointer, we won by five points,
so I hit two (shrugs shoulders). It is what it is. (Laughter) It must have
been a good move. It wasn't‑‑ I mean, it worked out well for us, so I'll take
it.  
  
Q. How about going to the line twice late in the game as a freshman; how
many nerves were boiling in you or did you feel comfortable?  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: All of them were boiling. But I knew it was time to step up
and like I practice them, just try to knock them down, and I did, but I was
nervous.  
  
Q. The length of Anna Prins looked like it was so tough to go against
tonight and seemed like when Anne Marie started driving to the basket you got
a couple put backs and that got your confidence going in the second half; can
you talk about that?  
JASMINE HASSELL: Oh, yeah, she was big, but like I say all the time, it's not
about me. It's about Georgia, and tonight my teammates stepped up and I'm very
proud of them. They did what they have to do, and I'm just proud to be a part
of the Sweet16. We still won and all my teammates played great tonight and I'm
just glad we went to the Sweet16.  
  
Q. You guys haven't been the best three ‑point shooting team throughout the
season. Has this kind of shooting been I guess‑‑ been there, capable of this
throughout the year, and why was it tonight, you guys were so good shooting
from beyond the arc?   
SHACOBIA BARBEE: We just‑‑ we're good shooters. All of our guards can shoot
the three. We have four men that can shoot the three. It's been there all
season. It's just that we just have to be consistent with it starting now.  
And tonight, we knew that we had to knock down the big shots. You're wide
open, you've got to knock it down and hit it. That was just a big focus.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotions of the team during that 19 ‑1 run by Iowa
State late in the game? How did you guys‑‑ with you are you able to withstand
that?   
JASMINE JAMES: I think we did a good job of sticking to go. It was like we had
two time‑outs during that period and every time we went to the time‑out it was
just like, we're okay. Good teams make runs, it's okay. Just go out there, try
to lock down on defense and execute what we need to do on the offense.  
I don't ever think there was a point like we were worried. We knew that we
needed to go out there and just buckle down on defense and just‑‑ and
everything will take care of itself.  
I think just everybody did a really good job of sticking together and keeping
each other up and making sure that nobody got down about anything, and we just
stayed focused on the ultimate goal, which was being able to come out with the
win, and we did that.  
  
Q. You had spoken this season about the ability of your players to provide
things in the game that don't show up in the stat sheet, and it just seemed
like Anne Marie sometimes tonight, getting loose balls, it just seemed like
that exemplified that; can you just talk about that a little bit?  
COACH LANDERS: Yeah, she's really smart, and as a player, she's really easy
for me to communicate with, because she gets me; Cobi gets me; Tiaria gets me.
And when I say that, it's like you say something one time and they are good to
go with it.  
Other players get me, but they have to ask, is this to understand what you're
saying, is this what you want; they get me first time.  
To give you an example of what Anne Marie did tonight. We said, we don't mind
giving up the two. If they are going to throw it inside, just be sure she
shoots over your belly‑‑ I mean, Anne Marie was great. Every shot that Prins
shot was contested. Prins was terrific. She did exactly what she needed to do.  
But here's what you're talking about. Then there would be a guard driving
somewhere that she leans over to help just enough to get it stopped, and then
go back to her man; sometimes go back to her man and knock the pass down. She
gets that.  
Hassel is being posted inside; she's opened, pointing at her man, pointing at
Hassel, cheek down, trying to discourage the ball from coming in. She gets
'help.'  
And then the other thing offensively, now tonight ‑‑ let me brag for a minute.
We were terrific on defense. We were really, really good. Prins killed us.
Nobody else did. And we made that decision earlier. We'll give up some twos
inside. Let's just not give up a load of threes.  
We gave up a load of threes, but boy, we shut everything else out. We guarded
all their stuff, that they did us; they were really good defensively. We
couldn't get Hassel in the position that we need to get her in and get her the
ball. And at her size, you've got to get her the ball at the right place,
right time, right‑‑ because she's not going to be able to go over somebody
6‑7\.  
So they were really good defensively. Gets down to the last three minutes,
what does Anne Marie do? Reverse the layup, drop a three. And then Cobi, she's
a freshman, she doesn't even know any better, she drops one on top of it and
we're back in control. Just makes plays.  
It's frustrating because sometimes you can run plays for them, get them wide
open, they make you look horrible if you miss it, put them in a position where
they have to make a play and be a hero, they can do that.  
  
Q. That last three minutes, it was very up ‑and‑down, back and forth, there
wasn't a lot of stoppage. Why did you feel comfortable just letting your
players go and not maybe trying to take a little bit more control at that time
and use a time‑out?   
COACH LANDERS: Because when we were in transition, everybody looked good.
Nobody looked panicked. Nobody looked like they were in a hurry. We had five
turnovers the whole night. JJ did a terrific job of running our basketball
team.  
And if I call a time‑out, what was I going to say to them? Nothing we called
worked. If they can make a play in transition, it might be better than calling
a play and a time‑out.  
  
Q. You've spoken about this team's focus, and going back after the Texas A
&M game, there's a story about how after a bad practice, you locked the gym.
Did the focus augment after that or did it really increase?   
COACH LANDERS: It got better. The message I think was received.  
With young people today‑‑ I've got great kids, you can tell that, can't you?
I've got unbelievable kids. I mean, they are wonderful. But with young people
today, their memory is‑‑ they are just‑‑ they don't remember things very long.
That's just the way it is.  
It's a different world. This is the Internet. This is the tech generation. I
mean, think about what they do. They play video games and if they don't like
the way it's going, they restart it. They just push restart and start over.
Their memories are not very long. It never has to be. They get instant
information off of their cell phone. They don't have to look for anything very
long.  
And the sad piece of all that, what I see with young people in this generation
is they don't understand how to invest. They are not real invested in anything
because all the information that they need in their world, all the
entertaining that they need, it's on their fingertips all the time.  
When I was in college, you sit in front of the radio for an hour and a half
waiting for your favorite song; they have 300 of them on their belt. It's
real. They wait for nothing.  
Their memories aren't real good. It was that piece, locking them out of the
gym got their attention. It was good for about two weeks. Then you've got to
play the game they play. You've got to push restart. You've got to change the
game. Invent something different. Get their attention and then go with that
and then a week, two weeks later, you've got to come up with a different song
and a different dance.  
You know, the one thing that I will say for them, is the one thing we don't
change; if you're going to play at Georgia, you're going to play really,
really hard and you're going to be unselfish, and that piece is consistent. We
may change some things around, but you're going to be a good person and you're
going to play really, really hard and you're going to play unselfish.  
And that's what you've seen with two teams here. You've seen a team come out
totally focused on the defensive end. I don't know what you thought, but as
their coach, I think that they are spectacular defensively. Iowa State is a
great offensive basketball team, great. I have no doubt that we can guard
them, size and everything. I didn't know really‑‑ you never know exactly how
it's going to look.  
But now that it's over, it looked kind of the way I thought it would. I knew
we would give up stuff inside because of the size and because we are going to
have to pressure.  
You know who was terrific, who goes totally unnoticed? Tiaria Griffin. I mean,
this little joker just plugs in right under the ball. And you can't get away
from her, and it's constant. I mean, that kid, that point guard at Iowa State
is really good. Couldn't get away from her, 40 minutes, every minute she
played.  
And what it does, it allows everybody else on your basketball team to get up,
have a chance for a deflection. Or if you are going to be a half a step late,
that could have cost us a three, you know. But you're not because Tiaria has
got so much pressure on the ball, takes another hand‑‑ and that's where it all
starts, with her.  
I'm sorry, I rambled. Did I use all my time? Can we go now?  
But Iowa State is really, really good. I really hated that somebody had to
lose. I'm glad it was them but they are really, really good. I mean, they were
well coached tonight, guys, Iowa State. Did they ever say they got frustrated
offensively, any at all? Because we did. I hope they did, because they sure
frustrated us.  
Anything else? Thanks.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Iowa State, press conference for the game tomorrow 6:30 against
Georgia. We have Coach Bill Fennelly, as well as student athletes Anna Prins
and Chelsea Poppens.  
For Chelsea and Anna, if they want to give their reactions to last night's
game after having a night to absorb it and watching some video of it, just
your reaction.  
ANNA PRINS: Well, obviously we are really excited. It's always a lot of fun to
keep moving forward in the tournament. We were able to play in a great
atmosphere and get the W, and I don't know, it was a really fun game, and I
think we're all really proud of ourselves, and, I don't know, just excited to,
again, move forward.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Like she said, we're excited and I'm proud of my teammates
and the way we conducted ourselves throughout the game and just maintained
pressure and didn't back off and just kept going. It was a really fun game,
fun crowd. It's just exciting just to be able to go on to the second round.  
  
Q. Anna, just to be a senior and have a chance to go to the Sweet16, what's
that mean? And two ‑part question, what does it say about a team that could
potentially advance there?   
ANNA PRINS: Well, I mean, it's exciting to think about, but I mean, you know,
I think in the Tournament, you have to think about the game that you're about
to play and not necessarily, you know, what could be.  
And I think, you know, like I said before, we're just excited to be at this
point that we're at and, you know, ready to go to practice in a little bit and
learn about Georgia and what they have to offer on the court.  
You know, just‑‑ I don't know, just trying to enjoy as a senior, enjoy the
moment that we're in, and with the girls; it's definitely an exciting time.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I feel like she basically covered every area of it. I'm just
excited to keep playing. Obviously we want to make it further, but we have to
look at the present and focus on the now.  
  
Q. Starting with Chelsea, looking at Georgia ‑‑  
CHELSEA POPPENS: We haven't really gone over scouting reports or practice yet,
but they are going to be a tough time and I know we are going to have to be
able to stick with their pressure and be able to guard them inside and out. I
know they have quite a few good three‑point shooters. We just have to play
good defense and hold our own.  
ANNA PRINS: Like Chelsea said, we haven't gone much over them, just little of
the scouting reports, a little of that. But just watching them yesterday, they
are a great team. And they have got some tough physical players, drivers,
three‑point shooters, but we'll learn more about them later today and just
excited to play them.  
  
Q. What can you take from the game with Georgia yesterday, anything
specifically you're looking for in watching that game.  
ANNA PRINS: I don't think, I think I just noticed the team as a whole. They
did look physical and I don't know, it was a fun game to watch. We were there
for the first half of the game, so didn't get to see the second but I think
that's mostly what I talk out of it, great rebounding team, too, I noticed
that as well.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I noticed they are really good and quick on their feet and
they know how to get to the right people at the right time. We are just ready
to go up against them, try to is see their weaknesses just go at it.  
  
Q. Coach Landers mentioned yesterday that they don't minding being
aggressive, is that something you relish and what goes into playing a team
that's aggressive and hard like that?  
ANNA PRINS: I think playing a team that is really aggressive, I did notice,
too, they did a lot of trapping. I think it's being able to attack pressure.  
I think one thing we learned from the game, Gonzaga game, and they did a good
job of pressuring us, trapping us. I think just staying calm and not letting
pressure rile you up, I think is really important, because that's what causes
turnovers. I guess focusing on the way that we play is going to be the most
important thing to focus on.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Like she said, I mean, Gonzaga did a really good job of
putting pressure on us, and I'm sure Georgia will go about that same way,
trying to put pressure on us and force us to make turnovers.  
We had quite a few turnovers yesterday, and our goal is just to reduce that
amount and have more poise and be able to better attack the basket.  
  
Q. Can you speak a bit of the experience of coming halfway across the
country to try to get to play in the same place the following weekend?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: It's just a great experience to be able to like stick around
the same place. It's a great atmosphere and Gonzaga has great people. We have
been walking around town and everyone has been super friendly, super nice. And
just being able to ‑‑ just to be able to stay in the same place, it's a
challenge.  
At the same time, you've got to maintain like school while you're gone if you
have to stay here and you have to be able to organize yourself and keep the
goal at mind.  
ANNA PRINS: Yeah, it's a great experience. I know a lot of us were excited
when we found out we were coming here. I don't think a lot of us have been to
Spokane. It's a gorgeous place. Like Chelsea said, really nice people.  
I think it does help to be able to continue in the same spot. I don't know, I
have just been enjoying the scenery. I'm Colorado, and pretty similar with the
mountains and stuff. So it's nice to be back in kind of a familiar atmosphere
as far as the scenery.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Fennelly, and he can maybe answer the same
question we first started with: Any more reactions from last night's game
after looking at a little video?  
COACH FENNELLY: I mean, not a lot of sleep last night obviously for the
coaches. The way we do things is we want our players to enjoy the experience,
and sometimes when you get in these events, the game ends and you're so
focused on the next one.  
So we told them: Go to dinner, relax, enjoy themselves, watch the men's games.
We give them a scouting report that they could look at. We haven't met with
them yet because we wanted them to watch our men's game, enjoy that, and we
will literally go over some stuff here in the gym and then watch some video
when we get back.  
But this experience is one that you talk so much about as a coach, as a
player, administrator, fan, media, and if you don't enjoy it, it kind of goes
away. So we try and let them enjoy the win, it was a great environment, a
great evening. Everyone was into the game from the start, and one of those
atmospheres that women's basketball needs more of, and it was fun to be a part
of it last night.  
  
Q. What concerns you most about Georgia, the quick scouting report.  
COACH FENNELLY: The biggest things always with Andy's teams is they are
extremely physical, one through five. It's not just Hassel and Butler (ph) in
the post. Their guards are big, strong kids. They attack the basket. They are
going to defend us like crazy. You know, they are a team that doesn't shoot
the three point shot a ton. They drive the ball at you, points off turnovers.  
You know, a Georgia team is a Georgia team. The names change a little bit but
the personality doesn't because of the way Andy coaches and the kind of kids
he gets, but they are going to defend with great energy and they are going to
deny all over the court.  
You know, I thought Montana played them really hard. You're going to have to
make some shots, try to rebound the ball a little bit. But their depth is a
concern for us a little bit. They played a lot of kids yesterday, and
obviously we only played six. For the most part our kids were tired, a lot of
ice baths and stretching last night.  
I don't know how much we'll get done in practice today, but the Georgia
mind‑set, they are built for the SEC. It's like every team is built for
certain things, and Georgia is built for an SEC team, and Andy's teams are
always the same way. We have played them twice in the NCAA Tournament a long
time ago; we lost to them in the Final Four, and then we lost to them a few
years ago in Minneapolis.  
So, tough to score against and you'd better rebound the ball.  
  
Q. Can you think of any current ties between the programs that you know of,
players or anybody down the line?  
COACH FENNELLY: Shannon Becker, the trainer for Georgia, was my trainer with
the USA team when we went to Australia, when we went to China with the World
University Games team. I think the game, I mentioned that we lost in to go to
the Final Four, my defensive ‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ Kelly, Coco Miller,
All‑Americans. I think they both got about 30 on us.  
And Georgia has recruited a little bit in the Midwest, so we see them. They
have recruited Minnesota. Andy and his wife, Pam, are really nice people. I
have seen them on the Nike trip, and he and I both love Diet Mountain Dew.  
He's just one of those characters that our sport has needed for a long time,
but not a lot‑‑ we haven't played them much. I think those are the only two
times we've ever played them was in the Tournament. But someone that we have
known for a long, long time and someone who has done a great job of building a
program. You know, he's going into the Hall of Fame for a reason, that's not
by accident.  
  
Q. How would you describe the difference between a team that's built for the
SEC and maybe a team that's built for the Big12?  
COACH FENNELLY: That's a great question. I think our league with the exception
of a few teams, we don't see as many full court pressure defense. The SEC is
really going to get up into you and guard you a little bit more. They are
rebounders, drivers.  
The scores, if you look at their scores historically, they are a little bit
lower than ours. I think our league is, offensively, we have been a little bit
better top to bottom. But I think that the other thing that I think you see
over time in the SEC this year and the rosters I've seen, they have some great
size. They have a lot of kids 6‑2, 6‑3,6‑4, and our league doesn't have as
much of that.  
We have Brittney Griner which everyone talks about, but from a broad base of
schools in our league, our league has become very guard‑oriented for the most
part. So we don't see that consistency and depth of size that the SEC will
have.  
  
Q. We were talking last night briefly with Coach Landers about his early
impressions of you. He paid you a compliment and said he thinks this is one of
the best teams you've had in a while. Your response to that?  
COACH FENNELLY: I would agree. I think it is one of our better teams. We have
been in seven straight NCAA Tournaments and that's a great thing, and I'm very
proud of that. I think there's only 13 schools that have done that. But we
haven't had a team that I thought realistically could go past one or two
rounds of this tournament.  
We are more balanced. I think it's a team‑‑ it's been one of the most fun
teams I've ever coached. They are easy to manage. They get along great. They
are enjoying everything about this experience. And that makes it‑‑ coaching, I
love my job, but sometimes you love it more than others and teams you love
more than others. You know, just like your kids I guess at times.  
But this team has been really fun, and they have kept everyone loose, and I
think everyone who is engaged with them have enjoyed being around them. And I
think it's not an accident that our team got to come to Spokane and to
Gonzaga, because the people here are just like home, and they appreciate the
kids, they are friendly, the fans. I don't know how many people went out to
dinner last night: I'm not glad you won, but we like your team and everyone
was really gracious until the men's team lost and then it became really a bad
night‑‑ we've been there, believe me.  
But it's been a team that's fun to coach, and I think we are probably a little
more skilled than we have been in the past.  
  
Q. Speaking about the fun nature of this team, can you talk about Anna
Prins' engagement? That just seems like such a fun moment.  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, the Cliff Notes version of it was about two weeks before
Christmas, Ryan, her boyfriend, now fiancée, came to my office and he said,
"Coach, I have a favor to ask you." And he said he wanted to propose and he
wanted to do it on the court, because Anna's family was going to be there, and
the basketball family, the extended family, her coming to Iowa State was a big
part of her life and he wanted to share it with people.  
So we decided to do it during our tournament and he gave me the ring before
the game, and I was like a nervous wreck the whole time because I wanted to
make sure‑‑ luckily, we played someone that we beat really easily and I wasn't
even thinking about the game.  
After the game was over, I just took the microphone and I think our fans
thought we were just going to say happy new year to everyone, because it was
December 30th. And I said, "There's someone here that wants to do something,"
and he walked out. And I turned around and I said to Pop, "She's going to say
yes, isn't she?" That would have been embarrassing.  
But it was great. I've never been a part of that, and I don't think I ever
will. He put a lot of pressure on the other boyfriends to come up with a way
to propose. But it was a special moment for their family and they were all
there and the kids were a part of it. It was very unique, fun.  
THE MODERATOR: You must have had to ask the seven‑foot father first; right?  
COACH FENNELLY: I would hope so. You'd better ask the seven‑foot father. Yes,
he had it all cleared and he was ready to go and the whole family was there.
It was a neat moment, it really was, and it was neat that our fans got to see
it.  
  
Q. You said you've gotten it done with one and a half guards in term of ball
handling, but how have you gotten it done with six kids and such a thin bench?
Tell us about it.  
COACH FENNELLY: That's been hard, we've had to do some things, manage our
minutes. I think Pete Link, our strength coach, who is in his first full year,
deserved a lot of credit for getting them ready.  
We have been very smart, literally, since the second week in January in how
much we practice. Our practices are very, very short, to the point. A lot of
walk‑through, a lot of video, and you know, the kids that are playing
understand they are going to play. We have had to do some things defensively a
little different to stay out of foul trouble, because obviously like last
night, I think there's five minutes to go in the game, and Anna and Pop both
get their fourth foul, so we have had to manage that a little bit.  
But you know, it's a group that can handle the minutes, and it's just one of
those things that, you know, I tell them all the time: You're young, you're
fine, you can do it. They would rather play, anyway, and I think it's just the
nature of our team. I wish we had someone in the seventh or eighth spot, but
right now, and for most of the year, we haven't, and tried to manage it.
There's been games it has hurt us, that's no question and that's a concern for
tomorrow. I think this time of year, Pat Riley, I play nine, (inaudible)
eight, I trust seven, I believe in six, I'm going to throw the ball to five,
I'm going to call plays for four, and we all kind of get to that point; your
benches get a little shorter.  
That was the other thing yesterday, the officials, like Bill, keep them on the
bench. The time‑outs are so damn long. They get plenty of time to rest. But
seriously, the biggest thing is, manage your foul trouble and manage your
practice, and I think we can get to the end.  
  
Q. Back to Anna Prins real quick. You spoke after the Big12 tournament just
how integral a role she played in your team's success. Can you talk about her
surge of late?  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, it's been one of those things, that I think a lot of us
have been waiting for maybe. She's playing like a senior. She had two and a
half games in the Big12 tournament as good as any player we've had here. And
she did it against Caroline Davis, Nicole Griffin and Brittney Griner, not bad
players.  
And just really played with a‑‑ and Anna is one of those kids that is very
cerebral in her approach. And she, I think, like she's mentioned many, many
times to many of the media people at home is, I think she does realize that
her career is about over, and she's just going out and playing. And now as a
coach, you're like, you couldn't figure that out when you were a sophomore,
because a lot of them don't, and that's okay, too.  
Pop has been the opposite at times. She gets so nervous at being a senior,
fearing the end is near, it's inhibited her play at times where it's kind of
freed Anna up. And I think the games in the Big12 tournament, we did get in
foul trouble and Anna didn't, and played extended minutes and kind of had us
on a roll.  
But she's played very, very well in the postseason, and it's good for her to
do that. She's finally stayed healthy. This is the first year she's been
healthy all year, so it's neat to see her go out this way. I think it's good
for her and it's good for our team, certainly.  
  
Q. The Georgia loss in the Elite 8, does that stick with you ever? Do you
think about that again, or do those fade from your memory when you're that
close?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, it never fades, never, never. Think about it all the time.
There are certain things in life, they are always in your head, some things
are good and some things are bad, and you know, there's a lot of those games
that I think that's what makes coaching so great and what drives people crazy
is you can't let it go.  
And I think if you do let it go, you're in the wrong profession. You shouldn't
let it go. It shouldn't haunt you or make you miserable, but I think it should
motivate you and keep you grounded or whatever you want to say.  
There's many times I've thought about that and a few other things. And
especially when you're that close, you know, to something. We have beaten
Connecticut and that's surprised some people and then you're 40 minutes away
from going to the Final Four and then you get beat. No, I don't forget those
things. I wish I could. I'm not very good at that. I'm not very good at a lot
of things and that's one of them.  
  
Q. You mentioned kind of Pop is sometimes uptight. They have been playing
well lately. Is there anything you say heading into this game so they play
free and loose or that you've said to past teams that you think might help?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know, there are some things that have been said and
done that probably can't be repeated in the public and to be honest with you,
Kidd and Maddie have kind of become the things that they do and say and think
and whatever.  
It's like yesterday we walked out of the locker room and one of the nice
people in the hallway said: "If loose is good, you're in good shape." It's a
loose group. It really is. They really are, and I think that's good. There's a
lot of things that I have to do to stay out of the way, and I think a lot of
times, when you get to this point, you want things to go so well for them that
you make it worse for them.  
So I think they have had the ability to do that, and we have met a little bit
less, so we have kind of tried to‑‑ because sometimes, you can just give them
information overload and it's just like, come on. You overcoach it, you overdo
it, and I think we have tried to take the other approach; and, look, here are
two or three things that we have to think about and do, and the rest of it,
let's go compete and somebody make a shot at the right time.  
That's what this tournament is about. And especially in a one‑day turnaround,
you could be meeting all last night‑‑ whatever. I don't think that's going to
work. And I don't think, again, they get to enjoy it as much. They have got a
scouting report under their door before they went to bed last night and the
first time we will talk about Georgia will be in about 20 minutes.  
And it's the coach's job to get them ready, and it's their job to absorb it.
We'll practice, we'll have a short film session, meet tomorrow and let's go
play. Some teams, that's not a good idea, but this team, that's the best way
to manage it, and they have taught me that, I haven't taught them that, they
have taught me that and we have just followed their lead.  
  
Q. So many coaches talk about having seniors and leaders as an extension of
themselves on the court. With two seniors that start and obviously a third on
the team, can you talk about that dynamic?  
COACH FENNELLY: Our seniors have been really good. I think it's very
important, and I talked, at length, ad nauseam about being an Iowa State
senior. I'm a very senior‑oriented person, they are on all of our posters, all
of our media stuff. They understand the Iowa State way. There's a way we do
things at Iowa State; not saying it's right or wrong, but there's a way we do
them, and those kids have to translate that to the group.  
I tell every single senior when I meet with them at the beginning of the year:
Your goal is to leave a piece of you behind. You want to be remembered for who
you are as a player, and as a person. People will‑‑ there are seniors that
people still talk about at Iowa State, there are some former players. We want
them to be those kind of people and then teach the others, and I think they
have done that.  
Obviously Pop and Anna on the court have done a great job. Amanda Zimmerman is
a phenomenal teammate, has not played much, but the people on that bus and in
the locker room know how much they have meant to the team.  
We would not have gotten here without the dynamic on and off the court work of
those three kids.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
Q. How do you feel carrying over the defense to Monday night's game?  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: We played well. Our main focus is coming out hard on
defense and pressuring them. I think we did a good job of it the second half,
coming out and staying composed and just staying with that pressure, and I
think it eventually got to them about midway through the second half.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I totally agree with Anne Marie. We came out and executed our
game plan as far as playing defensive pressure and using that.  
  
Q. JJ, think you can carry that over to Monday?  
JASMINE JAMES: I just think that the way we played yesterday was great,
defensively and offensively, and it's important for us to be able to carry
that over into our game tomorrow, so I feel like that's definitely a good
start.  
  
Q. JJ, what stands out when you take a look at Iowa State this morning?  
JASMINE JAMES: One thing that I would say stands out is their size and the way
that they go about using it. I mean, they have players who have had pretty
good height but as well can step out and shoot it. They shoot the ball very
well. So more than anything, I just would say probably their size and their
ability to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. You saw the number of turnovers that Gonzaga was able to force on Iowa
State; do you think that you guys will have a similar ability to hassle them
like Gonzaga did?  
JASMINE JAMES: It's definitely a focus of ours, every night we go out on to
the court, to remove (ph) the other team as much as possible and to try to
cause as many turnovers as possible, so that will definitely be a focus of
ours. Not because of what Gonzaga did, but just because that's what we do. So
we are definitely going to go out and pressure the ball and continue to play
great defense like we have been.  
  
Q. I know all three of you will be playing in your ninth NCAA game, if you
can just talk a little about that experience from the last few years.  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: Just the legacy of the Georgia program and what Coach
Landers has done here going into the NCAA Tournament, and then when we get
there, just one game at a time. Every game is important, and we learned that
last year; you just can't take any game for granted, and you just have to show
up as well prepared for the game you're playing as you're going to show up for
the next one.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I totally agree with Anne Marie. Just being grateful to go to
the second round and do what we need to do and not taking it for granted, and
just focusing on what we need to do game‑in and game‑out.  
JASMINE JAMES: I think the experience is definitely a good thing to have but
it doesn't mean much if you don't really use it.  
So I think that one of the things that will be important is that we continue
to play and continue to practice, that we utilize the experience that we have
and we continue to talk up the younger players and we continue to keep our
team motivated and we continue to be ready to go.  
  
Q. Last night ‑‑ (inaudible) had the sprained ankle coming into the season,
how tough was it to deal with that and was it a long recovery process?   
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: Last night the biggest thing was just the frustration
with it, just coming in ready for senior year and just felt like I was really
prepared and just set me back a little bit. I think I'm definitely 100% ready
now. I think the biggest part is just the mental aspect and not being able to
do things the way that I had the year before and just finally getting back in
the groove.  
  
Q. And obviously ‑‑ (inaudible) leg injury, not sure what it was, did you
offer any advice? Seems kind of like a perfect thing a senior with a freshman?
  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I think the biggest thing is just your attitude. You
know, you've just got to stay positive, and she's fought through it and she's
had a really good attitude towards it. She comes to practice and she's still
struggling with her injury, and she still wants to do the sprints the same
shape. And I think that's just the way she's approaching her injury and just
the attitude she has really helped her out.  
  
Q. For the forward, what's going to be the key to keeping Iowa State off of
the line where they are just killing people on the free throw line? Try to be
tough and pressure them and also to stay out of foul trouble?  
JASMINE HASSELL: Some has to do with them but also has to do with our defense.
You have to play good defense to help with the guards pressuring the ball and
making it hard for the injury‑‑ just playing smart and being the aggressive
and not fouling, like you said. Just play hard.  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I would say with the four out, one in set, totally
pressuring‑‑ I just blanked out. No. 55, the 6‑7 girl, does a really good job
of reading for the next pass. So just pressuring her as much as possible and
not let being her use I guess her height as she does half of the court.  
  
Q. Does Iowa State remind you of anyone that you've seen in SEC play or do
you see any similarities between them and teams that you've played before, and
what can you draw from that?  
JASMINE JAMES: Yeah, I think that when we look at Iowa State, you just kind of
see bits and pieces from every team in the SEC almost. It's not like one
certain team.  
So I wouldn't say that it's really anything that we haven't seen before as far
as match‑ups and defensive schemes and things like that. But I definitely
can't just pick one particular team. They definitely have pieces, bits and
pieces from several different teams.  
  
Q. I know they are 14 ‑19 inside the paint and made 52 percent for the game;
any that strikes you, what you saw in the SEC, great shooting teams like that?
  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I would say just the post playing SEC, really physical
and I think that's something that we can relate to. Kelsey Bone (ph) shoots
really well from the floor, Bashaara Graves (ph), people like that are used to
banging in the post and shooting high percentage and I think that's something
that we can relate to as a team.  
  
Q. You and Iowa State played in the '99 regional final and you guys won. Do
you remember much of that game and anything that stands out about that
matchup?  
COACH LANDERS: Actually, I do, and I don't have great recall on a lot of games
but I do remember that game, because I think any time you have a player who
lights someone up like Kelly Miller did that night, it sticks.  
Iowa State, then, played almost entirely match‑up zone, and Kelly Miller, who
was a great player for us, scored over 2000 points‑‑ I forget the total, do
you know? Was it in the 30s? 33, yeah. She was terrific. She moved around the
perimeter and really did a great job of finding the open areas and catching
and shooting.  
And you know, it made it just really difficult for them defensively, and I
remember it, because I was so concerned about it going in. They did such a
good job with that zone. And you know, Kelly pretty much punched our ticket to
the Final Four that night.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that the height stuck out, you had not watched a lot
of video yet. Having seen more stuff, what besides the height sticks out to
you about this Iowa State team?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, things that don't really surprise me, you know, Anne
Marie made mention of something that probably goes unnoticed by casual
observers. The thing that‑‑ let me start over.  
They orchestrate well what they want to do. Billy has always done a terrific,
terrific job of coaching his teams, and this team is certainly no exception.
It's well thought out, it's well schemed and it's well executed, and it's well
called by him at appropriate times to take what he thinks the defense is going
to give up next. They really do a good job of that and their team executes
very, very well. They don't rattle very easily.  
Then I would go to this: You can have great sets and great schemes, but
players understanding how to best capitalize at the end of the day is what
makes them successful.  
Anne Marie alluded to something a moment ago that is so important that
probably would go unnoticed by a lot of people. Most players, when they have
the ball, are looking at something and seeing yes or no with the next pass.
Iowa State is looking at that going, yes. It might not be yes, I can make this
pass to Chelsea in the post, but it's, yes, if I pass the ball over here,
Chelsea is going to be wide open.  
They do a great job of reading the defense in the post and then moving the
ball right or left to the correct person who has the assist that's going in.
They are really, really good at doing that. They play within themselves. They
don't take bad shots. The shooters shoot. The schemes, they do what they need
to do with their schemes, screen, cut, to get their shooters those shots. But
they always have the interior option with the post up regardless of whether
you defended that cut that might lead to a three or not; well, they have a
second option they are going to. The point play is very, very good.  
It's very, very difficult. I've coached a long time, and told our team last
night when we were watching some film, it's hard to wrap your head around 220
assists. You look at a stat sheet and you look at an assist column, and it's
three digits. And it's not one hundred, it's 200. So she understands her role
and performs is very well.  
So there has to be‑‑ that has to be addressed as best we can. But it's a
complete basketball team with parts within it that can be moved around to
different positions. So they create a lot of problems or a lot of challenges
for you defensively.  
  
Q. Going back to Merritt Hempe, you said barring her injury this season, she
might have been a starter at this point. Can you talk about just having to
deal with the injury, how she's progressed and do you envision playing her
tomorrow?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, here's the downside of the injury. I've said forever,
fall is important to a basketball team. Preseason practices is where, what, 70
percent of what you're going to be, develops. It's where you become what
you're going to be during the season. And when a freshman misses it‑‑ it pains
me greatly when a freshman misses a day of practice, because I tell them, you
miss a day, it's like you're missing a week. It's tough.  
Juniors, seniors, I tell them, if you don't know what we're doing by now, you
weren't going to play, anyway. (Laughter). But for a freshman, there's just so
much on their plate; and to think that she missed weeks.  
You know, she's playing on her own abilities. She's playing with what she
brought from high school. She isn't playing with what we were able to give her
and develop in her. So that's a setback. There needs to be a continued
development of physicality, of aggressiveness, of a mental toughness.  
You know, she's trained and to some extent, she's okay with it, but it's not
where we want it to be. It's not where Cobi is, it's not where Tiaria is. And
it's simply because‑‑ it's not her fault and it's not my fault; if you're not
there, we can't do anything with it.  
To the point, tomorrow, she always has something to give. You know, I think
her size tomorrow, obviously could be important to us. Her rebounding ability
to be important to us. And the great thing about her, one of the great things
about her, and the fact that she wants to contribute something, will be a
great benefit tomorrow.  
You know, she's one of those kids that give us depth, and going into
tomorrow's game, that could be an asset because typically Iowa State does not
play a lot of people. And we tend to play nine or ten.  
  
Q. Bill was asked earlier about the differences between the Big12 and the
SEC, just the leagues and how they prepare you for the postseason. What are
the biggest differences that you see that might kind of be a pendulum swing in
the game in that sense?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, I don't know that either team has a real
advantage simply because both of those conferences are very, very competitive,
and both of those conferences‑‑ and this is‑‑ until you've walked in their
shoes and had to deal with this game in and game out, you can't appreciate the
next statement; I'm really sincere when I say this, being honest.  
Those teams in those two conferences are so well coached, you're challenged
every time you prepare your team. I suspect Billy is out there tweaking
something right now, changing something, putting a wrinkle into something.
We're going to go out there in a few minutes and do the same thing, because
I'm confident that Iowa State will be ready for what we like to do. And I'm
confident that we will be ready for what they like to do.  
Those are the leagues that we play in that challenge you in that regard. You
have to do that. If you don't, then you're going to run into teams that are
just better prepared than you are and your team is going to be at a
disadvantage. And I'm sure I speak for Billy and me on this, neither one of us
want our teams to be at a disadvantage.  
But from a competitive standpoint, Big12 is very, very good, Southeastern
Conference is very, very good, very good with athletes, very, very good with
outstanding individual players and both leagues are very well coached.  
  
Q. Following up more specifically what he was asking, Bill was trying to say
that their conference was more offensive ‑oriented and he thought the SEC was
tougher defense and tougher in general. Do you feel that way?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, I really can't speak like Billy can to his conference,
but I can speak to our conference. Our conference is very defensive‑oriented.
We play some ugly games in our league. We play some games that's hard as a
coach to get through, because of it.  
The scouting is over the top, the preparation and then the defense that people
go out and put into play with the knowledge that they have of their opponents,
it makes us very much a defensive league. And as far as the toughness piece,
you just have to be tough. You don't have a choice. If you're not tough, then
our league will grind you down.  
  
Q. Browsing the schedules, you both play in real tough conferences, and this
year, at least, non ‑conference, like Iowa State, you didn't schedule real
tough. What's your scheduling philosophy on how to approach that when you're
in a tough league like that?   
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, it's not the league necessarily that drives it.
We know what we are going to get with the league and we know we have no
control over the scheduling.  
Our schedule this year, we thought we had built really the perfect schedule
for the team that we were going to have. We have been short‑handed the last
three or four years. We have been very thin.  
We've played‑‑ you know, JJ played more minutes than anybody in the conference
in the last three years. We played over time games where she played 45
minutes. We've had a number of‑‑ in games, a year, two years ago, we've had
players in our starting lineup, three players that played 40 minutes, one
player played 38 minutes. We've been thin.  
And with this freshman class coming in, we felt it was important to build a
schedule where we could get them on the court in games and get them game
experience and get them to a point where when we got to the conference, they
could help us solve that depth problem.  
And I think we've been successful with that. I would say this: We thought
where we were disappointed with our schedule, we thought a couple of those
teams would be better. Georgia Tech has been a Top 15 team; this year, they
were not. Rutgers is a Top 15 team; this year, they were not. TCU
traditionally is a very, very good basketball team, and this year, they
struggled a little bit.  
So we had some games on there that still yet challenged us, really. But over
the course of the season, their seasons probably did not go like they
traditionally have gone in years past.  
  
Q. You have a matchup Spokane will really enjoy.  
COACH LANDERS: I think it will be a great basketball game, I really do. I
think to see if‑‑ there's a part of me, and coming from our league, all of the
things that we just talked about and defense being the focus and all that kind
of stuff, it's not going to surprise me if it's that kind of game, but it
really isn't going to surprise me if it's not, it's going to be interesting.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

IOWA STATE  72  
GONZAGA - 60

  
COACH GRAVES: First of all want to congratulate Iowa State and Coach Fennelly.
They are a terrific team. Every time there was a play that teed to be made,
they made it and that's what great teams do. I respect Coach Fennelly
immensely and he's a great role model, and I like that team. I really like how
they play and I wish them well.  
As far as Gonzaga, I told the kids in the locker room, first and foremost, I
mean everybody but one team feels the same after that last game.  
And we have a lot to be proud of. I think at the start of the year if you
would have told me we had be 27‑6 at the end of the season, I would have said
you're crazy.  
But I'm really proud of our team. I thought we made huge strides this year and
it was evident by getting to the NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately we came up
short tonight but I was proud of the effort and told our two seniors that I'm
really going to miss them. I thought they were great leaders and great
teammates this year.  
You know, we played hard and in the end, we just didn't make enough plays. I
thought we had opportunities, but 33 games, we've given up 70 or more points
one time, and it was tonight. Our defense was tested and unfortunately we
didn't pass the test.  
  
Q. Haiden, I think you hit your first 3 ‑pointer of the game and it seemed
like you guys really struggled from the perimeter tonight. How much of it was
their pressure defensively and how much was it you guys just missing open
looks?   
HAIDEN PALMER: I think a little bit of both. Just not missing shots that we
usually knock down. They had a little bit of pressure but even some of the
open looks just happened. So we tried to get it inside more and do some of
those things, but normally those are going in.  
  
Q. They had you for ten steals, so were you guys thinking that was going to
be the way you could beat this team is with the defensive intensity and
getting the crowd behind you?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, definitely. They have a great offense. They execute so
well, post players, shooters. So we just wanted to pressure them, do our best
to take them out of their offense but credit to them, they still made a lot of
good plays, even under pressure. So we still did our game plan but not good
enough.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you thought the three pointer was going to be a big part
of their arsenal, too.  
TAELOR KARR: Yeah, that's what they are known for. They have those three
inside kids, but they are always known to be a three‑point shooting team. 22
went off on us, Brynn; I know her from high school days. We lost track of her
a few times in the zone and she made us pay, along with other ones, too.  
We just had a few too many mental breakdowns in man and zone, and they were
scrambling and went late in shot clock. But then they hit timely shots at the
he have end. I think we played well, he with played hard, tough. We played
pretty physical considering with how big they are, but they just hit big
shots, so give them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Taelor, you played your last game in a 'Zag uniform, what are you feeling
right now?  
TAELOR KARR: Sad. It's tough to go out like this. But like Coach said, a lot
of teams except one. You have to give Iowa State credit, they are a good team
to go out on and I couldn't be more proud of my teammates. Played hard. So I
couldn't ask for better teammates, for sure.  
  
Q. You guys forked 23 turnovers, that's a pretty significant amount. What
wasn't working defensively for you guys?  
COACH GRAVES: I just think we made a few break downs late in the shot clock.
You know, we felt we had to do something like that. You see how we're built
inside where there was no way we are going to be able to go toe it toe with
them so we had to be able to make it some kind of a full‑court game and some
kind of a scrambling kind of game. It was almost feast or famine. We have to
steal or we gave up a pretty good look to them.  
Give them credit, they did not miss, every time they had an opportunity, they
made the most of it. And if you look at the stats, you know, really the
rebound was a factor but when you shoot 32 percent, you're going to give up a
lot of defensive rebounds but it really came down to the field goal
percentage. That was the disparity.  
And ten steals, that's got to be among the best ever, right, in a tournament
game. Where are the stats people out there.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, 32 percent from the field, was it the looks for you ‑‑
not getting great looks, or was it just one of those nights where the ball
wasn't falling?   
COACH GRAVES: Again I think like Haiden or one of the two said, it's a little
combination of both: They are long, and that size is noticeable, it's there.  
But the honest truth is I liked our looks tonight. I thought we had some
pretty good looks and we had some good second shot looks in the paint, one of
those things, the pressure of the moment, perhaps, defense, but when you're
playing teams like Iowa State or anybody in the NCAA Tournament, those things
can't happen. You have to step up and make shots and make plays and that's
what good teams do, and that's what Iowa State did tonight.  
  
Q. I know Shelby had early foul trouble, but then she sat for most of the
game, so what was going on there? And then, also, give me your perspective on
the efforts you got from your bench, people who really stepped up.  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, 25‑0 bench points, that's considerable. Had several
freshmen in the game tonight.  
You know, as far as Shelby goes, sometimes some teams are better match‑ups for
others and quite frankly, Keani and Shaniqua did a good job, and Stephanie
Golden, as well, they were playing better. So as a coach, you have to make
that decision, who you're going to go with.  
I thought honestly, I thought defensively, we had some letdowns in our post
area. You know, Williamson was open too many times in that corner, and we
weren't getting that coverage. So maybe you guys don't see what we're seeing
as a coach and we know what responsibilities we're trying to cover.  
But the future's bright. I mean, you look at this is a young basketball team,
including our transfer that's been sitting out this year. We have 11 freshmen
and sophomores. That's a good group that's coming back. So I like where we're
at.  
  
Q. You're real aggressive on the perimeter. How much of those good looks
they did get was because of that, and how much was because of stuff you didn't
do? Were you kind of leaning that way, knowing you might give those up?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, we are the type of team that puts a lot of pressure on the
basketball. We try to make things happen.  
Often times, we do give up some good looks because of that. You know, it's one
of those trade‑offs but we felt going in and game preparation, we were not
going to be able to sit back in a softer zone or man‑to‑man and give those
inside kids good looks.  
I thought early in the second half, that's where they got that lead. They did
a nice job of getting us‑‑ pinning us deep and made easy baskets, and so we
had to then kind of extend the defense a little bit and try to make some
things happen in that regard.  
And for the most part, hey, Iowa State doesn't get turned over 23 times very
often. And we made a lot of those count. We just didn't make enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Ten steals is four away from the NCAA record.  
COACH GRAVES: Four away, my goodness. Well, I'll tell Haiden it was closer.  
THE MODERATOR: And one away from the school record.  
  
Q. Speaking of, like you said, 11 sophomores and freshmen ‑‑ Meghan Winters,
could you have asked for a better senior leader, and Taelor Karr and
everything she's meant to the team the last two years?  
COACH GRAVES: I'm proud of all our seniors, Meghan Winters is an amazing
teammate. You have to have one of those players, we call her kind of a mother
hen. She gets everybody organized. She makes sure everybody is where they are
supposed to be and always does it with a smile and is a great leader. She won
115 games here in her four years and went to Sweet16 and Elite 8; twice
Sweet16 and once Elite 8, that's an amazing accomplishment for her.  
As far as Taelor goes, what a godsend, when she decided to transfer and come
here, she has‑‑ you know, she's become one of the favorites. People love her
here. Teammates love her and play for her. I'm really going to miss her.  
I'm telling you, she put her stamp on this program in two short years, and
that's difficult to do especially with the great players we've had through
here. She's so poised, has so much class and plays so hard. I'm really going
to miss her but, boy, she taught those young kids what it's like to be a
winner and what it's like to play hard and what it's like to play with class.  
I really appreciate Taelor and we are going to miss both Taelor and Meghan,
great question.  
  
Q. It's going to be the first time in five years you're not preparing for a
second round game. Any thought what tonight and tomorrow night is going to
feel like?  
COACH GRAVES: I might sleep. You know, those that know me, I don't sleep
during the season. If I get four hours in a night, that's a great night. Maybe
I'll get seven tomorrow.  
It's disappointing. You know, it really is. I don't have many hobbies other
than going to watch my kids do things. And I unfortunately won't watch much of
our tournament. It's tough after. But I'm really pulling for Iowa State.
That's a class outfit. Bill Fennelly is as good as there is, and those
players, they play the game the way the game is supposed to be played, so I
will be secretly rooting for them.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

IOWA STATE - 72  
GONZAGA - 60

  
COACH FENNELLY: That was a great environment for a women's college tournament.
The staff here, Joel Morgan and all the people here have done an amazing job
of creating a special atmosphere for the student athletes. The fans are great;
they know when to cheer.  
It was a great game. We beat a very good team in a tough environment and just
excited that we get to keep playing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about going against that defense, and why did you find
success throughout the night?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: I think with the zone pressure, Gonzaga did a very good job
of forcing the ball out of Nikki's hands, and whenever they did have it, they
would trap so she didn't have it, so they forced the team ball‑handling
aspect.  
We did a really goodjob of having players attack the zone; that way I was
getting open looks and other girls were getting open looks on the perimeter
and we were able to hit those shots. Everyone did a really good job of not
only making plays but making plays for their teammates.  
  
Q. Chelsea, there was that little burst to start the second half that got
you up by nine; what had you talked about to get going there in the second
half?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Just coming out strong. I mean, not backing down. We knew
that they were not going to back down. So we just had to come out, do our
thing, especially as seniors we needed to lead our team. Everybody just played
well together.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys were pretty excited in the game, but why does this one
kind of mean a lot to you guys after last year, too, kinda?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: Well, one, at this point in the season, any one is big,
because the next time you lose, you're done.  
And Coach really emphasizes not only is it the end of a season but for three
girls, it's end of their basketball career here wearing Iowa State jersey. So
kind to have play for them and know it's a huge win that we are having on the
road in a great environment and against a really good team.  
But at the end of the day, we celebrate this tonight, but tomorrow it's back
to work and looking forward to the next game.  
  
Q. Did you ever feel there was one certain turning point for you guys? It
was a weird game because you gradually pulled away in the second half, but is
there anything that stuck out in your mind as being the big difference?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Not exactly. We all just kept working hard, kept going at it.
I mean, there was awhile there where we were not playing very good defense and
we just stepped it up and just started grinding away.  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: Really, I think it was just turnovers that kind of were
taking us out of the game and letting us lose our lead. Honestly, the part I
thought, we really all came together was the one turnover in the corner that
was Hallie and Nikki‑‑ whenever she stepped over the base line, and we kind of
knew at that point that what's when the crowd was into it. And the easiest way
to stop a run like that is just do something good, do something positive.  
So to push the ball down and get shots, just to make up the bad stuff with
good stuff, you kind of have to even it out. So I think that was a real
turning point, and we all came together and knew that we needed to pick it up.  
  
Q. Brynn, did you get any sense that they were putting so much focus on the
inside players that it was opening stuff up; that you were able to slip out
and surprise them a little bit?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: Well, I think at the beginning of the half like when Pop
would take a few drives to the basket and we get to the ball on the inside and
she would get fueled, they knew we were looking to go to our inside game.  
But I think those two did a really good job of forcing the outside defenders
to help on them, that way it give us open shots. So really it because not
necessarily us finding our own shots but it was making our defense help them
that they got us the open shots that we got.  
  
Q. What's it say about the team that this was a difficult matchup in some
ways for you because of their pressure and that you did overcome it; what does
that say in your mind?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, it's kind of been the M.O. of this team for a long
time. They really do like each other. They work hard at it. The numbers, you
know, turn the ball over 23 times on the road, usually don't win those games,
but we defended well as we have been. We shot free throws well as we have
been. We made some shots at right times and it was a very difficult
environment.  
But I think playing in the Big12, our kids were a little more prepared for it
maybe than some other people. We beat a really good team in a tough place, but
the balance was good, every kid contributed, and I think it was an effort that
our team has kind of been given the last six weeks of the season.  
And as Brynn said, you know, we have three seniors that really enjoy the
moment and you want to keep playing, and we're very, very fortunate and
appreciative that we get that opportunity that we get to come back to practice
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Was there anything about Gonzaga that maybe you had not picked up and
caught you a little bit by surprise?  
COACH FENNELLY: Their halfcourt pressure defense, not by surprise, but they
really stuck with it. We kind of kept thinking they would change defenses
more.  
It was hard for us. We had a hard time getting by that first wave. When we
did, we got some shots, but I don't know if I've ever coached in a game where
a kid gotten steals. But you know, we take 27 less shots than them, but we
shot it well enough. We made our free throws. We continued to guard with a
purpose, and never panicked.  
Our team at times gets a little crazy and like most times, but I never really
thought that they showed that today. Maybe that one‑‑ we were up 31‑24 and
they scored a couple transition baskets. We had that glazed look in our eye,
but other than that, they handled it great and it was‑‑ they communicated that
to each other, and they have learned how to do that.  
  
Q. Like you said, picking your spots, in that second half, obviously
turnovers were a story, but you had that stretch I think from the second or
third media time ‑outs where you didn't have a turnover and stretched the lead
from three to nine; what does that say about the character of the team, just
grinding it out?  
COACH FENNELLY: That's kind of our team. For the people who have not seen us,
we are not the most aesthetic thing to watch sometimes, and we drive our fans
crazy, because we do turn the ball over.  
But our kids understand what they need to do, and we've always told them,
embrace who you are, don't apologize for what you're not, don't try to do
something you're not supposed to do, move on to the next play. And they have
done that.  
And we have overcome this a lot this year. For a team that's pretty good, we
turn the ball over way too much. But we have found other ways. That's kind of
how life is, you know, if you're not good at something, figure out a different
way. And for our team, the way we figured it out is guard decent, make free
throws, make some threes, and have three seniors that give us the leadership
and understanding of what it means to be a good team.  
So at this time of year, you want to see that happen, and certainly we made
enough shots today against a really good team to win the game.  
  
Q. Did you say anything to Nikki? She had I think that was probably one of
the more stressful games of the season. Just what can you say about her and
did you say anything to her?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, I really didn't. I think she was under duress the whole
game, and she's been that way a lot.  
But the only thing I told her was, this is where point guards‑‑ you know,
everyone talks about great point guard play in the NCAA Tournament. I told
her, part of what happens tonight will be a definition of who and what you're
going to be, not just today, but down the road.  
And she struggled near the end of the half. She was frustrated, and I didn't
have a chance to say anything to her because her teammates did. I think when
she hit that three, you know, she knows and our team knows, everyone knows,
the whole world knows, we have one person that can dribble on our team. And
Kidd can dribble a little. So we have one and a half.  
So I mean, everyone knows it. It's no surprise, and that's why, you know,
Kelly is such a good coach and you try to trap her and get the ball out of
Nikki's hand. But we got it out enough and made enough shots and got the ball
in the post. She had 11 assists and that's part of what her job is, and she
guarded really well today.  
  
Q. How do you balance shooting quickly against a team like that so you don't
have to be under duress? And then when you shoot quickly, it makes the game
faster against the team; did you tell them anything about that?  
COACH FENNELLY: I told them, shoot it before you throw it away. I just said,
shoot it. You have to look at it, let it go. Because every pass was an
adventure there for a few minutes, and when the ball is out of Nikki's hands
and people are making decisions, if you had an open look at it, we were
shooting it.  
We were going to play the game, and even when we were up eight or nine, I'm
like, let's go, let's go, play faster. We were tired but I just felt like our
best opportunity was to score before they had all five. If Nikki is looking at
five defenders in front of her organized, that was not good.  
So we just said, let's go, and I don't care if it's eight seconds into the
clock, 28 seconds into the clock, you have a shot that you shoot every day in
practice, shoot it. Luckily, we made just enough.  
  
Q. Palmer tonight, was there something you guys adjusted to on defense or
what did you see from your team the rest of the night?  
COACH FENNELLY: I thought we defended her pretty well. We were going to give
her the three, try to make her stay, shoot tough twos. Part of our defensive
philosophy is tough twos and don't foul. She's the kind of kid if you got her,
she's hard to guard, and used her length a little bit. But just said, stick
with the plan make her shoot the three. Not that she can't shoot a lot, but
she's 24‑for‑94 in the season and 1‑for‑8 tonight. We wanted to make her do
things she doesn't normally do, and she's taken a lot more shots that aren't
threes. We had to live with that a little bit, but that's the way we play. We
are kind of numbers geeks when it comes to that, and that's the way we played
it and I thought we defended her pretty well.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA  70  
MONTANA - 50

  
COACH LANDERS: You know, I think for the most part it was very much what we
thought it would be, a very physical and aggressive basketball game. I think
physical, because Montana enjoys that style, I think aggressive, because we
enjoy that style, and it was a very hard‑fought game by both teams.  
I was really pleased with the way our basketball team defended from the
beginning of the game to the end of the game, and I felt like that the desired
effect of that defense probably set in at somewhere around the 13‑minute mark
there in the second half.  
I felt like that we started to benefit from having played it the way that we
had played it at about that point with maybe Montana missing a few more shots;
us doing a better job of rebounding the ball, and then getting out in
transition and creating some plays.  
But overall, just a very hard‑fought game. You know, nothing but respect for
Montana, because they fought the fight. I thought as the game wore on, our
quickness on the defensive end started to separate us from them.  
  
Q. What does it mean to be able to advance to Monday's game after today's
win?  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: It's an honor because not a lot of teams get to make it to
the second round. It's just a good feeling.  
JASMINE HASSELL: It's a good feeling. We're pleased. But now it's time to
focus on the next game, and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. The game was at 38 ‑36 with you guys ahead, when suddenly it seemed like
you guys put the pedal to the metal and took off; can you talk about the 20 or
so run put on there?   
JASMINE HASSELL: I think the key to that was defensively. We started turning
them over, so there for we started making plays on the offensive ends. We all
started just buckling down and played good D.  
  
Q. How much talk was there maybe in the last 24 hours about what happened in
the first round last year and did any of those thoughts at all creep in when
they got within two and you guys made your run to pull away?  
JASMINE HASSELL: To be honest, last year wasn't brought up. And personally,
when it came to that tie, whatever, I didn't even think about it. I just knew
that our opportunity is now, and it's time to go and just there's no reason to
think about last year. Last year is in the past. It's time to move on. We are
in a new tournament, new team, so that's what we did.  
  
Q. Tell me about your first experience in the NCAA Tournament, this is your
first game. What did you think?  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: It was everything I expected, especially playing against
Montana, all the coaches already said that they were going to be physical, and
they brought all that physicality to the game. It was just a good feeling.  
  
Q. How did she do, Jasmine?  
JASMINE HASSELL: She did great (smiling).  
  
Q. What was the defensive goal? It seemed like you guys really tried to
extend your pressure and get in the passing lanes a lot, make it difficult for
them just to get even set into their offense.  
COACH LANDERS: Yeah, the extension wasn't by design. Our pressuring the ball
led us further and further away from the basket, which was a good thing,
because you know, if you go back and watch the first couple of possessions, we
are playing hard pressure on the ball at the three‑point line. And as the game
wore on, the ball started to slow down and kind of wait and hesitate and so we
had to go out and extend it.  
But simply put, the idea tonight was: Let's get as much pressure as we can on
the point. Not just on the bounce, but let's pressure her to the point of
release of the pass; so that we give ourselves a chance to get up in the
passing lanes and possibly deflect. And then, let's do that, all right.  
So we have A, pressure, pressure the point; B, let's get up in the passing
lanes and try to deflect, and as we are doing that, let's be aware of backdoor
opportunities and let's guard the backdoor. I thought we were really good the
first five minutes of the game right there. They threw the ball two or three
times on backdoor cuts, and then they kind of settled in, didn't want to throw
anymore, which is a great thing and allowed us to deny a little harder.  
And then let's stay focused. We did most everything we wanted to do. Let's
stay focused on 10, let's stay focused on 22, the perimeter airy offensive
players, and then let's not give up the three.  
Well, the three ball is where we became undisciplined. We accomplished every
objective we had defensively other than cleaning up after ourselves,
rebounding the ball. They got far too many offensive rebounds but they are
very good at it.  
And allowing as many threes as we did‑‑ you know, they were very good. You
have to give Montana credit for some of it. They were very good at taking
advantage of us being undisciplined. At times, we left our man, chase someone
else, and almost every time, they came back and found the open man and knocked
down a three.  
So that was the only piece of the objective we didn't meet.  
  
Q. Looking ahead at Iowa State, what concerns you?  
COACH LANDERS: Everything. At first glance, you have to be concerned about
them in every way. You know, they have unbelievably good height. They have an
exceptional point guard. They drop the threes with incredible efficiency, and
they do that throughout the lineup. Are you kidding me, six, seven, dropping
threes, wow.  
They are very well coached and they execute their stuff in the half court, and
when they want the three they know how to go about getting it. If they want to
put one of their giant kids up, they know how to do that, they are very good,
as most of Billy's teams have been, if not all of them have been good.  
You know, I know Iowa State, and I really think this is Billy's best team in a
long time. They are really good.  
  
Q. Since we are on the topic of Iowa State, they look like they played you
six kids, you go 11. Is depth going to have to be a difference for you
tomorrow, too, Monday?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, we are who we are and they are who they are.
Now you're introducing me to something that I'm not‑‑ I can't agree or
disagree with you because I don't know. I mean, okay, so they played that many
kids. Is that what they normally do? Because I don't know. I'm asking you.  
You know, because if that's what they do, and they do what they do, we do what
we do; you know, and we'll know more after we've played the game whether it's
an advantage or disadvantage.  
You know, really, today, I thought our depth was an advantage for us, because
our people came off the bench, played very well and made defensive plays. They
were locked in when they went on the court. They knew what we were doing. Just
couldn't see any drop‑off. They were very, very good. If they do that again,
Monday, then they could be an asset to us.  
But I don't know what ‑‑ how many people they normally play; if they play six
or seven, maybe we can wear on them a little bit. Maybe not, maybe not; maybe
they will slow it down.  
  
Q. I had asked you yesterday about your freshmen input this season and you
had spoken about Griffin and Barbee ‑‑  
COACH LANDERS: Do you like them?  
  
Q. I mean, four assists and no ‑‑ I don't have the final count, but no
turnovers for Griffin and I saw that play from Barbee at the halfcourt, you
must have loved that.   
COACH LANDERS: You like them, don't you.  
  
Q. Kind of my angle I'm going for.  
COACH LANDERS: We like them. (Laughs). You can see what I was talking about.
You know, I mean, they have a good sense, a good feel for the game. They are
tough kids defensively. They both have some growing to do offensively.  
You know, we'll get there with the offensive‑‑ they are very good offensive,
they have skills, they can shoot the three ball, they can put it on the deck.  
Knowing when you can make a play, and when it's not play day, is a big piece
of that transition from high school to college. I mean, most of these kids in
high school can make a play any time they want. Now they try and make it and
they end up, you know, in between three opponents trying to figure out how
they got their, what their name, and where they are at. That's a piece that we
have to continue to work on.  
But yeah, we love those kids. Marion is going to be a good one, Marjorie
Butler played well today. They have made us better.  
  
Q. One more on Iowa State, if you don't mind. Do you view stylistically how
you play and Iowa State plays similar in any ways, or do you think you are two
totally different teams?  
COACH LANDERS: I haven't watched them enough to really be definitive. I think
that what little bit I've seen, they are a team‑‑ they are team that I don't
know if I've seen enough to even say this, but they are a team that executes
very, very well. They flow into what they want to do. They are smooth
offensively.  
You know, and honestly, I had not watched them enough defensively to tell you
whether they are tough or sneaky or what, so I don't guess I can answer your
question. Yeah, all I know is they are big; they are really, really big; big;
big.  
Tomorrow I'll watch some tape and give you some better answers.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA  70  
MONTANA - 50

  
COACH SELVIG: Well, hats off to Georgia. You know, they are just a really,
really good basketball team and they are really good on the defensive end. You
know, I thought we executed pretty well. I thought we got enough shots to stay
in that game but I think it was 38‑36, and all of a sudden they scored quick.
I mean, they made plays when we had a little momentum going and you have to
give them credit. They have a lot of weapons and they play hard. Proud of my
ladies effort but hats off to Georgia.  
  
Q. Twice there in the second half, you pulled within two, the last being 38
‑36, Katie, what happened that it got away from you guys?   
KATIE BAKER: Like Coach said, they just made some plays and big plays and
basketball is a game of runs. You know, you're not in it all the time. They
got a wig momentum swing their way, a couple footballs, a couple big shots,
hit a couple big threes and just like that they are ahead again. But that's
basketball for you.  
  
Q. Katie, could you talk about how unique of a challenge it is trying to
cover Hassell; they are quick and they are thick. Just talk about that a
little.  
KATIE BAKER: Yeah, I mean, it's a different game down there, you know, in the
post play. It's very physical. I liked it, actually, getting able to battle
with such great, outstanding SEC posts down there. But it's different. They
are big. It's a team effort, though, and I think we did well for the most part
of helping in. We got a couple jump balls, but that's the game for them.  
  
Q. Alyssa, can you just talk overall about the game today, I saw the team
doing a lot of smiling there until the very end, imagine you wore proud of
your effort?  
ALYSSA SMITH: That he, that's one thing about our team this year, we are
always going to work hard. And you know, like Coach talks about, before we go
out on the court, have fun when you play hard, and that's true for me, and I
can speak on behalf of our entire team and we definitely worked hard tonight.
That's why it's difficult to lose, when you work your butt off.  
So, they are a good team. They played hard, too, and it wasn't a lack of
effort; it wasn't a lack of trying. It's just, you know, we didn't score as
many points as they did.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, I know it's fresh, but can you guys sum up your
careers as Lady Grizzlies.  
ALYSSA SMITH: You want us to start crying again?  
KATIE BAKER: You know, wow, I mean, what a blessing to play for the University
of Montana; and to meet the girls that I have and the runs that we've done.  
You know, thinking back to this last year, even capping it off with winning
the conference and winning the tournament, you know, it was a picture perfect
senior year for us, I can say. But it really just has been the best
opportunity, the best career, best decision that I personally have ever made.  
ALYSSA SMITH: I mean, ditto. I think that anyone who gets to play for the Lady
Grizzlies program is extremely lucky, and it's been a ride. It's been a roller
coast.  
But I mean, I definitely learned a lot and not just about basketball but about
life, too, and I can speak for myself, I've come a long way since freshman
year, and the ending of the season is like a new chapter of my life. I think
basketball ends, a new chapter starts, no more scholarship checks, I don't get
to see my teammates every single day.  
Playing for Rob has been one of the coolest things, one of the coolest
experiences I've ever been a part of. There's a reason why he was Coach of the
Year, there's a reason why we won the Big Sky Championship and there's a
reason why we're here today.  
Yeah, I mean, it would take forever to sum it up I think completely, but I
wouldn't have had my last four years any other way.  
  
Q. After you get out early and spend a lot of energy trying to come back and
trying to tie the game, talk about how tough it is when you can't do that.  
KATIE BAKER: Yeah, it's frustrating when you dig yourself a hole. And like I
said basketball is a game of runs. They get up, they make a few big shots,
they take the lead as it seems and it seems like you're down. But I mean, then
we hit shots and we come back or we get a stop on defense.  
You know, that's why I love the game of basketball. Hopefully if you're
playing hard and your fight is there, we had multiple chances. We had some
good shots and good looks tonight, and you know, they just weren't falling for
us.  
And it is frustrating but like Alyssa said, it wasn't for a lack of effort and
it wasn't for a lack of fight. I can speak for everyone that we left it all
out on the court.  
ALYSSA SMITH: I think one thing is, you know, we got a lot of stops on
defense. We out‑rebounded them, I'm pretty sure we out‑rebounded them. I could
be wrong but anyways, I mean, we didn't convert as well as they did. We didn't
score off the steals. We didn't score off their turnovers and that was a huge
thing for us.  
We got a lot of great looks and they just didn't fall for us. That's
frustrating, because who knows, on any other night, sometimes those shots do
fall for us. But they applied a lot of pressure, which is something that, you
know, I mean, they are an athletic team and they are quick, and we have played
against teams like that earlier on in the season.  
But it is tough to play against and it kind of gets you out of sorts
sometimes. It's hard to come back against a team like that, especially when we
do dig ourselves a hole, we have to be able to convert, which we weren't able
to do tonight.  
  
Q. I don't know what your game plan was, but I imagine you did everything
you wanted to do except make shots maybe.  
COACH SELVIG: Yeah, and you have to give some of that to Georgia. They are
pretty good defensively. I thought we did a pretty good job of getting shots,
but we had 11 turnovers at the half and that was their pressure that did that.
We haven't seen as good of pressure as they have put on us this year and the
kind of pressure; so we end up with 20 turnovers, which against them isn't
horrible.  
We had enough good shots, so that game could have gone‑‑ we could have stayed
with them. What they did is when those spurts, like when we were at two, that
score, they transitioned a couple of those to steal a basket and nail a three,
and they did it so quickly, and we never scored that quickly. It was just
tough.  
  
Q. What was the attitude of the team at halftime?  
COACH SELVIG: Yeah, I mean, we are pretty fired up. We had a slow start in
that game, and we finally started coming back and making shots and finally
started getting some stops. There were stretches in this game where they had a
hard time scoring. They still end up getting 70, because boom, boom, they
scored so fast.  
But I think, what was it at half, 32‑25, that's very manageable, and that was
after a slow start for us. I felt we would get better against their pressure
just because we threw it around the gym a little bit early, because I think we
were a little excited.  
So they were fired up. We came out, the start of the second half is always
important and I thought we didn't take control of the game but we certainly
were assertive and got it right down to where it was hopefully going to go
down to the wire type game.  
But again, Georgia did a heck of a job, they hit big shots when they needed
it, and they hit two threes when they needed it and they started getting into
Hassell late there. They played better than us. They had more weapons to score
tonight.  
  
Q. Maybe not what you wanted there at the end, but having all those young
girls, what does this mean for those girls moving forward?  
COACH SELVIG: I think it's valuable. Being in the NCAAs, which we've had the
good fortune to be some and I think we were two years ago, I think it
motivates the kids. It's a great atmosphere here.  
Gonzaga, because they have a great following, it's a great atmosphere, we are
playing the SEC, one of the premiere programs in the nation, we played them
toe‑to‑toe most of the game and those are the kind of things that should fire
you up.  
We always play ten‑deep, we didn't have Shanae; wish we would have had her
tonight. But a couple kids who have not played as much got in tonight and they
played well in practice. I think the experience is valuable, not only to be a
better basketball but just for your college experience. I'm very happy that
our kids get to do this.  
  
Q. Looking at this group of seniors that you're going to be losing what have
they meant to you for your time here?  
COACH SELVIG: They are serious basketball players. They want to win, they want
to compete, they want to get better, and they are great people. I mean, it's
all you can ask for as a coach.  
And as they said, and it is really true, there wasn't‑‑ actually all four of
them, there wasn't a drill in practice or a minute in a game where they
weren't competing like crazy, and that's what I ask of them; they don't play
perfect, but it was never for lack of effort and they are just why you coach.
They are great people and fun to be around and they have enriched my life.  
  
Q. Specifically, talking about Katie and Alyssa, very emotional for them.  
COACH SELVIG: Yeah, it's always hard. They accomplished a lot of what they
wanted‑‑ they were so determined this year, we are going to bring the
tournament back to Missoula and go to the NCAA; we went to quite a few; we
didn't go to a couple.  
They were so thrilled when we did that, and they‑‑ you know, we lost some
games where we didn't play very well this year and I'm sure some people
probably thought we weren't very good but they never ever‑‑ they knew what was
going to happen. I didn't know we were going to do that necessarily.  
I told them, I said, you guys made believers out of me. In fact, every time
they lost a game, they came back with a vengeance, and bounced back, where you
might get discouraged they got motivated. Alyssa and Katie, can't remember a
drill that it wasn't giving everything they had. Boy, that's fun to be around.  
  
Q. If you could say something about Torry, it seemed like she came a long
way at point guard?  
COACH SELVIG: She played well tonight, had a little shaky start, turned it
over. Their pressure was not all Torry's fault, but she made big shots.  
What Torry's become, you look at her and think, she doesn't look very fast and
quick; she has become a really good defender. She did some brilliant things on
defense tonight, not only pressuring kids that look an awful lot quicker than
her but she was in help and her mind‑‑ she's someone I never said for two
years that she ever did anything good on defense.  
The lights clicked on for her, and so I'm really proud and she's become a
play‑making guard. She kind of scoots around out there. I thought she really
played well tonight after that little bit shaky start.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SPOKANE)

### [Jasmine Hassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21800)

### [Jasmine James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22148)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We want to welcome you to the third press conference today.
Today we have Georgia Lady Bulldogs Head Coach Andy Landers, and we have
players Jasmine Hassell and Jasmine James.  
We'll start with questions for the student‑athletes and get to Coach after
that.  
  
Q. This is for Jasmine Hassell. I just want to ask about your defense. You
guys have played great defense this season. What do you like about it? Just
talk about the pride there in how well you play defense.  
JASMINE HASSELL: We play defense well. We've always had a hunger playing
defense. Defense leads to offense. I love playing the defense to help with the
offense. We just like doing that, and that's what we hang our hats on.  
JASMINE JAMES: Just to kind of go off of what she said, I kind of agree it
leads to easy offense for us. If we don't have a great offense, we understand
that, if we go to the other end and we get stops and get steals and stuff like
that, and it may be able lead to easy points for us to get us going.  
Defense has been a big thing for us all year long and will continue to be as
we work our way through the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Jasmine James, it seems like it's been a long time since you played a
ball game. Could you just talk a little bit about that.  
JASMINE JAMES: I think that you can look at that two ways. I think that you
can look at it as you're not really playing games, you're practicing, or you
can look at it as a good thing because you're not playing games, you're
practicing.  
When you're practicing, it's giving you opportunities to improve on the things
that you need to improve upon as well as just try to get better as a team.
We've had quite a while now since our last game to try to get better. I think
it's been a good thing for us.  
  
Q. Jasmine Hassell, I know you ended the year with a real strong
performance. How does that play into your game, having the layoff, after
having such a great finish to the season?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I think as a group, we all just have gotten to regroup and do
what we need to do to make this journey through the NCAA Tournament. I think
we're all excited and ready to go.  
  
Q. Ladies, what can you tell me about what you know about Montana? Start
with you, Jasmine Hassell.  
JASMINE HASSELL: Well, they play defense, and they play offense. We know that
we have to play hard. We know that we have to execute and do the small things.  
JASMINE JAMES: I'll say this. Montana is a good team. They're here in the NCAA
Tournament.  
As we've taken some time to look, we've identified who some of their key
players are, of course, and just understand that they're a real good
all‑around team. They shoot the ball really well.  
We understand that we're going to have to come out and play hard and play good
defense in order to come out with the win. But we do understand that Montana
is a good team.  
  
Q. I know you both have been in the NCAA Tournament quite a few times. Coach
Landers has been there many, many times. Talk about the experience that you've
had previously of being in the NCAA Tournament and how that will help you
today. Go ahead, Jasmine Hassell.  
JASMINE HASSELL: We have been here a lot of times, and we don't want to take
that for granted because to be in the NCAA Tournament, it's a big thing.  
As far as experience, it will help us because we kind of know what to expect.
Once again, we don't want to take it for granted. We want to take each game
one day at a time and do what we need to do.  
JASMINE JAMES: I agree. We've been here now, this is our fourth year in the
NCAA Tournament, and it's definitely something that you can't take for
granted. Having the experience is a good thing. You come in your freshman
year, and you don't really know what to expect. Here we are seniors, and we've
been here every year now. It's like we know what to expect so we can talk to
the other players about what it is we need to do, and we know how we need to
come out and how we need to perform. So having that experience will be a good
thing for us.  
  
Q. J.J., I was just curious if you have any feelings on having to play
Montana three hours from Missoula. You're a higher seed than them. Does it
bother you at all?  
JASMINE JAMES: I wouldn't say it really bothers us much at all. In the SEC,
you have to go out night in and night out playing in front of crowds of
thousands and being able to come out with wins. I think it will be a good
thing, period, to have a good crowd, whether it's their fans or our fans. So
I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Have either of you players been this close to the Pacific Northwest
before? Or do any of your teammates have any connections with anybody out west
here?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I don't believe so.  
JASMINE JAMES: I don't think so.  
  
Q. Just a shot in the dark.  
THE MODERATOR: No other questions for the student‑athletes. Appreciate your
time.  
Now we'll open it up for questions for Coach Landers.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. I'll ask you what I asked the players. You can't help but be
impressed with allowing 53 points a game. When the defense is clicking, what
do you like about that side of the ball for your team?  
COACH LANDERS: I think the first thing that I've appreciated about our defense
and about our basketball team in general is that it's been very consistent.
Our team has done an outstanding job of making the effort to do things that
not everybody wants to do. That's probably what impresses me the most.  
When it's really clicking, we're doing the things that not everybody wants to
do. We'll step in and take a charge. We'll leave our man to help guard your
man. We spread the floor to eliminate the possibility of transitions, just a
lot of little things going to making it as effective as it has been.  
Probably when you look at it, to be more specific to your question, probably
when I look at it, what impresses me about it is that we really do spend a lot
of energy. When I look out on the court and I'm watching our team play, they
expend a lot of energy getting it done. They're not a group that we have to
beg during time‑outs to play hard. They tend to play hard every time out.  
  
Q. Andy, how well do you know Robin Selvig, and how kind of rare is this
opportunity to have two coaches who have so much experience and success?  
COACH LANDERS: We're old, yeah. You know, how well do you know Robin? Okay. I
ask you that because I feel like I've known Robin for a long time, and I have.
And I feel like that I know him‑‑ I feel like that we have this connection,
but I can't say that we've talked a lot.  
When we've had the occasion to, whether it's been recruiting in the summer or
playing in the same tournaments, our paths have crossed. We sit down, and we
visit for a few minutes, and I've always enjoyed that. But because we both
have been at this for such a long period of time and I met him a long time
ago, I feel like it's an old friend, but it isn't. That's why I asked you how
well you knew him.  
My take is that ‑‑ first of all, we're, what, 2,000 miles apart. So it's not
like our paths cross a great deal, but I have great respect for him. The job
that he's done in Montana commands respect.  
I think when someone has been able to stay at a place, maintain a high level
of competitiveness as long as he has, it also makes a tremendous statement
about him as a person because most of us mess it up somewhere along the way.
And Robin is just a class guy. I've really enjoyed the relationship that we've
had.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess it's hard to predict what will happen once the ball is
tipped off, but you can't help but look at what Montana has done now
defensively. That's an area where they take pride.  
COACH LANDERS: They're very good.  
  
Q. It seems like it's tailor ‑made for a game in the 50s, but could you just
talk about their defense.   
COACH LANDERS: I would love to. They're very, very good. I think a lot of
things make them effective on the defensive end, but first of all, they're one
of the few teams that tend to switch everything when they're in man to man.  
So opponents, I would suspect, unless basketball in this part of the country
is very different from everywhere else we've been‑‑ and I don't think it is‑‑
not many teams switch 1 through 5. They do that. So that's an adjustment that
offensive teams have to make. You have to address that offensively, and most
offenses aren't designed to take advantage of switches. They're designed to
screen and get cutters open. So they're very, very good at what they do there.  
Then if they choose to go to the zone, it isn't your traditional zone. It's
your matchup zone. And they do a very, very good job with it. So defensively,
you have the box. The box for defense in basketball is man to man or zone, and
it's not as if Montana is doing something abstract. They're not. They're just
outside the box.  
They're switching man to man and their matchup zone. So they require a
different preparation and a different mindset, and I would suspect‑‑ there's a
couple of teams in our conference that play matchup, and when you only have a
day or two days to prepare for those teams, it's a real burden.  
Now there isn't anyone in our conference that switches everything 1 through 5
and/or also plays matchup. So I can imagine the challenge that that presents
to the teams that they've played during a regular conference schedule where
games are two or three games or two or three days apart.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any team on your schedule that is similar to Montana?  
COACH LANDERS: I haven't looked back‑‑ I'll think for just a second, or I'll
try to.  
From a defensive perspective, no. From an offensive perspective, there are
two, three teams in our league that enjoy the three as Montana does and also
have excellent two‑man capabilities with an outstanding wing and post player
and versatile post players. That piece, their offensive tendencies will not be
too foreign to us.  
  
Q. Coach, when going up against a team from a smaller conference, how much
do you think your strength of schedule helps you in a game like this?  
COACH LANDERS: I hope a lot. But, again, you don't ever know until the ball is
tipped up. First of all, you don't know how your team is going to play. You
prepare for them to play well, but they don't always play their best game. You
don't know how the other team is going to play.  
Your question is a fair one, and it's a good one, but it isn't one that we
answer or try to posture with ourselves. We've played a lot of teams who
weren't in the Southeastern Conference who were very, very good. There's just
a lot of good teams out there. Montana is one of those teams.  
You don't have to be from the ACC or Big 12 or wherever to be a quality team.
Montana is very well coached. They're very disciplined in what they do.
They're well drilled in what they do. And what conference they come from isn't
anything that we feel is important. That we come out and attempt to play the
best we can play is what's important.  
  
Q. Coach, you incorporated so many freshmen this season. I was reading
through the media guide, and you kind of said leading into this it was going
to be interesting to see how that adaptation process would go. You must be
almost so proud and impressed by how that's gone. Can you just speak about the
growth of the freshmen this season.  
COACH LANDERS: It has been a lot of fun. We felt like for the last couple of
years ‑‑ this really isn't what you're talking about, but I'll set it up.
We're excited for a lot of reasons, and this is just part of it.  
The last couple of years, we've been a thin basketball team. We haven't had a
lot of depth. We've gone to NCAA Tournaments with seven kids, with eight kids,
with nine kids. We brought in a freshman class, and we had returning a big
senior class. We really thought it was a great opportunity for us to create
some depth by depending on our seniors and getting the freshmen involved,
ready‑‑ first of all, getting them ready to play in, and then giving them an
opportunity to play early on and bringing them along. That was the plan.  
What we didn't know was that we had a couple of freshmen who were exceptional,
exceptional in their head, that they could actually come out and look at me
while I'm talking, as you are, and get it, if I told them we needed it.  
Deep cut, take three steps, and back door, then throw your basket hand up in
the air, they got it. You don't have to draw it up. You don't have to create a
drill. They got it. We realized that very early in practice. We had a couple
of kids that were just going to come really, really quick with their
development.  
Cobi Barbee and Tiaria Griffin. Barbee has started every game. In fact, was
named to the All‑Defensive team in the Southeastern Conference as a freshman,
which is really a heck of a note. Griffin has started the last month or so
because she's one that needed to develop a little bit more and has, but she's
also one that has listened, who has, when you asked her to do something,
turned around and done it.  
And then the big thing, where those two are really, really different, is when
you come back the next day, they still got it, and they're still doing it. You
don't have to repeat it.  
And then the third one, Merritt Hempe, had she not hurt her foot, she might
have been starting right now too, but she was out like seven weeks or
something ridiculous with a foot injury. But when she went out the first time,
she was our leading rebounder and was really doing a nice job as well.  
So it is an exceptional group. And while we thought they were going to be the
depth piece, they've allowed us to have more depth, but they've actually moved
up the pecking order and become primary players for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start our second conference today with Gonzaga.  
We'll begin with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Taelor, coming from the Big 12, what scouting report have you given about
any players that you might know off of Iowa State?  
TAELOR KARR: Just overall that they're a great team. They've changed a lot. I
haven't played against them for two years. I remember they have a lot of skill
inside and out. They have a great coaching staff. Always well‑prepared. They
play hard. They've got a lot of good kids inside, a lot of experience. Their
seniors, guards can shoot it, they're quick.  
We need to hustle, play hard, see what we could do. Other than, they're a
great team, and we're going to have to match their intensity, for sure.  
  
Q. Haiden, we know that Gonzaga has been at the tournament now for four
straight years. Think about a lot of experience for the Gonzaga program.
Really you three are the only ones with a lot of tournament minutes. How do
you think that's going to play out?  
HAIDEN PALMER: I just think we have to show that leadership on the court, stay
composed, confident, because we've been here before. Iowa State is a great
team. We know we have to come focused, play hard for 40 minutes. It's a good
goal for us to have out there, help uplift our other players and help them to
play their game.  
  
Q. Jazmine, as a point guard, in watching their point guard, what she's been
able to accomplish, what do you see there?  
JAZMINE REDMON: I'm sorry. I'm nervous. She has a lot of assists. She's a
really good point guard. I feel like a lot of people can take good from what
she does. She's a really good point guard and she leads their team in assists.
She's just a good point guard, I'd say.  
  
Q. Taelor, having played in both conferences, how would you compare the
differences playing in the Big 12?  
TAELOR KARR: Both are great conferences overall. I think the 12 is a little
bit more physical. That's one thing we're really going to have to key in on
for this game. Like I said, they have three inside kids that were all Big 12
selections, they're seniors, they play a lot of minutes. Our posts are capable
of that, but they haven't had to do that a lot this year. Definitely worried
about their size, their physicality.  
We're capable of it. We just got to hustle, play hard and see what happens.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be at home here at Gonzaga, to be able to play in
front of your home crowd?  
JAZMINE REDMAN: I feel like our team is privileged to be playing at home.
Really excited. We're just thankful that we got to play at home front of our
fans.  
HAIDEN PALMER: Same thing. I feel like it's an honor to be able to play in
front of people that believe in us. We want to give them a good show, make
sure we're playing our game, playing with passion, playing hard, give them
something to be excited about.  
TAELOR KARR: Same thing. Just feel great to be playing right now, being in the
tournament. There are a lot of players that are home, their seasons are over.
We're very excited about that.  
Playing in front of the home crowd here is great. My senior year, last time,
last go around, I want to play my best, see what happens.  
  
Q. Haiden, one thing that Iowa State mentioned is they don't play a lot of
pressure defense that Gonzaga does. Do you think that can give you a leg up in
this game?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Both ways. They have some things we have to take away. We have
things they have to take away from us. That's one of the things. I know we
want to try to pressure them to play aggressive and hard just because they
play such a physical game. We need to step up on our side and match their
intensity, match their physicality.  
  
Q. Has there been any mention, talk about how this is a similar setup to two
years ago where you not only got to play the first two rounds at home, but
you're in the regional played across town at the arena?  
TAELOR KARR: We talked about it, it's been mentioned, but we don't want to
focus on anything except this game tomorrow. You're not guaranteed anything
but tomorrow's game. We have to go play hard. If we get that done, we work on
Monday. We don't want to look too far ahead. See if we can keep going, play
some more games in Spokane, that would be awesome.  
  
Q. For any of the student ‑athletes. When you look at Iowa State's front
court, have you faced a team you can draw comparison to?   
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, Iowa State, they have aggressive post players. We have
some tall post players as well. We just want to make sure we match that, play
just as aggressive. I think that's key for us. Like he was saying, us three
are the ones that played a lot with experience. We need to make sure our post
players are up to par and just excited and believe in themselves because we're
supposed to be here just like all the other teams.  
We want to play aggressive, play with confidence, kind of take that positive
they have away from us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student‑athletes and continue with coach.  
  
Q. What was that moment like this morning when you had three coaches in your
office, the amount of success and history right here?  
COACH GRAVES: You know, it was a thrill. That's terrific company, just like I
said. Three Hall of Fame coaches really. I feel like the poor schmuck in the
group.  
People I look up to, it was humbling to have them all there. I think that's
unique, to just have a chance to talk for a little bit, the four of us, while
the rest of the group was in the meeting.  
Coach Fennelly I've looked up to for years. He's a great coach. I followed
him. We were both assistants at one time together. To see what he's done is
just incredible, what he's built in Ames and before that even.  
Coach Landers and Coach Selvig, they're legends. I think there's only five or
six coaches in the women's game who have coached more than a thousand games,
and two of them are here. That's incredible.  
It was neat for me. I was like the little kid who wants the autograph. Do you
guys mind if I get a picture? That's something I'll remember forever. Not that
I'm young. I mean, I'm 50. A bunch of old guys in this little quad.  
  
Q. The night of the draw, you were immediately pointing out their size
inside, speculating about what you were going to do. With a guard covering a
big person, how will that play out?  
COACH GRAVES: I don't know. We'll see tomorrow. We have a plan for them. We've
played some teams that have that kind of size. We have a 6'7" player in our
conference, too, but not with three players. We're going to have to be
creative. We're going to have to switch up, see some lineups we haven't played
with a lot together tomorrow.  
But I'm confident in our team. They're competitors. We'll compete. We'll do
what we can defensively. My staff, I trust them and I think we can come up
with a good game plan. I don't want to reveal that now, but anytime you play
Iowa State, from all the tape that I've seen, I'll tell you, they execute as
well as any team in the country, and they do a nice job.  
I'm sure they've seen every kind of defense against that versatile frontline.
We're going to take a little bit of what other people have done and mesh it
into what we need to do.  
I'll tell you, they use that advantage very well.  
  
Q. Haiden mentioned Ohio State with the tall frontline. Can you take from
that game when you're game planning for this one?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, we draw on every opponent we've played. That's the team
we've become. I can say in the Ohio State game, it didn't end well for us. I
think we're a different team.  
From those people that have watched us day one, we were pretty ugly in
November and December, our inside kids have really improved. That's where
we've made our biggest stride. I think we'll be able to handle that a little
bit better this time around because we are more experienced.  
But this is a formidable frontline, there's no question about it. We're going
to have to be on our game and we can't do it one‑on‑one.  
  
Q. One of the secrets to your success has also been your bench. Do you see
that as an advantage heading into this game?  
COACH GRAVES: I think this time of year there's always an X‑factor. You look
at their best players, our best players. Oftentimes in things like this, they
cancel out, maybe that player you didn't expect to step up does. I don't know
who that is. We've had a different one it seems like every night.  
I'm just hopeful that somebody does, somebody has that game where you go, Wow,
you really needed her tonight. We'll see how that plays out. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. This is a terrific free ‑throw shooting team, Iowa State. What's happened
there? Even Haiden doesn't shoot that well from the free‑throw line, and you
think she would.   
COACH GRAVES: Hopefully there aren't very many fouls then tomorrow on either
side, and that might work to our advantage.  
You're right. We always have late‑game strategy, who we need to foul late in
the game. There's nobody you can put on the line on their side.  
As far as we're concerned, if you look at our percentages, listen, we shoot
better at the end of the game, I'll tell you that. The kids who are in the
game, you look at their free‑throw percentages, they're a little bit better
than you might think. Definitely been an issue this year. What do you do about
them? We make them in practice, so...  
  
Q. How is Taelor? Is she back to 100%?  
COACH GRAVES: I think she's doing fine. I don't think she's 100%.  
This time of year after 32, 33 games, I don't think anybody's 100%. That's why
I like the fact we have some depth.  
But she's tough. She's a tough young woman. Like she said, she's a senior and
she's going to give it everything she has, lay it on the line, as they all
will, as Iowa State will.  
  
Q. Bill was saying earlier, watching you on tape reminds him a lot of you
guys. Do you see that similarity watching Iowa State? Does it help you prepare
knowing they're a lot like you or is it a little tougher?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I'd like to think it's a little tougher because we play a
good style of basketball.  
What I like about Bill and his program is I think they play the right way.
They share the basketball. It's a finesse still, even though they are very
physical. But they have skilled players. I think that's the way the game
should be played.  
I've been very impressed with them. They don't have many holes, which
frustrates me. We're going to have to find some.  
But, yeah, I do think we're similar. I mentioned to somebody earlier. We were
a Midwest school or they were a West Coast school, we'd probably recruit each
other a lot because we like the same kind of players, it looks like. I think
we coach similarly.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SPOKANE)

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Chelsea Poppens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24893)

### [Anna Prins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20665)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome everyone to Spokane and Gonzaga University
for the press conferences today. First one we have up is Iowa State. We have
with us today, Bill Fennelly, the head coach. Also, the student‑athletes we
have with us are Chelsea Poppens and Anna Prins.  
We'll open it up for questions, first of all, for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Start with Anna. One of the concerns that Gonzaga had coming into the
year was the inside play. So what have you noticed, as an inside player, that
they have? Do you think they've made their strides along the way?  
ANNA PRINS: Something I noticed, just watching film, they do have some girls
that are taller, which, I don't know, it's exciting for me because I like to
play against taller players, and they're very good.  
So I think‑‑ I'm not really familiar with their season as a whole, but they
looked really good to me. I'm just excited to play.  
  
Q. Chelsea, just your general reaction to being the 5 seed and being
recognized for 23 wins this year, but then having to go play somebody on their
home court in the first round.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: We're just happy to be able to make it this far and be able
to be one of the few teams that are still competing at this time. We're just
ready to go in and play our best.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you guys are used to coming to this tournament. Gonzaga is used
to coming to the tournament too. So how do you think that's going to play out,
all the experience that the players have in this situation?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: It's going to be a fun game. Everybody knowing what to
expect. Giving the freshmen a new experience, and they're having fun with it.  
Just being able to compete against such a great team who know how to play, and
it's going to be a good challenge. That's what we're looking forward to.  
  
Q. Anna, you're averaging about 20 points over the last four games to kind
of close the season. What's changed for you during that stretch where you've
been able to have success scoring?  
ANNA PRINS: I don't know. I just think‑‑ I mean, it definitely is different
being a senior, just realizing how close to the end you are.  
I don't really necessarily look at it as an individual thing. I think just it
helps that us as a team, we're playing really well together. The past few
games, it feels like we were really gelling together, and I guess these sorts
of things were happening that normally don't.  
I think just letting go and playing because you realize that there aren't many
games left and you want to get the most out of them as you can.  
  
Q. Chelsea, they always get good support here at Gonzaga. You get good
support at Iowa too. What is it like for Iowa kids growing up thinking about
where they want to play and how they end up at Iowa State?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, I came from a small town, and just being able to play
at a D‑I school was fantastic, and Iowa State had great aspects of it that I‑‑
that came into play when I decided to go to Iowa State.  
The atmosphere, the program, the people there, the coaching staff, the
teammates‑‑ it was kind of like a big old family‑based program, and that's
what I liked about it. The town is a big town, but it has a small town feel.
Everyone is there to support you, and the fan base is just amazing there.  
That all came into play when I chose Iowa State.  
  
Q. For either player, do you have any connection to this area or any
connections to the Gonzaga team that you've become aware of?  
ANNA PRINS: I just found out I have some family here I didn't know about. On
my grandma's side.  
  
Q. [No microphone].  
ANNA PRINS: They're actually Gonzaga fans, obviously.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: No. I have a few family in Seattle, but they're coming to
support us. Other than that, I don't really have any connections here.  
  
Q. Maybe both players, starting with Chelsea, tell us about how playing in
the Big 12 this year, especially playing against Baylor, helps you to play on
this kind of stage.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Playing in the Big 12 with all these great teams, everyone's
tough, anyone can win on a given night. It just depends on who wants it more.  
And just being able to compete against each and every one of these teams has
just been a great experience in our four years. It's really prepared us for
like playing against other teams in the NCAA Tournament. It's just been great
to compete against the best.  
ANNA PRINS: Ditto. I mean, I agree with Chelsea, everything she said.  
The Big 12 is a great conference to play in. Every game, like she said, is a
challenge. It's really fun to play in this conference. You can play against
some of the best players in the nation every night that we play, and I think
it does definitely prepare you for later in the season, especially right now.  
Just kind of giving you that confidence that you can compete against the best.
I don't know, it's been a fun ride.  
THE MODERATOR: No more questions for the student‑athletes. We'll excuse them.  
Now we'll be able to direct questions to Bill Fennelly. I'd also like to
mention that Matt Schultz is the sports information director. He's right in
the back.  
Now Coach Fennelly.  
  
Q. Bill, what are the major challenges when you are the higher seed but
you're coming in to play someone on their home floor?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know that the seeding really has anything to do with
it. The challenge is we're going to play a great team.  
When you get to the NCAA Tournament, you know you're going to play a great
team. I don't put much stock in where the game's played. We played in a lot of
great venue. I think our kids are going to enjoy the atmosphere.  
It's like we have a great fan base at Hilton, and certainly they do here. We
get to play in front of a sellout crowd. We play in the Big 12, as the kids
mentioned, and we played great environments, but our focus is playing a great
team. Wherever you play them, you play them. That's the NCAA Tournament.  
That's not something we focused on. I told our kids every year we've made the
Tournament, that number just decides what color jersey you wear. I don't
really pay much attention to it.  
We're honored to be here. It's a great program. Coach Graves does a great job.
The people in Gonzaga are tremendous. They run a great event. Everyone in
Spokane has been tremendously gracious to us. It feels like home. The people
have been really nice.  
We're honored to be here. We're honored to be part of this event. Hopefully,
we'll give the folks a good game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bill, along the lines of the earlier questions, Gonzaga opened the year
knowing they were strong at guard, concerned about the inside play. Have you
seen that at all in what you've seen looking at Gonzaga?  
COACH FENNELLY: No. I think what's happening, their post players are young,
and I think what you hope for in any team is that the older players, your
experienced players, the guards for Gonzaga, help those other kids come along.  
If you think they play a good schedule, you're playing Louisville and Ohio
State and all those people, and their post players are developed. I think they
feel much more comfortable than they did earlier in the season.  
Obviously, we focus more on what's happened later in the year. We haven't
really paid a whole lot of attention to what they were doing early. When you
have kids that are skilled and they're comfortable and they played a lot of
games now, they're not redshirt sophomores or freshmen anymore. They're
experienced players in a good system.  
Kelly's kids have always gotten better. They know how to play the game.
They'll present a good challenge to our team, no question about it.  
  
Q. There is a very big gap in the teams between free ‑throw shooting
percentage. What makes for such a good free‑throw shooting team as yours?   
COACH FENNELLY: That's a good question. We shoot a lot of free throws in
practice. We focus on it. It's something that we take very, very seriously. I
think that it's like a lot of things, there's a pride that goes into it, and
you don't want to be the one that misses.  
There's a lot of work that's gone into it. Chelsea, for example, was in the 50
percent range when she was a freshman, and put in a lot of time and effort to
where now she's one of the top free‑throw shooters in this league.  
For our team, it's been a way that we need to manufacture points. We're not
going to turn you over. So we've got to figure out a way to score the ball.
For us, the free‑throw situation has become something that we've taken great
pride in.  
We had a couple of high school coaches at practice the other day, and they
said they've never seen a team shoot so many free throws in practice. We made
the decision with as much time as you have in practice, to use that time to
shoot them, and our kids take pride in it. It's been an asset to our team.  
  
Q. Kelly made a comment on the draw day that it feels like a spring chicken
with three other coaches there at this site. You're kind of a spring chicken
compared to the other two too.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you very much. I don't feel like it, let me tell you.  
  
Q. Anyway, what is it like to be at a place where you've got so many veteran
coaches?  
COACH FENNELLY: When you start thinking about Andy Landers and Robin Selvig,
those are hall of fame people, let alone hall of fame coaches. We sat in
Kelly's office here a minute ago and took a picture, and he's poor mouthing
all these great coaches. There's a lot of trophies in his office too.  
So it's a great thing. You're honored to be a part of this event. They're good
guys. They're good people. I've had the pleasure of knowing them on a personal
basis. I got to know Kelly a little bit better on the Nike coaches' trip. As
good a basketball coach as he is and those other people are, they're better
human beings, and what they've done for our sport, what they've done for
college athletes, college student‑athletes is incredible.  
Obviously, this time of year, people focus on how many games you've won and
whatever, but the thing that they've done for young people is probably more
important. So it's fun to be a part of it, and certainly fun to be around guys
like that.  
  
Q. You probably talked with your coaching brethren about playing here at
Gonzaga because they've been able to use this atmosphere very successfully in
the past. What did you get from them as to how you need to have your team
approach this game?  
COACH FENNELLY: The night of the selection, I probably had 20 text messages
saying congratulations, and you got a terrible draw.  
It is what it is. We're not going to make any excuses for it. We play at home,
and we have a great home environment. We played on the road in some‑‑ when
you've got to go to Baylor and Oklahoma and all those other places, they're
not a whole lot.  
We piped in music in our practice facility. We have the Seattle Seahawks
soundtrack and piped it in at practice. Everyone had a headache for three
days. But they have a great fan base, but those fans can't score. They can't
guard you. You've got to play.  
The kids are going to decide the game. I think our kids are excited to play in
an environment where the teams are appreciated, and it's an exciting time, I
know, for Gonzaga basketball with their men's and women's team.  
Our men's team is playing tonight. We're excited about that. It will be fun.
Like I said, you just hope you play your best, and hopefully that will happen
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What is going to be the toughest challenge for your club out there,
playing in the game itself?  
COACH FENNELLY: The way they defend is going to be a problem for us. They're
very aggressive. They change defenses. They're very balanced on offense.  
Someone asked me who on the schedule do they remind me of? They remind me of
us a little bit in the way they approach the game‑‑ balanced scoring, share
the ball, play the game right, play the game hard. They play pressure defense
more than we do. We're going to have to find a way to take care of the
basketball.  
When you go on the road, you can't beat yourself. Your offense can't beat
their offense. You've got to make plays at the end of the shot clock, and all
you've got to do is look at the NCAA Tournament yesterday in the men's games.
Someone's got to make a play. Someone that maybe you don't expect to make a
play. That will be the challenge for us tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the Coach.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate the time.

### [Katie Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25207)

### [Kenzie DeBoer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25208)

### [Robin Selvig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25206)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started here with Montana head coach Robin Selvig,
and also the student‑athletes we have with us today would be Kenzie DeBoer and
Katie Baker.  
We'll start with questions directed to the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Katie, you can't help but be impressed. They allow about 53 points a game
against SEC teams. Tell me what you see as keys offensively to getting open
shots.  
KATIE BAKER: Yeah, I know that we're really going to focus on limiting
turnovers. Every possession you have is gold because of that front court that
they have.  
So really just limiting your turnovers, being patient, working the ball
around, getting good open looks is really just going to be the key, especially
against that zone.  
KENZIE DeBOER: I agree with Katie. She said it all. We have to be strong.
Blocking is going to be a big factor for us.  
  
Q. Katie, have you guys played anybody on your schedule that might be
similar to Georgia?  
KATIE BAKER: Earlier this year playing Villanova and UNLV down in that
tournament in Vegas. They were big, strong girls, and quick, different style
of offense than what you see in our conference. So that can be the only real
comparison I have.  
We've played some good games. I feel like we've played a tough schedule. And
Temple we played at the very beginning, they were that fast‑paced kind of
game.  
In comparison, those would be the games.  
  
Q. Katie, how different a team are you from the one that came here two years
ago and played UCLA in the first round?  
KATIE BAKER: I mean, for us seniors, we're older. We have played together for
a while now. I feel like this team, I mean, when you look at personnel, we're
the exact same team as we were last year, which I think has helped us
chemistry‑wise.  
So everyone really knows their role and everyone has a role on this team. But
everyone has owned it. What's great about this team is there's no one person
carrying the team. Everyone contributes and everyone has a special part.  
So I think that's a little bit different aspect of the team from 2010 or '11.  
  
Q. Kenzie, were you able to watch the men's game last night? Anything you
could take from that game going into Saturday?  
KENZIE DeBOER: We all watched the men's game together. It was tough seeing our
boys struggle out there.  
What I got out of it was we need to be confident. I think our boys lacked a
little bit of confidence. I think they were scared. I think us being older,
having a lot of seniors, experience on our team, I think that will help us to
have some confidence, go out there, know we can play with a great team.  
  
Q. As a 14 seed two years ago, you came within a few whiskers of upsetting
UCLA. Here you are again two years later. What will it take this time to pull
off that first ‑round win, Katie?   
KATIE BAKER: Like I said, kind of composure. Really valuing every possession,
because each possession is super important, and confidence. We're the
underdogs. We have nothing to lose going into this game. I think knowing that,
playing like that will really help us to our benefit.  
But we really, kind of like Kenzie emphasized, play Montana basketball. We're
going to come out with a fight, play like it's our last. So we have kind of
that underdog tone going for us.  
  
Q. After being here two years ago, how nice is it to be able to come back to
Spokane and play for your close fans, Katie?  
KATIE BAKER: Such a blessing. Quite a journey here. To come back and be here
our senior year has been a picture‑perfect season for us through the ups and
downs. I think the only thing to end it great would be to make a dent in this
tournament, so...  
  
Q. Kenzie, how great is it to be so close to your fans?  
KENZIE DeBOER: It's great. I'm actually from Washington. A lot of my family's
coming. We have such great support from our Montana fans. I think a lot of
them are going to make the trips over here, which will be awesome to see them
supporting us in the crowd.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student‑athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Selvig.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your defense, how unique it is.
Coach Landers talked about how unique it is you're able to switch all five
players.  
COACH SELVIG: Well, I haven't always had teams that could do that effectively,
but we've had a number of teams that could. It's kind of grown into something
we like to do.  
I like to think we have some versatility on defense. Georgia is a more
versatile team because they can throw such different looks at you.  
We play man and zone. This year for the first time we've been about 90% man
and 10% zone. Hopefully we can find one that works tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your senior leadership going into this. What
are you expecting out of Kenzie and Katie?  
COACH SELVIG: I know what I'm going to get out of them. We're going to get a
team that competes and plays hard. We've got our hands full with Georgia,
that's obvious, just as we had our hands full with UCLA a couple years ago. We
had good senior leadership then.  
I don't think we're going to be afraid. I think they're looking forward to
this. They're excited for this. They lived and died to get back here this
year, their senior year.  
I think we're going to get a heck of an effort out of them. Now, hopefully we
can find somebody to make a shot or two and make it interesting.  
  
Q. With both teams really strong defensively, can you talk about what kind
of a game you expect the style to be tomorrow.  
COACH SELVIG: It will be a battle. I think Georgia, they've probably always
been good defensively. I think they're pretty physical. I'm kind of glad we
just came off the Northern Colorado game. That's just a slug 'em out from the
start. Stepping into the NCAA tournament, you don't want to be going, Oh, they
let you do this and that. These ladies are big and strong.  
We got to be ready for a battle. That's one thing these ladies have always
risen to. We're going to compete, fight tooth and nail for every rebound,
every loose ball. That's the nature of this team.  
We got here pretty much 'cause we defended people every night. Georgia
probably will say the same thing. You look at their record in that league, the
number of points they've given up, it's really remarkable. It's not very many.  
  
Q. Because of the defensive strengths of both teams, how important is your
guys' ability to hit some shots from the perimeter, hitting threes lately?  
COACH SELVIG: I think it's important. What you're not going to get on Georgia
is any easy baskets. Probably not going to get transitions unless we get a
steal or two. They're so solid fundamentally and they play really hard. He's
got enough depth. They're not going to get worn out.  
When we get good looks, we got to make 'em. When we're good is when we find a
couple kids making shots. We've done that a lot this year, but I think the
three would be important.  
I don't think we're going to get a whole bunch down low. We have a number of
different kids that can do that. So I do think that's critical.  
  
Q. Coach Landers talked at length about your relationship over the years.
How does it feel to be part of such a big legends' club here in Spokane?  
COACH SELVIG: I don't know about legends' club. I've watched them for years
and years and years. We went down and played at their place in a NCAA one
time, a 16 seed, got to play them on their home court. I don't know if that
was a good thing or not.  
He's recruited up around Missoula. I had a chance to visit with him a lot.
They played in the regionals. We hosted the regionals, I can't remember what
year it was, but Georgia was at our place, Texas Tech. A program I've followed
quite a bit. I admire what he's done.  
For one thick, we pride ourselves at our program as being good defensively,
and I think Georgia does the same.  
Bill, I've known for a lot of years, too. Of course, Kelly. It's a fun group
of coaches here to be around.  
  
Q. Kelly felt like an infant this morning with you guys.  
COACH SELVIG: That's Kelly saying that. He's not really an infant anymore. I
think he's doing okay.  
  
Q. I had the pleasure of covering Katie Baker for four years in high school.
What a player, and even a better person. Can you talk about her impact at
Montana, what she's meant to your program?  
COACH SELVIG: Well, Katie is really a wonderful person. She has been a
blessing to coach. She's positive every day. She went through knee surgery and
she never was down one minute. She lost 15 games one year. She had her
appendix out one time in the middle of the season.  
She's very strong. A bad game, she doesn't come in without a smile. She's a
great friend for all these ladies. She's a great teammate.  
You know, it's been a thrill to have her. And she competes every minute of
every game and every second of every practice. What coach doesn't love that?  
  
Q. Kaylee Valley (phonetic), a recruit you've signed, in the same mold as
Katie. You recruited her maybe to be a point guard. Can she have an impact
with you guys?  
COACH SELVIG: Pretty excited about her. She's the kind of player we like to
get. She's a versatile kid, maybe point guard. She could play inside, play a
lot of different places at our place. She's also a young lady that really
competes and will be good on both ends of the floor.  
Next year we have a lot of open things. We have four seniors, three that
start. I have redshirts returning, there's going to be competition. I've seen
Kaylee play a lot. She was at our camp. Very excited about her chance to come
over and be a heck of a player.  
  
Q. Can you talk in general, your team seems well ‑equipped to handle
Georgia's physical style. Could you talk about how the game has evolved over
the last years and how you approach that as a coach.   
COACH SELVIG: You know, it's not a game for the meek, and it hasn't been for
quite a few years.  
The difference is, a lot of times when we got to the NCAA, played someone in
the top 20, there was a big difference between strength, speed and quickness.  
With my team this year, I think we've got pretty good strength. We're not as
athletic as Georgia, speed and quickness, things like that, but we have one of
my stronger teams.  
We won't get knocked around that much. We might get knocked around some. But
that's the nature of what this game's become. Endlessly people are watching
and they're sitting down by the floor at a women's basketball game, they can't
believe how physical it is.  
But it's been that way for a while. Usually those really physical teams were
in the Final Four, and there wasn't so many. Now there's a lot more parity.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SELVIG: Thank you.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  93  
Louisville  60

  
MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais from Louisville, head coach Jeff Walz
and student‑athletes Sara Hammond, Antonita Slaughter, and Shoni Schimmel.  
We'll begin with a statement from Coach Walz.  
COACH WALZ: I'd just like to first congratulate UConn and Geno, his entire
staff. They've done a great job. They're a fantastic basketball team, and we
knew that coming in here. They played as well as I've seen them play this
entire year tonight, and they shot the ball as well as I've seen them shoot.  
We knew coming in here that we were going to have to try and make them take
some 3s, and they took some 3s and they made some 3s. We just didn't quite
have enough tonight. But it's not because we didn't compete. And we didn't
compete‑‑ and we competed for all 40 minutes.  
I'm proud of every single one of our players. It's without a doubt going to go
down as one of the greatest runs in women's basketball.  
To be a 5 seed and knock off a 4, then‑‑ but the No. 1 of all 1s in Baylor and
then a 2 in Tennessee and then come back and beat Cal, I don't think anybody
can argue that, you know, unfortunately we just came up one game short.  
But I'm proud of my players. I'm proud of everyone. I'm proud of my staff
support staff. And we're going to hold our heads high and we're going to be
proud of what we did.  
And I'm really proud of our two seniors in Monique Reid and Shelby Harper.
Mo's had the opportunity to the play in two national championship games.
Unfortunately we didn't come out on the plus side of either one of them. But
it's an experience she'll always have.  
And I'll told these players this is something that they'll remember for the
rest of their lives and I was privileged to coach them and be a part of it.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For Sara, I wonder if you could speak to the difficulty of contending
with Breanna Stewart and what specifically you were trying to get done and
what you would have liked to have done better.  
SARA HAMMOND: You gotta give credit to her, her being a freshman coming in, in
the spotlight in a national championship. She handled it very well. She's a
tremendous athlete. She's a freak of nature. She's got a wingspan that's close
to Brittney Griner's, I think.  
And she's a hard matchup. She can shoot the 3, she can take you off the
dribble or post you up. So she did a tremendous job. And her teammates did a
tremendous job of getting her open and getting her the ball.  
But our whole game plan was to limit her touches and not let her rebound. And
she was relentless on the boards tonight. I gotta give credit to her and her
team.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you talk a little bit about the attack they put on you
personally, I mean, the way they contained you?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Playing in the Big East you kind of know each other, and so
they kind of had an idea. We've already played before, so they knew what to do
to stop us, and that was kind of limit my touches and not really let me shoot.
Because they saw the day we played Cal, the same thing happened.  
And my teammates did a great job of doing what they needed to do, and that was
score when they needed to. We just came up short, and you can't really ask
much of anything because we gave it all we had.  
  
Q. Having done what many believe was completely impossible, and having built
up such faith in your team this year, you've got much of this team coming
back, what do you think it's going to do for you next year?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think it's us still believing in the fact that we did make
it this far and we are losing two seniors. But, hey, everybody's coming back,
and so that's bad for everybody else because we did make this run at the end
of tournament, and it's just going to continue into next season and we're just
going to get better and grow as a team and learn from this and hopefully be
back next year.  
  
Q. Sara, Coach talks about throwing the first punch. UConn did that tonight.
Describe kind of the feeling that was like and how difficult was it to
emotionally regroup after that.  
SARA HAMMOND: Honestly, I thought we kind of came out and fought with them
there at the beginning. They're a great team. They made it to the championship
for a reason, but we did too.  
But they executed their game plan to perfection. They tried to take away
Antonita and Shoni' 3s and kind of get up in their face, and they made other
people take shots. And then when you look up at the scoreboard and you kind of
see they're going on a big run, I mean, yeah, you're down 18 or whatever, but
we never stopped fighting. We went to timeouts and we huddled. And Coach and
all of us, we gathered around each other and said the reason we're here is
because we kept fighting and we never gave up, and we're not going to quit
now. We made it to a national championship.  
We never quit, no matter what the score was.  
  
Q. For Antonita, I wonder if the way the game got out of hand, does that
make you think there was something you didn't do, or was there just a talent
discrepancy that you weren't going to be able to overcome?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Personally I think that my teammates‑‑ I think they fought
the hardest. We just came out short tonight.  
And we're not going to hang our heads. We did the unthinkable. So we're just
going to work through the summer and just come back next year and get better.  
  
Q. Can you tell us how your seniors are handling the loss? Do they have
perspective the way you do, or are they more upset?  
SARA HAMMOND: I think they're glad that we got to the national championship.
No one believed in us this whole time. Everyone expected Baylor to be back in
the national championship. And we did the impossible.  
I don't think‑‑ none of us are hanging our heads, and they're not hanging
their heads either because they went out, they were the last ones to practice
the last day you could practice, and that's a great way to go out, knowing
that you're the last one of two teams to end the season still playing.  
So I think they're proud of all of us and they're‑‑ a great way to go out.
Obviously we didn't go out on top, but it was a miracle run in this
tournament, and I think they're going to remember that the rest of their
lives. And when we look back‑‑ Coach always tells us 20, 30 years from now
we're going to be texting and emailing each other talking about this and what
we did.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. With their 3 ‑point looks, what was your thought process in terms of what
you're trying to take away from a team that can score in that many ways?  
COACH WALZ: Well, that's part of the problem, and I've said that, I've talked
to my staff about and we said that from day one. What makes them so unique is
their ability to score from all five positions on the floor. You got to kind
of pick your poison.  
I told our players, too, we're going to have to try to make someone shoot the
ball that normally might not. But the problem is when you go 13 and 26 from
the 3‑point line, it makes it tough to defend you.  
And that's really what happened tonight. I thought Kelly Faris was great for
them. She always doesn't get a lot of the props because she doesn't do‑‑ she
might not always be the high scorer, but just how she plays, how hard she
plays. She defended so well. And then she goes out there and goes four of
seven from the 3‑point line.  
I think we started off in the second half and made a little run, and she comes
down and hits back‑to‑back 3s to counter any kind of run we were trying to
make.  
They're a tough matchup for anyone, and especially for us when we're as thin
in the post as we are.  
  
Q. Jeff, after the win against California, you told ‑‑ I believe it was an
ESPN sideline reporter‑‑ court‑side reporter: Why not us.   
COACH WALZ: Yep.  
  
Q. In a nutshell, why wasn't it you tonight?  
COACH WALZ: Because we didn't score enough points. They scored 93, and we
scored 60. That's kind of‑‑ if you don't score more that the other team, it
ain't gonna be you.  
  
Q. More succinctly, Jeff, was there something that you could say ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: No. I mean, they played great. They go 13 of 26 from the 3‑point
line. They defended well. They chased Shoni and Antonita and did a really nice
job of pushing them off the 3‑point line.  
We ended up going 5 for 23 from the 3‑point line. And that's normally not what
we do. We've been a much better 3‑point‑shooting team, especially the past
three weeks, than we were tonight. And I knew coming into this game we were
going to have to make some 3s. We just don't have the post depth right now
with all the injuries that we have to be able to just pound the ball down low.  
So I'll give credit to them because they defended extremely well.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked a couple days ago about Breanna Stewart and talking to
Jim Boeheim and sort of having a sense of how good this player is, but it's
one thing to sort of know what a player is like in high school and on tape and
another thing now to coach against her. Can you give us a sense of how
dominant a performance you think this was and just how difficult it is to game
plan against her?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, it's extremely difficult. You know, I've seen her
play in the summers a bunch and in high school. She's just a phenomenal
player. I think Geno saved her for the tournament because he didn't play her
as much throughout the year. So I guess he knew what he was doing.  
But she's a spectacular player, and we knew that. I think what you've seen
from her in the NCAA Tournament, especially in the Final Four, is what all of
us had expected the entire year, to be honest. And I think she got injured at
one point and then was going through just some growing pains as a freshman,
but she sure figured it out at the right time.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talk a little bit in your opening statement, but just the run
you guys had. Geno said up on stage that the only team playing better than his
guys in the tournament were you having won those games and just what you've
done. And I know it's after coming off of the loss, but just what this run has
meant for Louisville and just basketball in general, seeing a team thatgets
here ‑‑ no 5 has ever gotten to the finals before.   
COACH WALZ: I think it's great. I give all the credit to our players, to my
staff, in believing in what we thought was possible. We came out every night‑‑
I mean, we came out tonight with the plan to win. We had planned to be the
ones out there celebrating. We weren't coming into the game thinking there
ain't no way we could win. Because if you do that, there's no sense to show up
and play.  
So we go, you know, we're the 5 seed, we win the first one. Then we aren't
supposed to beat Purdue; we do that. And then nobody ever thought we'd come
close to beating Baylor. But we knew in order to do that we were going to have
to do something special. 16 of 25 from the 3‑point line was pretty special.
Then you go out there and you beat a Tennessee team that everybody thought
we'd lose again, and we don't. You come in here, you beat Cal. And, I mean,
things are going good.  
The one thing that I wish I could change is the two opportunities that we've
had here to play in for the national championship, you're playing against a
conference opponent. The great thing about this tournament is you normally get
to play somebody that hasn't seen you. And they can watch you on film; we can
watch people on film.  
Like we watched Cal. Clarendon, I thought she was really good. But in person,
she's a lot better than what I had seen. She's a lot quicker and does some
more things.  
But you get in here, you play UConn, and it's‑‑ it's a tough task. But we
thought we had the opportunity to compete with them. I thought if things went
well‑‑ and we were going to have to get some breaks here or there. But the run
that we went on I think is remarkable and it's something I'll always remember.
And I've told our players: When we walk out of this place, we're walking out
with our head high and we're proud of what we've done.  
  
Q. Jeff, you cut it to 16 points and Stewart hits a 3 ‑pointer and you turn
around and you just kind of shake your head like: What else can I do? What was
that emotion, and was that kind of resignation there?  
COACH WALZ: No. They just made big shot after big shot. Starting the second
half, we come out, we score. Then Faris hits a 3. We come back down the floor
and score again. Faris hits another 3. Then we hit back‑to‑back 3s and get it
to 16. And Stewart comes out and hits about a 22 ‑‑ a 23‑footer. And it's just
a big time shot.  
And at that point in time I was like if we can get one more stop and get down
and score, all of a sudden it kind of makes the game a little more
interesting.  
But unfortunately we were never able to get it to where a shot actually
started to matter. And what I mean by that is when you're up 15, 16, that rim
looks really big. You get it to 10, you get it to 8, and all of a sudden
there's a little bit more pressure on you. And we could just never get over
that hump and get it to that.  
  
Q. Jeff, are there ways you can build off this run that weren't available to
you in 2009 because of who you lost from that team?  
COACH WALZ: Of course.  
I think what this does for us is I think it shows people that our '09 run was
not an accident. And where I'm hoping that this really helps us build is in
recruiting. I'm hoping there's some players out there that realize, hey, look
what they've done at Louisville in the past six years. We've played for two
national championships in the past five years.  
And in order for us to continue to make runs like this and then to come into
the situation and be able to beat Connecticut is we're going to have to
continue to recruit and get players that can come in here and push the ones
we've got, and then we'll put a team out there where we're competing to win
this game.  
  
Q. Jeff, to kind of elaborate on that, can you speak to this team's
potential next year? I know it's kind of hard now, but considering who you
guys have coming back and the injured players you that you didn't have?  
COACH WALZ: I'm really excited about that, but at the same time I've got to
make sure my players understand that we just went on a pretty special run. And
if you're going to sit here this spring and summer and think that same thing
is going to happen without going back to work and getting better individually,
it's not going to happen.  
I challenged them in the locker room after the game. I said, Hey, this is
unbelievable, something you'll never forget. I'm not going to forget it
either. But if you're satisfied with this, that's not what I want.  
I've had the opportunity to coach in the national championship three years,
once as an assistant, and we were out there celebrating, and now twice as a
head coach, and we're still one step away. You've got to climb that next step
to be able to cut the nets down.  
And that's our goal, and I told our players that. And, you know, I think they
want the same thing. And we understand we have to have the same type of
improvement from each player as we did this year to be able to make that next
step, and hopefully our incoming recruits will be able to help. And then
hopefully, again, we'll be able to continue to recruit some special players
that want to be a part of this.  
Because‑‑ I mean, I'm not sure‑‑ I think we counted. I think there's been
eight schools, I believe, in the past five years that have actually played in
a Final Four. In our game, it's not easy to get to this game that we've just
played in, and because of the fact that we're continuing to recruit and
continuing to get players to believe in what we're doing‑‑ and hopefully we'll
see the dividends when we sign our next class and the class after that.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking of the talent that you already have, could we get your
thoughts on how Sara Hammond rose to the occasion tonight when both Slaughter
and Schimmel were being contained by UConn?  
COACH WALZ: I thought Sara came out and competed. We're still going to
challenge her. She settled a few times for fade‑away shots. When she's got it,
she's quick enough and strong enough to drive to the basket, try to absorb the
contact and try to get 3‑point plays.  
But the progress she made from her freshman year to her sophomore year, it's
remarkable. And I challenged her to make those same strides to her junior
year. Because if she does that, now all of a sudden we're getting better.  
It's the same thing I told Jude Schimmel. I thought Jude has done great job
for us. And now she has to continue to improve. You could just go down the
entire line.  
So we're honored to have the opportunity to play for a national championship,
but we're not satisfied with the results. So we're going to continue to get
back to work and hopefully be able to be the ones that are out there
celebrating.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  93  
Louisville  60

  
MODERATOR: Joining us on dais from are Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma
and student‑athletes Kelly Faris and Breanna Stewart.  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Auriemma and then take questions for
our student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thanks. I don't know what I can add to what we just did. I
told Jeff after the game, it was an amazing run by them. Incredible for them
to be in the situation that they were in, and I want to congratulate them and
Jeff and his staff and their kids.  
And for the last month leading up to that was a little bit of a struggle. In
spite of our record, it was a little bit of a struggle for‑‑ I know for Kelly,
for Stewy, myself, the coaches, you know, nothing that you could see, but it
was a struggle. It was a struggle for us internally to get connected and to be
the kind of team that I knew we could be.  
But this last month has been everything and more that I could ever hope for
with this team and these players. And they deserve this. They really do.
Sometimes you stumble upon a championship, sometimes the other team hands it
to you. But this particular group, especially Kelly, she deserves this
championship because she competes for a national championship every day in
everything she does. And I'm really, really happy for her. Stewy? Eh
(laughter).  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Kelly, Coach talked about sometimes you stumble sometimes like that. What
made this team do you think reverse itself by your standards in the last
month? And was there ever a true moment ‑‑ any moments of doubt that it would
not happen?  
KELLY FARIS: I don't think so from our standpoint. I think a lot of people on
the outside doubted it. We had our ups and downs where it was frustrating, and
there were times that I was just mad at the world for the way that things were
going and the fact that I couldn't figure out how to make it work.  
But I can't put into words how thankful I am for this group. And for Coach to
turn this around after the Big East Tournament loss. We sat in the locker room
and he looked at us and he said, You know what? When we get back together, I'm
going to show you how to win a national championship.  
And, sure enough, we're sitting right here. So there's times that I don't know
how the heck he does what he does, but he's pretty darn good at his job and he
figures out a way to get it done.  
And happy to have him on my side.  
  
Q. Breanna, can you take us into your mind when the clock was winding down
and that you saw that you were going to win a championship your freshman
year?  
BREANNA STEWART: It was really exciting. I didn't really know what to expect,
but obviously as the clock was winding down, we knew that we were going to win
the national championship. And I was just trying to figure out who the first
person I was going to hug was gonna be.  
  
Q. Kelly, how much was Breanna's play maybe also a catalyst for what you
guys were able to do after the Big East Tournament, the change that she made
or the change in her, and how much did that change you guys?  
KELLY FARIS: That changed us a ton. I don't think people understand how much
we needed her to get to this point. If we didn't have her, we wouldn't be
here. And we all know that, and I hope she knows that. If she didn't turn it
around and step up like she has‑‑ I mean, we have a freshman that's the MVP of
the national championship game. And that doesn't happen anywhere but here. And
she deserves it.  
And kind of, again, I'm glad she's on our side. I wouldn't want to be playing
against her.  
  
Q. Breanna, how does this all compare to what you imagined in August or
September when you came here about what your freshman year would be and to see
how ‑‑ the spectacular fashion in which it's ended?   
BREANNA STEWART: I think coming in obviously the goal is always to win a
national championship, but really going the whole six months through all the
hard work and all the practices, I mean, this is kind of a‑‑ I don't know,
it's really exciting to be here. And winning a national championship was our
goal, and we accomplished it.  
  
Q. Breanna, I know after the Bridgeport regional you weren't really too
hyped up about winning the MOP there. You were focused on the team awards. You
guys obviously got that done today. Does it mean a little bit more to you to
get the MOP for the entire tournament? How does that feel?  
BREANNA STEWART: I appreciate it. I mean, it's nice. But, still, we just won a
national championship, and I think that's the best thing.  
  
Q. This is for Kelly or Coach. Kelly, you said Coach said he was going to
show you how to win a national championship. What he did do?  
KELLY FARIS: He might want to keep that a secret. I don't know. (Laughter).
I'll let him answer that one.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll start with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, you're pretty good with words. Do you have a favorite one when you
think of Breanna Stewart? Would it be precocious or innocent, or how would you
describe?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She's probably all those, she's probably all those things.
She's just‑‑ she's really, really innocent and in so many ways. She has a
little kid's attitude towards everything that happens. She sees the fun and
the joy in everything, and that's why I'm really thrilled for her, because
there were times this year where all that went away, and I was really, really
worried about her.  
And she got it back and she got it back just in time, and here we are.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said I think a couple years ago at a Big East media day
that wait until Stewy gets here and we're not going to lose many at all, if
any. Now she's here, and the last time you guys won a title in '04 was Diana's
end of her run for you guys. Is this the start of a new run with the freshmen
and the group you have coming back?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. It's so hard to look ahead. So many things have
to go right in the future. Stewy certainly is different than any other college
player that's playing right now. But there are a lot of great players that
were playing this year that didn't make it to the Final Four, didn't win the
national championship. And there's been players that have won it as a freshman
and never won any other one and never even went to a Final Four again.  
I think looking ahead is‑‑ for me, I think the three freshmen that we have‑‑ I
want them to keep getting better and better and better every day. Where that
takes us, I don't know.  
Right now I'm really anxious for next year to start because I want to see what
Bria Hartley looks like and I want to see what Stefanie Dolson looks like as
seniors, because they've been in the middle of this since their freshmen year.
And for them to finally be seniors next year, I think it's probably going to
be pretty exciting for me.  
  
Q. Geno, what Breanna did these last three weeks, your best ‑case scenario,
or beyond what you hoped you would get from her when she started when the
light bulb went on?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mentioned yesterday that I always‑‑ when we recruit
players‑‑ people tell me this all the time‑‑ my favorite time that I love my
players is when I'm recruiting them and after they graduate (laughter).  
When I'm recruiting them, I think they're going to be First Team All‑American
National Player of the Year. And after they graduate, I think back to, man,
what would we be without them. But whole four years that they're there is just
torture.  
The reason I say that is when I saw Stewy play in high school and play U.S.A.
Basketball and play with pros as a junior to be a senior in high school and
dominate those kids, all I could think of was what's she going to be like when
she's in college and learns how to, you know‑‑ how to play and fills into her
body and gets a lot smarter? So I'm thinking, wow, this kid could be
unbelievable. Maybe as good as anybody I've ever coached.  
So that was my thought with Stewy. But thinking that and having it happen,
those are two completely different things. And I'm not surprised that it's
happened, but to think that it would happen her freshman year to this extent,
these last two weeks, that‑‑ that was difficult. That would be a difficult
thing for me to admit that I thought so.  
  
Q. Geno, congratulations first of all.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
  
Q. Obviously I want to ask you about the historical significance of hitting
No. 8. I mean, you tied a great coach today, and can you talk about that as
far as your program and your feelings personally?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, when we started‑‑ when we got to our first
Final Four in 1991 here in New Orleans, we almost acted like, carried
ourselves like, we're thought of as we didn't belong here. The other three
teams were Stanford, Virginia, and Tennessee, so the thought of being in the
same Final Four with those three programs.  
When we left and we didn't win, I thought: What if we never go back? What if
that's that one and done? There's other teams that made the Final Four that
never went back. And I thought: What if that happens to us? What if that's
what Connecticut is?  
And then when we won our first national championship in 1995, I thought: Lots
of people won one. What if we won't win another one ever again?  
So I'm always kind of looking into the future and thinking: Is this it? Is
this the last one? Is this one and done? Are we going to be one of those
programs?  
So to look back now and see where we've come and what's happened at
Connecticut in the last 18 years, I would say, never in our wildest dreams did
we think that that was possible. Halfway through it I still wasn't sure where
it would go.  
And winning tonight I think validates a lot of what we wanted to do, what we
aspired to be. On ESPN they put up a list of John Wooden, Pat Summitt, Geno
Auriemma, Mike Krzyzewski, Adolph Rupp. I'm like: That's not the way it works.
That's not the way it works.  
I never beat Coach K in a game, and I never coached against Coach Wooden. So
the only person I compare myself to is Pat Summitt. And to be there in that
spot with her means a lot to me.  
  
Q. Coach, if I could ask you two things. First, you have eight titles, but
that's eight championship games. Never lost a championship game. What does
that mean to you? And then, also, if you can sort of put in perspective what I
guess ‑‑ I think you've been in contention every year since '95. There's never
been a single season where I think anybody would have been shocked if you
would have won. What that consistency from way back then in '95 means to every
single year be in the mix.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, somebody‑‑ as a matter of fact, somebody pointed out
something that you wrote that kind of captured the essence of what we are at
Connecticut, and certainly how I treat it, that I expect to be in contention
with my team every single year. Ever since 1995, you're right. And everybody's
had injuries and everybody's had bad luck, but ever since 1995 with very,
very, very, very few exceptions, we were number one in the country every one
of those years at one point or another. And I don't know anybody that's been
able to do that.  
And yet, at the same time, the expectation level to win one every year really
bothers me. And I think you were really good in pointing that out. It bothers
the hell out of me that there's this assumption that we should win it every
year or we should lose in the national championship game every year. I don't
think anybody that makes those comments really, really knows how hard it is to
do what we've done.  
And I'm really, really proud of that. Because I know how hard it was to do it.
And with each year that goes by and teams get knocked out and teams that
everybody thinks are national championship teams or programs that should be in
the Final Four and are not, with each year that that happens, I feel even
better about what we've done. Because I know more than anybody else, and so
does my staff, just how incredibly difficult it is to do what we've done. You
had something else?  
  
Q. (Off Microphone)?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Eight for eight? Man, oh, man. You know, the one thing‑‑ I've
said this before, and excuse me if I've said it here before, but I really
believe that coaches lose more championship games than they win. You don't
have your team ready, for whatever reason, mentally usually. And I've been in
the Final Four a couple times when we've lost where mentally we weren't right.
But we've never been in a championship game where mentally we weren't right.  
And all eight times that we've won a national championship, I felt like my
team was mentally ready to win a championship. And I think that's something
that I'm really proud of; that we don't show up in championship games not
ready to play mentally or physically.  
  
Q. When you say to a team "I'm going to show you how to win a championship,"
what do you have to show them and where‑‑ how long in your career, Geno, did
you understand what you had to show them?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, remember after we lost at Notre Dame in at that triple
overtime game and you said to me, You gotta be the most miserable 30‑and‑3 guy
in America, right? I think if you're not careful at Connecticut, you have this
thing hanging over your program that losses are not allowed, and kids become
afraid to lose if you're not careful. And at Connecticut we've always played
to win. I think that's another reason why we play well in these tournaments;
we play to win. We're not afraid to lose. But that takes some getting used to
at Connecticut.  
And I thought that for a large part of this season too many times our team was
feeling the pressure to win, the feeling of are we good enough, what if we
don't live up to other people's expectations of ourselves. And a lot of that
has to do with me. A lot of that has to do with our coaching staff. Because
too many times at practice they didn't live up to our expectations as coaches.
Usually mine.  
And it got to a point where I could sense it, I could feel it that it was
holding us back. And as soon as the Big East championship game ended, I sat
down with our coaches and I said: All that's going to change starting right
now.  
You don't know if it's going to work, but I tried to make them feel like,
listen, all that stuff's behind us now. There's a lot of teams going into the
NCAA Tournament. 64. And there's a lot of teams that think they can win it.
But we're Connecticut. And we go into the NCAA with a different mindset than
everybody else. And they're so young, dummies, they believe me (laughter).  
  
Q. For the last month back home we've been busting your stones about how
come they can't win a close game anymore.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know, I know.  
  
Q. Turns out you didn't have to.  
COACH AURIEMMA: By the way, I went back and checked my media guide after you
guys were killing me about that crap, and in my first four years at
Connecticut, we played 47 games that were decided by eight points and less.
And we won like 80 percent of them. So anybody out there from Connecticut,
shut up.  
  
Q. Did you think you would be able to run ‑‑ to win‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. Well, I mean, when we saw the bracket, obviously, you
know, when we saw it, we were really, really concerned, because obviously the
1 and 16 game you don't worry so much about. Vanderbilt is a really good team,
but we're better than Vanderbilt. But when I saw Maryland, Kentucky, and Notre
Dame, probably, and then Baylor, I thought, man, this‑‑ I hope I didn't set
these guys up for a big letdown, because this is gonna be really, really,
really hard. And you hate to play teams that you've already played in the NCAA
Tournament.  
But sometime during that Vanderbilt game something clicked, and we just got
this thing about us, this aura about us that we got now. I don't know where it
went, I don't know what happened to it during the season, I don't know how we
lost it, but there was something in that Vanderbilt game. And then it happened
again in the Kentucky game, and it happened in the Maryland game where I knew
we got it. We got it. We got everything we need right now to win this whole
thing.  
And I'm not going to sit here and tell you that, you know, that if Baylor had
been in this game against us, you know, we win by 30. So things had to break
right a little bit for us too. But that's just the way the tournament goes.  
  
Q. Geno, in '95 when you won your first championship, it caused a tremendous
amount of interest in the sport. Since then there's maybe a feeling right now
that the game has plateaued in terms of injuries and the quality of play. Do
you agree? And, if so, what can it do to get better on both levels?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Man, that's a topic for a lot of discussion, and a lot of
people have talked about it and I've certainly thrown out my share of ideas,
which people have‑‑ some agree with, some have said that I'm an idiot.  
I think, like any other sport, the product that you put on the floor has to be
excellent. And you have to aspire to be really, really good, which means you
don't have a majority of the teams in college basketball shooting 40 percent
from the floor.  
That means that our officiating keeps getting better. That means that our
coaching keeps getting better. That means that these kids that are being
coached in high school, AAU, whatever, keep getting better; that they work on
their game; that they learn how to be really, really good players instead of
just whatever. Like you see a lot of kids. Like if they win, they win; if they
don't, they don't.  
There's got to be a commitment to being great. I think it's happening at more
schools than ever, but I think there is a feeling that we have plateaued.
There's a feeling that we have plateaued. And the interest level has to come
back, and maybe players like Stewy will help in accomplishing that.  
But women's sports unfortunately are going to suffer that. They have from the
beginning, and they will to the end. That's just the world that we live in.
And we gotta fight that every day.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Coach. Louisville got here by volume scoring in a sense,
just shooting lights out against Baylor, volume scoring against Tennessee.
Could you describe what your defensive approach was to containing them in
general? And then specifically in the second half, after Sara Hammond was the
one person doing much damage in the first, you held her to just four points in
the second. What adjustment did you make on her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We really didn't make any major adjustments on Sara Hammond.
We spent so much time and energy guarding Shoni Schimmel and Antonita
Slaughter. We spent so much time and energy guarding those guys. That was our
focus the entire game. And Jude Schimmel when she was in the game as well.  
So whatever anybody else did, we were gonna have to live with it. As long as
those three players didn't dominate the game. And our guards did a amazing job
on those three. Amazing. That, I thought, was going to be the difference in
the game, how well we did against those three players. Because, let's face it,
those three have carried them to this point. Those three in the six games or
the five games before tonight have dominated every guard combination that
they've played against. And we were determined that that wasn't going to
happen tonight.  
  
Q. Is there any player that you would single out for their defensive efforts
in this game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: For us? Yeah, I don't think Shoni Schimmel got a lot of open
looks, and that was Kelly Faris. And Antonita Slaughter didn't get many open
looks either, and a lot of times that was Stewy. We thought her length would
be good enough to keep her from‑‑ plus, we didn't let her get as open as some
of the other teams that she's played against in the last three weeks.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're welcome.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
MODERATOR: From Louisville we have head coach Jeff Walz along with the five
starters, our student‑athletes Sara Hammond, Sheronne Vails, Antonita
Slaughter, Bria Smith, and Shoni Schimmel.  
  
Q. Antonita will you just talk a little bit about the hot 3 ‑point shooting
that you've had so far in this tournament and just at what point maybe you
really started feeling it, and are you surprised that it sort of carried
through this far?  
ANTONITA SMITH: No, I'm not surprised, just all comes with practice and
repetition. And I know my teammates have confidence in me, so that gives me
confidence within myself when I shoot the ball.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you address Monique Reid, the courage she
shows, the injuries she deals with, and how much she helps you guys knowing
that she's always there to fight for you?  
SARA HAMMOND: Mo's been here before. She's experienced the Final Four and what
it takes to get to a national championship. And just her experience and her
fight and wanting to get back there, it just shows that no matter how hurt you
are, what adversity you face, that you can still push through.  
And Mo has proven that to us as a fifth‑year senior. And she wants to go out
on top. So she's played all year long on one leg, and just her fight and that
adversity she's faced I think has really shown to us that anything's possible,
no matter what you're going through. And, you know, we're just thankful to
have her on our team.  
  
Q. Shoni, just tomorrow night's the end either way of an unbelievable run
you guys have had through this tournament, arguably the best to date he's ever
done. What's it going to take for you guys to come home tomorrow night with a
national championship?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think not being done with what we've come out here do, and
that is win a national championship. We've already beat Baylor, already beat
Tennessee, and we beat Cal, the 2 seed, so now we have another 1 seed.  
And we're ready for anything. And for it to be the national championship game,
why not go out with a bang.  
  
Q. Bria, where is the team planning to watch the Louisville men's game
tonight? And should they be successful, I'm sure you're aware of the history
that you guys can make tomorrow. And what does that all mean to the team in
the program?  
BRIA SMITH: It's huge for the program. It's huge for both of our teams if we
were able to pull off both winning the championship. But we're going to watch
it at some‑‑ Crazy Lobster? Crazy Lobster. We watched their last game there,
so we're just going to have a big watch party again.  
  
Q. Along that line, any and all of the players, how much texting, tweeting,
whatever, calls, between y'all and the men's team has there been?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, probably a lot. I don't have Twitter, but I hear from
these guys all the time how much they get and how much tweets, how much
Instagrams, likes and followers and everything.  
Texting, personally it's been a lot, but it's just everybody saying
congratulations and whatnot. So, I mean, I don't know, how many do you guys
have?  
BRIA SMITH: Too much.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Not enough you mean? Keep them coming (laughter).  
  
Q. I wanted to talk to you guys as Coach walked away just about maybe what
kind of coach he is and kind of what he's like maybe away from kind of the
public glare.  
SARA HAMMOND: Coach is a great guy on and off the court. And off the court‑‑
well, on the court as well‑‑ he's always just making sure that we're having a
good time. He cracks jokes with every one of us and makes sure we have smiles
on our faces. And he does go above and beyond to make sure that we need
everything necessary off the court and on the court. And he's there to make us
not only better players but better people and prepare us for life.  
So, I mean, he's just a great guy to be around. And I know he acts crazy
sometimes on the sidelines, but that's what gets us going and gets us excited.
And I think that's why we all came here to play for the University of
Louisville, is because of what Coach Walz promised us and getting us to a
national championship and hopefully preparing us maybe for professional
basketball and preparing us for life.  
  
Q. Just on the funny side about Coach Walz, Coach Auriemma said last night
he thought Coach's shirt last night looked like a tablecloth. I was wondering
if you would agree with that assessment. And, secondly, does he have ‑‑ what
do you guys think of Coach's wardrobe choices?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It was definitely pink. It wasn't red last night.  
SHERONNE VAILS: Yeah. It's okay. It looked like a picnic cloth, but it's all
right.  
  
Q. Coach, taking away your stock answer, what's it going to take besides
scoring more points than them tomorrow night to beat UConn?  
COACH WALZ: That's a great question. We're going to start working on that
today and tonight, and we'll put a game plan in tomorrow. We're going to use
today's practice just to get out there and shoot a little bit, go through our
stuff.  
At times we're a lot better with less. So the less preparation we have, the
less we have to think about things. And sometimes the less you think as a
basketball player, the more you just play on instinct.  
So we're just going to put a game plan in starting tomorrow for our hour that
we get.  
But it's going to take the best game that we played to date. We're gonna have
to play better than we played against Baylor, better than we played against
Tennessee and Cal.  
We're gonna have to play, I mean, 40 minutes of pretty much perfect
basketball, which I think we can. It's like I've said from day one: I'm just
glad it's not a best‑of‑seven series.  
It's just like Baylor. If it's a best‑of‑seven series, I told our kids‑‑ I'm
honest with them‑‑ if we had to play Baylor a best‑of‑seven, I don't think
we're going to win that series.  
But we don't have to. We've got to play one night, 40 minutes. And our goal is
to come out here and play the best 40 minutes that we played this entire
season.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys obviously haven't had a lot of success against UConn.
What would winning a championship against them do for the perception of your
program both locally and nationally?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it would be great. The opportunity to play for a national
championship and win a national championship would be fantastic. But I think
what we've done right now is put our program out there on a national stage.
Our goal is to get to this point every year. And we're going to continue to
strive for that.  
And being our second national championship game in five years, I think says a
lot about our program. To win one, that's what everybody dreams about. I've
been fortunate enough now to play in three finals, one as the assistant to a
head coach.  
And like I was telling my staff, the crazy thing about it is in all three I
played against a conference opponent. At Maryland we played Duke. Now it's
UConn twice.  
The one thing I love about the NCAA Tournament is you're normally paired up
when you're playing against people you haven't played, so the X's and O's part
really becomes a factor, because they haven't seen what you do, they don't
know what you're going to try and do.  
That's not going to be the case tomorrow night. He knows what our players can
do. We know what their players can do. So now it's going to come down to just
flat‑out execution. Because we're not going to be able to surprise them. We're
not going to be able to junk it up. We're going to have to play basketball.  
And that's where it's one player against another player, how many times can we
make sure we try to get them uncomfortable and take contested shots.  
It's going to be a challenge, but it's one we're excited to have. I'd rather
be playing tomorrow night than not.  
  
Q. Shoni, a lot has been made of your run to get here, but when the
tournament began, did you guys expect that you would be playing for this title
on Tuesday?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, definitely it's every girl's dream in the women's game
of basketball is to go out there and play for a national championship. Our
coaches have done a great job of preparing us and getting us to this point,
and they've done a lot of it, but also our team has just come together as one
and just gone out there and played our hearts out, and that's nothing you can
ask more of.  
And for us to be here‑‑ and we kind of had it in the back of our mind. I know
I did. But for us to get here is‑‑ just says a lot about the University of
Louisville.  
  
Q. Bria, in previous games why do you think you haven't been able to beat
UConn?  
BRIA SMITH: Well, the first time that we played them this year we didn't
really execute the game plan as good as we were supposed to. And I think that
now we have more of a focus. It's way later into the season, and we know
what's going to come with the UConn‑‑ with the UConn game plan and everything.
So I think that we're going to be more ready for this game.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wanted to ‑‑ in what ways is your team better than the last
time you guys played them and what do you remember about that game?   
COACH WALZ: I don't remember a thing. I try not to remember anything about
those games.  
We're playing better basketball. I mean, our kids are confident, and there's
really not much more to say, to be honest with you. We believe in what we're
doing. They believe in what they're doing. No one thought we could beat
Baylor. No one thought we'd come back a day after that and beat a Tennessee
team. And I know people picked us to beat Cal, but I think it's because they
just had to because we beat Baylor and Tennessee, so it's like, gosh, if we
don't pick them and they win, we look bad.  
I'm not sure everybody really believed that we'd win that game last night, and
I got a pretty good feeling they aren't picking us for tomorrow night.  
So we're just going to come out here and play, and that's what we've done, and
we're going to have fun doing it.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you walked out on the floor for the first day of practice,
what were your realistic expectations for this team? Geno, he knows what's
expected of him, but what did you expect from your team this year?  
COACH WALZ: Our realistic expectations first day of practice were to be
playing here. I thought we had a talented enough team and a deep enough team
to get to a Final Four.  
Now, I'm looking at that group that first day of practice, that's Asia Taylor,
Shawnta' Dyer, Tia Gibbs, Monique, healthy, as healthy as she could be. And
then all of a sudden Tia Gibbs was supposed to be back mid‑November. She
doesn't come back. Asia Taylor was the same thing. She does not come back.
Then Shawnta' Dyer goes down mid‑December with a torn ACL.  
Mo actually had been playing well in the non‑conference. We just weren't
playing her a lot of minutes. She played about 14 or 15 minutes, she wouldn't
practice the next day, trying to just get her into playing shape when we
started the conference. Started the conference well. And then she gets hurt in
practice and re‑injures the knee, and then it's back to play a game, take two
days off because the knee swells up, take care of that, get the swelling down,
play a game again.  
So once that all happened, it was, all right, let's see what we can do. Let's
see if we can't get through the conference, get through the conference
tournament and see if we can't put a run together.  
And that's what's happened. So when we started the year, I thought we had a
chance to be here. Now, January 5th or 7th, I'd be lying if I said I'm not a
little surprised that we're playing tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: At this time I'll excuse the student‑athletes to their individual
breakout rooms.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Jeff, tell me a little bit about Antonita Slaughter. Her play has
obviously been huge for you guys to get here, but hometown kid, talk about her
development a little bit and what she's meant to you guys during this last
couple weeks?  
COACH WALZ: Antonita has made significant strides from her freshman year to
now. I'm sure she'll tell you, if you have a chance to visit with her, there
were many times her freshman year that I told her she'd stay on scholarship
but she would be the water girl. I told her best thing that she could do in
practice was fill up the water cups for us. Because she wouldn't try. She
didn't give the effort that I knew she had to give to be great.  
Because I'd watch her in high school, and the kid, she could flat‑out shoot
the basketball. But she never looked to drive, she never looked to get in
there and rebound and try and be physical. And I just kept pushing her and
pushing her and pushing her, and towards the end of her freshman year she
started to play a little bit more. Then she ended up actually playing well for
us in the NCAA Tournament.  
Sophomore year, it was okay. She had a good year, not a great year. And then
all of a sudden last summer I challenged her to get in the gym and shoot. I
said: For us to be as good as I think we can, you've got to be a 40 percent
3‑point shooter. And she was pretty well close to that until that last month
where she went 4‑of‑34 through a five‑game stretch. And up until February the
27th, that was the last game she had asolid game, our last home game, I would
say she was the most consistent player we had. I knew what I was going to get
every night. I was going to get about 12 to 14 points, about eight boards, two
or three assists, and she'd play solid D.  
Now, I never dreamed she'd be‑‑ I'm not sure what she's shooting in the NCAA
Tournament from the 3‑point line, but it's got to be 50 percent plus. It's
pretty incredible what she's done. And they aren't standing on the line. I
mean, they're a good four or five feet behind it.  
So I'm excited for her, excited for her progress. And just her entire family
is down here supporting her. It's really neat to see.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering, your official response to Geno's criticism
of your shirt. And, also, if you could just talk about your relationship, what
it's like, with Geno.  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's not ‑‑ it's not‑‑ what I was going to tell y'all, too,
is this‑‑ this will most likely be the last game that I coach here. It's been
a great six years. As a women's basketball coach, you go through times where
you're always wondering what are you gonna do when you're finished. And I've
been to three national championship games. And now that I've got the
opportunity to be a waiter in his restaurant (laughter), I don't know what the
hell else somebody wants in life. So my goal is to become the head waiter. Not
just one that sits in the back. I want to be the best damn one he's got. So
I'm going to talk to him after the game tomorrow night and see when I can
start, see if we can talk a contract through, and hopefully we can get things
taken care of. Because it would be an honor to work in his restaurant.  
I love the guy. He's a great guy.  
  
Q. Jeff, you said other day, I mean, crowing for the Big East and how this
is sort of a fitting end for the conference as it is now and having you two
play. I think six of the last seven years there's been a Big East team in the
championship game. Just talk for a second what it means to have two Big East
teams playing for the NCAA championship and its last year as the most dominant
conference?  
COACH WALZ: It's a special thing. The Big East Conference, it's my‑‑ obviously
my sixth year of being in the conference. And every time you turn on a Final
Four, there's Big East teams playing in it.  
And for myself, obviously it's our second time in five years that we've faced
them in the finals. I don't think anybody could argue that this is the best
league in women's basketball. It's not just UConn and Notre Dame, Louisville
has been in the Final Four the past five years twice. So it's not just one
team that dominates it. You look at all of our programs, you get South
Florida, DePaul, I mean, you just start‑‑ St. John's. You can just keep going
on. If you don't come to play every night in our league, you're going to get
beat. And that's what makes our league so special.  
And the thing that I've really enjoyed about it is you've got every style of
play within our league, which is why I think we do so well in the NCAA
Tournament. You've got Harry at Villanova that's going to run the five out and
back screen you and slip on you, slip screen you to death, and it's just
exhausting to guard. But then when you get to the tournament, there's somebody
like that you're going to face and you're prepared for that. And then you get
the teams that like to run up and down the floor. You get your UConns
executing half court as well as I've seen, but then they'll ‑‑ a pressure
defense is relentless.  
So the Big East has prepared all of our teams to have success in the NCAA
Tournament, and I think it's a fitting end to have two teams playing for a
championship.  
  
Q. You do realize that if you take a job at Geno's restaurant you're going
to have to wear a tie.  
COACH WALZ: He said I don't. I can keep wearing my tablecloth. So I'm going to
get that worked out. That's going to be part of the contract.  
  
Q. Okay. He really seemed to like you and respect you. I mean, he talks
about a lot of coaches, but when he talks about you, you can tell that he
genuinely thinks you're a hell a coach. And I'm just wondering if you could
tell me why ‑‑ about the dynamic of your relationship and how that makes you
feel.   
COACH WALZ: Well, you know, he's always been good to me. The one thing that I
will say is I'm not sure he knew who I was when I got into the league. He knew
I worked at Maryland, but he never knew who I was.  
And I can remember at a Big East meeting where we just had a pretty frank
conversation. It was a good conversation. And I think at that point he was
like, oh, okay, he's not all that bad.  
And then as we've gone‑‑ I mean, I like to have fun. I think I'm pretty
sarcastic at times and I like to give it back to him as well. So he'll give it
to me, and I'll try and throw something back at him. And it's all in good fun.  
But when it comes to competing on the basketball floor, I've always respected
what he's done. I respect how he does things. Even when we had Angel. We had
some great games our first year, we lose I think by four or five in the
conference finals to them.  
And then obviously the following year we're playing in the finals, it's a
12‑point game at half and they score a backdoor layup to end the half, and he
knew it was a ball game. The final score was 20‑ 22 or 23. But even after the
game he's like, hey, I knew it was going to be a harder game than what
everybody else thought.  
But I've always respected him because he's just honest and blunt. Like I like
say, he says what the rest of us think, and I respect him for that.  
  
Q. Coach, Breanna Stewart has been incredible in the tournament as of late.
Could you talk a little bit about her performance and what it's going to take
to stop her tomorrow night?  
COACH WALZ: I'm hoping she misses the bus. She's playing like I think we all
thought she would the entire year. But for some freshmen sometimes it takes a
little bit of time to get into your groove. I watched her play in summer,
watched her play U.S.A. Basketball, and what you've seen in the tournament is
what she's done her entire career.  
So, to me, this is really not all that surprising. And, to be honest with you,
I don't think it's surprising to Geno either. There's a reason he recruited
her and she was National Player of the Year. She's a big‑time player.  
I had the opportunity to sit next to Jim Boeheim at the Olympics, and we're
just talking during the gold medal game. And he was like, wow, you know,
there's this kid that plays open gym with our women at time up there at
Syracuse, she's going to UConn, she's one of the best players I've ever seen.
I'm like, yeah, I know (laughter).  
So it's not a surprise at what she's doing. And she sure makes it look easy.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what Geno has meant to the women's game?
And, also, can you kind of compare and contrast you guys's styles of
coaching?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think what he's meant to our game is a lot of coaches lose
games. I mean, I think I'm 0‑and‑64, something like that, against him at this
point in time.  
Like I said, what impresses me so much about what he's done is he takes really
good players and gets them all to play hard, and then he gets them to buy into
his system and they continue to go.  
Our first year we played them at our place, and they actually were traveling
to Marquette or something so they stayed over and they practiced at our
practice facility. And I'd ask him, Hey, you care if I come watch? He's like,
Sure. Actually my whole team came to watch. And he sat there and talked to me
for the first hour of practice. But what impressed me so much is you had Renee
Montgomery, I think it was Maya's freshman year, Tina Charles, those kids were
out there running practice. He didn't have to tell them to go hard. The
upperclassmen were getting on the freshman, were getting on the sophomores. If
you weren't going hard, he didn't have to say anything because their teammates
are saying it.  
And that's when you know you've got yourself a great program and leaders.
Because as a coach, when you just have to coach and you're not trying to
encourage your kids, Go hard, go hard, go hard, you know it's going to be a
good thing.  
And that's what he's got. He just continues to get leaders after leaders, and
he develops them of course.  
  
Q. Jeff, all dynasties have to end sometime, UCLA, whichever. Can you
foresee anything in the coming years that would knock Connecticut off its
perch? Not that they win every year, but that changed the dynamic, short of
Geno leaving?  
COACH WALZ: No. Right now, no. I mean, Breanna Stewart is a freshman, so we're
dealing with her for three more years. And then again, what I like about them
is they don't‑‑ he's not one to stockpile kids. He doesn't put in‑‑ get 15‑‑
if you look at his roster, it's not 15 deep with 15 McDonald's All‑Americans.
He's going to get three or four each year, and then he builds players that go
around his system.  
I've always been impressed with him. You get players that‑‑ honestly, when I
look at some of them, like some of the ones he's recruited in the past,
they're great players for what he's trying to do. And then you put a Maya
Moore in the mix, then you put a Breanna Stewart in the mix, like you have to
guard everybody on his team. That's what makes them so good.  
And I don't see how that's going to change unless he decides to retire, which
I think he should (laughter). I'm all for it.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you played them the first time, Stewart didn't play. And just
does that sort of throw out that game? And you say you don't remember it or
don't want to remember it, but does that kind of change the plan knowing that
she wasn't even there and now she's on this run that few freshmen have ever
done?  
COACH WALZ: We're going to have to‑‑ we've seen her play enough obviously as
the year has gone on and we know what she can do, but she does throw a little
wrinkle into the plan of who guards her. Because if you focus too much on her,
then who's going to guard Dolson, who's going to score in the low block. And
then I've got Lewis I have to worry about. I mean, and then Hartley and then
Tuck and‑‑ I mean, it goes on.  
So we're going to have to try to figure out something to try to stop them from
getting so many easy baskets. I'm not sure what that is quite yet. I've got a
whole night to try to figure it out.  
  
Q. Jeff, you mentioned Hartley and Lewis. Sometimes I think the expectations
on those kids are so high that when they don't ‑‑ they're not sky high it's
like they're not playing well. Can you maybe talk about it, especially
Hartley? It seems like she has played pretty well during this NCAA Tournament.
  
COACH WALZ: I think Bria has played extremely well, to be honest with you. I
laugh because I watched Geno's press conference the other day and I listened
to his kids talk at the press conference and they talk about how it's been an
up‑and‑down year; they're 34‑4\. I'm like, I'd love to have a up‑and‑down year
and be 34‑4\. Or they might be 35‑4 now. I'm not sure if last night's‑‑ 34‑4t.  
That's just the expectations that are put on them every single year. And it's
a good thing, but at the same time I think everybody needs to take a step back
and say, hey, if 34‑4 is an up‑and‑down year, I'd hate to see what a bad
year‑‑ or actually what a good year is.  
But she's been there. She's been solid for him the entire‑‑ her entire career.
I like how she fights, I like her demeanor on the floor, and I like how she
takes a lot of responsibility for what's going on in their program.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier trying to keep things simple. I know you said
before in Oklahoma City before the Baylor game you were just gonna go out and
shoot. You wanted your kids to just sort of focus on putting the ball in the
basket. Can you sort of expand on that, that maybe sometimes it is better to
sort of keep their minds a little clear before big games like this?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah. It's like when we played Baylor. We weren't going to shut
them down. And we're not going to shut UConn down. I mean, it's about
impossible. So there's no way that we're going to‑‑ if we have a chance to
win, it's not going to be a 60‑55 game. It's got to be 84‑83\. We might have
to try and get up into the 90s if we can.  
And the only way we're going to do that is by shooting the basketball. We're
going to shoot 3s. He knows that. It's not going to be a secret. But they're
going to be out pressuring us too. I've got a feeling they'll probably find
where Antonita is.  
But we're going to have to figure out a way to score points. I know they're
going to score. But it's a matter of can we score.  
And that was the difference in the Baylor game. Everybody talks about how we
guarded Brittney Griner and all that. Again, they scored 81 points, which is
their average. We just figured out a way to score 82.  
So tomorrow night we're gonna have to figure out a way to put points on the
board.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously what's going on in the school right now is unbelievable
with the men's team playing tonight and you guys playing tomorrow night and a
chance for history of only the second program to have both titles. Have you
talked to Rick today at all? If they win, is he planning to show up tomorrow
night? Is there any sort of plan? I know you guys are watching the game
tonight at the same place you watched it the other night, I think.  
COACH WALZ: We're going to be watching at the Sheraton tonight in the lobby.
So that's where we're going to watch the game tonight.  
I've texted with Rick back and forth, just wished him luck. And, again, he
congratulated us. And he's focused right now on trying to make sure his kids
are prepared to play a basketball game.  
He told me if he can make it down for tomorrow, he's coming, which I can only
imagine what's on his plate after tonight's game. It wouldn't surprise me if
he found a way to come down, but if not, I know he'll be watching. He's done
it through the entire tournament.  
It's something special, not just with our basketball programs, but our
football team wins the Sugar Bowl in a game no one expected them to win
either. So our whole philosophy is, hey, we're just going to come out here and
play, and we're going to play hard. We're going to have a game plan.  
But there's no pressure on us to win this game. The pressure is all on them
because they're going to be a heavy favorite to win. And we're just going to
come out and try and get it to where if we can get it into the second half,
get it down maybe the under eight timeout where there's just a little pressure
on them, then we'll see if we can't make a few shots.  
But like I tell our kids every game, you gotta make it a game at half or you
don't have a chance in the second half. So that's really our goal.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions for coach?  
  
Q. Sorry if anybody was dumb enough to ask this, but I was just wondering,
could you talk about the similarities and differences between Rick Pitino and
Geno Auriemma.  
COACH WALZ: They both win a lot. They're both great.  
Rick's been great to me. I mean, I can call him up. I text him. It's not like
I have to wait five or six hours to get a response or a phone call back. And
Geno's the same way.  
So as colleagues, they're both great to me. As coaches, I mean, they're both
fantastic coaches who have had a ton of success.  
And then their personalities. I mean, you have to be confident in this
business if you're going to be successful. And I think‑‑ I laugh because I
really like both of them.  
I think there's a big difference‑‑ and I tell my players all the time‑‑
there's a big difference between being confident and arrogant. And if you're
not confident, you're not going to be successful in anything you do in life.
But at the same time, you don't want to be arrogant.  
And we really work on that. We really talk to our players. And we'll show them
examples of stuff that goes on in the media of, hey, this to me is a confident
person. This is a confident response. This is an arrogant response. So our
players get an understanding of what they're portrayed as. People can hear
somebody say something and go, wow, that's an arrogant answer.  
Because it's important to me. It's important to all of us. I'm a big believer
in first impressions. You only get one of them, so let's make it the best.  
MODERATOR: We have time for a couple more questions, if there are any.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais we have UConn head coach Geno Auriemma
and student‑athletes Caroline Doty, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, Breanna Stewart,
Stefanie Dolson, and Kelly Faris.  
We'll start taking questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Caroline, I don't know if there is such a thing, but are now in official
final game of your career mode?  
CAROLINE DOTY: I don't know if there's a mode to get into it, but definitely
crossed my mind. It's been five years. I don't know what I'm going to be doing
next year. It's a long time.  
I'm just happy to be here and I'm glad the national championship is my last
career game. Hope to go out with a bang.  
  
Q. Who's got Shoni Schimmel assignment tomorrow?  
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We haven't gone over that yet.  
MODERATOR: That might be a better question for Coach at that time.  
  
Q. How much has it helped you guys having played them already and there's a
familiarity of an opponent so in scouting reports it's fresh as opposed to
seeing a team for the first time that you may not know as much about?  
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT‑ATHLETE: It helps. Obviously they're a Big East team, so
we've seen them a couple different times and played them once earlier this
season. But at the same time, that was a while ago. And you know they're going
to change, just as we've changed over the season.  
So there's some things that are gonna be the same about them that we know, and
then we just have to make sure that we're focused and prepared for the type of
play that they're putting on right now.  
  
Q. Stef, sort of the same lines there, I mean, this Louisville team seems to
be loose and feels they have nothing to lose tomorrow night playing the
national championship game. They've been doing that all through the tournament
it seems. Whereas you guys, expectation every year is you come to win a
national championship and compete for it. Do you feel there's more pressure on
you guys to win tomorrow night, or is it you guys are loose and ready to just
play?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think that exactly. We're just ready to play. Louisville
has done a great job beating Baylor, beating Cal, beating Tennessee. They've
come a long way, and I don't think a lot of people expected it.  
But, like you said, they're going to come and play like they have nothing to
lose, and we have to go out there and not really focus on them and focus on
working hard in practice today and then come out tomorrow ready to play and
have fun.  
  
Q. Kaleena, what do you think the most important moment of the season has
been?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Up to this point I think after our Big East Tournament
and just the turnaround that we've made this season as a group, you know, the
confidence level has risen and just our mindset has gotten a lot better as a
unit.  
  
Q. Kelly and Caroline, you guys obviously have a lot of experience playing
in the NCAA Tournament. What would it mean for both of you to bring another
national title back to Connecticut?  
CAROLINE DOTY: It would be a great team win. It would be a great ending to a
great four years for Kelly, five years for me.  
We come in every single year with the mindset and the goal to win a national
championship. So for it to be the last go‑around to be with the teammates we
have, who are playing unbelievable, that would just send us off on a great
note. We wouldn't be more happier.  
But we just gotta take care of business and prepare and really work with the
game plan Coach has for us.  
KELLY FARIS: I would agree. For us it's our last opportunity, and each year is
special and different in its own way, and this year we've had our ups and
downs. And we've had to work really hard to get to the point where we're at.
So I want it just as bad as anybody on this team. And I know we want it for
each other more than anything.  
So like Caroline said, it sends us out on the right note.  
  
Q. Breanna, while you were going through your stretch between the first ten
games and the start of Big East Tournament, do you remember anything
particularly funny or insightful that Coach Auriemma or Coach Dailey said to
you that resonated with you either as a ‑‑ in funny way or in a serious way
that got you going?   
BREANNA STEWART: I was about to say no, not particularly. I don't really have
anything in particular, no, but they always seem to be busting my chops.  
  
Q. Kelly, I was reading up on the last game against Louisville, and I think
you had seven turnovers that game, seven assists. And it was interesting that
Coach pointed out ‑‑ he said you were really upset after that game, you were
really hard on yourself. What are your memories of that game even though you
won? Seems like at least individually you were not happy with your
performance.   
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, I've had a few too many of those games this year. The
turnovers are huge, and you can't have seniors contributing the most to that.  
So, yeah, of course after that game we won, but there's times that you can win
and still feel like you lost a game. It's not all about winning here‑‑ and we
said that multiple times‑‑ it's about how you win. And so as a team you're
happy that you get the win, but individually there's times that you're gonna
be unsatisfied with how you play. And that was one of them.  
  
Q. Can you quantify how unsatisfied you were after that game versus, let's
say, another game this season?  
KELLY FARIS: I don't really remember exactly. But given the fact that I had
seven turnovers, I'm sure I was pretty disappointed in myself in that.  
  
Q. Stefanie, how difficult has it been for you to play through this pain? I
mean, in a realistic sense to ‑‑ I know you haven't been practicing as much,
but how much pain are you in and how much mental stress does that put you
under?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It's definitely frustrating to play with this, but my team
and the coach has done a good job of just supporting me and helping me through
it, because I've never had to do anything like this. Rosemary has done a great
job of taking care of me and treating me, making it feel better every day.  
So I'm just working through it. Like I said, my teammates are helping me out
and doing what they gotta do.  
  
Q. This is for Kaleena. Very few programs have such legendary figures as a
Diana Taurasi or a Maya Moore, and sometimes I think it can be hard when
you're the player that comes in and is inevitably compared to these great
players. How have you sort of dealt with that and tried to just be yourself,
not necessarily get caught up in being compared to legends in your program?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It's easy with our coaching staff and with my
teammates to not really get caught up in stuff like that. Especially playing
on a team like this with so many good players and so many people that are
capable of so many things. You don't really think about yourself.  
Last night was a perfect example of what a great team we have and how many
great players are on this team. It wasn't just one person making everything
happen out there; it was a team effort. So it's not hard at all to look past
that stuff.  
  
Q. Breanna, people have expected so much of you since you were like 14 years
old in terms of playing. Do you ever surprise yourself by what you're able to
do? Do you ever come out of game and go: I didn't think I was capable of
something like that?  
BREANNA STEWART: To think that I wasn't capable of doing something? I don't
know if I have ever surprised myself just because you would think that you
would be the one person that actually knows what you're capable of doing. But
I think there's been moments where there's been like certain plays that you've
been‑‑ or I've been surprised about, I guess.  
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Awesome answer (laughter).  
  
Q. Stefanie, good to see you smiling. You usually come into press
conferences smiling, and you looked a bit in pain.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: What?  
  
Q. Usually when you come into press conferences you're always smiling.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I'm always smiling.  
  
Q. Anyway, my question for you, just talk about the three seniors and what
they've meant, not in terms of leadership this season, but since the end of
Big East Tournament. How key have they been to just bringing everybody back
together, getting on this new page that you've done through the NCAAs?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: They have meant a ton. They have since then spoken to all of
us, saying it's their last year. And we're all going out fighting for them. We
know they want a national championship; we want a national championship for
them. And they've all given up so much and worked so hard for all the years
that they've been here.  
So for any of us to give anything less than our best out there would be a
disappointment to them.  
  
Q. Stefanie, do you think you guys should be favored in this game? Do you
consider yourself the favorite in this game?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I don't think so. I mean, we can't really think about that,
to be honest. We gotta go into it‑‑ like I was saying before, Louisville is
going to give us a great game. Every team we've played in this tournament has
given us a great and tough game.  
And to go into it thinking that we're the favorites‑‑ I mean, they beat
Baylor. So we gotta go into it knowing how hard they've worked to get to the
point that they are and, like I said, focus on ourselves and just executing
offense, defense, and playing together as a unit.  
  
Q. Geno, you guys are ‑‑ you guys are 7‑0 in title games in your career.
This is the first time that you're here that you haven't won a title a Big
East title beforehand. Does that make this one different in a sense that
there's been sort of nothing accomplished this year as far as championships
that may be goals for the team and now you have a chance to sort of right that
by winning the eighth one?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I mean, I guess that's kind of stuff that when
you guys have to come up with‑‑ but I think we won something like 13 or 14 Big
East championships in a row, and I don't remember anybody at the Final Four
saying, well, you know, you won the regular season and you won the tournament
so that should prime you for the national championship.  
I think what happens‑‑ I've always said this. What happens during the regular
season and what happens in the tournament, you kind of have to put all that
behind you. Winning the Big East championship is a lot harder than winning one
game. Winning the regular season Big East championship is a lot harder than
winning one game. I'm sure if Louisville had to play Baylor four times during
the regular season, it would be a lot harder than playing them one time one
night.  
So tomorrow night Louisville plays Connecticut. What happened leading up to
that I don't think is going to have any bearing whatsoever on that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
At this time we're going to excuse the student‑athletes to go to their
breakout rooms.  
We'll continue with questions for head coach. Start right here.  
  
Q. Geno, do you remember a team that's made a bigger jump mentally, meaning
mindset ‑wise, from the end of a Big East Tournament to the start of the NCAA
Tournament more so than this group has?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Maybe not. Maybe not. There's been other times when we've had
to readjust how we do things, who we are and recalibrate, I guess. I remember
in 2003 and 2004 we lost in the Big East Tournament, one time in the finals
and one time in the semifinals, and after that we had to go back and kind of
switch gears a little bit and ended up coming out and winning the national
championship both of those years.  
But, again, I'm kind of torn about all this, you know, because I know we made
some changes and I know we changed a little bit, but, like I said yesterday‑‑
and I know a lot of you guys weren't here‑‑ we didn't have a ten‑game losing
streak during the season and then we had to like fix everything and then come
in as a 9th seed and shock the world and here we are: Holy shit, how did they
get here? You know?  
We won 30‑some games and we beat the ACC champion by 30, the Big Ten champion
by 30, the Pac‑12 champion by 26, and the Southeast Conference champion by 30.
So we didn't sneak into the tournament. We just had to make a couple
adjustments to how we thought and get a couple kids to kind of step outside
their little world they lived in that was not helping them.  
So in terms of how much we've changed as a team, it looks like a lot on the
outside to what you're seeing, but internally it wasn't that much. It was just
a few little things that had to be adjusted.  
  
Q. Geno, assuming that there was quite an excitement from winning last
night, are you concerned that the beginning tomorrow night may take a little
while to get back to where you should be?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It always does. It always does. The great fallacy in coaching
and in everybody's‑‑ it's just another game. No, it isn't. It's the national
championship game.  
So you can try to spin it any way you want, but for both teams those first
five minutes‑‑ look at last night, the first ten minutes, it was hard to get
anything done.  
It's really, really hard. I think tomorrow it will be the same way. I think
it's going to take both teams a little bit of time to get comfortable. I could
be wrong. One team could just start off like gangbusters. But my experience
has been that it's a hard game to play in early on. You really do need to kind
of let the emotions wear off, and that's going to take a little bit of time
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Geno, the question I try to get Breanna to expand on regarding if she
ever surprises herself, if you had the time to text that answer to her, what
would you have provided her with?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I mean, I think the really good players‑‑ I
think the really good players, they expect to be good. So whatever they do,
they expect it. I think the players that aren't that good‑‑ it's like Shaq in
the commercial when he comes out of the car and he goes, That's like how I
felt when I made two free throws in a row: Wow. That's a lot more than I hoped
for.  
The great players, everything they do, they go like, Uh‑huh. I can do that.
Because that's what makes them really, really good.  
So I'm not surprised that she said, you know, I know I'm a good player so when
I play well I'm not surprised.  
I'm sure that the thing that surprises her, or any of those other really good
players, is when they play terribly. That probably is a shock to their system
more than like, wow, I'm surprised I just did that. I think the opposite is
true.  
  
Q. Coach, what on earth did you think it would take to get Heather Buck into
last night's game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why is that relevant?  
  
Q. I was just asking about last night.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why? I mean, Heather Buck is one our players, so I put her in
when I think it's time to put her in. No sooner, no later.  
  
Q. If you go out and win the championship, what would be the most rewarding
thing for you about this particular team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Hmm. Rewarding for me personally or rewarding for this team?  
  
Q. Both ways, I guess.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Whenever I talk about my team, and especially with my team, I
always talk to them in terms of what I think they can be. So when we got
together in October‑‑ actually when I saw them in September during their
preseason workouts with Amanda Kimball, our strength and conditioning coach,
when I would go watch them in the morning, I remember saying to them: I think
this can be a really special group. You guys have a certain something.  
And I saw it in their workouts, the way they acted, the way they behaved, the
way they competed against each other, how hard they went just, the aura they
had with them.  
And they all made a point to mention it to me almost every other day in the
office. They would come to me and they would say, Coach, this just feels good.
It feels different.  
So when I started to think ahead, I started to think of all the possibilities
that this team would have. And then when things got a little bit out of kilter
a little bit and players didn't develop like I thought they were going to,
there was almost the sense of maybe I was wrong. Maybe what I saw wasn't
really what was true. And I started to privately I started to like go, man, I
hope I didn't overestimate what we have here. And I think some of the other
coaches felt the same way, and we just didn't know what to do to get some of
these guys to shake that little bit of doubt that they had in their minds.  
So what would be most rewarding for me, that it wasn't easy, that they were
able to conquer some things that are hard to conquer, which is mostly in your
mind. And if we're fortunate enough to win tomorrow night, that will probably
be my biggest takeaway from that.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said ‑‑ we've heard you say you can't win championships
without great players.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Uh‑huh.  
  
Q. Well, two of them, Diggins and Brittney Griner, are leaving, and they
have one between them. Can you talk about how hard it really is to do what you
guys have done? Because I think we're starting to see it now.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I always thought that. I always thought that while we
were in that run of, what‑‑ from 2000 to 2010‑‑ what did we win, six
championships? Five? Six? We won six championships in ten years. I always
thought during that run‑‑ I said, you know, someday everybody's going to look
back and go: I can't believe that that actually happened. Because the more
time passes and the more you see how many really good teams come up short, you
start to realize how incredible that was and how hard it is to do.  
And I guess this is a perfect time to address that, that having the best
player in the country or having the two best players in the country‑‑ I don't
thinkthe average person out there understands that this is what makes it so
hard, is that Baylor didn't have to play Louisville in a best‑of‑five series.
We didn't have to play Notre Dame last night and then again tomorrow night and
then two nights later. You only have to win one game in this tournament, and
then you have to win another one, but it's not against the same team. So all
you need is one good night and the other team struggles just a little and it
changes everything.  
So to be able to go through that six‑game stretch in the NCAA Tournament year
after year after year and put yourself in that situation to win it, I want to
say it's more than just great players. But when it comes down to it, nothing
else matters if you don't have great players.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk specifically about Bria and Kaleena of maybe some ‑‑
I don't want to say necessarily ups and downs, maybe that's not fair, but just
some of the struggles both of them have gone through this season and then how
well they're playing now in the most important part of the season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Bria Hartley and Breanna Stewart?  
  
Q. No, Bria Hartley and Kaleena.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh, well, I think Kaleena has been pretty consistent. She's
one of the few players on our team that hasn't been set back by either
injuries or some kind of mental funk or whatever. She's been somewhat
consistent. I can say that pretty much day in and day out for five months
she's been the same.  
Bria Hartley is just playing right now like‑‑ she's not even there yet, but
hopefully tomorrow night she'll get there. But there was a level that Bria
Hartley was playing in September that I had never seen her play before. I
thought she was as good a player as we've ever had in our gym during September
and October. And unfortunately things didn't pan out the way I'd hoped, but
I'm a firm believer that when you're as competitive as Bria Hartley is and
when you want to win as bad as she does, you just figure out way to be ready
for the biggest games. And I don't know who's going to play really well
tomorrow night, but she's going to be one of them.  
  
Q. Geno, you've got a lot of great players that you've talked about over the
years. Is there anyone that you could compare in terms of sacrifice and pain
over five years and perseverance to Caroline?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Probably the closest one would probably be Shea Ralph that I
have had similar experiences. Shea, I think what Shea went through, you know,
talk about somebody that could have won four national championships, the four
teams that Shea was on her four years at Connecticut, at one time during those
four seasons we were the best team in the country. And had Shea been
completely healthy all four of those years, we would have won four national
championships.  
So I don't think anybody's suffered from a physical standpoint more than Shea
Ralph has at the University of Connecticut or sacrificed her body more.  
And with Caroline it's been‑‑ it's been maybe even harder, because with Shea,
even when Shea was hurt, she was one of the best players in the Big East and
maybe in the country.  
With Caroline, her position is different. When she's not a hundred percent,
it's very difficult for her to get the things done that she wants to get done.  
But I know right now she does ‑‑ I think right now I don't think there's
anybody that appreciates being here more than she does.  
I still think back to the one year that she played the entire year when she
was healthy and we went 39‑0 and we didn't have a point guard. It was her and
Tiffany Hayes in the back court and we won a lot of games, and I wish I could
have had that Caroline for the whole four years.  
  
Q. Geno, two ‑parter. First one, what it would mean to win an eighth title
and tie the record tomorrow night that Tennessee holds? And the second part
is: When you guys were here last for the championship, it was the end of the
Taurasi era, winning the third straight in New Orleans. Is this the start of a
new era with, if you do win tomorrow night, Breanna Stewart, who is having the
best season of a freshman ever in an NCAA Tournament?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Talking about things that haven't happened yet is never a good
idea. I think tomorrow night when the game is over, if we don't win, it's a
sad way for Kelly and those guys to graduate. If we do win, it's an amazing
way for Kelly and Caroline and Heather to finish their careers at Connecticut.
And if we do win, it's something that Kaleena Lewis traveled 3,000 miles from
California to go to Connecticut to get. It's why Moriah Jefferson came from
Dallas, Texas, to Connecticut, to get one of those.  
So I think if we're fortunate enough to win tomorrow night, it's the first day
of a new life for those guys. When I wake up Wednesday morning, win or lose
tomorrow, I don't know that my life is gonna be impacted that much. I don't
think it's going to be impacted much. When I go to the Masters Friday, because
my son's down there, that will be impactful.  
  
Q. Coach, Antonita Slaughter on fire from 3 ‑point range yesterday. If you
could talk about the challenge of defending that shot tomorrow and how crucial
that will be in order to win.   
COACH AURIEMMA: I watched that game yesterday, and it's just‑‑ he's got to be
a genius, that guy. Because every time I see that kid catch the ball, she's
wide open. And I can understand if it's the first game of the tournament, but
here they are now in their fifth game in the NCAA Tournament and the kid for
40 minutes is wide open every time she catches it.  
So I'm going to have to watch their films really closely and find out how the
hell he does that, because I want to try to do the same thing with Kaleena
Lewis.  
But she has made more big shots in this tournament than anybody I can remember
in any five‑game stretch.  
So all I can say is if we're there and we have a hand in her face and she
still makes them, then God bless them, they deserve to win.  
  
Q. Geno, what happened to Bria? Did she just lose her confidence? What
happens to a player that's playing in an exceptionally high level and then
seems to really dip like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You have daughters?  
  
Q. One.  
COACH AURIEMMA: One. So you're just asking me that to piss me off, right?
(Laughter). Because I got two of them. And I can't explain the stuff that goes
through their heads.  
Bria Hartley, one of the reasons why she was All‑American last year and one of
the reasons why she's really, really good is she is really, really, really,
really stubborn. Really stubborn. One of her greatest attributes is she's
really determined, and one of her worst attributes is she's stubborn. And
she's so cocky and she believes in herself so much. And one of her problems is
she don't listen to anybody. I mean nobody.  
So when she was hurt, she wouldn't tell anybody. So she kept playing on an
ankle that was bothering her, and then it got to a point where she can't
practice for a month. And during that month she realized how being stubborn
and not wanting to listen to anybody‑‑ how much it cost her.  
And when she came back, she tried to get it all back real quick. And when it
didn't happen for her, she just collapsed. Because she puts so much of her
life into it, she wants it so bad, that when she couldn't have it, it was just
was a killer for her.  
But through it all, you know what happened on the back side of that? At the
end of it all, she's learned how to open up with people, tell them what you
think, listen to what they're saying to you, take everything in, pay
attention, say what's on your mind; don't just sit there, don't think you got
all the answers.  
So that's come out of this; that whatever happens tomorrow night, when next
season starts, there's a whole new Bria Hartley out there now that didn't
exist before all this.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit just about maybe how you've evolved or
how you've been able to continue to reinvent this team year after year after
year, you know, and keep them at the top? What's been the key for you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think as you get to a certain age, it's really, really
important that you have really young assistants, young, energetic, incredibly
focused, driven people on your staff. And Chris Dailey is not as young as Shea
and Marisa, but when he started at Connecticut 28 years ago, Chris and I had
this vision of this is how we're gonna do things.  
With me, it's gotten a little lax. Like I don't have the brain power or the
discipline as much as I did to really kind of embrace that as much as I did
back then.  
Chris Dailey has not wavered one iota from that first week of practice 28
years ago and what our demands are on our team.  
And Shea and Marisa just take it to a whole 'nother level in terms of their‑‑
the energy level that they bring and how incredibly passionate they are about
what they do.  
So because of that, as I've gotten older, I've been able to hang on to all
those things, even though, me personally, it's hard for me to hang on to them
because, you know, my life's changed a little bit, and I've been here and
there the last four years with the Olympic thing.  
But Tonya Cardoza, Jamelle Elliott before them, and Chris, Marisa, and Shea
right now, the things that we think were important 28 years ago, the things
that I thought were important when Shea played, those things are just as
important now, and those three people make sure that it's done the same way.
And every player on our team buys into it, and that's why every year we put
ourselves in the position to be at this point during the season.  
  
Q. Geno, this morning Jeff Walz announced his resignation so that he could
go work for you at your new restaurant. Two questions: One, what do you think
makes him qualified to work for you, and, two, when do you think he'll start
at maître d'?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I heard about that, that he had said that. I ran into Shoni
Schimmel's parents on the way over here, and they said they're all for it and
the Schimmel twins are transferring to Connecticut (laughter). Even though
they're not twins. So that's the plus side of him resigning or retiring.  
He doesn't dress well enough to work in the front room of my restaurant
(laughter), so he'll be bussing dishes and taking out the trash in the back
until he fixes his attitude.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the energy level that Louisville is playing
with right now? You said last night they're playing as if they don't think
they can lose. And, also, can you just explain your relationship with Coach
Walz?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I think that's a fallacy too. I guarantee you
they're not sitting in the their locker room today before practice, today
after practice, whenever they're watching film as a team, they're not sitting
there saying: You know what? Let's just go play tomorrow. We got nothing to
lose. They're not saying that. Because I love playing against teams that say
"We got nothing to lose" because we usually beat them by 50. Because you know
what? You know what's at stake tomorrow? National championship. So those kids
and Jeff and the staff, everybody knows‑‑ we got nothing to lose tomorrow?
Really? You got the national championship to lose tomorrow. They know that. We
know that. Everybody that's watching the game knows that.  
So what's helped Louisville get here is they want to win. I don't think
there's this, well, we're just free and clear; we got nothing to lose. They
want to win. Because when you watch them play, they play to win. They're not
out there going, well, let's just see what happens. And they're not looking to
just hang around and see if they happen to win the game. They're playing to
win, and that's why they're so much fun to watch right now. And I've loved
watching them play. I've watched every one of their games.  
As far as Jeff is concerned, I see a lot of myself in him, being an assistant
coach in a great program like he was, then getting your first opportunity to
be a head coach and all that goes with that.  
When I did it, no one was paying attention. He's doing it in a much bigger
arena where lights are a lot brighter. When he started at Louisville and what
he's done there in a short period of time‑‑ how many years he's been there?
Six? You look around the country, who's done a better job than him in six
years? I don't think anybody. I don't think there's another coach in America
that's accomplished as much as he has from where they started in the last six
year than he has.  
And I've tried to‑‑ we spent a lot of time together at the Big East meetings.
And I've tried to help him out a little bit. I told him‑‑ I said, You're so
inexperienced, you don't even know how to get a technical. You say the wrong
things. And I gave him a couple pointers on how to really get technicals. And
he's taken me up on it, and pretty much every time we play them he gets one
just to prove to me that he's a good learner.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit more about the defensive game plan for
tomorrow night, please?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why, are you related to Jeff (laughter)?  
  
Q. No, I'm with Louisville. I'm just looking at ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're with Louisville and you want me to tell you what
thedefensive game plan is?  
  
Q. I'm with the Louisville media. I mean, I'm not ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh. Oh. I'm just funning with you. That's what they say down
South, right, funning? Yeah.  
Well, I've gotten a lot text messages from a lot of my friends in coaching,
and they all seem to start with: Yo, tomorrow night get a hand up.  
So one of our strategies tomorrow night is every time one of those guys
catches the ball on the perimeter, we're going to get a hand up.  
They're really hard to defend. They really are. I don't know exactly what's
going to happen tomorrow night, but I'll make you one prediction. At some
point during the game Shoni Schimmel will make a shot that you will think
she's closer to our basket than she is to theirs, because she does that all
the time against us. She makes shots from ridiculous places against us. And
there are things that Louisville does that you just can't defend. Because
that's just what they do.  
I'm more impressed and more amazed watching them defensively. I thought Jeff
came up with the perfect strategy when they were playing either Baylor or
Tennessee, I'm not sure, when the sideline reporter asked him about what
defense they're running in defense, and he said I have no idea. He said: I
have no idea. I have no idea what they're doing. I don't have any idea what
defense we're in. He goes: And I guess that's good, because if I don't know
what they're doing, then the other team can't figure out what they're doing,
so we're going to stay in it.  
So if they play that defense tomorrow night, we're going to be in big trouble.  
  
Q. Coach, my question was going to be about their defense. Obviously you've
beaten them in the past, but how concerned are you about the different
defenses they play ‑‑ which some coaches call it junk defense‑‑ and your
team's ability to handle it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: He's always got something up his sleeve. I remember the first
time we played them he had his team line up and go the wrong way coming out of
halftime so that we would shoot at the wrong basket. Who does that in a
college game? That's something you do in CYO, right?  
So he had his team line up and go the wrong way, and all my Phi Beta Kappas,
they all went with him. And luckily the ref went, Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
supposed to go that way. He was so pissed because he had us and the ref
stopped it.  
So he's always coming up with something. He's always got something that's a
little unconventional.  
So we're not‑‑ our team doesn't‑‑ we don't try to figure out like every little
thing that you're doing and then have something for every little thing you're
doing. So with the 30‑second shot clock you don't have the ability to come
down and go: I think they're in. Wait, no they're not.  
So we just have a plan of attack, and we attack it. And whatever it is that
they're doing, that's fine. We'll make adjustments as we're moving through the
thing. Because in the end every defense is the same. Every defense is the
same. It might start out looking a little bit different, it might take a
different shape or form at the beginning, but after one or two passes, every
defense is the same.  
  
Q. Geno, will Kelly leave as one of your favorite all ‑time players? And who
would she likely to be guarding tomorrow?   
COACH AURIEMMA: That's a good question, who she will be guarding tomorrow
night. We've kind of varied that recently, like we did last night. Just move
around a little bit.  
Will she leave as one of my favorite players? Absolutely. Absolutely. I think
she's going to leave as a lot of people's favorite player. Kelly's a product
of her environment, her family, where she grew up. If somebody said, hey,
where is Kelly Faris from? Miami Beach. You would say, No, she's not. Where's
she from? Anaheim Hills. No, she's not. She's from Indiana. Yeah, she looks
like an Indiana kid. She looks like a kid from a basketball‑crazy state who
just loves to play basketball, who plays just for the love of the game.  
And I don't think there's that much of that anymore. And she's touched a lot
of people's lives up in Connecticut for sure.  
  
Q. Geno, you mentioned how the spotlight has gotten a little bigger on
women's basketball lately. You look big picture, it seems ‑‑ from the
President doing a bracket on the women's side now and the Vice President going
to the Final Four a couple years ago and obviously supporting Delaware in
their run lately and you have a great relationship with the governor of
Connecticut, is it because some of them have daughters and they're following
more? It just seems pretty neat that some of the top politicians in the
country are big women's basketball fans it seems.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, they're the future minivan voters, you know, soccer
moms. And everybody's looking for that vote, so maybe they're hedging their
bets down the road.  
One of the few audiences that we don't have is that audience that all the
advertisers really, really, really aspire to get, I guess, that 18‑ to 35
year‑old guy who buys trucks and Miller Lite and Bud Light and all that good
stuff. We don't have that audience probably.  
The audience that we do have is when those guys get a little bit older and
they have daughters, then we get them to become women's basketball fans. And
that's something that I think we have to keep doing a better job of growing
our fan base.  
Can we ever attract that 18 to 35? I don't know. I don't know. But the fan
base that we do have, I think we have to do more to strengthen it. We have to
do more to make them more passionate about it. Because as you mentioned, when
they do get involved with the game for whatever reason, they kind of‑‑ they
enjoy it. They enjoy the experience. They enjoy the attachment to the game.
And I think we always have to be mindful of what we're going to do to
strengthen that.  
  
Q. You pretty well answered this question on Kelly a while ago, but Doris
Burke the other day said she represented the heart and soul of the team as
much as anyone she can ever remember playing at UConn. Can you give a couple
of examples of that?  
And last night, the sequence where she got the three offensive rebounds and
then at the end of the first half too, is that what she is‑‑ does that sum her
up?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't‑‑ you know, normally when you talk about players
that have hadgreat, great careers at Connecticut, you can identify them by
something that was great, a great skill that they had.  
And I think Kelly is one of the few players that have come through our program
that when she leaves, they're never going to introduce her as, That was Kelly
Faris; she was a great passer, or she was a great shooter, or she was a great
ball handler.  
For Kelly, it's more‑‑ those three rebounds yesterday, they're indicative of
what Kelly is great at. Kelly is great at putting you in a position to win.
That's what she's great at.  
We had no business last year in the semifinal of even having a chance to win
that game against Notre Dame, and in the last two minutes she just
single‑handedly put us in a position to win that game. She's done that so many
times that I can't even count them.  
So when she leaves Connecticut and people ask me, you know, Who's one of the
best players you've ever had at Connecticut, and I say, Kelly Faris, they'll
say, Why? She was great at making sure we were in position to win every night.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're welcome.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

Louisville  64  
Cal - 57

  
MODERATOR: Joining us from Louisville, head coach Jeff Walz and
student‑athletes Shoni Schimmel, Bria Smith, and Antonita Slaughter.  
We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Walz and then take questions
for the student‑athletes.  
COACH WALZ: Well, first off, I'd just like to congratulate Cal and Lindsay on
a fantastic season. She's a first‑class person. I consider her a friend in
this profession, and I have the utmost respect for what she's done. And I wish
her and her program‑‑ she can continue to build it and grow it and nothing but
success.  
From our end, we got one more game. I told the kids they're stuck with me in
practice for one more day. So it's just‑‑ it's a remarkable group of young
ladies. I'm proud of every single one of them.  
And can't even put into words how proud I am for the adversity that we faced
this entire season with our injuries. Tonight we're down 10 at half, we come
out, we execute perfect to start the second half. We scored I think the first
five, and then we just chipped away and chipped away and chipped away. And we
run a play at the end there, Sara Hammond gets a layup, gets fouled, and we
finally take our first lead.  
And once we took the lead, I knew‑‑ I could see it in our kids' eyes, the
excitement that, hey, we can do this, we're gonna do this. And, like I said,
I'm proud of them.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Antonita, talk about how you were feeling when you got the ball. You were
obviously very comfortable shooting. What gave you the hot hand tonight?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: I just think when I shoot the ball I know that my
teammates have confidence in me, so that gives me confidence within myself.  
  
Q. Bria, there was a moment where it seems like the turnovers for you
personally were piling up, and Coach kind of got into your face a little bit
but also consoled you for a little bit. Kind of what was that conversation
like?  
BRIA SMITH: Well, he basically was telling me‑‑ he was telling me how I needed
to slow down and I needed to stop occupying the ball so much and we got here
by playing team basketball. And we kind of got out of that for a while. So
just to pass the ball more around and get back into the way that we play.  
  
Q. Antonita, you've been one of the team's best shooters from a marksmanship
standpoint most of the season. Went through a little bit of a downturn, maybe
had shooting problems there at the end, had a great game against Baylor, a
little bit quiet against Tennessee, and then really blossomed tonight. Was
there something in particular you did mentally or any other way, tied your
shoes a certain way or whatever, to sort of like get in the right mindset and
bring out the confidence in this game?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: No, it just all comes with repetition. When I was down, I
just keptafter practice just staying after a little later and shooting more.  
And, like I said, I know my team has confidence in me and they want me to
continue to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. Shoni, I ask this question part serious and part fun, okay? Your parents
said they would marry if you beat Baylor. What do you think they might be
saying or will say if you beat ‑‑ if you beat whoever wins the second game?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I don't know. She's up here telling me her brother (laughter).
But we'll see. I don't know. Thing going around is tattoos, so I might make
them tattoo something. Our assistant coach, Samantha Williams, is getting a
tattoo of a cardinal bird soon, so if we keep winning, I heard Coach Walz is
going to get one, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Just can you guys talk about your excitement level to getting to this
point, just how unbelievable this journey has been for you guys?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It doesn't feel realistic right now. It hasn't set in yet.
We're playing in a national championship in a couple days. It's just so
exciting and we've worked so hard to get here, and just like we're ready to
take on anything.  
We've gone through so much adversity through this year, and we're ready to
take on anything. And if that means the national championship, here we come.  
BRIA SMITH: To add on to what Shoni said, this is literally every basketball
player's dream, to be in a national championship. So it feels unreal, but I
think we're ready for it.  
  
Q. Bria, in Oklahoma City I think you guys trailed a total of seven seconds,
and that was at the end of the Baylor game. How were you guys able to mentally
regroup after being down at 10 at half time?  
BRIA SMITH: Just the confidence that Coach has in us and him coming in at
halftime saying that we really couldn't have played any worse the first half;
we weren't playing the basketball that we're used to playing. So just to get
back into what we're used to doing.  
And he had a great play set up for the first play of the game for us‑‑ I mean
of the second half for us. And just building up momentum from scoring and
getting stops on defense really helped us.  
  
Q. Shoni, your defense really tightened up on them in the second half. You
can see they were having trouble with that little 1 ‑3‑1 trap. What did you do
differently to slow them down in the second half?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We just didn't let them get the ball where they wanted to be.
Our coaches knew exactly their scout, so they told us what to do and when to
do it. We didn't really follow the scout report the first half, but we
listened the second half because we didn't want to lose and we weren't going
to be down the rest of the game.  
So just listening to our coaches and executing our game plan is what really
got our defense going.  
  
Q. Shoni, the defense Cal played on you in the first half, can you talk
about that seemed pretty tough and were you getting frustrated?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It's frustrating to be able to have someone right there in
your face the whole time, but we came together as a team and we gathered
ourselves and we did what we needed to do, and that was to go out there and
win. And we did it as a team, and I couldn't be any more happier.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Coach, you flipped the switch for the second half. Schematically what did
do you different when you came out of the locker room?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we really didn't try and change a whole bunch. We did come
out and play some man. But what happened was we finally started to get a
little more patient at the offensive end. We came out, we executed our first
play perfect. Shoni gets a three. We come down the floor, we run our second
set, the second play. Bria Smith‑‑ I believe Bria hits a jump shot.  
We really‑‑ it was probably one of the poorest defensive efforts we've had in
terms of following the scout and being mentally prepared. When we came out in
second half we were in man and I wanted to a double on ball screen, and we
never doubled in our ball screen one time the entire night. And that's the
part that I kept telling them, you know, give me chance to coach. Double the
ball screen so I can at least see what's going to happen and then we can make
an adjustment.  
But I think what happened was we finally started to rebound the ball a little
bit better. Because they were just abusing us on second‑chance points in the
first half. I believe they had 10, and then in the second half they end up
with 4. So we did a better job of staying between them and the ball, but we
scored. We found a way to score. And I told our kids before the game started.
I mean, our goal was to try and score 60 tonight and we end up with 64.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how good this town has been to the University
of Louisville in the last three months.  
COACH WALZ: It's been pretty good. I'll go back‑‑ last year, I know our men
didn't win in the Final Four down here, but just to get down here to play in
the Final Four. You've got your men's program playing in the Final Four, New
Orleans football team wins the Sugar Bowl here, and now we're going to have a
chance Tuesday night to play for a national championship. Been pretty good.
I'll come back and visit.  
  
Q. Coach, you brought Hammond back in with about 8:39 left in the second
half with four fouls. Just since she was a huge factor down the stretch, just
talk about that decision ‑making process there.   
COACH WALZ: Well, it got to a point where‑‑ she's one of our better post
players, and if you're going to win, you've got to have your best players on
the floor. And that's something that I truly believe in. And I said, hey, if
she's going to foul out, she's going to foul out, but I'm not going to keep
her over here for last four minutes of the game.  
My thought was if we can get this last 8 from her, we're going to. And I
thought she did a great job. I mean, she made a few big‑time moves. She caught
and finished for us. She goes 3 of 3 from the free throw line, and I believe
two of them were and‑ones. So just really, really pleased with how Sara
responded.  
  
Q. Coach, were you concerned at all the way they were defending Shoni, and
did you do anything at half time to try and figure out how to spring her?  
COACH WALZ: No. What I told them was we've got to stop dribbling the ball. I
mean, that's all we did was dribble dribble, dribble. I thought they were all
trying to check the air. I'm like, guys, the officials did that before the
game. You're okay.  
And it's all they did. We occupied the ball. It was one person after another.
It wasn't anybody trying to be selfish, but they just kept pounding it into
the ground, and I finally said we don't have a chance to win if you keep
dribbling the thing. You've got to pass. You've got to get it up the floor to
pass. You've got to rip it through in a triple‑threat position and play off
the pass instead of off the dribble the entire night.  
And we finally did a much better job of that in the second half. Antonita
Slaughter‑‑ we ended up with 12 assists on the night, and I think we had three
or four at half. And I think that shows how much of a better job we did.  
  
Q. Jeff, taking the cue from Shoni, if you win Tuesday, what will your
tattoo say?  
COACH WALZ: I'm just going to take a pen and stick it on my rear end and call
it a tattoo. She don't have to know any better. You know, like they‑‑ see,
they're youngsters. You can sit there and tell them you're going to get a
tattoo, and that's great. To me a little dot is a tattoo. So that's what I'm
planning on doing. Please don't tell them. (Laughter). Okay. Because she's
expecting something big.  
We're just thrilled to be here. It's like I said in my opening statement, I
thought when the year started, when we came into June, July, I really‑‑ I was
excited about this ball club. I was excited about our depth. I was excited
about our returners, our freshman. I thought we're going to have a chance to
be really good. And then all of a sudden it's one kid after another after
another. And you just have to roll with it.  
The biggest problem in college athletics in my opinion is everybody lives in
the moment. I mean, we lose to UK in December, you think the world's going to
come to an end. It's just awful. And I'm like, hey, it's one game. That's the
way I approach them all: It's one game.  
Now, once you get in the NCAA tournament, it's not one game because when you
lose you're done. But back in December, it is what it is. They had an
unbelievable year, UK did. I think they would be willing to say, hey, we'll
trade. You can win that game and we'll come here and play for a national
championship on Tuesday.  
Everybody gets caught up in the moment during the regular season. And we went
through some growing pains. We went through some adjustments. We went to try
and figure out who can be where, who can play what, and we finally got things
going. This is my sixth year here, and I'd say five of those six except for
the year we were 14 and 18, which we were decimated with injuries that year
too, we're playing our best basketball at the end of the year. And that's all
that matters.  
I keep telling people we're not in the NBA. We don't have to play the best
four out of seven. It's the one game, one night. And we're figuring out a way
to pull them out and win and play well at the right time.  
  
Q. Coach, not to slight your players' ability or anything, but is, to a
certain extent, attitude, bravado, confidence carrying your team through?
You've knocked off some very talented big ‑name teams. Is that what you're
going to need a little bit Tuesday night? Are you playing a little bit above
yourself right now?  
COACH WALZ: You know what? I wouldn't necessarily say we're playing above
ourselves. We're playing as a team. The great thing about us, you look at our
roster‑‑ I mean our scoring tonight, Sara Hammond gets 9, Antonita gets 18,
Bria gets 17, Shoni gets 10 and Jude gets 9. We're sitting there with five
kids in double figures for the most part.  
You've gotta guard everybody on our team. That's where our lack of depth comes
in. But we've figured out a way to get to the last game of the year without
it. So I don't thinkeither of these teams we play on Tuesday are going to care
that we don't have a bunch of depth to put in.  
But if we can get the ones we have healthy to play their best basketball on
Tuesday night, then we're going to have a chance to win a national
championship.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously no matter who comes through tonight, it's gonna be all
Big East, you know, finals. What's that say about this conference? And also,
then, how do you guys overcome maybe the season? How do you reconcile what
happened during the regular season with these two teams and get your team to
overcome?  
COACH WALZ: I don't even remember playing them. I mean, it's one game now. We
aren't concerned about that. We figured out a way to beat some really good
basketball teams. But we do have‑‑ one of these two are going to win here
tonight, and they're special. They're very talented, well‑coached basketball
teams with some great players on both sides.  
We're going to enjoy this tonight. We're going to enjoy it. We're going to go
on Bourbon Street. I'll tell the kids as long as their back by two, we're
okay. (Laughter). I mean, everybody is saying you gotta get the kids to bed.
No, we don't either. We're going to enjoy it. We're getting a chance to play
for a national championship, so when we get to halftime, we're gonna head out
of here, we're gonna let them go back to the hotel, go out with their
families, get something to eat. And it might not be 2. It might be 1:30. But
I'll have curfew for them and then we'll get prepared starting tomorrow.  
  
Q. I just got here so I'm probably going to ask yousomething you've already
been asked. Talk about Cal, what they did well in the first half and what you
guys had to do in the second half to do what you did.  
COACH WALZ: I think Cal's fantastic. I'm so impressed with what Lindsay has
done with her team, how hard they play.  
We allowed them too many offensive rebounds in the first half. We allowed them
too many points in transition. And then we just dribbled the ball, dribbled
the ball, dribbled the ball. I mean, it wasn't very pretty.  
In the second half, we talked about sharing the basketball with the pass
instead of the dribble the entire time. We tried to mix it up a little more on
defense. We played a little man, we played a little zone. We played a little
zone starting off, switched into man.  
But the bottom line is we finally did a better job of keeping them off the
glass. And when they did get an offensive rebound, they were long offensive
rebounds. They weren't able to just go back up and score.  
I've seen some post players that rebound the basketball, but Caldwell and
Brandon are phenomenal offensive rebounders. They're hard to keep off the
glass. But we figured out a way to do that, and that's why we were able to
finally get something going at the offensive end.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.  
  
Q. Your men obviously are burning it up in Atlanta, and I know that you said
after the Baylor game that your team had been watching the men play in the
locker room. How much is your team feeding off the success that the men had?
And are the men following you and giving any support and love back to the
women?  
COACH WALZ: I mean, the way I look at it, I think the men are trying to feed
off of our success. They've just had a so‑so year this year and they just
happen to be playing well at the end. No. I mean, we're huge supporters of
each other.  
Our athletic director came to me and said, hey, the men's team was in the
hotel lobby jumping up and down and cheering for us. I've gotten a text from
Rick already congratulating us and telling me to tell the players what an
unbelievable job they did. And it's special. I'm very fortunate, very
fortunate to have a men's coach, as high profile as he is, to really genuinely
care about the women's program. It speaks volumes for him, speaks volumes for
his program.  
And the players are the same way. The players have been already texting my
players. And that's what it's about. That's what our entire athletic
department is about. We also support each other. I've gotten the softball
coach, baseball coach, swimming coach, track, everybody has sent a
congratulations text. They're so happy for us.  
And that's what we do. That's why our athletic department is as strong as it
is. So we will be cheering on the men tomorrow night loud.  
MODERATOR: Thank you coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 7, 2013

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  83  
Notre Dame  65

  
MODERATOR: Joining us on stage from Notre Dame are head coach Muffet McGraw
and student‑athletes Skylar Diggins and Kayla McBride.  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm just so proud of this team and what we accomplished this
year and hate for it to end on a game like this when we just‑‑ just played so
poorly.  
I thought Breanna Stewart was fantastic. She was just unbelievable. I think
her and Lewis, obviously, just they killed us. And we contained everybody
else, but we did not have an answer for them.  
And defensively it's probably the most disappointing. I know we can miss
shots, but I felt we could play better defensively. And that was a
disappointing way for this really wonderful season to end.  
But we will try to think back on what we did to get here and be proud of that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. This question is directed to Skylar. You were not able to get a shooting
rhythm, for whatever reason. Was your concentration then leaning more to
getting your teammates involved and also playing defense, particularly the two
blocked shots, you know, the defensive standard there? So those are the two
questions to Skylar.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yes, it was. My focus was on defense and trying to distribute.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you just talk a little bit about your legacy and just the
entire Notre Dame experience.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, it's been a dream come true, just having an opportunity
to play for my hometown school and right in my backyard for Coach McGraw and
just being able to learn from her every day. Just experiences I've gone
through I'll never forget. The people that I met I'll never forget. And it was
just such and great time. I had a great time going through it. And I wouldn't
want a different group of girls in the locker room, I wouldn't want a
different group of coaches.  
And just the people I've met, I know they will be a part of my circle for
life. And that's just a blessing in itself.  
  
Q. Kayla, the full first ten minutes of the game you guys were 2 for 24 as a
team. Was it the pressure of their defense or were you just missing makeable
shots?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Give her a second. I'll take a question. Yeah, can you repeat
it? I thought we were‑‑  
  
Q. You got off to ‑‑ I think it was 2 for the first 24. Was it the pressure
of their defense or were you missing makeable shots?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I thought it was a little bit of both. They did a great job of
getting up and pressuring us, and I thought that we got some shots we wanted
at the beginning of the game, some layups and some jumpers that we usually
knock down.  
It was a physical game tonight. I thought it was a little bit of both. You
have to credit their defense and the pressure, making us take quick shots. But
I thought we did get some shots that we wanted and usually knock down.  
  
Q. Skylar, I think you guys had a 26, 25 lead, Lewis went out about 2:55
left, and then they went on a 14 ‑to‑3 run to close the first half. What
happened there?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We just didn't play good defense. And they got out in
transition and they scored in half‑court offense too. We didn't lock down on
defense like we normally do. We just weren't playing like ourselves.  
And, like I said, you have to credit them. They're such a good team, they know
each other so well, and they outworked us.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you share with us a little bit about what Geno said to you
after the game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: He just said don't let this game define my legacy. He told me
that he feels like I've done more for the sport than some people who won four
national championships. And he just told me that I've done a lot for the game
of basketball and I had a great career.  
MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I just want to say thank you to all the fans and the city of
South Bend for the support. Thank you, thank you.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, that first 15 minutes you guys couldn't hit anything, yet still a
one ‑point game. I gotta think you were thinking, okay, we're going to hit
shots, eventually things are going to fall, we survived their defensive stop.
What was the difference that got them going that you guys just couldn't really
get anything going offensively all night?  
COACH MCGRAW: I didn't feel good about it because we weren't executing
anything. We weren't running our stuff. So we couldn't even feel good about
that. We couldn't feel good about, oh, we got a great shot, we just didn't
make it.  
I thought we forced some things and overdribbled a little bit. We're a really
good passing team, and I don't think we moved the ball. We missed some people
that were open.  
And so I don't think we got that confidence from executing.  
  
Q. How does Skylar's legacy, her impact, affect next year's team, teams
after that?  
COACH MCGRAW: She leaves a gigantic hole in the lineup. I don't think any one
person can replace her. I think that there's a lot of pressure on our incoming
point guard to be good right away.  
And I think the rest of the team has to step up a little bit more and realize
what we've lost. I think that the swagger and the confidence that she
brought‑‑ I hope that somebody can step up and replace that.  
  
Q. Muffet, obviously the game is disappointing, but I know how close you are
with Skylar. I wonder if it's just disappointing ‑‑ or how disappointing is it
to see her up here not to get to where I think she ultimately wanted to be?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think she's a champion. I do. I know we didn't win it, but
what she has done for us has been amazing and she's leaves Notre Dame as the
most celebrated and decorated and best player ever, and I'm happy for that.  
  
Q. Muffet, you've played so assuredly all through the season, but especially
in those games against UConn. Was it just maybe the importance of the moment
or nerves? Is there any way to explain how poorly you shot tonight? It wasn't
all defense, I don't think.  
COACH MCGRAW: No, I thought we looked nervous. I did think we looked nervous
coming out. And I think‑‑ I don't know why we did. We've been here before, and
we certainly should have felt differently. And I don't know. I think the way
the game went early on, I just don't think we ever got into that rhythm where
we could get comfortable, and so I think we were just a little on edge the
whole time. And then all of a sudden we're down 10. And we just got in a giant
hole at halftime, and the that really I thought was the difference in the
game.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on it a little bit in your opening, Breanna Stewart
was amazing tonight. How good was she considering she's a freshman under the
big spotlight? How impressive is that to you?  
COACH MCGRAW: It is really impressive to have a freshman have that kind of
game, to be Most Outstanding Player in the Regional and then to come into the
Final Four and just play with such confidence to be the best player on the
floor‑‑ well, on the team for Connecticut. You don't expect a freshman to rise
to the occasion like that. So I thought a phenomenal performance by her.  
  
Q. Muffet, did you say anything to Skylar, at least one ‑on‑one after the
game? Or there's obviously going to be time for that heading forward, but I
wonder if you, as Geno did, said something to her?  
COACH MCGRAW: No. We talked to the group in general and then came down here.  
MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you.

## April 7, 2013

  

### [Talia Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25337)

### [Layshia Clarendon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23447)

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

Louisville  64  
Cal - 57

  
MODERATOR: Joining us now from Cal, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb and
student‑athletes Layshia Clarendon and Talia Caldwell.  
We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Gottlieb, and then we'll take
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I credit Louisville, who obviously has been really hot and
they outplayed us in the second half and did enough of the things that they do
well to win the basketball game.  
What I said to our team in the locker room is that we can be disappointed
about a half a basketball that we wish we had back. We could be disappointed
to not be playing on Tuesday night because we really wanted to be playing on
Tuesday night.  
But I'm going to think about that for two minutes, and for the next 10,000
minutes I'm going to think about what this group did for the University of
California, I think forever the legacy they will have left from this year;
that when you come to Cal, you play for the person next to you, you play with
a lot of character, you work really hard, that you make the name on the front
of your chest the most important thing even if you're really, really talented.  
And I'm just so grateful that we got to play into the second to last possible
day you could be playing a game. And we had a pregame meal today and we got to
do walk‑through and all of the stuff just being together, and I'm really sad
that we're not doing that on Tuesday night, but that I wouldn't trade this
team for anything, even though we're disappointed about a half, and I think
our seniors set that tone, and I think the whole team did that this year. And
we're going to fight really hard for it‑‑ to keep it that way because of
Layshia and Talia and Eliza and Tierra and what whole group did this year.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. To Layshia, from your perspective, where was the game lost from what you
could gather?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think maybe midway through the second half. It's hard,
the game's so fast, but there was a stretch where they were really throwing a
lot of junk at us, and 19 turnovers is high for us. We just turned the ball
over. We were kind of getting lost and they were making a lot of baskets,
picking up momentum.  
So I think we just‑‑ the turnovers killed us a little bit and they kind of
took momentum. But like Lindsay was saying in the locker room, we were still
up 6 points; we still had a chance to win the game even though we were not
playing our best basketball.  
So just I think the turnovers and there was kind of a shift and they hit some
shots and got momentum.  
  
Q. Talia, what changed inside in the second half?  
TALIA CALDWELL: I think the junk defenses and we had to mix up things and‑‑ I
don't know. We just didn't get our hand on a lot offensive rebounds we
normally do, kind of bounced off, a little sloppiness inside. Yeah.  
  
Q. Layshia, could you walk us through the last two minutes, because you were
shooting upwards of 67 percent at points during the first half, and then
during those last two minutes it seemed liked you couldn't buy a basket. Did
things just go cold or was it something specifically they were doing on
defense? And from the perspective of a player on the floor, could you just run
us through those last couple minutes?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think, for one, we weren't getting stops on defense. So a
lot of the first half I think you guys saw us get out, we got to run a lot.
The second half they were scoring so much we had to ‑‑ our pace really slowed
down, we had to go against their press, kind of work in every single time, and
it seemed like we were shooting really low at the shot clock because it took
us so long to get down there.  
And the last two minutes, I think a little panicked. I think we just didn't
get the ball inside as much. And maybe credit to them, throwing the traps,
kind of getting us rattled, getting us back on our feet a little bit.  
Definitely their press and their defense we didn't get a chance to run at all
because we weren't getting stops.  
  
Q. Layshia, could you ‑‑ you gathered the team and spoke‑‑ it looked like
you were speaking to them at the end of the game when you were huddled
together. Can you just share with us your feelings and if you're able to, like
your coach, put what this teams has accomplished in perspective, or is it too
painful right now?   
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I can do it. I told them: Don't hang your head for one
second. Not for one second. Because we've just come to far, done too much.
That was my biggest thing.  
And like Lindsay said, two minutes, it's hard to let it go. It's going to hit
you maybe now, maybe later on the plane, maybe when you get back. It's going
to hurt definitely because we new there was mistakes. It wasn't like we just
played someone who's flat‑out better and just literally beat us. We made a lot
of mistakes ourselves. So that's where the hurt kind of comes in.  
But there's‑‑ just when you look at this team, you think about this team, I
just can't help but smile because what we've done is beyond amazing. Like she
said, we've affected so many people and just to see all the good that's come
out of it, all the positive, all the love, and, like she said, the legacy
we're going to leave.  
And I think it's another positive note that we weren't just some Cinderella
team who made a run this year. Like this is what Cal basketball is going to
be, like we set out to make this program known. And I think that's one thing
we've done, and we've done it from a point of love, loving each other, from
the point of having fun or from the point of dancing.  
So when you look back and see that's a legacy you left, yes, it hurts to lose,
but like that's pretty awesome. I don't think a lot of people get to do that.  
  
Q. Talia, can you talk about the last couple minutes? You guys these last
few games, South Florida, the Georgia game where you might not have been up or
you were in a bad spot and you guys kind of played through it and managed to
pull it out, were you feeling ‑‑ even when you look up at the scoreboard and
you're down by 3 with 30 seconds left, were you feeling like you guys were
going to pull this out?  
TALIA CALDWELL: Definitely. I had complete faith that one of those three were
going to go in every time, even when Mik shot the second one, I thought,
That's going in.  
The whole bench, we always believe in whoever is out on that court. So, yeah,
it never was like the game was over. We were like, okay, as long as there's a
second on the clock, even Brittany Boyd pushing it at the end, we're going to
keep fighting.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for head coach Lindsay Gottlieb.  
  
Q. Lindsay, could you go over the various hurts that Brittany had during the
game? Seemed like a back and then a hand. What was going on with her?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Her back tightened up at one point. She got some treatment on
it. And then she jammed her finger pretty badly. I don't know if it's broken
or not, but kind of got the finger caught on a play underneath the basket.  
  
Q. Lindsay, could you talk about the differences in the halves? Seems in the
first half in terms of rebounds, points in the paint, everything was going
your way. And your inside game obviously wasn't as effective in the second
half.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Sure. So when I said I'm only going to think about the game
for two minutes, that was kind of a lie (laughter).  
Maybe every single play, two minutes each I'll think about.  
It's interesting, like a stat sheet doesn't always tell the story of the game,
but I think this one does. We didn't score in the second half. They totally
affected our pace. We had a hard time‑‑ we shot like 60 percent in the first
half, and we had a hard time breaking them down and getting the looks we
wanted in the second half, and so then we didn't get inside touches.  
I thought we tried to go to the boards just as strong the second half. I don't
know if there was some kind of foul calls early on that that sort of changed
the tone of it. And I didn't know that we were doing anything differently, but
it felt a little different.  
And off of our inability to score they got some good open looks in transition.
They made some nice adjustments, moving Slaughter to the 4 at one point. And
then when they would score, we had a hard time attacking their presses cleanly
as we would have liked to.  
  
Q. Coach, you'd mentioned just a few seconds ago Slaughter. Do you care to
elaborate at all on just how she did? I think her stats kind of stand out
there.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Sure. Any time you shoot 60 percent from 3 and hit six of
them, it has a huge impact on the game.  
When I say the stat sheet kind of tells the story, they did what they do a
little bit better than we do what we do. All the kind of categories play out
the way you thought they might. We got 17 offensive rebounds and turned that
into 14 second‑chance points. We had 32 paint points to their 18.  
But we committed 19 turnovers and they scored 22 off of our turnovers, and
they made eight 3s, six by Slaughter.  
So the stat categories are all exactly how you thought they could be if you
were analyzing the game beforehand. They just did their thing in the second
half a little bit better than we did our thing in the first half. And we
couldn't‑‑ even then we could have made a play or two or gotten a stop or two
at the end and still won the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision to bring Mikayla to shoot those 3
‑pointers? Obviously she hadn't been in the game.   
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah. So with 30 seconds to go we were down 3, and we
definitely weren't saying we have to go for a 3. But we really wanted to run a
play that gave multiple options. I wanted to the ball in Layshia's hands, I
wanted Layshia to be either the creator, the decision‑maker, the shot maker,
one of those things.  
And we have a play that is kind of an end‑of‑game situation play that gives
multiple looks at 3s, but the only looks aren't 3s. And it kind of made that
decision to say, all right, we'll put one more 3‑point shooter out there
simply because we weren't getting low‑block touches. It's not like I could
have said, okay, let's go right to the block with Gray, Gen, or Talia. That
wasn't really‑‑ they weren't making that readily available. So we put the
extra 3‑point shooter out there to maybe extended the defense, and I thought
our best look still might be Layshia to the rim. But it kind of gave that
option.  
They did a really good job off the first on‑ball with Layshia to kind of step
it up and then came off of a flare and then it was going to go back to Layshia
on the other side, but two people went with Layshia, and Mikayla ended up with
wide‑open look. I mean, I'll take that look.  
  
Q. Lindsay, as soon as the half started, you guys had a couple turnovers and
they went back down and they hit a couple shots and all of a sudden you go
from 10 to 5. Was that a concern as you get things ‑‑ as things started?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely. I thought we had pretty good luck early on. Talia
got the ball, could have finished, maybe got fouled, wasn't called. I thought
we should have gone up 12 right then. Then they come right back down, hit a 3.
So all of a sudden it's 7 instead of 12 in my mind and I think we turned it
over again and they scored.  
Sure. It's set the tone. You always want to start out‑‑ well, that being said,
it was a concern, but I didn't feel like we couldn't counter‑punch. But it was
not a very good start to the second half.  
  
Q. Lindsay, mentioning the stat sheet, does that include your free ‑throw
performance? All season long you've been a mediocre free‑throw shooting team.
Is this an example where it really caught up with you do you think or not?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: The free throw thing that sticks out the most is that they
took 19 free throws and we took seven. And usually by the way that we play we
get to the free‑throw line a whole lot more. Now, it might even out because we
don't make as many as the opponent in terms of the point differential, but the
thing that jumps out to me the most is, yeah, 1‑for‑7 is a terrible
percentage, but more so that we go to the free‑throw line seven times and the
opponent goes 19. That's just what is uncharacteristic of us.  
  
Q. Lindsay, the fouls really seemed to pick up in the second half. Did that
affect how you would have liked to have used your personnel, especially when
people had three and four fouls?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Didn't affect the rhythm of the game. I thought we‑‑ letting
them score affected the rhythm, I thought our kind of inability to sort of
push the tempo the way that we did really affected the rhythm, and I thought
that there was a whistle like all the time affected the rhythm of the game.  
I didn't think there was necessarily one chunk of time where we were like, oh,
we have to sit a particular player for a long, long time. So in that sense.
But I definitely feel like it ended up being a factor in the second half, just
in terms of how it played out.  
MODERATOR: Great. Thank you, Coach.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thank you.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  83  
Notre Dame  65

  
MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut are head coach Geno Auriemma and
student‑athletes Breanna Stewart and Kelly Faris.  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Auriemma and then questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I'm glad it didn't come down to the last minute
(laughter). So I was praying for that because I didn't want to screw it up
again and I didn't want my guys to screw it up again. So we're thrilled about
that.  
I said this to Rebecca earlier: When you get to the Final Four, there's only
good teams and great teams left. And you're gonna have to beat them if you
want to win a national championship. I don't think anybody comes here and
loses games. You're going to have to beat them.  
And we knew that going in. And we knew that if we were going to win the game
tonight, we had to beat Notre Dame. We couldn't count at all on them losing
the game.  
And I really believe that for 40 minutes we competed and we played about as
hard as we're capable of playing. And I couldn't be happier for them. I
couldn't be more proud of them. We've come a long way. And this is really,
really, really rewarding.  
And again, you know, the Notre Dame team that we beat is a great, great, great
team. You don't beat us seven out of eight times without being a great team.
So my hat's off to them and the kind of year that they've had, but tonight was
our night.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Breanna, could you talk about your game and about your shoulder a little
bit and how you've just sort of come on here at the end of the season and the
reasons for that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: What do you want, me to answer it for you?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yeah.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Come on. Get this over with.  
BREANNA STEWART: About my game, I don't know, I think that this postseason
I've really gained a lot more confidence. And today was a game that I was
really looking forward to playing. I think all of us were.  
And about my shoulder, it's fine.  
  
Q. Kelly, talk about the journey that this team has undergone from the end
of the Big East Tournament to get to this point and getting this win
tonight.  
KELLY FARIS: We've had some ups and downs starting from the beginning. I think
we've mentioned it before, there's been‑‑ we can almost count on one hand what
it felt like, how many practices that we've had everybody there type of thing.
But when you get to this point in the season, you know that everybody's had
their ups and downs as well and some worse than others.  
So, for us, we just had to turn it around after the Big East championship, and
I think we did that from the younger guys all the way up. And I told them in
the locker room they have no idea how proud I am of every single one of them,
and I mean that from the bottom of my heart, because to see this team just
totally transform, especially the young guys, that's not easy to do.  
And the fact that she comes in and plays her heart off and has 29 points, you
don't see very many freshmen that do that.  
And I think that the big difference for us is just our mentality and we were
able to get contributions from everybody, and that really helps us out.  
  
Q. Kelly, I was wondering if you could ‑‑ you waxed pretty well in
Bridgeport about Breanna's emergence. It's getting frightening now. Can you
just a little talk about what you saw tonight?  
KELLY FARIS: I think this is what we knew was in her. This is what we saw from
the beginning of the year. And then everybody goes through their little lapses
of issues, whatever they may be. And this is what we wanted her to get back
to. This is how she plays basketball. It's how she's always played basketball.
So you guys are just kind of starting to get a glimpse of what we knew that
she had.  
  
Q. Breanna, did you just wake up one morning before the Big East Tournament
and say, all right, now it's time for me to play the way I know I can play?
How ‑‑ if somebody asked you from outside how to explain your play in the last
three weeks, what would you tell them?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I'm not sure if I just woke up and started feeling
better, but I think that getting in the gym with C.D. and stuff like that
really helped just gain my confidence in practice and then put it over into
the game.  
And I think Coach had a little bit to do with it.  
But, wait, what was the second half part of the question? (Laughter). I get
distracted.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Sorry. Just wanted to make sure you got your facts straight.  
  
Q. Kelly, did you think that you guys had it in you to make this kind of
change?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah. For sure. We all knew it. It was just a matter of actually
focusing and turning it around and stop talking about it and actually put it
into action.  
Like I said, we saw glimpses of what we could do at the beginning of the
season. And in preseason. We felt great during preseason.  
So we knew we could do it. And, like I said, it just‑‑ unfortunately it took a
little while for us to buckle down and actually, like I said, put it into
action, but I'm glad we're coming together right now.  
  
Q. Kelly, we talked in Bridgeport about the defense and how good it was
against Kentucky. Tonight you guys held Skylar and Kayla to 8 ‑for‑35 shooting
and for one stretch held them without a point for about seven minutes. Just
talk about the defensive effort tonight. They scored 65, but it was not an
easy 65 to get.   
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, obviously that's something that this program prides itself
on. We take a lot of our momentum from our defense. And going into this game,
that was something that was going to have to be different. Our pressure had to
be that much higher than we've ever played it against anybody. And we knew by
doing that we were going to have to get into our bench and have to count on
them to give us some good minutes as well.  
So I think we came in with a good game plan set up by our coaches, and I felt
like we executed it. And a lot of it was revolved around defensive pressure.  
  
Q. Kelly, is your happiness now ‑‑ does your happiness now surpass the
disappointment that was in your face after the first losses to Notre Dame this
season?  
KELLY FARIS: Obviously those are still going to be in the back of my mind.
When my career is over and I think back to the different games, and the ones
that stand out are usually the ones you lose. Especially at this program,
because there's not expected to be very many of them, so‑‑ but, honestly, at
this point I'm not really worried about all that.  
Where we're right now, this is where it counts. And we've gotten to this
point, so there's no reason to sit here and think about all the past games. Or
even going in to play against Louisville. We can't sit there and think about
when we played them earlier in the season. They're a completely different
team, and we have to be as well.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you all to talk a little bit about the spreadsheet. You
knew Notre Dame would come at you, and they did, they cut it to 6 there. And
you all came up with the answer. You had a couple plays on defense, couple
offensive rebounds. Talk about that a little bit if you could, both of you,
because you both contributed to it.  
KELLY FARIS: I think Coach mentioned it to us in the locker room. Obviously
they went on their‑‑ like you said, they went on their stretch and they picked
up the pressure. And we had a few too many turnovers, but we were able to
count on different players at different times to make the play when we needed
it. If we needed a steal, we got a steal. If we needed a bucket, somebody
knocked one in. And those buckets and hustle plays, they all came in at very
crucial times. So that was huge for us to sustain our lead.  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that obviously Notre Dame is a really good team, and
we know that they're going to make runs like that. And I think it's just how
we answer it and make our own run. Because we went on a run after they cut it
to 6, right? Yeah.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
BREANNA STEWART: I don't remember.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. When you lost to them up at Storrs, we were talking after the game and
you were concerned about how long it was going to take Stewart to adjust to
the physicality of the game. Has she gotten stronger in the last couple of
months, or how has she done that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She's gotten stronger mentally. I think she's gotten stronger
emotionally. Stewy really takes things to heart and she puts a lot of pressure
on herself. And when she wasn't playing well, it got into her pretty severely
and she let it affect her. She wasn't strong enough mentally and strong enough
emotionally to just kind of put it aside.  
And after the Big East championship game‑‑ or I should say after the end of
the regular season, there was a renewed almost kind of I'm not going to settle
for this anymore. I'm not going to allow myself to feel like this anymore.  
And that's kind of rare for an 18‑year‑old to be able to do that. And I do
think that getting in the gym and being able to clear your mind and just go
back to what you love doing, just playing basketball, and then once she
started playing well, it just snowballed. And right now she just has a
tremendous amount of confidence in herself, as she should.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen a lot of really good performances from Huskies in the
past. I mean, she put up 29 tonight, key blocks, in one of the biggest games
that potentially you could play. Where does this one rank in your memory of
big games by UConn players?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Given the stage and what was at stake, I don't know‑‑ I don't
know that I've seen any bigger, way bigger. I know there's been NCAA
Tournament games where we've had certain individuals play great, great, great
games. But I don't remember a player having a better game in this environment,
and certainly I've never seen a freshman have a game like this in this
environment.  
I remember Kara Wolters' semifinal game against Stanford in 1995 where she had
31. That was pretty amazing. She was a sophomore then and it was incredible.  
And Stewy made a lot of free throws after she got banged around with her
shoulder. She's just one of these unique kids that doesn't take herself too
seriously, doesn't demand a lot of attention. And I hope she's got another one
left in her Tuesday night.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked a little bit after the Kentucky game about the job Bria
did defensively on O'Neill, and today I noticed you had her on Kayla McBride a
little bit, and McBride has killed you guys for the last two years I'd say
maybe. Can you talk about ‑‑ I mean, is she a better defensive player than
maybe we've seen in the past, Bria? And her performance tonight, just talk
about that, defensively?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, I think the last two games have been two of her best
efforts. But I think I might have said this after the Kentucky game. We've
kind of narrowed her scope so she doesn't have to think a lot out there and be
involved in a lot of different rotations on defense and just give her one job
to do. And she's been able to lock into it and has played great both games in
Bridgeport, and I thought she was great in the second half, especially today.
She played the whole 20 minutes, and I know she was tired. Hopefully we can
get her some rest.  
But she's a winner. I've always said that. One of the things that worried me
about our team for the longest stretches‑‑ and, by the way, those of you that
don't know us, it's not like we lost ten games in a row this year and we snuck
into the NCAA Tournament. We are 30‑something and 4. So there's been times
this year where we've been pretty good and we've beaten a lot of really good
teams during the season by a lot, so‑‑ just so that we're not the Cinderella
team that everybody thinks we are, the Beauty and the Beast here.  
But I‑‑ one of the concerns that I had about our team was‑‑ I don't know that
we have anybody with the attitude that you need sometimes to win a national
championship. Even Stewy. She gets 29, but it wasn't like an in‑your‑face 29.
It was like it's 29.  
Bria is the only one that we have that really has that kind of cocky attitude
that, you know, in the biggest games I'm the best player. She might not play
the best, but she actually feels that way. And she's the only one on our team
that is like that.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what the standards you have at your program about
being back in the title game? And then also maybe an early comment on
Louisville and what Jeff ‑‑ the run they've been on here?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Our program right now, we're the beneficiary of a lot of
things that have happened over the last 20‑some years. And the players that we
get and the expectation level is such that this is where we're supposed to be.
So the way the program is structured and the kind of players that we get, they
are never surprised that we're where we are. There may be bumps along the
road, but they know exactly what the destination is all the time.  
And Tuesday night‑‑ I don't know, Tuesday night‑‑ we gotta problem Tuesday
night I think because I think Louisville‑‑ Louisville really thinks they're
the best team in the country right now. After the way they've played and what
they've done, and these last couple weeks, they probably think there's nobody
that can beat them. They probably think it will be a huge upset if we win that
game Tuesday night.  
And Jeff's a big part of that. People have issues with me. He's the cockiest
guy I ever met, man. (Laughter). He's the cockiest guy I ever met. He wears an
Italian tablecloth for a shirt today (laughter). I was going to hire him for
my restaurant.  
But, you know, I've gotten to know him really well, and I think we were‑‑ we
were at a certain level relationship‑wise when he first got the job at
Louisville. And I would say probably over the last two or three years I don't
think there's anybody that I respect more for their coaching ability than
Jeff. In our league. I don't know that anybody does a better job day in and
day out of getting their team ready to play than Jeff does.  
  
Q. Italian tablecloth. Good line. I'm sure you answered a question on Skylar
earlier, but I just got here. But I did want to ask you: She's been a unique
opponent for you. You've certainly had a lot of players on opposing teams who
have impacted you, but maybe there's not a opponent who's impacted you more
than Skylar Diggins, and I wonder if you can reflect on her career against you
versus even some of the other players that had an impact against
Connecticut.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know the ironic thing about it is that if you check
Skylar's shooting percentage and all that stuff against us, it's not that
great, including tonight. But what makes her who she is is that invariably
whenever there's a time where she has to get a 3, she gets one. Whenever she
needs to get in the lane and get an assist, she gets one. Whenever she has to
get a steal, she might not have any steals, but then she'll get the two that
decide the game. She just has that uncanny ability to capture the moment.  
And one of the reasons why she's been so successful is she does have that
mindset, like I was saying, that I was worried that nobody on our team had.
And if they weren't in our league, she would just be another player that beat
Connecticut. But because they're in our league and we played them so many
times the last couple of years and they've had so much success that‑‑ yeah, I
would say there hasn't been an opponent that we played against that's had more
success against us than she's had. For sure. For sure.  
  
Q. Geno, how much did how your players felt about the previous three games
leading into this one this year play into what happened tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, nobody wanted to believe me because you lost. But
there's losing and there's getting beat. And I've always said that to my team.
There's a huge difference between losing a game and getting beat.  
And I felt like all three games this year we lost. We didn't get beat. But you
can't say that because we lost the game. So if you lose the game, you got
beat. But when we looked at the three games getting ready for this game, we
all thought they've yet to beat us. I know it's a loss in the loss column, but
we lost all three of those games because in the last minute or whatever, we
didn't execute the things that we're good at.  
And that's why I think tonight we won the game. I don't think Notre Dame lost
the game tonight. And if I thought that they had beat us soundly those three
games, then I would have been coming into this game thinking, man, you know, I
don't know if we can do this.  
But when you look at it‑‑ you know, I was saying this the other day. At some
point the percentages are going to work in your favor. The best 3‑point
shooter in the country gets two wide‑open shots at our place and misses them
both. They've got a kid, Kayla McBride, who's like the 35th best 3‑point
shooter in our league and makes a 3 to tie the game in overtime.  
You know at some point those percentages are going to revert back to the other
way. And we missed free throws at their place that would have iced the game,
both Stewy and Kelly. And you knew at some point it was gonna‑‑ and today it
did. Stewy and Kelly made their free throws.  
So I think it made our players feel really, really confident going into
tonight's game as opposed to I don't think we can beat these guys. That's a
long answer to a short question.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Wait. Didn't you have a question? Go ahead.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you ‑‑ thank you, Coach.   
COACH AURIEMMA: You're welcome.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you whether, in describing the difference between
those games that you lost earlier in the season and this one that you won
quite soundly tonight, you would ascribe it to a different or better game
plan, and if so, would you tell us what that was, or whether it was a matter
of executing the same game plan better.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, Shea Ralph has had the scout for every single one of
these games, so she knows Notre Dame better than she knows the UConn players.
And we felt like there were things in all three of those games that we did
really, really well, that we needed to do it more often tonight. There were
things that we did lousy against them those three games that we had to try to
eliminate those things.  
So the game plan was more about not inventing anything new, not coming up with
a game plan that they didn't know we were going to spring on them. It was just
this is what we did that worked, and we gotta do it more often at both ends of
the floor, and this is what we did that they killed us on, and we gotta
eliminate those as many times as possible.  
So I think we just took the information that we had from those three games.
And then today, the players, as is the case, you know, they made it happen. We
can put any game plan we want on the floor, but those kids made it happen
tonight.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Louisville. Joining us on the dais is head
coach Jeff Walz, Sara Hammond, Bria Smith, and Shoni Schimmel. We're going to
open with a brief statement from Coach Walz, and then we'll take questions for
student‑athletes.  
COACH WALZ: Just really excited to be here and to be representing the Big
East. We're very fortunate to have three teams competing in the Final Four and
then two more up the road in Atlanta. I think it speaks volumes of not just
the women's but the men's basketball also that you've got five of your eight
teams that are still remaining from the Big East.  
So we're excited. We're looking forward to it. And we're going to enjoy it.
Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes first, please.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you possibly describe for us what the last seven days have
been like for you personally and for your program?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It's been huge for our program just to be able to make it to
the Final Four, and even our men's team down in Atlanta, it's a great thing
for the University of Louisville.  
But I could never describe how it feels to be here in the past seven days.
Like it's just ‑‑ it's amazing. And all that hard work we did in the beginning
of the season is now paying off for us, and to be here at the Final Four, it's
amazing.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right there.  
  
Q. Sara, could you talk about rebounding going against a Cal team that's one
of the best in the country? How are you going into the game and what's your
approach going to be for a team like that?  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, the coaches told us if we're going to win this game
tomorrow, rebounding is going to be key, because I think the last game against
Georgia they had 27 offensively rebounds. They're a very athletic team, their
post players get in there and they're relentless on the boards, and their
guards are too.  
We'll have to have that same mentality that we've played against everybody,
against Baylor and Tennessee, because we're going to be the tougher team and
we'll be the team that's more relentless. And we've got to fight. We can't
give up on any loose balls, any rebounds, and we just gotta make sure that
we're putting a forearm in their post players and making sure they don't get a
hand on the ball.  
  
Q. Bria, would you talk about transition defense, Brittany Boyd likes to
push the ball for Cal, and what you have to do there?  
BRIA SMITH: That's also a key we were talking about, just being able to stop
them in transition is going to limit their points, because they do like to
push the ball a lot. And if we can get rebounds and limit them in transition,
it will work in our favor.  
  
Q. Two questions. First, the relationship with the men's program, both
obviously in the Final Four right now? And, secondly, the last two games,
except for your locker room, you guys say no one believed you could beat
Baylor and Tennessee. It's a different feeling here now that you guys have
arrived. There's not that "us against the world" mentality, I would think?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yes, our relationship with the guys is great. We used to play
pickup with each other last summer, but we're still close and whatnot. And
Rick Pitino comes in and he was talking to us at the end of the Big East
Tournament, talked to us and gave us a little motivational speech. And it was
great to hear it from him. And I think that's what got us rolling in this
tournament.  
But what was your second question? I couldn't hear you.  
  
Q. The two games against Baylor and Tennessee, you guys said basically no
one outside the locker room believed you could beat them. Now it's a different
mentality. You guys aren't the overwhelming underdog anymore.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I would say we're still kind of the underdog, being the 5 seed
in the Final Four. Just kind of like we're going to keep that mentality and
continue to go out there and shock everybody. I mean, we're not supposed to be
here. But we're here to play basketball.  
  
Q. Shoni, the basket you made against Griner we've seen 9,000 times on TV
since it happened, was that instinctive or had you been practicing that?
You're coming down the floor, you're looking at her standing there, what's
going through your mind?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: To be honest with you, I saw her on the right side, and so I
took a right and then I went back to the left because I didn't think she'd be
able to get over there that quick. But she made it because of her length. So,
I mean, I just had to do the little circus shot because I just mess around in
practice sometimes doing it and it worked out for me. So‑‑ in my favor.  
  
Q. For any of the student ‑athletes, how were you able to believe that this
was possible when you look at all the injuries you folks had during the year?
Three potential starters. You lose one in December. A couple out for the year.
At what point did you think that this was a realistic possibility for you?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, it was hard for us to do it. But Coach talked to us
about it, they're hurt and they can't come back as of now, except for Monique.
She came back, made her comeback.  
So it was just adversity we had to work through. And at that moment in time
they couldn't come back, so we had to understand that the people on the court,
the people who were healthy, that's what we're going to work with, and that's
what we did. And it's gotten us this far. And I can't wait for those other
three to get back. But I'm glad Mo made it back for her fifth year, and it's
been great for us.  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, I think anytime you hit adversity, that's when your true
colors come out and shows how much heart and toughness you have as an
individual and as a team. And we knew we couldn't do anything about it. We
didn't have time to sit around and sulk and be kind of like, oh, well, we wish
we had them. We made no excuses for ourselves and we didn't think about it
really.  
The coaches did a good job of saying they're hurt, we wish we had them. But
Coach just focused in on the people he can use on the court. And we came
together as a collective group and knew with the 10, 11 people we had we were
going to use what we had and everybody was going to use the best of their
ability, because each one of us can bring something to this team that's going
to help us win.  
And I think throughout this tournament everybody's just blossomed. And you've
seen what's happened and how we've beat these teams.  
  
Q. Sara, what about your defense has made it so effective in Oklahoma City?
Held Griner without a field goal in the first half and Simmons I think went
scoreless in the first half. Is it completely different game plans as far as
what Coach puts together? What has made it so effective?  
SARA HAMMOND: I think it's different game plans, depending on the team. We
don't play the same style of basketball every game. It just depends on the
team. And the coaches put together a perfect game plan for Baylor and for
Tennessee.  
So, I mean, we have the best coaching staff in the country. I'd put them up
against any other coaches in the country and I'd still choose ours every
single day.  
I think the great thing about Coach is he got us to believe in that game plan.
Brittney Griner, she's 6'8" of course. Everybody's trying to figure out how to
stop her and her team this year. We're physical with her and we were going to
force other players to step up on their team and make them feel the pressure
and feel that they had to make the shots. And it worked for us.  
And Tennessee, I think the same thing. Meighan Simmons is a great player.
She's co‑SEC Player of the Year. And I think we were just going to try to keep
the ball out of her hands, get her frustrated and, you know, came out with a
win. And it's all thanks to our coaches.  
  
Q. Shoni, Bria, when Coach Walz explained the game plan to you for the
Baylor game and laid it out for you how you were going to beat Baylor, what
was the most ‑‑ the thing that was toughest to believe could happen that you
could shut Griner down or that you needed to make 16 or 18 3‑pointers to win
that game? Because both of them seemed to be a little difficult to achieve.   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, actually, we‑‑ the first play that we rolled up, our
jump ball, was that we were going to have four people back on defense. But I
was going to be standing at the other free‑throw line just waiting for someone
to toss the ball to me for a layup. We didn't get that because we boxed out
for the jump ball.  
But we just believe in everything that our coaching staff says. And the game
plan‑‑ I guess the hardest thing to believe that we were going to be able to
keep Griner off the boards from scoring and everything, but we were able to do
it. And we came out with a victory.  
  
Q. To all three of the ladies, as much as you guys are being here in the
Final Four, you're the team that kept Baylor and Brittney Griner from being
here. How much do you relish that achievement and how much have you fed off
that to get you guys to the next couple of days, hopefully?  
SARA HAMMOND: We're just really excited to be here. Baylor, they're a
tremendous team. They won the national championship last year. And that's a
compliment to them, because everybody's been trying to get to their level and
trying to compete with them.  
But I'm just going to say it again, the game plan that our coaches put
together and us being able to believe in what they were wanting us to do, I
mean, it's just an honor and a blessing to be here right now. And we're just
going to enjoy this moment. We're going to remember it for the rest of our
lives. And hopefully our job's not done. We're looking to win a national
championship here.  
BRIA SMITH: Well, definitely to add on to what Sara said, they are a great
team. And we're really blessed to be here. We executed the game plan, and
that's how we're here right now.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Same thing.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you give an assessment of the Cal guards and how you think the
‑‑ the importance of that matchup in the overall context of the game?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: They're a great basketball team and their guards are what gets
them going, and I think they have a good set of guards and they'll be able to
give us a good run for our money. But they have a lot of pushing the ball and
they know how to get out and run and they rebound well for being guards, too.  
But I think we've just gotta give them a run for their money and continue to
keep playing Louisville basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Had a question right here. No? Yes.  
  
Q. I know it's sometimes difficult to talk about yourself, but could you for
a second give me a sense what you think especially during the postseason your
impact on this team? And I'm sure it's more than just the point, it's also the
attitude, inspiring the team, if you could talk about that?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, I think kind of just being like the older classmate out
there on the floor most of the time, being a junior. Like I just take that
leadership and continue to keep leading on the court and off the court and
just keep talking to them and just keeping them calm and being a normal
teammate, your friend, your sister, whatever you want to call it.  
I'm just out there to help this team win a basketball game, and I'm going to
do whatever it takes to talk to them and tell them stuff and talk to my
teammates and just be their friend and go out there and win a basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right over here.  
  
Q. Shoni, when you do so well in environments like this, your life tends to
change in a lot of different ways. I'm wondering how your life has changed. Do
you have a Twitter site that's blown up like Skylar Diggins or what?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: No, I don't have Twitter.  
  
Q. I don't know where I heard this, but your parents just got married? What
was going on with your family? You have eight siblings or something? Can you
tell us that story?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: My parents have been together for 28 years but they've never
had the time to actually tie the knot. So they had a ton of kids, eight kids,
and they just never really had the time to go out and do it because they're
out coaching us or teaching us how to play basketball and stuff. They never
had the time.  
But it was Easter Sunday and my dad's like, Anything can happen. So my mom was
like, All right, if you guys beat Baylor, I'll marry your dad. That ended up
happening and they ended up getting married the next day after‑‑ in between
our games, the Baylor and the Tennessee games. It was incredible to hear that
and to actually have that happen for them because it's 28 years and they
finally did it.  
  
Q. (Question Off microphone)?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: That wasn't in my mind. There's no doubt in my mind that we
were going to win. So it didn't really matter.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything for the student‑athletes? Okay. Thanks, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Coach, congrats on getting here, my friend.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.  
  
Q. Two questions. First off, the fact that you guys are here, you've been
here before a couple of years ago. Can you compare the two runs you had to get
to the Final Four with the team you had a couple of years ago and this one?
The second part is also teams get hot in basketball. They make shots and such.
Is it a detriment you guys have had seven days off after having that
unbelievable weekend in Oklahoma City?  
COACH WALZ: First part of that question about the two teams that we've had
that have made a Final Four in five years. You know, our first team you had
Angel McCoughtry on it, arguably one of the best players in the Big East and
in the country, her sophomore, junior, and senior year. And then we had
Candyce Bingham to go along with her, Des Byrd ran the point for us. We knew
we were good. We were preseason top seven, top eight. We were in the top five
three‑fourths of the year. That was a team, I think, people knew was going to
have a chance to compete to make a Final Four.  
Now, us with our upset of Maryland in the Elite Eight game, I'm not sure
everybody expected that. And then we go on to the Final Four and upset
Oklahoma. Those two ball games I think were very good games. I think people
that were around the game and understood it knew, hey, they had a chance to
win.  
Now, this team, I mean, I'm willing to bet not many thought we'd beat Baylor,
and after we did that, I'm not sure there were too many that thought we could
come back and beat Tennessee. So with the two teams, this one here I think
more so shocked everyone of what we've done.  
And I'm just as proud of this basketball team as I am our '09 team just for
the fact of all the injuries that we've been able to withstand and the players
have stepped up.  
What was question two?  
  
Q. (Question Off microphone)?  
COACH WALZ: Oh, yes, I'm not worried about that, because we actually started
to play better in our first game in the tournament against Middle. And that
carried over to our Purdue game. We had a week off until we went to the Sweet
16. And we've continued to play well. And we've continued to practice well. So
I'm expecting us to continue to play well tomorrow.  
But it is a bigger stage. When you go out there, there's a little more at
stake and a little more pressure.  
  
Q. When was the last time you spoke to Rick Pitino, and can you recount that
conversation?  
COACH WALZ: I texted him this morning actually. We were going back and forth
wishing him luck and he was wishing us luck and telling us to have fun and
stay loose. Coach has been great. He's been great to me. Ever since the first
day I arrived on campus, I went in and had the opportunity to meet him. And I
sat down with him for 10, 15 minutes. And since then, if I've got a basketball
question, I can pick up the phone and call him. I can call him on his cell,
text him, doesn't matter what time.  
And when this is over I'm sure we'll do the same thing we do each summer, get
out on the golf course a couple of times. It's kind of the way he supplements
his income. Because he sandbags, boy, I'm going to tell you.  
  
Q. Jeff, speaking of Coach Pitino, is he loaning you one of his suits for
tomorrow or are you going to have your open collar ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: No, no, I'm not going with ‑‑ no. I'm wearing the same thing I
always wear. I'm wearing my dress shirt and that's it. I'm trying to get it
approved to be like a baseball coach and just wear a uniform.  
  
Q. You made that switch about 21 games ago, I guess, to have Bria be the
primary ball handler, Shoni did, too. What precipitated that change and how
has that obviously worked out for you?  
COACH WALZ: I'm just trying to get the ball out of Shoni's hands some. Just
trying to take some pressure off her. Because she was having to bring the ball
up the floor against pressure. And most teams are playing full‑court man and
we're trying to set some screens for her, but she was still having to expend a
lot of energy bringing the ball up the floor and then was being caught on the
score also.  
So I called Bria in and I said, I'm going to put you at the point. She had
done some in high school. It's not her natural position. But she was fine with
it. And she has done a great job for us, does a really nice job of allowing
Shoni to play without the ball, which has improved her shooting percentage.
Since we made that move, Shoni's shooting percentage has gone up.  
And then what happens for us, too, when I put Jude in the game, I'm out there
playing with basically three point guards. Jude obviously goes to the point,
Shoni goes to the 2 and Bria moves to the 3, and what's allowed our transition
game to improve is whichever one of those three gets the outlet, we're going
with it. We're not having to go find the so‑called point guard and throw it to
them. They all know they've got the green light to push it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Cal? You had a couple of really high ‑profile wins;
they've grinded it out a little bit more to get here. What do you think about
Cal?  
COACH WALZ: They're very talented. Lindsay's done a great job with them. We've
had some, I guess you could say, high‑profile wins, but they are 32 and 3.
They haven't lost too many ball games. They're a very physical basketball
team. Their post play is as good as I've seen on film. I love how aggressive
they are going to the boards. Their guards push the ball in transition.  
We're going to have to do a few things. We're going to have to do a few things
well. We'll have to get back in transition, make sure they don't score easy
baskets, which I'm sure they're going to score some. It's just a matter you
can't give them 14, 16 points in transition.  
And we're going to have to figure out a way to keep them off the offensive
glass because they rebound the ball so well. And then they get to the
free‑throw line. I mean, I think they average‑‑ in their wins, they're
shooting about 24 free throws a game, and that's something if we allow that to
happen tomorrow night, it's not going to be a good result for us.  
  
Q. Do you think you're doing something novel or revolutionary when you put
that defensive plan together to stop Griner? Had you ever seen that attempted?
And, secondly, what is it with this jacket and tie? You just have trouble
accessorizing? Or why don't you wear them?  
COACH WALZ: The first one, everybody talks about our defensive effort that we
did against Baylor. We held them to 81 points. They average 81 points. So in
my book it's called average defense. So we just did not allow Brittany to get
40 or 50. So Odyssey Sims, instead of averaging 12, gets 29.  
My whole plan is when we go play somebody, I'm trying to take away your best
player. And then if somebody else can score 25, then I'm going to lose.  
As the game progressed, I kept telling our kids: I don't think they can make
enough 3s to beat us but I know Brittney can make plenty of 2 and 3 pointers,
so we're going to continue to give their outside shooters open shots, and if
they make them, we lose.  
But the whole key to it, instead of worrying about how we guarded Brittney,
how we did this, maybe everybody should start asking how do we score 82.
Because there's not been one team in the four years that Brittney Griner was
at Baylor that scored more than 82 points. We scored the most points in four
years during her career.  
And I think that's where it all comes from. And I told our players before we
went into the game: I don't care about how we're going to stop them, because
we're not. They're going to score. We have to figure out a way to score it.
And I thought 70 would be enough. Obviously I was wrong. But I was like: We've
got to figure out a way to score, and that's what we were doing.  
And what Bria said‑‑ our plan for the tip is I figured they'd get the tip, but
Bria did a nice job stepping in front, stealing, and she goes down and scores.
And we do our little press, and when it got to half court, I sent Bria down
there to our end. We're playing 5 on 4, because I was like: I don't care; we
give up the basket, we're going to throw it the length of the floor and score.
We were going to keep doing that until they either put someone back and we
made it a 4‑on‑4 game. Or they just said, okay, we'll see if you can keep
throwing that pass.  
But it never got to that, because we actually‑‑ we stopped them a few times.
And then the whole key to winning is if we can continue to go 7 for our first
10 from the 3‑point line, I think we'll have a chance to compete with most
teams.  
My wardrobe, I can't stand wearing a coat and tie. I used to get out there and
I used to wear it. And I thank Tom Jurich because when I came for my interview
six years ago, I was in my jacket and tie. When I went to meet him and he
said, If you don't take that tie off, you're not going to get this job, I want
you just to be relaxed and be yourself, so I said, That's great.  
And then one day a year and a half ago I was going to do a little speaking
engagement, just had a button‑up shirt on and dress pants, I said, Do you care
if I wear this to games? He said, I don't care what you wear. I said, Sounds
great.  
So that's what I've gone with. And it's comfortable. I enjoy it. And I'm going
to continue to wear it.  
I'm trying to start a trend. It just hasn't picked up.  
  
Q. Jeff, with your defense there's times where it looks like you'll switch
in the middle of a possession. Without giving away too many trade secrets, how
often is that something you continue to do throughout the game, only in spots
where you see certain matchups, kind of what plays into that?  
COACH WALZ: Really what plays into that is who we're playing, personnel, who
is on the floor for us, and then most of the time honestly as the game starts
to progress, our players, some are playing man, some are playing zone. Our
Tennessee game, at one point in time my staff is sitting there yelling: What
are we in? What are we in? And I turned around and said: I don't know. Shut
up. Who cares? They're playing hard. And they started laughing. And I'm like:
Guys, at this point in time they're communicating with each other. And if we
don't know what we're in, they obviously can't know either.  
And it's worked for us. It's like I said, our goal, when it comes to scouting
and coaching, is you gotta try to figure out a way‑‑ and it's not just my
goal. I'm sure it's every coach's goal‑‑ make somebody that normally doesn't
score score to beat you.  
And that's what we're going to continue to try and do. Some games it works;
some days it doesn't. We've lost eight games. There's been eight it hasn't
worked very well with.  
  
Q. Two questions. How important was it for you to get a trio of referees
that allowed physical play? And, secondly, Mark Cuban said he would consider
taking Brittney Griner in the second round of the NBA draft. You proved you
could be physical with that player and take her out of her game. Would you be
an analyst for a moment and talk about the possibility of her even being
remotely on NBA?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I'll start with the first question. You know, when we went
into the game, our game plan was not to try to sit there and foul her every
time she got the ball. Our game plan was to try to cut down on her vertical
space. We wanted to make sure that we crowded her when she had it so she
didn't have the room to pivot and move. And we did that.  
They pay three officials to officiate the game, and then they pay us to coach
and the players play, and then you adjust how the game's called. And that's
what we did. I mean, we didn't do a very good job because we had three players
foul out. So there were plenty of fouls called. And that's how you have to
play. There's going to be games more physical than others. Some games they
call the handshake; others they don't. And you have to be able to go and
adjust as the game's going on.  
For Brittney, she's a great player, there's no question about it. She's one of
the best that's ever played this game. I just know from having the opportunity
to have sat there and played a little bit of Division II basketball on the
men's side, I mean, it's pretty physical. And then I can only imagine what
it's like in the NBA. I would think it would be a little bit of a stretch for
her to try to sit there and try and go out and play in the NBA. I'm not sure
how she would fare against Dwight Howard. I mean, she might be okay.  
In our game, I would hope that she'd just stay with the WNBA because she's got
the opportunity to make a huge impact and continue to improve what we already
have. And I consider it a very good professional game that I'd hate to see her
try to go over there and do that, and I'm not sure it would be really for her
or would it be for publicity to try to say, hey, look at what we did in
Dallas, look what we've done. I'm not sure which it would be. But I hope she
goes to the WNBA, and there's no doubt in my mind she'll have an unbelievable
career.  
  
Q. How have you seen Shoni's game evolve this season, even during this
postseason?  
COACH WALZ: Well, she's just matured over her three years right now. She came
in with flair. That's what she does. She can make an unbelievable shot.
Unbelievable pass, but what she's doing now is she's starting to understand
time and score of games, knowing when to make that back behind the back pass
and when to put up a circus shot, as she called it.  
That's all I challenge her with. I understand how she plays. I recruited her.
It's the one thing I told her when I recruited her: You can play anywhere.
You're talented enough to play anywhere, but you can't play for anybody.
Because some of the shots she takes and some of the passes she makes
somebody's not going to keep her in the game.  
I go back and I tease her all the time. For the first game of her college
career, we played Tennessee at home and she turned it over eight times in the
first half. Not the game, the first half. I kept her in: Shoni, keep going,
babe. It's you. Because she needed to get a feel for the passes I could throw
in high school now I can't throw right now. They're quicker, taller, bigger,
stronger athletes that I'm playing against.  
And as it's progressed through her career, she's adjusted to all of that.
She'll still make an unbelievable pass and it will be a layup and she might
throw one out of bounds, but with three minutes left she's not going to throw
that pass.  
  
Q. Follow up. Why?  
COACH WALZ: Because I let her play. I let kids play. Some coaches think I'm
crazy, but I want them to go out there and have fun. I think this game should
be enjoyable. I think the kids should have fun. I work them hard in practice
now. But when it comes to the game, they're going to take some shots that
aren't great shots. And that's okay.  
As I tell our players, I go watch high school games and I watch games on TV
and it's a one‑point game. Team's down one, the kid goes to the free‑throw
line to shoot two shots. They miss the first one, and you hear the coach yell
out: Focus, focus, you can make it. Well, and I'm going: No kidding? What do
you think the kid's trying to do, not focus?  
So I'm on the other side. I'll yell out the kid's name. Like when Monique Reid
went to the line to shoot her two shots, she looked over at me. I said: Can
you miss again? And she laughed. Because the worst thing you can do is make
them tight. And that's what I try to do. Like when we have kids throw up an
air ball, when they'll run by me, I'll be like: Just try to hit the rim; we'll
get a half a point.  
You want them to play and you want them to laugh, and that's what we do. Some
people might not agree with it, but that's how I like to coach. That's why I
think Shoni enjoys playing at Louisville. And hopefully we'll continue to get
players that want to come in here and have the opportunity to show a little
bit of their personality while they're out there playing.  
  
Q. Two questions. What impact has the Kevin Ware situation had on your team
and your players? And, two, I know you're one of the schools that are leaving,
but are there some bittersweet feelings on your part to be leaving the Big
East?  
COACH WALZ: The first one, we all were watching the men's game when Kevin Ware
went down. It was just a sad moment for him. It was one of the most horrific
injuries I've seen on TV in a sporting event.  
When I talked to the kids before we went out to play, I told them: It's a
basketball game. I mean, when the‑‑ at the end of the day it's just a
basketball game. So let's go out there, let's have fun, and just give it
everything you got for two hours, 40 minutes of basketball, and whatever
happens, happens.  
But when we walk back out here after the end of it, as long as we can look at
each other and say we gave all we could, that's all you're asking. Because you
have a kid like Kevin Ware from Atlanta that wanted to have a chance to go
back and play in a Final Four at home that unfortunately he can't play, but
he's with the team, which is great.  
We just learned‑‑ and I realized at that time we coach a game. It's a sport. I
mean, I love what I do, and I'm going to try to do it to the best of my
abilities. But we're going to make sure we're having fun.  
And then your other one, I'm sorry?  
  
Q. (Question Off microphone)?  
COACH WALZ: About leaving? Yeah, it's sad, especially when you're sitting here
looking at three teams playing in the Final Four. You've got, like I said, two
men's teams playing in it. The Big East as we know it, this is our last year.  
But if you're going to have a final run, I don't think we could have made it
any better. Everybody can argue this league's the best, that league's the
best, but at the end of the day it's what you do at the end. And we've got
three teams in the Final Four, and I think that says enough forward about our
league.  
  
Q. Jeff, how would you evaluate the UConn ‑Notre Dame game? It's very rare
to see a team play another team four times in a season. You know these teams
about as well as anybody. I wonder how you would evaluate that game.   
COACH WALZ: It's going to be a battle. If we're fortunate enough to win the
first game, I'm hoping it goes about ten overtimes. I mean, I'm looking for
that BW3 commercial where something happens. You keep going overtime,
overtime, overtime, because I want them tired.  
But it's been an unbelievable three‑game series for those teams. Anything can
happen. There's no question about it. But Notre Dame should be playing with
the confidence of knowing, hey, we beat them three times, but at the same time
I'd be going, dang, I wish we wouldn't have beat them three times. I mean,
it's tough to beat somebody four times in a year, but if anybody can do it,
they can do it.  
But UConn's playing really well right now. Stewart's playing so much better.
And that's a big X factor for their team. But Skylar and Kayla and Jewell
Lloyd and Achonwa, they're still playing great, too, so I'm expecting it to be
an unbelievable game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais is Notre Dame head coach Muffet
McGraw. We'll have student‑athletes Skylar Diggins and Kayla McBride.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You have an incredible basketball resumé. There's one thing missing from
it, and that is the national championship. How much would it mean for you to
get two more victories and win your first national title?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It would mean a lot‑‑ I say this over and over‑‑ not only to
me but to our team and our program, the city of South Bend who has been
supporting me my whole life, the university, Coach McGraw. It would just mean
a lot, so many things so much bigger than myself. And the opportunity is here
now. And, like I said, I'll keep saying it: We're going to leave it all on the
court and try our best to get to that position where we can fight for a
national championship.  
  
Q. Both players, this is obviously the fourth time you've played UConn. You
know them so well. Have you found it more or less difficult to pay attention
in the scouting report and focus in on what you have to do as opposed to a
team that maybe you hadn't seen before?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I don't think there's that much change. I think there's a few
things here and there. We see on film what's wrong, we adjust from there. They
couldn't have changed that much in about a week and a half. So we just try to
go out there and play hard and play with intensity.  
I think it makes it‑‑ I think we pay attention more now than ever. I think
you're at the point of the season where every detail matters even more. And we
know so much about them, and likewise with them for us.  
But we just have to make sure we come out and still execute our scout defense
and our keys to the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the level of confidence that you guys have playing
against UConn, especially you won seven out of eight, four straight?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: You know, UConn is a great team. I think we just go out there,
we have confidence in ourselves. I don't think that their games really matter.
This 40 minutes matters the most out of any other game this year, and that's
how we're looking at it.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I agree.  
  
Q. You and Kelly go back to senior All ‑Star games, U.S.A. Basketball. Could
you talk about the last four years, on‑court battles, maybe how ferocious
they've been, and the respect you have, both ways, you and Kelly have for each
other?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: She's a good player, one of the hardest workers I've ever
played with and somebody that never stops. She's like the Energizer Bunny. I
think she's fun to play with because you love when teammates go out and just
play as hard as they can every possession. That was my experience with her.  
  
Q. Skylar, I want to get a sense for the winning attitude, the mantra that
you carry, along with the team. Where did that start for you, how long ago,
and what's helped you progress to where it's at now?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: When I was at a very young age my dad tried‑‑ he was super
aggressive with me. He was in sports, and he kind of‑‑ my mom used to say how
rough he used to play with me and what have you, but he was very competitive.  
And then my mom, she never played basketball. She was a cheerleader, gymnast.
But if we played card games, if we played Monopoly, if we played anything, we
weren't stopping until she won. And she always encouraged us to just try our
best and you don't have to be the best but you have to be your best. And she
was so competitive in everything she did. So kind of both of my parents.  
  
Q. Who is the most well ‑known person to reach out to you this week to wish
you luck?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, I had talked to Lisa Leslie. I talked to Nancy
Lieberman. And on Twitter, Trey Songz told me good luck. I thought that was
pretty neat. For those who don't know who Trey Songz is, he's a singer.  
  
Q. Skylar, half the state of Connecticut is debating how deep you are in
UConn's head now after all that's happened. Is that something that you like to
plant a seed of doubt in the opponent, or is that something you don't even
care about?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yeah, I don't think it matters. Not to me. I think right now I
don't even think the past three games matter. I don't know if the tables have
turned maybe because they're a team, when you play against them, they can get
in your head. Because anything about Connecticut basketball, you think about
the championships and All‑Americans and what have you, and I think we've
overcome the intimidation factor. I don't know how you feel K‑Mac.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I have to agree, we have a lot of confidence in each other,
just a belief we can win. Not just with UConn, it's been every game this year.
We've just taken that momentum and just kept playing hard.  
  
Q. Everybody talks about how this game might be different. I'm wondering if,
Kayla and Skylar, maybe you could talk about how the last three were similar.
Did they play out in a similar way? Were the matchups the same? Was there a
lot of difference between the last three games played? And as Jeff was saying,
UConn has only lost 11 games in five years and seven of them to Notre Dame. Is
that incredible to you guys after what UConn has accomplished?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: What was the first question? I'm sorry. It was like two long
questions.  
  
Q. Skylar, how similar were the first three games?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Okay, gotcha. I think all three of the first three games were
decided within the last couple of minutes. And I think both teams had an
opportunity to win the game. I was proud how my team just made big plays
towards the end. If you remember in Storrs with Ariel Braker with the block,
and she got the final rebound to finish the game, and then South Bend, the
three overtimes, just making plays, K‑Mac with the 3, and to put us into
overtime and the countless amount of plays made in the three overtimes. And
then finally in the Big East Tournament, the last defensive play that our team
had and the presence of mind to sprint down the court after we got the steal,
make the layup, and then sprint back down and match up.  
I think the game was decided in the last couple of minutes and just our
ability to make plays.  
  
Q. Has it been total business for you, or have you had a chance to soak up a
little of the culture? If you have, why is that important to get some little
breaks in from the grind?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We talk about that all the time. This is a business trip for
us as far as basketball goes. But we want to enjoy this experience. This is so
much fun being a part of this team. We're in such a blessed position to have
the opportunity to play for another championship.  
And this is an exciting time for me. I'm a senior, and I keep saying I want to
soak it all in. I know the team went to Bourbon Street saw a little bit. And I
was saying how we ate the crawfish, it was looking back at us. Had eyes in it
still. The food is great, the people have been great. It's been a fun
experience so far.  
  
Q. Skylar, when you talk about that intimidation with UConn, what did it
take for you guys to get over that and put together this run you're on right
now?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: When you're playing against them you can't just focus on them
and the front of the jersey. You have to really focus on what you want to do
and executing your game plan. And I think we've been the aggressors for the
most part the last couple of times we played them. And I think that helps us,
when we're just worried about us, what we're going to do, and what we need to
do to win the game.  
  
Q. Sky, two years ago you guys were in this position they're in having lost
three times to them in the regular season and beat them in the Final Four.
What was the mentality for you guys? Was it, okay, we know we can still beat
this team and they're sort of in the position now where they've lost to you
three times this year and now they're trying to knock you off for the first
time?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: For us, we felt we had nothing to lose. I think that was our
mindset that we play, we're the underdogs, we had nothing to lose.  
When we come into this game, I don't feel like we're the underdogs. I still
feel like Connecticut is America's team and they're going to cheer for them
whether we beat them 20 times in a row.  
I think we approach this game with the mindset that we can beat them because
we have before. At the same time they're a great team. And we didn't win by
20. Like I said, the game was decided within the last couple of minutes.  
So if we're able to make some runs of our own, sustain their runs, make big
plays and believe in ourselves, fight adversity, make some big plays at the
end of the game, we'll be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll take some questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Muffet, Skylar said their attention level has been good. How would you
grade it over the last two or three days?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it's been really focused. I think it's a lot of
intensity. I think there's a lot of awareness of the scouting report and what
we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach, Skylar came to you as a great high school player, but she wasn't a
great player at least to the level she is now the first day on campus. How
does she become the player that she is now?  
COACH McGRAW: She's somebody that's a student of the game. She loves to watch
film. We watch a lot of film. We talk a lot. We draw stuff up on the board
together. We kind of talk about ideas and different things and experiences.  
And I like to watch the game from the point guard perspective. So I stand at
half court so I can be in her ear I think the entire practice and what are you
seeing and what do you think and what could you have done differently here.  
So I think a lot of back‑and‑forth conversation about things and here's some
good things that you did, here's some things you need to work on. And just
also having Niele Ivey on the sideline as a former point guard going through
the same thing. I think between the two us we've done a lot with her.  
  
Q. I know you've answered various versions of this question over the course
of the year, but here you are in the Final Four with three Big East teams
here. Talk about the pride of the conference and obviously the mixed emotions
of this is it.  
COACH McGRAW: We certainly think the Big East is the best conference in
women's basketball. We've proven it this year to have two No.1 seeds, and then
Louisville join us in the Final Four is a great accomplishment for the league.
It's great that we're doing it in the last year together. I think it's a
fitting ending for us to go out in a big way, and we're really proud of that.  
I think the Big East has elevated our team and our program. Since we joined
the conference we've really become one of the nation's best teams.  
And so it's a little sad to see its demise, but we're looking forward to big
things for us, too.  
  
Q. Muffet, why have you and Geno stayed civil when other coaches in this
situation may not be so just because of how the rivalry has been, how heated
the games have been? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems to
be stability and like between the two of you. Is that correct, and, if so,
why?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think I don't really read anything that he says. I think
that helps. I try to stay away from anything that's controversial. He would
love to try to get some things going, I think. But it's really not in my
nature to go back and forth like that. So I think we do remain civil. I think
having Philly as a common denominator‑‑ I think we both understand each other.  
  
Q. Muffet, how much has the dynamic for UConn changed in the last few weeks
with them playing Moriah Jefferson as much as she has this week and the
emergence of Breanna Stewart?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think both of them are playing much better. And I think
the expectations are high coming in for someone that's ranked No. 1 and No. 2
in the country. Everybody expects that you're going to come in and be a great
player right away.  
And different kids respond to that differently. It takes some of them longer.
We were fortunate with Jewell Lloyd that she was able to come in, really make
that statement, and join the starting lineup immediately as one of our best
players.  
So I think they've come a long way. And they're playing really great
basketball right now. I think Stewart, to be the most outstanding player of
the regional tournament, that's quite an accomplishment for a freshman.  
So I think they're definitely playing better now and playing probably like
everyone expected them to at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. Would you speak to Louisville and what qualities they have that allowed
them to get this far?  
COACH McGRAW: I think confidence would be the keyword for them to go into
Baylor‑‑ that game, and just shoot the ball as well as they did.  
And Shoni Schimmel is a very confident lady, as the leader of that team, and I
think they have a little bit of a swagger to them.  
And I think that's something that you need when you're playing against a team
of Baylor's caliber.  
  
Q. Two years ago you guys were in this position UConn was in having lost to
them three times and beat them in the national semifinals. This year is a
little different because every game was down to one possession or triple
overtime. Mentally, how is it better to have your team able to focus to maybe
beat a team a fourth time since all three games were so close ‑‑ I think two
years ago the teams were a little more distant, that, okay, maybe there's a
little confidence UConn had that they could still beat you?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we came out of each game, with, wow, we didn't play
well. Here's some things we can do well. Here's a some things we can do a lot
better. I think we learned a lot from each game because they were so close.  
So I don't think we have that feeling of we've beaten them so easily, because
certainly it wasn't an easy game. So I think it's a different mentality than
it was two years ago.  
  
Q. Muffet, could you talk about the vibe of this Final Four. Lindsay
Gottlieb joked that that game tomorrow night is the undercard because you guys
have played so many times in such tough games. But you had good things to say
about Cal when you played them at the end of last year. Are you surprised to
see them here? What do you think about sort of the vibe of this Final Four
grouping?  
COACH McGRAW: I'm not at all surprised to see Cal here. Last year I thought
they were severely underseeded to be in the 8‑9 game.  
We just barely beat them at home in a great game. And I told her next year
they'd be a top 10 team for sure and certainly a team that's on the rise. And
they've really exceeded the expectations in just her second year. I think it's
exciting for them first time to be here.  
I don't know the vibe. I don't leave my hotel room much. I don't know what the
vibe is on the outside, but I think that the game between us and Connecticut
is such a big rivalry game in the country, that, sure, the national‑‑ ESPN and
everybody's pretty excited about having that game on TV. And it is a sell‑out.
So I think it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Muffet, you say you don't read much what Geno says, which is probably a
good thing. About a month he was addressing a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in
the state, and he told the audience that there was no way that Notre Dame was
going to beat UConn a fourth time, and pretty much guaranteed that they were
going to win the game. Did that get back to you?  
COACH McGRAW: No, the guarantee for these championships, ‑‑ and so that was a
great motivational speech that I'd never have to give to my team. So I think
that was something that we did see.  
  
Q. Muffet, at the beginning of the year you talked that you liked this team,
but you did say you didn't expect, I shouldn't put words in your mouth, but I
wonder if where they are has turned out to be a surprise based on where you
thought they would be at the beginning of the year?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought after the Baylor game I changed my whole thinking on
this team. I came out of that game. We lost the game.  
It was relatively close. And I thought we played really well, did some really
good things. And so I gained a lot of confidence coming out of that loss. And
I really looked at the team a lot differently and where we could be.  
We went from there to play Texas A&M in a tournament in Vegas. And I thought
they were a great team. And we managed to beat them. And coming into early
January and beating Connecticut in the Storrs first game.  
And I think from that moment on, we felt totally different, like we got here a
lot earlier than we thought we would. I think our expectations changed in that
time.  
  
Q. What did you saw on this team that made you feel like that? Was it
something they were doing on defense or just a mindset?  
COACH McGRAW: I think a little bit of both. I think the mindset was there, the
confidence. I think that's what we saw that we went in, we executed what we
needed to. We made shots when we needed to.  
And I think certainly Jewell Lloyd had a lot to do with that. I think early on
Kayla McBride. You knew Skylar was going to be there. You expected big things
from her. But to have the rest of the team step up, I think that was the big
difference.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Cal we have head coach Lindsay
Gottlieb, student‑athletes Layshia Clarendon, Talia Caldwell, and Eliza
Pierre. We're going to start this morning with an opening statement from Coach
Gottlieb and then we'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Hi, everyone. Thanks for being here and covering us. We are
thrilled, to say the least, to be practicing on April6, to be here, having a
lot of fun with our team. We're soaking it all in. The people of New Orleans
and host committee have been wonderful so far. We're looking forward to
getting out to this open practice today.  
Personally I've watched a million of these since I've been a coach. It's
really a thrill to be here, but especially to be here with this group and this
team. There's no one else I'd rather be around, and we're excited to play
Louisville tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions and please state your name.  
  
Q. A lot of attention being made to the guard matchup in this game and your
role as a defensive stopper. Does that get you excited, you could have an
impact on a game of this magnitude with your role?  
ELIZA PIERRE: Yes. I don't know‑‑ yeah, it does. I think that they're very
skilled, and we have skilled guards. But I think I'm really excited to do what
I guess I do best.  
  
Q. No matter what you do, how much baton passing have you done with Brittany
Boyd in terms of leadership and preparing her to sort of maybe take over this
team from a guard spot going forward?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't know if I've necessarily thought about it that
specifically. I think our whole senior class has done a great job just kind of
instilling hard work, just being yourself, always bringing on every single
rep, just being a good leader, leading by example kind of thing, more than me
specifically passing on to Boyd.  
I think that's a really good role that we've all kind of played as Talia has
passed the baton to Reshanda Gray and Eliza has passed it on to all the rest
of the guards. I think we've done a good job of that.  
  
Q. How much have you seen Louisville play? In particular, in tournament
they're shooting 50 percent the last couple games from the 3 ‑point line. How
are you guys going to have to adjust your style for that?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: We've seen them hit a lot of open 3s, a lot of dribble
penetration, get by, force rotations, and then wide‑open shots. Our goal is to
get them in front for contested shots, which we have the guards to do without
a doubt.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask Talia a question. Louisville likes to get up and
down the floor. Of course you guys also. But how big will the rebounding be,
you and Reshanda, as far as slowing them down? You guys get a lot of offensive
rebounds in particular. Is that something you really focused on in this
game?  
TALIA CALDWELL: Yeah, definitely with every game because if you make baskets
it slows them down, of course, just from a schematic standpoint.  
And we feel like if we're not going to make every shot that the guards make or
that we make, we might as well put it back on the offensive rebound side and
take opportunities.  
They're also scrappy. They've got a lot of O boards the past few games, so if
we box them out and make them take one contested shot each possession, I think
they'll be good for our favor.  
  
Q. For each of you, where were you watching the Final Four last year? And at
what point did you realize this could happen this year for you?  
TALIA CALDWELL: I did not watch it. If I'm not playing it, I'm kind of a sore
loser, I'm done. So I was at the rec gym playing pickup that whole week. I was
just disgusted seeing all those teams. I felt like we should have been there,
even last year, and we would have competed and could have won the whole thing.  
So it just motivated I know me personally for next year and I wanted to work
on my game asap.  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: The same, I didn't want to hear about it. My sister texted
me about it. I was like, Stop talking to me kind of thing. I think we were
getting out of church and someone was telling us about the game. Sore losers,
hate to lose. Didn't want to watch.  
It's hard. I think you love the game so much and you're not in it, you don't
want to see the other teams.  
But I did come to the Final Four my senior year of high school. So that was a
really cool experience to see it in St. Louis, but didn't watch last year.  
ELIZA PIERRE: I guess I'm the sore thumb over here. I watched it. I watched it
because I know some people on the teams who played last year. So that's the
reason why I watched it. But I don't think if I knew anybody I would have been
watching it.  
  
Q. For any of the players who want to answer, obviously it's a big deal for
the Big East to have three teams out of the four. What's the perception of the
Big East on the West Coast? What's your thoughts on the conference as a
whole?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think a really good conference. You have so much talent
out of UConn, Notre Dame, Louisville. Respectable conference. I think we
respect every one of our opponents from the Pac‑12, SEC, the Big East. We know
there's a lot of talk about East Coast basketball, how physical they are, how
every game, night in, night out, like Skylar mentioned last night, it's like
an NCAA game for them. So really good conference. Really good names to play
with.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Gottlieb.  
  
Q. Hey, Lindsay, how do you balance the first time here for the team versus,
okay, it's a business trip and we have two games to win to become national
champion?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think the easiest thing has been to be how we've been all
year, and my philosophy and this team's philosophy, which is enjoying every
moment that we can being together, being with this team, and then at the same
time focusing and locking in when it's time to do so.  
So I think a lot of coaches who maybe aren't that way all year go, okay, now
it's the Final Four; how are we going to handle all the madness and then be
able to play? Well, that's what we do all the time. It's just on a larger
scale.  
So I think for us that's not the huge transition. It's just them being used to
more people there when we get off the bus and more lights and more cameras.
But the idea of enjoying it and focusing is something that we're accustomed
to. And I think that it's benefited us.  
  
Q. Such a big step forward for Cal basketball. What's this week been like
for you in terms of who you heard from and the interest that you're getting
and so on?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean, it's unbelievable. It's like a dream come true for all
of us. I've said that I absolutely believed in the talent in our locker room
and that we were capable of something like this. And at the same time I'm very
conscious of the fact that it's really hard to do it and a lot of things have
to happen right.  
And I think the reason it's been better than I ever imagined is because the
people I get to do it with, and that's from my staff to the team to our
administration and the Cal community.  
I'm also very keenly aware that there are so many great coaches who never get
to experience this. And I've been sitting here at Final Fours watching, and I
definitely have these pinch‑me moments like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be in
open practice. I'm getting text messages. Muffet and Geno gave me the most
genuine hugs last night when they saw me, which is really cool. And from
across the country I'm getting text messages from coaches and people and men's
coaches I know saying, hey, we're following, this is so great.  
So I'm very grateful and appreciative for this opportunity, really happy for
our players. Seeing their smiles and them light up with all the stuff that's
happening is probably the most gratifying.  
  
Q. Coach, could you follow up on who those men's coaches were that reached
out to you?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: A lot of them sort of connected to Cal. So obviously our men's
staff has been incredibly supportive. I've got e‑mails and text messages from
the former staff, Ben Braun and Louis Reynaud who were there before, Sonny
Dykes, our new football coach, Jeff Tedford, our old football coach, Dennis
Gates who's a great alum and Cal grad who's now coaching at Florida State. I
got a couple of texts last night from a UCLA ‑‑ former UCLA assistant who I'm
friends with who went to Santa Barbara, our Santa Barbara men's coach, Bob
Williams, and I could go down the list. It's really cool.  
Adam Duritz, the Counting Crows lead singer, was texting me last night from
Australia: I knew when I planned this tour I should have arranged the dates
around the Final Four.  
I mean, things like that, it's just the Cal community is so excited. A lot of
people. I could go on and on. But it's really just a thrill for me, and just
to be able to share it with these people.  
And then personally people from my childhood and things like that. It's so
much more meaningful when you share it with people. And I love that this team
is so accessible and so relatable that everyone feels part of it.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to follow up. For those of us who don't see you on a day
‑to‑day basis, how would you describe the collective personality of your team?
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think there isn't one collective. I think they're
individuals. I would say it is a group that genuinely enjoys life and playing
college basketball. I've gotten a million comments here from the support staff
and volunteers: Your team's the most fun. Your team's the best to be around.  
Got a lot of comments at the banquet last night that they're just the most
comfortable. I'm very secure in the fact they play for the California across
their chest and they're truly about the team and about each other that I'm
okay that one of them has a mohawk and the other one has pink braids and the
other one has brown hair and that when they're wearing stuff where you can be
an individual‑‑ some of them wear skinny jeans and some baggy jeans and some
wear the prom dress last night and some don't. It's a really unique group that
is just comfortable in their own skin and comfortable playing for Cal.  
I think collectively they're really smart. We're at the number one public
university. They're very socially conscious. They're aware of things beyond
basketball. They play really hard. They're super competitive. They get most
competitive about things with their teammates, like "don't say something bad
about my teammate" kind of thing. And they just genuinely‑‑ they dance every
day.  
They can break out into kind of song, but it's just really a neat kind of
mixture of serious and focus on basketball and school, and then a whole lot of
fun also.  
  
Q. Lindsay, what sort of outside activities have you been able to enjoy here
aside from the schedule of events?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, there's a lot of things scheduled, and those things are
fun. It's not like we've been off doing our own thing. But when we got here,
there was a New Orleans kind of Jazz band welcoming us walking in and king
cake and just the welcome there. Yesterday we had the media stuff and the
salute dinner. We tried to mix in like our meals even at the hotel having
gumbo and local sort of style things.  
I think maybe on the way back from practice today we were going to do a
sightseeing tour. But the main thing we haven't got to do yet is Cafe du
Monde, trying to fit that in somewhere, trying to soak in the flavor of
everything.  
At the same time obviously it's a business trip and there's a lot of scheduled
things and trying to keep the normalcy of our game prep while we kind of mix
in these other things.  
  
Q. Rebounding is a big part of your team's success. How important will that
be tomorrow considering Louisville doesn't have that kind of interior game you
guys do?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: It's going to be incredibly important. It's certainly a part
of our identity, huge factor in our success all the time. We don't take it for
granted. They'll tell you in the locker room every single game somehow find a
way to weave that into a key to the game. I try to say it a different way:
Rebound like they've never seen anyone before. And rebound only like Cal can.  
I don't take for granted that we're pretty good at it. We emphasize it all the
time. But I think it will be a factor.  
  
Q. You've been pushing a rock up a hill for a long time, that being your
neighbor to the south. You've beat them in the regular season. You're here and
they're not. Do you feel like you're up over that hill finally?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I think all along we've got such a tremendous respect
for Stanford. And even going through this year, Tara and I shared text
messages through the postseason. I've told her: You make it look easy, and
it's not easy. I have respect for the consistency of excellence.  
That being said, it's been for us about trying to create another elite program
in the Bay, trying to make Cal basketball one of the programs across the
country that gets to do things like this.  
So we see it as, wow, we've achieved one of those goals. We've gotten Cal to
the Final Four. We are in the elite. And we think that's great.  
It doesn't really kind of factor in for us, oh, and Stanford's not here. I
think we were just focused on us getting to this level. I think they've been
supportive of us trying to get here. And we hope for years to come that we're
at this level, and if that means competing with them more regularly, then
great. But it doesn't feel any better that they're not here; it just feels
great for us to be here.  
  
Q. Lindsay, when you run into an opponent that has recently developed a
persona as a team of destiny, is that something you're cognizant of to talk to
your players about, prepare in a special way, or do you not care at all and
just focus on yourself?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: We care about what they're running and how they're getting
those open looks. And, yeah, sure, I'm cognizant of the fact they're hot and
why are they hot and what do we need to cool that down. We talk to our players
about that, but it becomes more about specifics of how we want to defend them
or what they've been doing well and not‑‑ I think our kids pretty much think
we've got a good thing going, too. We focus on what we do well and how to slow
down the opponent, and that's like just the kind of normalcy of our prep.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I hope you get your beignets at some point. The expectation is
Baylor would be the team you're playing. Since you're playing Louisville,
obviously that's a team ‑‑ impressive they beat a team like Baylor. Does it
make it any harder, though, to take them‑‑ not take them seriously, but to be
prepared in the way you want to be, because they accomplished this great thing
but they're not the team that everyone would have expected to be here?   
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean, I think we're in the Final Four; you know that your
focus has to be completely on the team that you're playing. And there's no way
that any of us would‑‑ we haven't taken a game lightly all year. We had to win
every single Pac‑12 game after splitting Stanford to get to the championship,
whether that was the next top team or anyone else.  
So this team has a real mentality of whoever's in our way is the most
important game in the history of the world. That's kind of how they have
approached it.  
So absolutely we don't‑‑ we're not thinking about Baylor. We're not thinking
about anybody else but Louisville and all the things they do well and what
makes them such a serious threat to us, and those are the things we're trying
to be ready for.  
  
Q. Coach, Louisville has done a good job of kind of taking away other teams'
stars, and in their defense, at least in the half court, it looks like they
could change from ‑‑ in the middle of a possession. Can you talk about that
and describe exactly what makes Louisville's defense so tough?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's exactly what you mentioned. I think they're
really good and they're at their best when they're making you uncomfortable,
when they make you off kilter. I think Jeff does a really good job of figuring
out what's going to make another team uncomfortable and trying to play to
that.  
And so we've talked about not being rattled by their changing defenses, not
focusing on what they're doing and focusing on kind of the looks we're trying
to get and how we're trying to play.  
We have faced a number of different kinds of defenses that either try to slow
down Layshia or pack it in on our post or do some kind of junk defense, box
and one and triangles and two. And we've faced various things like that
before.  
The key with our players is not letting them dictate how we want to play on
offensive end, and I think that's what they're so good at doing and it leads
to their offensive production when they're turning you over.  
  
Q. Along the line of not playing Baylor, seems like this tournament you've
been a little bit fortunate, didn't have to play Texas Tech on its floor. Got
away with the fouls against South Florida, and you didn't have to play ‑‑
Gonzaga didn't make it to its own regional. Didn't have to play Stanford.
There's an old saying about being more lucky than good. Do you feel you all
were lucky in who you didn't have to play?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I definitely agree that a lot has to go right in order to get
to this point. But I also think there's a huge impact that our players have in
making things go right. I thought Fresno State was a terrific 15 seed. I
thought South Florida was one of the best teams we faced all year. That's a
team that took Notre Dame to overtime.  
And I thought LSU and Georgia were tremendous competition for us. So have we
won pretty every single game? No. And I think we can play better. But I think
the teams that were in front of us at each stage were really formidable and we
had to get the job done. And so I think we looked at the task at hand and got
it done and feel very excited and fortunate to be here. But "luck" isn't the
kind of word that comes into it in my mind.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you think Layshia has been overlooked nationally; and, if so,
why?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yes, 100percent. Absolutely. I just‑‑ she's an All‑American.
She has had an All‑American type season, consistently, and now she's helped
take her team to the Final Four.  
When people ask me what's the difference between us this year and last year,
the players that returned were all better. And Layshia has played like an
All‑American all year, which is what you need in order to go from being really
good to being the elite.  
I don't know, is she overlooked because we're on the West Coast and people
don't see her as much? I think at times if she was wearing one of these other
uniforms she would be one of the biggest names in the country.  
But I think she's quietly and steadily earned that respect from the people who
really watch basketball and who really know. So I think some of it is a West
Coast thing. I think some of it is the fact that we've kind of splashed on the
national scene this year and she wasn't necessarily on that stage for all four
years.  
I think another piece of it may be our balance; that we haven't needed her to
score 25 every game; that she's really good at distributing and playing within
the flow. I could go on and on. And she's an unbelievable student‑athlete. She
was the Scholar Athlete of the Year in the Pac‑12\. She's a tremendous
teammate. She plays both ends of the floor. There's not more, I think, one
person could do for a team within the context of being at this level.  
  
Q. Did you ever imagine that you would be coaching a team to the Final Four?
How did you prepare the Cal team to make it this far this season?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: That's a great question. Did I ever imagine it? I did. I don't
know what you dream about. But a lot of people have asked like, as a kid a
friend and I would take like a fake tape‑recorder and we would do imaginary
press conferences.  
And she would dream about playing in the Final Four, which she got to do, and
I would dream at some point start thinking about coaching here.  
When I watched other coaches coach in this kind of setting, I've said: Wow,
what would it be like to do that? And you visualize it in your head, and yet
it's still better than I ever imagined.  
In terms of the team, I think what I did is I gave them a belief to prepare
them for this. When I first got the job I said: We have everything we need in
this room, we just need to believe it.  
We need to work really hard, and I think that's the best way to prepare them,
because now I can look at them when we were leaving Berkeley for New Orleans,
I said: You just need to pack yourselves. You need to pack your heart and your
toughness and your jump shot, your rebounding and just bring us.  
And I think that's the best way to prepare them is to make them feel confident
and comfortable in who they are and the way we've done things.  
  
Q. Who was the friend who made the Final Four?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Her name is Hilary Hike. It was Hilary Howard. Played at Duke.
She was in the'99 Final Four, the team that knocked off Tennessee. Just kind
of a neat story. She's the one who introduced me to Joanne Boyle, who was her
assistant coach at Duke, who then hired me.  
Kind of a funny story, because Geno really recruited her very hard. She ended
up going to Duke. And our high school coach now is really good friends of
Geno, runs his restaurant.  
I joke that I have a job because you went to Duke and our high school coach
has a job because you said no to Connecticut. And now she and her whole family
are here. It's kind of fun. We joke: Wow, we both ultimately made a Final
Four. Pretty neat.  
  
Q. You're an East Coast person. Could I get your thoughts on the Big East,
them having three teams here. And Geno really ripped the president for
destroying the conference to chase the football money. What's the West Coast
version of what the Big East is going through in terms of the realignment?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: From being an East Coast kid growing up, I grew up watching a
lot of Big East men's basketball, Syracuse and Georgetown and you know Seton
Hall and the great games. My first coaching game was Syracuse when I was 21
years old. So really familiar with the passion for basketball, the commitment
to basketball.  
There's a lot of great teams, obviously UConn and Notre Dame have sort of
carried the banner, and then everyone else has sort of risen to a higher level
because of the success that UConn had. It's a great conference. We're excited
that they let us join the party here from the West Coast.  
But I think the college athletics world is changing. We're really excited
about the Pac‑12\. I think there's so many incredible schools and great things
going on. But you look at the conferences breaking up from the nostalgia
standpoint, it's a little sad. But new rivalries will develop. And I guess all
we can do is kind of go forward and hopefully get some new good rivalries.  
  
Q. So I was wondering like how do you encourage your students, like your
team to keep up the good grades and still be good in basketball?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: That's a great question. They know from the minute that they
step on campus and probably even when I'm recruiting them that the academics
is just as important as the basketball, that they go hand in hand; that
they're both a priority.  
We help them schedule their time so that they have class and practice and
study hall and weight training; that everything is a priority all at once. And
I think more than anything, I think when they know that it's important to me
and the whole program, it's important to them as well. And they do a really
good job of balancing both, and we talk about their classes and we talk about
the basketball.  
But I just think positive motivation is the best way to do it, to let them
make them believe what they can achieve when they end up with a degree from
Cal and playing on this basketball team.  
  
Q. Lindsay, when you ask questions, when you were the reporter, were you
rude, and did you have gravy stains on your lapel?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely not.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how much film have you watched on Louisville the last couple of
days, and are there specific games that you've keyed on to try to learn
something about them?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I've watched a lot of film. And you always try and get sort of
a diversity of film to watch. I like to watch teams that play defense the way
we play defense so I can see kind of what they do.  
I have specific coaches that I kind of, their game plans resonate with me;
this is where this person did this or that.  
And then I look at obviously teams that we're successful against them and
teams where they were really successful, knowing what you have to not do. So
obviously I always start with the most recent games.  
I've watched all their tournament games, obviously. And I kind of look at some
other games within their conference, of teams I'm familiar with and how they
defend.  
Are you asking me for those teams specifically? Honestly, like I always watch
how Notre Dame and UConn guard people, because I think‑‑ not that we do
everything the same way. I like to watch how Stanford guards people, not that
we do everything the same way, but you can get a sense of what they're trying
to do and how did that work.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2013

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kelly Faris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21810)

### [Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23275)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Connecticut, head coach Geno Auriemma,
student‑athletes Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis and Kelly Faris. We'll start with
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Proper pronunciation is Mosqueda. No, no, you got it right.
I'm glad you did. I don't know what that means in Mexican‑‑ that's Mexican for
something, but I'm not sure what it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Spanish. We have a question right here in the front row
(laughter).  
  
Q. Kelly, you and Skylar have been playing together summer All ‑Star teams
and U.S.A. Basketball. Could you describe the rivalry and maybe the mutual
respect you two earned over all these years?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, I don't think I'm the only one. I think quite a few have
played with a different people along the way that we come across. And it makes
it more fun. You always love playing people you know or grew up playing
against and you know their type of personality and how they are on the court.  
And she's a very competitive, smart player. So it just makes it that much more
fun to play.  
  
Q. This is for both the players. Coach during the middle of the season
seemed to indicate that this was not one of UConn's standards, one of the best
teams. Did that motivate you all in any way and did you think there was a
grain of truth in it?  
KELLY FARIS: I think he tries to get something out of us every single day.
With everything he says, he's constantly trying to get a response from us. So
when he makes comments like that, of course it's going to get under our skin a
little bit and make us want to prove him wrong. He's somebody that you want to
be on his side, and you want to gain his trust and his respect.  
So that's definitely something that we take to heart. But at the same time you
have to be careful not to let it get too much into your head. Use it for what
it's worth and for the positive.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Yeah, I agree with Kelly. We've been working toward
that all season, and I think we're finally starting to get the hang of it and
getting confident in ourselves and playing well.  
  
Q. Kelly and Kaleena, why do you expect tomorrow night to be different from
the three previous games we've seen you two play?  
KELLY FARIS: I think we've said it multiple times. I think coach says it a
lot. It's not about the Xs and Os between us. We know each other like it's the
back of our hand. We've played them so many times throughout the year.  
And this is it. This is one and done. And the stakes are high. So we just have
to learn from our past mistakes. And the games we've played against them we've
lost by‑‑ I don't know what the total point was, but it's not very many. And
we've had our opportunities and we just didn't finish it off.  
We know we're right there. And, like Kaleena said, we've been working really
hard to prepare for this game and building our confidence. I think we're in a
much better place than we were before.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Like Kelly said, the little things is what seem to
kill us in those games, in those big games and finishing them off. There's
spurts in the games before where we played great and we did everything we were
supposed to do. But when it came down to the wire, it just didn't end the way
we wanted it to.  
We've been working on making sure that didn't happen. We've putting ourselves
in positions like that in practice and being successful. And if it comes down
to that tomorrow, then we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Kelly, this is for you. As a senior, you come to UConn to win
championships, and you took one when you were a freshman. So much has been
made about Notre Dame losing in the last two years. What about the frustration
for you and your other seniors of not having any championships since then and
knowing now this is your last shot?  
KELLY FARIS: Obviously the past two years haven't ended the way we would have
liked. And I think the hardest part was to send the seniors out on that type
of note.  
So we know how it feels. And, like you said, this is it for us. And we don't
have another opportunity for the seniors to get it. And this is our last
chance. So we're going to leave everything out on the court and make the most
of it.  
  
Q. Kaleena, you went through this last year. Could you talk about how tough
it is for freshmen to go through that first year but also to develop the way
Breanna and Moriah are developing and to peak at the right time?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Yeah, it's definitely something that is a hard process
going through your freshman year, especially jumping from high school to
college basketball. It's just completely different. The game's faster. It's
more aggressive.  
But I think now they're definitely peaking when we need them to. They're
playing great and their confidence level is high. And regardless of what's
happened during the season, they've gotten better and they've risen to the
occasion at this point. This is when they need them most. The fact they're
playing great right now is awesome for our team.  
  
Q. Kaleena, being the fourth time you played Notre Dame, this week, leading
up to it, practice, film work, things like that, do you find that you're sharp
and intense and focused on them because you know them so well, or is it a
little bit ‑‑ I don't want to say maybe boredom set in about it?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: No, not boredom at all. Definitely still watching them
as intently as I did the first time, especially now it's a little easier to
watch film and know what I'm looking for having played them so many times.  
And just trying to make sure that, if anything, the mindset's right before we
go into the game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll start with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Kelly was referring to the fact that you say things that inspires the
players, either directly or to a third party that they hear and read and gets
them going. Muffet said today that she had read or heard something you said
before the Big East Tournament about Skylar and used that to motivate the team
to ‑‑ in the Big East championship game. You always say what's on your mind.
Are you ever worried that opponents might use it to their advantage?   
COACH AURIEMMA: I wish I was smart enough to do that because I don't remember
what it was that I said that inspired Skylar. But I'm glad I helped. I'll
always do whatever I can to motivate players.  
So whether they're on my team or the other team, I just want to be known as a
great motivator. I'm glad I'm still working on it. But I don't know what she's
talking about. I don't remember what I said. I wish I did.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Jefferson and Stewart are different
players now and how do you get freshmen to develop so they can thrive in the
tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know what the exact answer is to that question. A lot
of times the process has a lot to do with what each individual is made up of.
I didn't do anything with Kaleena last year from October to the Final Four
last year. I didn't do anything different. And this year, whether it's Moriah
or Breanna Stewart or Morgan Tuck, my approach wasn't any different. But their
personalities are much different than Kaleena's.  
So a lot of times it's how much are they able to handle and retain, what are
they able to let go off, how long can they keep their confidence. Those are
things that freshmen struggle with.  
And I think as coaches, you know, you try to evaluate that and you say, okay,
how much leeway can I give this particular freshman and how much do I have to
hold them back a little bit because they're not quite ready for it yet.  
And this year was a real struggle with all three of our freshmen, because so
much was expected of them to have to perform at a real high level. And maybe
they felt some of that throughout the season. And that doesn't exist anymore.
And I don't know if it's what I did as much as what they've done.  
  
Q. Along those lines, do you feel the start that Stewart had to be here and
her pedigree coming in maybe exacerbated what was a normal process for
freshmen to go through, that sort of the physicality picks up in December and
the conference play, the usual things happen? Do you think there was more made
of that than the normal freshman process for them to go through?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's nothing normal playing at Connecticut. So for Breanna,
everything she did that was really good‑‑ her first six or seven games,
everything she did was good. She was the greatest player to ever come to
Connecticut. Then everything she did that was bad, well, she's not as good as
everyone said she was.  
So when you're that highly skilled and highly talented and you come to
Connecticut, you're going to get to experience a little bit of everything. And
how you handle that in the end is going to determine how good a player you
are.  
And certainly in five months Breanna Stewart has gone through everything you
can imagine. Being called better than Maya Moore and being looked at as you'll
never be a great player until junior year. So takes a pretty strong type of
person to play basketball at Connecticut.  
  
Q. (Off microphone) and for what it produces this year it seems like there's
a collective entity here, it kind of shifts and moves. How is that different
for the program to have that than in the past where there's not an
identifiable personality around for which everything might move?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, we weren't fortunate enough to have any of the three to
see that ESPN talks about all the time. So we had to do it as a group rather
than rely on one person.  
But that's always been the case at Connecticut. We don't build our program
around one person, no matter who that is. We don't aspire to be that, when we
have players like Tina and Maya and Renee and Diana and Sue and Sveta and
Shea, and I could go on and on. It was always in the context of we'll let them
decide, each player, how big their role is going to be.  
And because of their personalities and how big their personalities were, they
just became superstars. And we don't have anybody with that personality this
year. We just don't. Kaleena Lewis has the kind of basketball game, the kind
of skill level that if she had a different type of personality she would be
like Maya or like Diana in terms of how she would act, but she doesn't have
that yet. Maybe she'll get it next year.  
But, you know, you just have to kind of take advantage of what you have. And
this year's been frustrating and rewarding, because it's been collectively.
And collectively when we're good, we're really, really good.  
And the four losses that we had this year can be in some ways directly
attributed to that one person in the past who in the last two minutes decides
the game. And it's taken us a long time to figure out who that is.  
  
Q. Kelly sort of alluded to this, but in terms of late ‑game execution, are
there things that you can do in practice to get your team better for late‑game
execution against an opponent like Notre Dame where ultimately that's really
been the difference?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, I was talking to somebody else the other day and
when we were up 5 in overtime and still unfortunately missed those free
throws, we went back to practice and I put the time on the clock and made a
triple overtime and still we made 15 in a row. So next year I'm going to
practice really hard on our guys making free throws in late‑game situations
because that's all about coaching, you know.  
And I said this 100 times. If Stewy makes those free throws, I'm a great
coach; if Stewy misses them, then I'm an ass. So many of those things
basically come down to something as simple as every one of our games, one
possession or one play ends up being a difference, like you said.  
And it may be the exact same outcome Sunday night. I have no idea. I have no
idea. I love the play they ran, though, at the end of regulation at their
place, when we're up 3, and they would double team Skylar and she throws it to
Kayla McBride who dribbles to the 3‑point line and ties the game. I don't know
why I can't think of that. One of these days I'll have that play. Just give it
to the guy, let 'em dribble to the 3‑point line and shoot it.  
  
Q. Geno, Kaleena and Stefanie were named to the WBCA team today. Your
thoughts on that honor and being rewarded for the work they put in?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I think every kid goes to college, whether it's
Notre Dame or Connecticut or Louisville or Cal, with goals: I want to win
national championships, I want to be an All‑American, I want all these things.
But unfortunately it doesn't happen for everybody. And when it does happen,
you're thrilled because you know how hard they have to work to make that
happen, that it was a goal of theirs from the time they were in high school
and that they're fortunate enough to play on the kind of team that allows for
them to play like All‑Americans.  
And both Stefanie and Kaleena deserve to be on that All‑American team this
year. Just like Bria deserved to be on it last year. And the other eight
players that were named on that team, the same with them. I don't think
there's anybody on that ten‑member team that you would say, you know, somebody
else should have made it than them. I thought it was the absolute perfect ten.
They did a great job.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the job Muffet did this season and just
what attributes have enabled her to be successful in the profession?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, everyone assumed that because you graduate three
starters like they did that your team is going to really suffer the following
year. And in the normal situation, they might have. But when you've got a
guard like Skylar Diggins who can miss eight shots in a row and then when it's
time to make the next four she makes the next four. And I think people maybe
underestimated just how much of an impact someone like that can have on your
team.  
I know it's the same thing when we lost our four starters and Diana was the
only starter coming back and everybody said now we'll get them. You don't
underestimate just how good a great guard can do.  
The other thing that I've seen happen is I think Muffet's really good at
taking advantage of what her players are really good at. She puts them in
situations where they can be successful. They're not running an offense that
doesn't fit their players. They're not playing a defense that doesn't suit
their style of play. She's really smart. She keeps her composure on the
sidelines.  
They're as prepared if not better prepared than any team we play all long
year. And it's been like that for a long, long time. And that's what allows
you to be in a position where you are now. Muffet's doing the same thing this
year that she's been doing the last 20 years, but when you have the kind of
guard that she has right now, all that stuff that you've been doing for 20
years now you go to three straight Final Fours because you now have the
absolute perfect person to run the stuff that you run and lead the team that
you put together. So it's not like she just all of a sudden stumbled on being
a great coach.  
  
Q. Two questions. First of all, have you done anything special this week to
either challenge or, your players being so familiar with the other team,
change up your game plan? And, secondly, how much thought have you given to
scheduling on down the line when so much of your conference goes away, and
might even ‑‑ two years from now might even want to play‑‑ consider playing an
independent schedule like Louisiana Tech did 20, 25 years ago?  
COACH AURIEMMA: This week we didn't do anything other than try to get ready
for hopefully two games. Our practices were mostly about what we need to be
really good at Sunday night and what changes we want to make for Sunday night,
based on the other four games that we play or three games that we played
against Notre Dame this year.  
In terms of the future, I don't know what the future holds. I don't think
anybody else does either. The conference that we're going into is for us a
great opportunity. And the thought of us being out there and independent,
women's basketball program, that's never entered my mind. That's not something
I would want to do. I don't think in today's day and age you can function like
that. I think being in a conference is ultimately the best thing for our
program, and I don't see that changing.  
  
Q. Geno, is there a difference between the way your team will approach
experience ‑‑ prepare for this experience than Cal? You guys six times in a
row and they've never been here. What is the spectrum of that experience when
you come in with a difference like that?   
COACH AURIEMMA: I was just saying this to Chris Dailey today, that I looked
around and I said: I can't believe this is 14 Final Fours for us. Because I
remember in 1991, our first. And it was here in New Orleans at Lakefront Arena
and 8,000 people at the game. And I remember how we acted relative to how we
act now. And we showed up and it was different than any other game
preparation, different from anything else we had done.  
And then at halftime we're down 10 and we're in the locker room and we're
like, damn, the pain started already. And it's halftime.  
I'm sure there's so much going on with Cal's kids right now that by the time
the game comes around, because of the hoopla that exists here now, it's way
more than it was in 1991, it will be‑‑ that will be the only thing that's
normal is when the actual game begins. Because everything else leading up to
that is something that they've never imagined or ever experienced.  
But when the ball goes up Sunday, that will be the only thing that's familiar
to them. And that's probably the way it should be. You should have as much fun
as you can and when the game starts go back to what you've always done, play
basketball.  
But I hope the experience that we're trying to provide for our players is not
that much different. We're not locked up in a hotel room watching film 24
hours a day. And we're not practicing three hours a day in different spots.
And we're enjoying where we are. And we're enjoying what we're doing. And
we'll be ready to play Sunday night, just like the other three teams will be.  
  
Q. Coach, to sort of follow up on that, do these things ever become routine
because you've done so many of them, or do you still get the buzz out of it? I
know it can't quite be like Cal doing it for the first time. But can you still
get that enjoyment out of it, emotionally that this is still a big deal to
make a Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Leading up to this is getting harder and harder for me
every year, not‑‑ being at the Final Four is still fun. It's still great. It's
easy. When you're here, you know your team deserves to be here. You know
you're going to play well. You know you're playing a great team.  
For me, it's gotten harder and harder to enjoy the process leading up to this.
And Lindsay doesn't know it yet, but 10 years from now she's going to look
back on this year and go, man, that's when it all turned for me. I used to
love this game (laughter).  
  
Q. Geno, where would you put your interest in playing Notre Dame, obviously
not next year, but the year after that and in the future? Is that something
that you and Muffet and both schools would work to have just because of its
importance as an overall rivalry for the game?  
A.Yeah, if you look at our schedule now, this year, I think as the preseason
top 10 teams, I think we played‑‑ I want to say all of them at one point or
another. And that's kind of been our philosophy during the regular season for
a long time now.  
So once we get this conference thing squared away and once we get our
scheduling in order, I would venture to say that there's going to be a lot of
interest in playing that game. I'm sure on our part and their part. I would
think.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining
us for our fourth and final call this afternoon with our women's final four
head coaches. Joining us for this particular segment is Jeff Walz, the head
coach of the University of Louisville. Jeff and the Cardinals will be playing
California this coming Sunday in the national semifinal game of the 2013
Women's Final Four in New Orleans.  
At this time, before we take your questions, I'd like to invite Carolayne
Henry who is chair of the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Committee and
Senior Associate Commissioner of the Mountain West Conference to say some
welcome remarks. Carolayne?  
CAROLAYNE HENRY: Thanks, Rick. Jeff, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to the
University of Louisville, pronunciation notwithstanding, and congratulate you
and your team on an outstanding season and for making it to the 2013 Women's
Final Four. I look forward to seeing you in New Orleans, and good luck.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Jeff, if you would, just a quick opening statement and then
we'll go to questions.  
COACH WALZ: First like to thank everyone there. We're just honored to be one
of the four teams remaining. It's been a crazy two weeks for us. Just really
excited with the way we're playing right now with the effort that our young
ladies have given us, not just during the games, but in practice, both
mentally and physically.  
We're a group right now that I think has done things that no one thought could
be done, and we're going to continue to grow with what has gotten us where we
are right now, and hopefully, be able to find a way to win a game or two more.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what is your style of coaching? What is the line that you
find of how far you can push players and how you push them? What was your
learning curve with that and figuring out the point which you started to get
diminishing returns?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I was fortunate enough to work six years for Paul
Sanderford, two years at Western Kentucky and four at Nebraska, and Paul took
three Western Kentucky teams to the final four back when he was there. I just
really learned and watched from him. He was very demanding on his players in
practice, but most importantly, I saw how much he cared about them not only on
the floor but off the floor. The relationships that he was able to build with
them that they put their trust in him and they believed in him. They knew that
even though there were some really tough days at practice that he was just
trying to get the best out of them to hopefully show them that they can
achieve more than they even think they can. That's really where I learned it
from.  
I became a big believer that you can really get these college students, these
18 to 22‑year‑olds, to do more than they ever dreamed they could if they know
you care about them, if they know you genuinely are there for them.  
So when we step on the court, our players know it's basketball. It's all about
basketball, and we have a job to do. But they also know when we step off the
court, I'm there whatever they need. We're going to laugh. We're going to
joke. They're going to make fun of my stuttering. I'm going to make fun of
their hair if I have to, whatever it might be. We're very sarcastic, and we
like to laugh and have fun.  
When you can do that off the floor and be able to switch it and understand,
hey, when basketball stuff starts, it's time for practice. We've been able to
have some success here, and we're going to continue to do that, and hopefully
the success will continue to follow.  
  
Q. How concerned are you with their ability to rebound, particularly the
offensive rebounds? Your team being one that likes to get the ball and go.
Also, would you talk about the intriguing match ‑ups that will take place?   
COACH WALZ: Yes, their ability to rebound the basketball is something else. I
was really impressed with them as we watched the Georgia‑Cal game. I think
they came up with an unbelievable 27 offensive rebounds. They're relentless.
They're ball hawkers, as we like to say. They just hawk the ball. They're
going after it. Their number one goal is to get it, and they won't settle
unless they do. So we were very concerned about that.  
We know we're going to have to make that a focus of ours, a concentrated focus
and putting a body on somebody every time a shot's taken.  
Guard‑play‑wise, it's going to be fun. I think they've got one of the best
guards that I've seen in a long time in Clarendon, and I've been really
impressed with her ability to shoot the three, her pull‑up jumpshot, and just
her demeanor on the court. She really is a comforting influence for their
entire team.  
Then you've got Brittany Boyd that is a very, very solid player, does a nice
job of taking care of the basketball. Both of them have 100 assists and more.
So when you've got two players on your team that Clarendon has 100 assists and
Boyd has 150, I think it says a lot about their abilities to not only handle
the ball, but they can distribute it and get it to people in the right spots
to be able to score.  
  
Q. So far you've been called an answer man because you have an answer for
everything. Just talk about having a week to prepare, but 48 hours before
you're back out on the floor to have an answer for the next team?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I wouldn't say it's so much that we have an answer. What
we've been able to do is score the basketball the past three games.
Everybody's‑‑ I've had great emails and great text messages and phone calls
telling us what a great job defensively we did against Baylor, and I kindly
remind everybody that I talk to that we held them to 81 points. They average
81 points, so we did average. They score 81, and that's exactly what they were
scoring on average for the entire season.  
The difference is they normally only give up 51, and we found a way to score
82. So our ability to score the basketball right now, to me, is a bigger
influence on the way we're playing than us being able to defend people. We
score 86 points last night against a very good defensive Tennessee team.  
So we're going to have a game plan. That's the part of the game that I love
the most. I love the strategy part of it. I love trying to figure out what can
we do to possibly get someone off balance? Then you try to think what are they
going to do to try to get us off balance? And that's where I enjoy sitting
down and watching film and just trying to dissect their games and figure out
when they watch us, what do they think our weaknesses are?  
So it's a lot of fun to do that, but at the same time, as I've said over and
over, I haven't made a shot in my entire career as a coach and I haven't
gotten a rebound or come up with a steal. You've got to have players that are
willing to go out there and follow the game plan and do some unorthodox things
at times.  
When you put four on defense and send one back, which we were going to do for
the first possession against Baylor, just to try to get some excitement and
try to get our team believing, hey, we can do some things and it's going to
work. Right now, I think our players do believe in our coaching staff, believe
in our game plans, and we're going to continuing to with that and hopefully it
will work when we have to go up and play California.  
  
Q. If you can quickly talk about the Schimmel sisters?  
COACH WALZ: The Schimmel sisters are a good group of two great kids. It's been
fun to coach them. They're playing great basketball right now. Shoni's really
been shooting the ball well and been passing it. And Jude is just, I mean,
she's so steady with the ball. She played 30 minutes last night, had three
assists and one turnover against a lot of pressure. Tennessee was trying to
pressure and come at her, and she with stood that very, very well.  
They're fun. I like how they play and that's why I recruited them. I want kids
that want to come in here and know they're going to get the chance to play.
You're going to get a chance to run up‑and‑down the floor. From Shoni's
freshman year to her junior year she now knows, okay, when can I try that
no‑look, off the ear pass? If we've turned it over two straight times, it's
not the right time to try it. But we're still giving her the freedom to play,
and I think that's what makes her so special.  
I tell her all the time, you're talented enough to play anywhere, but you
couldn't go play for just anybody. Because I know sometimes she might throw
one up into the crowd but I also know she's got the ability to come down off
the break and shoot one from 24 feet that some people might think is a bad
shot, but that's her game and you've got to be willing to let players play
their game if you're going to be successful.  
  
Q. When you went to the Final Four for the first time in 2009, can you talk
about how immediate the impact was in terms of recruiting, visibility, how
different it felt when you went out after having been there? And how you think
now Cal is doing for the first time, how that can impact their program?  
COACH WALZ: It was great for our program, because it puts you on a national
stage. It puts your name out there. It lets everybody know that you are a
program. It's hard anymore to just have one team. Like in '09 you had a great
team, and that's it, and then you weren't heard of again.  
I think Cal, Lindsay has done a great job of building and continuing to grow
that program. And this is only going to help their recruiting, and I'm hoping
it continues to help ours. Because, as we all know, that is the name of the
game. You've got to find players that believe in what you're doing and want to
be at your University. I'm a big believer in that.  
If you've got to try to convince a kid this is why, this is what you do, this
is why you should come here and you're begging them to come. Well, once they
get there, those aren't the ones that give their heart and soul. So when we
try to go out and kind of players that want to be a Louisville Cardinal, and
those are the ones that are going to give you everything they have.  
So there is no doubt in my mind that it's going to help both our programs to
continue to grow and hopefully we'll both be able to go out and find some top
10, top 15 players.  
  
Q. You talked about offensive creativity and players being able to play.
Doesn't mean undisciplined, but they're able to make some choices out on the
court. It strikes me that Connecticut and Notre Dame have similar type styles
and I think they're harder to defend because of that. Do you think that's a
big thing going forward in women's basketball for coaches to be able to help
players play that way?  
COACH WALZ: Yes, I do. I think it's very important, and at the same time, I
think as a coach you have to be able to give your players freedom to play. But
you have to make sure your players understand what's going on in the game,
what the time and score is.  
I love watching Geno's teams play because of how they play. But at the same
time I don't think you're going to see Kelly Faris or somebody coming down the
floor and shoot a 25‑footer 1 on 4. You know, that's freedom, but we hopefully
aren't going to do that either.  
So you teach them how to play. You teach them time and score and then you give
them freedom within that. That's something that we really have been working on
here and our players are really starting to understand the more educated they
get about the game of basketball, understanding what's going on at this
certain time, you're going to be able to do a lot more. Then I don't have to
call as many plays. I don't have to direct us in what we're doing.  
And that's what we really did our two games at Oklahoma City. That's why when
I said we're going to play street ball, that's what that meant. We're not
going to worry about hopefully having to run a bunch of offense. We're going
to drive and kick, make the extra pass, find a shooter and score, and that's
what we were able to do for two straight games.  
  
Q. I hope you'll indulge me asking a question about a player who is not on
your team but you've seen play a couple of times. What impresses you most
about what Jewell Lloyd has been able to do for Notre Dame as a freshman
coming in and starting 34 out of 35, and filling some big holes?  
COACH WALZ: Well, Jewell's done a great job for them. Her strength, her
stamina is really what's impressed me, because a lot of freshmen, when you're
playing as many minutes as she is, the toll and the wear of the season just
kind of breaks you down because you're not used to it.  
As I tell all my freshmen, I sit them down before they go home for Christmas
and we go to the board and talk about, how many high school games did you
play? How many hours did you practice each day? Did you get two days off? And
we go through that. For 90% of them they've played more basketball before
Christmas break their freshman year in college than they did their entire
senior season.  
So what impressed me about Jewell is just her ability to sustain her endurance
and to be able to continue night‑in and night‑out to go out there and perform
at the level she's performed without looking tired.  
  
Q. You've knocked off No. 4, No. 2, and No. 1 Baylor in your bracket. Now
you're getting into the Final Four and you're kind of seen as the underdog.
But what have those wins against the higher seeds done for your team's
confidence?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think we're at a point right now where we do believe if we
show up and compete and follow game plan and believe in each other, we can
beat anybody. But, at the same time, we also know if we don't show up and
we're not all on the same page, we're able to be beaten by anybody. We're just
not talented enough to just go out there, roll the ball out and say, hey,
let's play.  
We have to go out with a plan. Our players have done a fantastic job of
following the game plan. We're going to know player tendencies. We do our
scouting based on player tendencies. What this player likes to do. We have to
try to take that away.  
Our game last night I thought we did a really nice job in the first half. Now
in the second half, Taber Spani drove left every time she got the ball and
scored, and that was on our scouting report. Don't let her go left. Don't let
her go left. But we didn't do a good job of that, and that's something that
we'll talk to our players about. Hopefully we'll be able to do a better job of
that for 40 minutes against Cal.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you were able to come to the Sugar Bowl earlier this
year and watch Louisville, and if you were able to take anything away from
that victory? They were a big underdog against Florida and had a great game
and Louisville just kind of took over New Orleans. Were you able to watch that
and is that something you can translate to your team?  
COACH WALZ: Unfortunately, I was not able to go down to the game since it's
right in the middle of our season. But we did watch the game. We watched from
start to finish, and were just so impressed with how Charlie had those guys so
prepared and so mentally focused to play and came out and threw the first
punch.  
That's kind of what we talked about with our kids. When you're playing teams
like we're playing, you have to be the aggressor. You have to come out and try
to get it going from the beginning, instead of trying to fight your way back
upstream.  
We learned a lot from watching them. We watch our men play a lot. We love how
they play, how they compete and how they attack the entire time. And we try to
take things away from both of those teams and implement them in our program.  
  
Q. How much of you saying Louisville as the ugly ducklings crashing the
party, nobody believed we'd be here, is a true feeling of being an outsider
versus you playing an us ‑against‑the‑world card to motivate your team?   
COACH WALZ: I think it's a little bit of both. You're always trying to find a
way to motivate your team. But I'm not sure if you filled out a bracket, but
did you have us beating Baylor?  
  
Q. I did not have you beating Baylor.  
COACH WALZ: Okay. And I'd love to know of the bracket that's were filled out
on ESPN how many had us beating Baylor.  
  
Q. I'm going to say less than 1%.  
COACH WALZ: Okay. So I think it's fair to say we're the party crashers is a
legitimate saying. I think we are. If somebody had us beating Baylor, did they
really have us beating whoever that next team might be? And last night, it was
Tennessee.  
Even as we beat Baylor, I'm not sure anybody thought we could come back on
24‑hour rest and beat a very talented Tennessee team that had been beating
everybody in the NCAA Tournament by about 18 points.  
  
Q. I think that's fair.  
COACH WALZ: That's why we go with it. We're going to try to go with it and run
with it and see where it can take us.  
  
Q. We were talking to Lindsay a little earlier, and I think she said you
guys maybe first got to know each other when she was an assistant at Richmond
and you were at Maryland. She talked about your ability to get players to
believe in whatever you tell them. She said if you told them they'll come down
from the moon and run around in circles, they'd do that. That you just have
that ability. Can you talk a little bit about getting to know her a little bit
and maybe what you think her biggest strengths are as a head coach?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, she was an assistant at Richmond and I was an assistant at
Maryland when our paths first crossed. It's kind of funny, because we were
both out at the Final Four last year, and actually were at a little get
together and we sat next to each other at dinner and just had a really nice
conversation just about basketball and life and family for that entire time.
Now all of a sudden we're going to end up playing each other in the first
semifinal game.  
I'm just really impressed with how she's been able to go into a program and
continue to build it. I think it's very similar to what we've done here. We
did not walk into a situation where the cabinet was bare. We talked into Angel
McCoughtry, Candace Bingham and just took them to the next step, the next rung
on the ladder. And Lindsay has done that exact same thing.  
She went in and had some very nice players and brought in some more of her
own, and now they've got them taking her personality, and that's one of we're
going to continue to attack. We're not going to give up. We're relentless. We
get on the floor after 50‑50 balls.  
I've just been really impressed with the little bit of film I've been able to
watch right now of how they don't quit.  
  
Q. Where is Monique Reid physically compared to the player who scored 18
points a game in 2009 and 2010, and kind of along with that, showing players
how she feels off the court about them. How has your relationship with her
kind of changed over the years as she's dealt with a lot of physical
adversity?  
COACH WALZ: Mo's probably, I can honestly say, she's probably 50%. She played
33 minutes last night, which is the most she's played this entire season, I
believe. I just admire her because she just is willing to continue to fight.  
When she came back from her micro fracture surgery from last season, we knew
it was going to be a situation where we're going to just have to monitor her
playing time, monitor her practicing, and just see how the knee responded.  
I felt we did a really good job of that in the non‑conference. She was playing
14, 15 minutes a game. Some games she might play 20. Then we get into
conference, she was doing well, and then, boom, she goes down in practice and
has that same knee, reinjured it, has to go get a scope done and had it
cleaned up. They basically said at that point in time, you need more surgery.
We can do it now. You're finished for the year. Or we can wait until the end
of the year and see if you can't manage your pain and the swelling until it's
finished.  
There was no doubt in my mind what she was going to choose, and that is she
wanted to play, and that's what she's done for our program.  
She's the only player in our program history that played in two Final Fours.
When she steps on the court for our next game, she will have surpassed Angel
McCoughtry for games played here at Louisville.  
So it's been fun to watch her, especially her freshman year because she was an
important part of our Final Four run. Sophomore year, she's first team All Big
East. Her junior year, I believe, she was first team All Big East. Then gets
hurt her senior year. Comes back for her fifth year, and she's able to fight
through it.  
Our relationship has grown each year. You know, when she came in as a
freshman, I had to get the most out of her. I had to try to get more out of
her than she ever thought she had in her as a freshman, because I knew what
she needed to bring us with the group that we had. We had Angel McCoughtry,
Candice Bingham, and I needed two more players and it ended up being Monique
Reid, and Becky who did a great job of filling those roles.  
So she's continued to mature. She's continued to grow. I think she's learned
as most of my players do after their freshman and sophomore years, hey, coach
is one way at practice. But he'll do anything for us when we step off that
court.  
Then, for a fifth‑year senior, she's also learned if she goes hard, I really
don't say too much to you. So she's decided to go hard now.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say your conference schedule prepared you well for this
national tournament, and what do you think of the idea that you can't win it
all without beating one of those teams again?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think our conference schedule, just the Big East itself is
just a great league. To be the last year of it as the existence we have now to
have three of us playing in the Final Four, I think it speaks volumes for what
the women's programs are all about.  
When you go back and look at the men and women, you have five of the eight
teams are Big East schools. So I'd say the Big East had a pretty good year in
both men's and women's basketball.  
For us, we know if we're fortunate enough to get past Cal, we'll have to play
either Notre Dame or UCONN, and it's going to have to be a situation where we
come out with the same type of focus that we had when we played Baylor in
Tennessee. Because we haven't had much success against UCONN or Notre Dame.  
So we're going to have to get our mindsets changed, if we are fortunate enough
to get to that game, to be able to go out there and try to make that as
competitive game as we can.  
  
Q. Do you think you have an advantage to play a team that you don't see that
often in the tournament?  
COACH WALZ: I enjoy that myself. I enjoy playing teams that you don't get to
see that much because I think that makes the chess game even more exciting.
Because now you watch them on film. You're like, she's pretty quick. Then you
get a chance to actually get there in person, and it's like, oh, she's quicker
than I thought she was, or she might be slower than you thought she was.  
But we'll have the opportunity to play Cal, who, we obviously have not played.
Then, if we're fortunate enough, we'll have to face Notre Dame or UCONN team
that's very familiar with us and we'll be familiar with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Walz, thank you for joining us. Look forward to seeing
you in New Orleans.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you very much. Sure appreciate it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Muffet McGraw. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH McGRAW: This has been a dream season for us. I think when you looked at
us in the beginning of the year, nobody predicted us to be in the Final Four,
and certainly the improvement we've made throughout the year.  
But how well we've played throughout the year has been just so fun to watch.
Skylar Diggins leading the team in just about every way possible, but great
performances by Kayla McBride and Natalie Achonwa and Jewell Lloyd. We've had
some fun along the way and we're so blessed to be back for the third time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Looking statistically, and statistics can be used however you want, but
in some ways it looks, Jewell Lloyd actually played more games as a freshman
than Skylar did. I know point guard adjustment is much bigger. But can you
just talk about how fast Jewell adjusted to the enormous role you've given her
and maybe even compare it to how Skylar adjusted? That's the first part. The
second part, you could have three good looks at Morgan Tuck, particularly in
the triple overtime game. I just wonder what impresses you most about her.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, Jewell's progress throughout the year was really
tremendous. She really came in as an immediate starter. I think the first day
of practice it was pretty obvious that she was that good and that ready.  
She started out the year well with a career high against Baylor December5th. I
think she went through a little bit of what most freshman go through where
there are a little bit of ups and downs along the way as you're just getting
used to the rigors of the college basketball season.  
But she has really come through late in the year, which surprises me because a
lot of freshmen hit the wall in February and don't really recover past that.
But she has been tremendous.  
And I think a lot of it is because of Skylar. I think when you have veteran
players around you, they make it easier for her to do her job. And we try not
to give her too much early on.  
I think obviously not playing the point you don't have as much responsibility.
So I think it was easy for her to make that adjustment.  
And I think Morgan Tuck has really improved throughout the season. And she is
coming into a starting position. I think that she's a very good post player.
She can score around the basket, and she can face up as well but her
rebounding and her inside game I think are really good.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just the fact that teams like you and UConn and some
others, even a Stanford that has really become very adept at what I would say
is read and react offenses and I know you guys have said but have players who
can freelance and can react and how that makes it difficult for defenses to
stop you. And then the second question is if we have a Final Four first ‑timer
in Cal, if you can sort of talk about what it meant to your program back in'97
to make that Final Four breakthrough and how you build on that after you get
that spotlight?  
COACH McGRAW: The Princeton offense is a really fun offense to play in because
it's all reacting to the defense. I think there was so many options. There's
never a point where you have to go from A to B. There's always different
options and the ability for the guards especially to be creative and to play
to their strengths and to move without the ball, I think, is it's a great
offense for this particular team because they are such smart basketball
players they read the defense so well. And it's effective against man and
zone.  
So I think the transition game into the Princeton offense gives my players a
chance to use their own creativity. I don't like when the point guard looks
over and says what are you going to run. And fortunately I don't have to worry
about that because Sky pretty much can make up her own mind. So we've been
blessed there.  
I don't like a team that runs a lot of sets. I want it to be more of an open
game.  
Second question, I think going to the Final Four for the first time is an
unbelievable experience that you just treasure. The first one is always
special. You remember that team, those players, those kids and just the joy,
especially when you've overachieved to get there. When you're a team that was
not the No. 1 seed and yet you still managed to get there, I think it makes it
even more special. And I think they're going to enjoy them mentally.  
  
Q. Couple of years ago lost three times to UConn and turned the tables at
this point in the Final Four. Now that's kind of reversed. I'm wondering, was
there a mental obstacle that you and your team had to get over that year and
if that's the case how did we do it? And then this year do you feel like you
have a mental edge because of the three wins over UConn?  
COACH McGRAW: We beat them in 2001 and won the national championship, I think
that was a big moment for us to finally get to that point and to win a
national title upsetting UConn in the semifinal. And I think that game
certainly gave us and our program kind of a great momentum swing.  
And in the last couple of years, I guess the last two years, we faced them and
come out with the win. And I think we just‑‑ we go into the game with a lot of
confidence and we know it's going to be a battle. But I don't think there's an
edge really either way.  
I think coming into the last two games we won a couple. We lost one. And I
don't think we felt any differently than we feel right now.  
  
Q. You had talked a little bit about Morgan Tuck. The other two Connecticut
freshmen have really stepped up their game in the NCAA Tournament. You haven't
seen a lot in the three games this season of Moriah Jefferson. Can you just
talk a little bit about what the improved play of those two freshmen mean in
terms of giving you guys different looks and what you're most concerned about
when they have like Jefferson and Hartley on the court at the same time?  
COACH McGRAW: Jefferson gives them speed that they didn't have before. I think
she is somebody that can really get up and guard the ball, and she can make
the offense run a lot faster, because she just is so quick and she really
likes, seems to like the transition game.  
So she presents some problems because she puts their game at a little higher
pace. Breanna Stewart I think is just a great shot blocker. I think that's the
thing she does better than anything. She's really been that all year long.
Somebody that can really change your shots around the basket and she's playing
much better offensively now, which gives them just another person that can
really score.  
  
Q. This Sunday there will be two Hoosiers on the floor together for the last
time in Skylar and Kelly Faris, and they both really elevated themselves to a
pretty exalted position in storied programs. And I wonder if you have any
thoughts on those two and what they've done and how they've represented their
schools?  
COACH McGRAW: I certainly have a lot of thoughts on Skylar. Miss basketball,
state champion in Indiana. To stay home has meant a lot to everybody in the
state of Indiana. Certainly up here in the community it's been amazing the
support that we've gotten.  
And I think people like the home‑ talent. They appreciate that kids stay close
to home. When we went to Indianapolis for the Final Four we got a huge crowd.
The entire state was cheering for us. So I think it's a bonus to have a player
like that stay close to home and help us grow our fan base and create more
interest in the women's game. And to be Player of the Year candidate the past
couple of years, Player of the Year in the Big East, it's just brought even
more notoriety to women's basketball and certainly to the state of Indiana.  
Kelly Faris has had a fantastic career at UConn, and she's had tremendous
success there, and I'm sure that they will miss her next year.  
  
Q. Do you have a favorite Skylar story?  
COACH McGRAW: No, I don't think I have one. I just enjoy her so much, the way
she pops in the office every day and staff meetings, sits down and asks what
we're working on. I think she's just been so involved in what we're doing at
every level, that it's been really fun.  
She's a very different type of player in that she‑‑ I could see her being a
coach. I would really look at hiring her one day on my staff because she has
that kind of basketball IQ basketball. And I think we relate in a little
different way than with most players. And I've really enjoyed that.  
  
Q. It's just her sitting with you and the coaches?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah. Not for a long period of time. She pops in on the to the
training room, locker room, hey, what are we doing today? And five minutes.
It's not a long time, but it's just interesting.  
  
Q. Going back to the idea of playing them for the fourth time. Two years ago
when you were on the other end, you said, quote, it's difficult; I hope to
beat a team four times. I'm assuming that you're hoping you're wrong at this
point?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it's tough to beat a team three times. It's tough to beat
a team two times. And the battles we have had this year have gone back and
forth and down to the wire. Every one of them. So we've really done some
really great things at the end of the game to win the game. We've made some
huge plays. When you look back at every game, whether it was a defensive stop
or a huge basket or something good, we've been able to make something happen
at the end.  
So we would certainly hope that the karma continues.  
  
Q. You faced Geno's teams many times. Is there a common thread or trademark
that you think all the teams have in common and also can you talk a little bit
about the rivalry, is there a rivalry between you and he?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, all his teams are really talented. I mean, they get great
players. They've had No. 1 player, they've got Lewis and then Stewart, best
player in the country.  
So they've always had great talent. He's a very good coach offensively. I
think the way their team moves and the style of game they play I think really
fits what he has. He tinkers with it year to year based on what he has. I
think they're really strong defensively. They're a very good defensive team.
They rebound. They do everything really well. He's a really good coach.  
I don't know that there's any trademark, except that they're really talented
and very well coached.  
And do you see, do you have a competitiveness between the two of you?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we're both competitive. I think it's been quite a
rivalry. In the last few years, I think it's gotten even more competitive.  
  
Q. Going back to when the bracket came out, it couldn't have come out as too
much of a surprise where teams were seeded, did you think: Couldn't we at
least be in opposite brackets so we don't make it to the championship game, or
is it you play them when you get to them?  
COACH McGRAW: I do think that. I thought the way the bracket was set up, it
was interesting to see we have to play Duke who was the next No. 1 seed, I
thought, the highest No. 2 seed.  
So I was curious as to how we ended up playing Duke and yet in the top four
lines they said, oh, you're the 2 and they're the 3 so you have to play. So it
didn't work that way the rest of the way through.  
So I was hoping that it would be a championship meeting as opposed to the
semifinal, we've played them three years in a row now and it would be nice to
play somebody else.  
  
Q. Also being familiar with Louisville. What did it take for Louisville to
beat Daly?  
COACH McGRAW: Unbelievable. That was just a remarkable offensive performance
by their team the way they shot the 3. And that was the only way they had to
win. That was their chance. They were much smaller.  
They spread the floor and shoot 3s. And they made them and set the NCAA state
record, and that was about the only way they could have won that game. And it
was a masterful plan.  
Defensively they did a really great job. And a lot of pressure on the No. 1
seed when it gets down to late in the game, if you can stay in the game with
them, it was difficult for them to come back from all that, and they had all
that energy to come back in the game and then Louisville makes it by making
two free throws from one of their seniors who had a great career for them.  
So what a great finish. And I think a great thing for the game to see a team
that didn't think they could be beat to get beaten and have some new teams in
the Final Four.  
  
Q. Realize some conferences are changing but what are your thoughts on
seeing three Big East teams this year in the Final Four? Is it surprise?
Delight? Pride? Annoyance?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled for the Big East. I think it
proves we were the best conference. I don't think that there was any question
when you have two No. 1 seeds coming out of the same conference but to see
Louisville join us in the Final Four I think shows what depth and strength we
had in the Big East.  
And it's a little sad to think that next year we'll be gone, the year after
Louisville be gone. A shame it has to end but a way to go out. And we're very,
very happy and take a lot of pride in that.  
  
Q. Two questions about Skylar: Was there ever a moment when you realized how
much of a difference ‑maker she could be for the program? And have you noticed
a change in her intensity, her sense of urgency in this tournament compared
even relative to the last few tournaments she's been in?  
COACH McGRAW: I think I noticed her arrival on the national scene starting in
the Big East tournament her sophomore year and continued through the NCAA
tournament in the game where we beat Oklahoma and then Tennessee to advance to
the Final Four. I think that was the moment that she really stood out and
became the iconic symbol of our team and what she's done for the game of
basketball, I think she started to really understand her position and what she
could do, what she was capable of.  
And I think the last two games she has been unbelievable. I think she always
has a sense of urgency a drive to win but the way she's playing, she's managed
to somehow relax and play and have fun and at the same time have the
tremendous drive and sense of urgency. So she's in a really great place right
now.  
  
Q. I think when somebody becomes for lack of a better word the "it" girl in
a sport, it sort of chooses them. It's not like Skylar's just chosen to be the
center of attention; it shows her. She's a great player. But she has all this
charisma, all these other things. Can you tell us how she's handled that,
because seems like she has wonderful relationships with her teammates, it
hasn't caused any chemistry problems. But that's a lot to put on somebody
besides just playing basketball, to be really one of the faces of her sport at
a young age?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it's a tremendous burden to be placed on a player at
that age. And somehow she has embraced it. I think she talked to Ruth Riley
years ago, like after her freshman year, maybe, when just about what it's like
to be the one that everybody's talking about. And Skylar's in a completely
different generation now with social media and how that has blown up to her
Twitter account numbers.  
But I've been so impressed with the way she handled it. But I haven't really
been surprised because when she was going into ninth grade, I sat her in my
office and offered her a scholarship and she was so poised and mature at that
point, I thought this girl is just going to be special, and she really has
done unbelievable things, I think, for the women's game.  
  
Q. What are the ways you think she's most improved this season and how has
she most impressed you with the way she's developed her game?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think she has become a very confident scorer and
somebody who has welcomed the opportunity to be one of the leading scorers on
our team. I think last year she was in a little bit of a, not a back‑up role,
but certainly with Natalie Novosel and Skylar, they were going to be probably
the top two scorers.  
So I think she's worked hard to get this opportunity. I think her jumper, I'm
surprised when she misses. She has worked on her shot so much and the
mid‑range game I think is her specialty.  
So I think that's the thing she's improved the most.  
  
Q. The end of the first half when you guys were struggling and Skylar hit
those three 3s it seems as many times she carried the game it seems like that
was the best example ever, because you could have been in real trouble without
that happening.  
The second general question is, yes, Cal is new to the Final Four but
Louisville has been there fairly recently. Why does it seem like all the
players still wind up going to the same schools?  
COACH McGRAW: The first question, we were in serious trouble in the first half
against Duke. We were really struggling to find our rhythm offensively and
couldn't make shots, which we're normally pretty good at.  
I thought Skylar hitting those three 3s gave the whole team a sigh of relief
that the pressure was off them and Skylar was going to carry us for a couple
of minutes until they got their shot back.  
So that was huge. I think that was something that we absolutely needed. She
knew it. Similar to the game at UConn when she hit the back‑to‑back 3s, but
that was just so key in our comeback.  
And then the other question, I think that players look to‑‑ everybody wants to
win a championship. And I think they want to go to the school they think has
the most opportunity, and a lot of players now are looking at what other kids
are doing in their class, which for us in our recruiting, we want kids to have
the confidence to come in and know that they're going to be able to compete
for a national championship.  
And they don't have to bring in other players with them. But it seems as
though Duke and Connecticut, Tennessee, they still seem to attract the best
players.  
And I think when we get a little more parity in the high school game, I think
that maybe you'll see more parity in the college game, because the top players
won't always be looking to go to the top five schools.  
  
Q. When you have a rivalry that's gotten as intense as Notre Dame and UConn,
how much of a plus can that be for the game as a whole? Does any sport need to
have a rivalry just like this one?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think they do. You've got the Yankees and the Red Sox,
and I think there's always big games that attract the casual fan to the game.
And so I think that's what we're doing for women's basketball.  
I think it is the most heated rivalry in women basketball and it's a game that
everybody enjoys watching. And we enjoy playing. I think it's a fun game. And
you know it's going to be a battle. It's going to be a war. So I think that
makes it even more fun to watch.  
  
Q. What is the advantage of having been here the past two seasons, the team,
knowing what they're going to go through and that sort of thing, and also is
there any added weight just because they've been there twice and not achieved
their goal?  
COACH McGRAW: I think that going in knowing what to expect is good because
you're prepared for, you can prepare the freshmen for it.  
I think it gets to be a little more of‑‑ I'm not sure what the word is. It's
not quite as fresh and as fun to be stuck in for five hours of interviews and
so many other things that because you always want to get out and enjoy it. You
don't really have that chance to really spend the time with your team in New
Orleans, because you're always doing something else.  
So I think we're going to have some fun on our own, I'm sure. But I think we
do have at least a lot of experienced players that know what the grind of
going through all the media work is going to be and all the practices and the
open practice and I think they'll be able to focus better because they know
what to expect.  
  
Q. Is there any added weight to it just because they've been there before
and haven't achieved the goal?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, so I think I answered that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Lindsay Gottlieb and we'll start off with an
opening statement.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I'm thrilled to be on a call like this. I have a group of
young women in our locker room that I absolutely knew that they were capable
of playing at an elite level and had the ability to make a Final Four, and yet
this is still better than any of our wildest dreams.  
We're enjoying every moment. I'm excited about going to New Orleans and having
a larger audience and the national media experience. These Cal Bears, they're
special young women who have come together and become a pretty darned good
basketball team.  
So we're focused on winning two games and at the same time want to enjoy the
experience. Looking forward to the whole thing, and happy to answer any
questions you have.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Was there a moment this year that you thought this team had the ability
to get to the Final Four? I mean, even in the beginning of the year, you spoke
that you thought this would be a very good team. But I wonder if there were
points or a certain point during the year where you really thought this was
possible.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think if I had to point to one moment, it was beating
Stanford. Everything we did with our scheduling and our mentality and our team
meetings this year were to prepare us for what I called kind of being elite
and having a shot at being at a Final Four. When we lost at Duke earlier in
the year, I said this is the type of game we scheduled on purpose so we can
win against a top 5, 6 team when we need to.  
But there's a difference in feeling like you can do it and believing you can
do it and absolutely knowing you can, and I think winning at Maples the kids
can look at each other and say we know we can do this. I think that was the
biggest moment of saying we belong in this company and we have to keep getting
it done.  
  
Q. Two questions for you. Just about the fact that this matchup is between
two teams, I think a lot of people maybe didn't necessarily think we were
going to be there. You guys were a No. 2 seed but you hadn't been there
before. And Louisville having to get through both Baylor and Tennessee.
Talking to Jeff Walz last night, he said this is so good for women's
basketball to have these unexpected teams. I wonder if you could talk about
that and then specifically maybe talk about the fact that your team has been
so dominant on the boards, that that's been such a big factor for you guys,
and how do you explain why you have such a good rebounding bunch.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I'll take the first one first. Cal‑Louisville is sort of the
undercard in this Final Four. There's no question UConn and Notre Dame are the
heavy hitters in terms of name recognition and having been here before. But I
think it sets up pretty well that you have two exciting teams with coaches who
are obviously passionate and care about women's basketball and believe in
their teams, and I think it's a neat matchup for the country to see there's no
question that maybe people didn't have Louisville in their bracket ahead of
time, but that they're arguably the hottest team in the country having beaten
Baylor and Tennessee in two amazing performances.  
And I think we're also a team that people don't know a ton about, but we're
exciting to watch. So I agree it's good for women's basketball. It just puts
different players in programs on the national radar, and I think it speaks
that there is a growing depth of talent across the country.  
So really, really excited for the matchup and happy for Jeff and his team and
we're just excited to be there.  
In terms of our rebounding, we have a group of kids that are so aggressive and
relentless on the boards. People ask me do we do rebounding drills, and we
really don't.  
I can't take credit for their natural abilities. What I can say I've tried to
do is empower them to embrace that as a huge strength of ours, that it
matters. We talk about it before every game. I don't say, Let's go rebound; I
say, Rebound like only Cal can. Dominate the boards.  
It's more we believe in its importance and I encourage them to do what they
do. But it's a group that collectively really is aggressive and relentless and
works hard on the boards. And we have a number of kids who go to the boards.
We can't just focus on one‑‑ boxing on one player.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about ‑‑ take me through Tierra Rogers'
place with this team and how she relates to her teammates and how her
teammates relate to her, because I know she stayed on the roster, she stayed
on scholarship. I know she's still with you guys a fair amount from a
day‑to‑day basis. But what's been kind of Tierra's role?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: For those who don't know, Tierra Rogers was a tremendous high
school player in San Francisco. Her father was tragically murdered at halftime
of one of her games when she was a junior. She then struggled with maybe
giving up basketball, but stuck with it, came to Cal, and beginning of her
freshman year collapsed at a workout and was diagnosed with a genetic heart
disease that would keep her from ever playing basketball again. She has a
pacemaker.  
There were struggles that came with that in terms of do I continue to do this,
do I stay at Cal. And Joanne Boyle was right by her side from the beginning,
said, You're going to have a scholarship for as long as you need to graduate
and we're going to be your family still.  
And I just took over from that point with the same mentality as Joanne. One of
my first calls when I got the job was to say, Tierra, you're still with us.
She's a huge part of the team.  
What I've said before is there's not a player in California women's basketball
history who has had as much history on a program that's without putting on a
jersey or scoring a point.  
She's a friend to our players. She's a mentor. She is a source of inspiration.
She's just normal around them. Just her teammate. But I think they all see her
as a symbol of you take advantage of every day. You play hard and for each
other every day. You might have things happen to you in life that you can't
control, but you find a way to turn that around and make it positive.  
So it's a pretty special story. She's on track to graduate. She's with us all
the time. And I think we all appreciate the courage it takes to do that
because there were times at which the sight of a basketball court I think made
her really sad.  
She's been very open that it's not easy all the time. She goes through moments
of depression and things like that.  
But she's all for this team. And she said to me at a practice earlier in the
year, just sitting and she was on the side and she said: Coach, this team is
special. And I said I know, T. And we didn't really have to say much more.  
She's a huge part of everything and glad that more people will be able to hear
her story through this run.  
  
Q. Mini scouting report on Louisville and your strengths and weaknesses as
opposed to areas where you think they'll give you the most trouble?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think obviously they've been scoring and shooting the
basketball at a ridiculously high rate these last couple of games. I think
they like to get out in transition. Tremendous guard play led by Shoni, but
her sister Jude is playing really well, and Bria Smith's a terrific player. I
think that their offense starts from these kind of disruptive defenses that
they play. They mix it up a lot from zone to man to kind of what we would call
junk defenses, triangle and two, things like that. So they're very balanced.
They're very uptempo and they try to make you make mistakes.  
In terms of how we match up, I think it's going to be a fast‑paced game. I
think both teams want to get up and down. Like with everybody, we try to take
advantage of our depth and athleticism inside and push the pace with our guard
play, Brittany and Layshia.  
I think it's going to be a really fun matchup, and we'll have to make sure
we're ready to handle their pressure and multiple defenses.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you, do you think that with reaching this level you're
going to have to shoot a little better than you have earlier in the
tournament? I'm referring to how you started off against the last game
shooting 1 for 18. Is that worrisome to you?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I don't think it's in any coach's game plan to start 1
for 18. I think every coach feels better when the ball's going in the basket.  
So, yeah, I do think we want to get high‑percentage shots and we want to knock
them down. And at the same time I think how we are all year is we say if the
shot doesn't go in, we need to get the offensive board or we need to be moving
the ball to make sure we get the best available shot.  
I think what I tell our players is not, hey, we have to make more shots. I
talk about where we're attacking from, are we getting the right looks, are we
focusing when we finish, that kind of thing.  
But absolutely we understand. I thought it was key in the Georgia game that
when we were shooting so poorly, we continued to get stops. I mean, we easily
could have been down 15, but we were down 6 because we were getting stops. We
talk about defense being in attack mode on offense.  
And when we're knocking down shots, we're obviously better all the way around.  
  
Q. How key will Layshia's offense be in slowing down Louisville's offense,
basically giving you guys a chance to get back up on defense and presenting
them from being in that transition mode? And also have you ever played ‑‑ had
a game in New Orleans either as a player or as a coach?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: First off, I think if we're scoring collectively, that helps
to slow down their transition. So I think you make a great point that half of
slowing down a good transition team is making baskets.  
And especially not turning the ball over on live ball turnovers. So in terms
of us wanting to score efficiently. That offense starts with Layshia. She's a
terrific guard.  
I think she's an All‑American guard who has risen on the biggest stages. So we
pride ourselves on being a balanced team. We certainly spread the ball around.
But I think Layshia getting off to a good start, Layshia knocking down shots
will help us collectively and will show down the transition, as will all of
our baskets.  
New Orleans, I have not played there that I can recall as a player or coach.
We played at LSU when I was an assistant at the University of Richmond. But
that's the closest to New Orleans I've gotten. But I did attend the Final Four
as a coach when it was in New Orleans. What was that? Maybe eight years ago or
so?  
  
Q. Curious about your thoughts on being the sort of outsider and that the
other three teams from the Big East ‑‑ I think you're familiar with at least
that region of the country and probably familiar with the conference. Do you
like the idea that you're playing teams that you don't see all year unlike the
other ‑‑ at least two of the other ones?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think it's really cool to be the West Coast
representative. The number of text messages and tweets I've gotten from
coaching friends, not only in the Pac‑12 but across the West Coast, I think
there's an additional sense of pride in that. We have ‑‑ everyone on our
roster, except for one woman who's from Israel, everyone's from the state of
California. It's kind of cool to be like, hey‑‑ it's a great chance to
represent for our state, for the West Coast.  
I think it's added fun to it. I do think it's exciting to be playing teams
that don't see us on a regular basis, and everyone's going to watch film on
each other and coaches are going to do their homework.  
But I think it's different when you're live. I talked to our players in
motivating them about, hey, let's be better than they ever thought we could be
on film, live. Interesting dynamic. I grew up on the East Coast. I'm so
respectful of the Big East and the quality of basketball that goes on. But
particularly of these three teams.  
But I think it is a neat dynamic to be the outsiders, to be the West Coast
kids, and we're going to do the best to represent ourselves but also this side
of the country.  
  
Q. Geno said sarcastically he was congratulating the presidents of the Big
East for breaking up the greatest basketball conference that's ever existed.
What are your thoughts on that comment?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's obviously very timely that all of this conference
realignment stuff going on, particularly sort of the demise of the old Big
East is happening right at the time when there's so many positive things
happening. I believe two of the men's team are from the Big East. And three of
the women's teams.  
So I think it's Geno being Geno, making a timely funny quip, but I think it's
just the way it is right now with conference alignment, realignment. And it's
unfortunate, just because growing up on the East Coast I would watch those
games and the rivalries.  
My first coaching job was at Syracuse. But obviously for this weekend we're
focused on just trying to take care of our business and being the best version
of Cal that we can, and if that shed some light on the West Coast, that's just
an additional bonus.  
  
Q. Two additional questions. The first is I know Joanne Boyle is one of
them, but can you sort of talk about your coaching mentors and how you took
things from them to develop your own head coaching philosophy? And then,
second, Cal has had a lot of success recently with other women's athletics,
swimming and volleyball, softball. How much is there sort of a contagious
sense when you have that success in women's athletics, maybe the athletes
being friends with other teams that maybe helped your team?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Great questions. First, in terms of I would say my influences
on how I coach and how I approach life, there's no question it was my parents.  
My mom passed away when I was in college, but my dad is coming down to New
Orleans. And I think what they did is say: Do what you're passionate about. I
think there was a feeling in our household that whatever you take on you
should do it at a really high level, but no pressure to do anything in
particular.  
I think a lot has been written of the family of lawyers and was there pressure
to do that. They just really instilled in us this idea of be really good at
what you do, but if you choose something that you love, you're more likely to
be good at it.  
In coaching, absolutely Joanne Boyle hired me as a 24‑year‑old. I needed a
note to rent a car when I went out recruiting because I wasn't 25. And it was
her first head coaching job. She'd been a long‑time assistant at Duke. Took
the Richmond job. Brought me along‑‑ I had been at Syracuse and New Hampshire
‑‑ and said, Let's do this together.  
I think there's a lot of different ways to be successful in coaching, but for
me that was the best path because it was as close as you could be to running
your own program without it. She kind of let me in on all the decisions in how
you run a program.  
So I can't be more appreciative to her of everything that I learned and also
just the ability to form my own philosophies and be the coach that I am.  
I read a ton, from political things to philosophical things to coaching books.
And I watch‑‑ I watch press conferences. I watch how people respond to their
players.  
I can tell you moments when I've paused the TV and rewound it and said, Look
at how that coach kind of interacted with their player.  
And in doing that, I take it all in and learn from people. But I feel strongly
that you need to be true to yourself and take pieces of people and be your own
personality. I don't think I'd be very good if I was trying to be somebody
else. So it's like I read, watch, and listen and try and help that form what I
think is right for me.  
The second question about women's athletics at Cal, we have an unbelievable
athletic department. Our athletic director, Sandy Barbour, she supports all
the sports, but I think in particular empowers women to believe that it's
really important here and it's not just words, it's actions.  
She really wanted women's basketball to be good in addition to the other
sports. And I completely feel like there's a camaraderie. I'll give you one
quick example. Teri McKeever is our women's swimming coach. She was the
Olympic coach this past summer, the first ever female coach of the United
States Swimming Team. My office sits right over the pool, so I can listen to
her from outside. Well, she came to me right before they were going to
Nationals about two weeks ago and said: Would you speak to my team.  
I speak a lot in front of people. I don't get nervous. I was sweating bullets
to talk to these swimmers, these people with Olympic medals in that room. I
said: You want me to talk to your team? So I gave them a signed basketball,
they sent me pictures from Nationals of their girls with signs up of things
I've said to them. And they send me e‑mails saying: Good luck.  
I'm close with some of the softball players through Twitter and stuff,
interact with them.  
So it's a great environment here, and I think our athletes see other
successful female athletes. And I think people respect that we're different in
terms of our personality and style but that we all are representative of Cal
and do things at a high level.  
  
Q. I was wondering if there was anything wrong with Gennifer Brandon in your
game against Georgia. You took her out most of the second half in overtime.
You're leaving a lot of rebounds on the sidelines by doing that. What was your
thinking in that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't know how many rebounds we left because Reshanda Gray
got eight offensive rebounds in that game. Gen had a tough one, struggled to
get going early, was all over the boards, got good looks and missed some early
and never got in a rhythm.  
She's fine, but because of our depth in the post, you know, I'd certainly‑‑
you ride with your top players, but didn't see her getting into a rhythm. So
we gave some minutes to Reshanda who, by the way, would be starting on almost
every other team in the country. So we didn't feel it was a negative thing.  
I talked to Gen after and I said, Hey, shake it off. Your teammates had your
back in this one. We're going to the Final Four, and I have no doubt when you
step on the floor on Sunday you're going to be the best version of Gen we've
ever seen.  
I'm not worried about her. I'm thankful we had depth in the post. Talia had a
tremendous second half also. And we'll get Gen going in New Orleans.  
  
Q. Wonder if you had any scouting reports with Sandy on where to eat in New
Orleans and all the great haunts here.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I got a nice congratulatory text from Lisa Stockton, the
Tulane coach, and I said, Thank you. And she wrote back, and she said, Sandy
has to be your official tour guide. I said, We've already given her that job.  
Haven't talked to her directly about that. We've been talking about some other
important things.  
But there's no question that this team is excited. Our players have been
talking about beignets for weeks now. And I don't know if you saw the
television interview, but LaChina Robinson asked, Layshia, what are you most
excited for, and Layshia screamed: Beignets. I think we have to make a team
stop at Cafe du Monde for sure.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could talk about the intriguing matchups.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's going to be some really fun guard play. People
say almost cliche that the guard play is the most important thing in March and
April, and obviously Shoni is one of the most dynamic, fun‑to‑watch players in
our game.  
Jude has played great. Bria Smith. And I think we have some guards that people
are going to fall in love with when they see them. Like I mentioned about
Layshia, people asked me about the difference between us this year from last
year. Last year I thought we were really good, but this year we're kind of at
this next level. And there's no question that Layshia had an All‑American
season to get us there.  
The kid is dynamic. She's got the best mid range in the country. She can get
to the rim and shoot the 3 as well.  
When the country sees Brittany Boyd and the pace she plays, she's really fun,
she's good for basketball. She's flashy. She's tough. Quick with the ball.
She's a great passer. I think you have her on the court at the same time with
Shoni and there's going to be a lot of pictures taken. And Afure Jemerigbe has
been playing great for us. She made some huge plays in the win over Georgia.
And we bring a kid named Eliza Pierre off the bench who on‑ball defenses ‑‑
she makes it an art form.  
I think the matchups are going to be really fun. I think the team that gets
out in transition more and is able to exploit that is going to have an
advantage. So obviously we want to try and slow them down and take away open
looks, and I'm sure Jeff will be saying the same about us.  
  
Q. Being a part of the first other than Stanford to get to the Final Four,
what does it mean to the program right now?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's beyond words. I think that this is something that
I knew these players were capable of and we've kind of all dreamed about. But
the reality is better than that.  
There's a lot of good basketball on the West Coast, and Stanford has kind of
carried the banner for so long and consistency of excellence is amazing. But I
think it's good to have another team and different faces and different style
of play out there.  
When I took the job at Cal, I was very vocal about I loved this place, but I'm
not just happy to be here. I think the time is right in women's basketball for
there to be another team in the mix of the elite, especially one on the West
Coast that's not named Stanford. And I thought the things were in place at Cal
to do that.  
And the fact that it has happened and hopefully we can continue to make it
happen, it's huge.  
  
Q. Talk about the contribution of Layshia to get these wins this season.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't know if there's a player that does more for their
team. And we're very balanced and we pride ourselves on that balance and
versatility. But this young woman has taken on a lot and come through in every
moment. And sometimes that's hitting the big shot, but sometimes it's just
having the ball in her hands and making a good decision. Sometimes it's a
defensive stop.  
I can go back to the preseason when we were in that locker room at Notre Dame
last year and we lost a tough game to a No. 1 seed and we had everyone coming
back, and I said, I want to be good next year not simply because we don't lose
anybody but because everyone in this room is even better than they were.  
And Layshia's the hardest worker we've been around. But in addition to doing
her own thing, she brought Brittany Boyd under her wing and said, Hey, we're
going to work out today. We're going to get you to a whole other level. I
think that type of leadership, not just with Brittany but the whole team, has
carried through.  
We have a number of terrific personalities on the team and a fun‑loving group.
But Layshia has been the quiet, steady leader who has helped to take us to
another level.  
  
Q. You were talking earlier about watching other coaches and how they go
about things, how they interact with their players. I'm curious kind of
watching Jeff in that sense, what stands out to you about his style, fairly
unique kind of full ‑throated guy?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Totally. Jeff and I used to talk when I was an assistant at
Richmond and he was an assistant at Maryland. We would talk about scheduling,
phone calls, and things like that.  
So he's been someone I've been friendly with for years. It's really fun to see
him do his thing. When another kind of sort of same‑generation young coach
gets a coaching job, you watch to see how they handle everything. He
seamlessly transitioned from being sort of the right‑hand man at Maryland to
running his own program.  
You can tell he's comfortable doing it his way. People have joked that he's
the mad scientist with game plans. And I think the main thing you can say
about him is he gets his players to believe in him and believe in what they're
doing. You get the feeling if he said, Hey, our game plan is going to be we're
going to fly in from the moon and run around in circles, they would do it for
him. And that speaks a lot to his personality and what he gets out of his
players.  
So just excited for him and the way that he does things, and hopefully it will
be a great matchup on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Geno Auriemma. Opening remarks, please.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the committee did a terrific job this year each and
every year, especially recently, we're getting a lot more parity in the
tournament, a lot more excitement in the tournament.  
And I'm sure you appreciate a lot less coaches complaining about their region.
I want to say thank you on behalf of all of us coaches, and it's the most
important time of the year for these players. It's what they work for for 12
months out of the year and coaching staff's put a lot of time and effort into
this, and this is our reward. And I want to thank you and the committee for
making all this possible for us.  
As far as our team, we've played really, really well since the NCAA Tournament
started. The Idaho game carried it right on through. And we beat four really
good teams and the last two in the regionals, I couldn't imagine that we could
play any better. Getting great contributions from a lot of different people.
This is where we'd hoped we'd be when we started practice in October. It's a
familiar place for us, fortunately. Familiar opponent, unfortunately.  
I know starting today when we begin our preparation, this team is focused on
one thing and one thing only. And that's putting ourselves in a position to
win a national championship. And I know we're all anxious to get started.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, despite all that Kelly has done and all that she is in your
program, we still call her underrated. Is she the most underrated great player
you've ever had? And Sunday she's going to go against Skylar Diggins for the
15th time. It's two Hoosiers who have become elite players in storied
programs. I wonder if you have any thoughts on how they've represented
themselves and their programs.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think Kelly is for sure, or has been, I should say,
one of the more underrated players, both in our program and nationally.
Underrated in terms of what the expectation level is of what a Connecticut
player is supposed to look like and people view scoring or stats as a way of
measuring how good someone is.  
In the last four years for us, she's been invaluable, starting with her first
game of her freshman year. There's no one I would want to represent us in
everything that she does, more than Kelly. I think she is what Connecticut
basketball is all about. Just show up every day, practice hard, play hard,
compete for a national championship and not worry about whether you get any
credit or not.  
As far as the rivalry with Skylar Diggins, it's been great for them for four
years in high school and now four years in college. I don't know what the
record is against each other. It might be 7 and 7, it might be 8 and 7 or 7
and 8, I have no idea. But I do know that there's a tremendous amount of
respect there.  
I know Kelly has a lot of respect for Skylar and what she's done. And I think
the two of them have represented the state of Indiana like you think they
would.  
The state has a tremendous reputation for hard‑nosed basketball players. They
certainly have done the state proud. And I'm not surprised, and I don't think
the people in Indiana are surprised either.  
  
Q. It is 7 and 7.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's appropriate since this will be the last time they'll be
playing against each other. It's been a heck of a rivalry, I think
individually maybe less so than team‑wise. But Skylar's gotten a lot more
attention and certainly a lot more accolades for what she's done for Notre
Dame.  
But I don't think Kelly would trade her national championship for anything in
the world.  
  
Q. I don't know if anybody pointed out to you but New Orleans is the first
city to host three Final Fours and your team has been in three of them.
Wondered what you thought about the significance of that and what does it say
about the consistency of your program? And also you got a couple new bosses
with local connections in Warde Manuel and Debbie. How have they been to work
with this past year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're right about the three Final Fours in New Orleans. And
we're 1 and 1 the first time we came down here in 1991. We're like Louisville
is this year or Cal. No one expected us to be there, but we came down there
and we enjoyed every minute of it.  
And when we came down in 2004, I think everyone expected us to win a national
championship, and we did. As far as the city's concerned, I love it. I've been
down there a bunch of times. I enjoy the people. And certainly enjoy the
atmosphere and I'm looking forward to coming down there, and every time my
family's been down there, especially in 2004, I can assure you that my family,
after that championship game, really enjoyed the city.  
And Warde, everybody's heard about my new contract. That was contingent on us
getting to the Final Four. Warde being from New Orleans, there's a clause in
my contract that it was going to be ripped up if we didn't win and get him
back to his city.  
He's been absolutely fantastic for me personally, for our team, for our
athletic department, for our university. And Debbie, bringing Debbie up here
has been like a dream come true for me. I've never had an advocate for our
program in all the years I've been here that works as hard as Debbie does to
make sure that our basketball program is the best that it can be.  
So I'm really, really in great company and I'm really happy for them.  
  
Q. Moriah has been on the floor with Bria a fair number of times recently.
Can you talk about that dynamic and what her evolution might mean for you guys
in terms of getting a better result against Notre Dame?  
COACH AURIEMMA: One of the things we wanted to do a little differently after
the Big East Tournament was we wanted to get Bria off the ball a little more
and allow her to concentrate on scoring more so than she was earlier this
season. She's been in a bit of a slump. She struggled all year long with
injuries at first and then just not playing well enough and getting down on
herself a little bit.  
So the fact that Moriah is playing so well right now has allowed us to move
Bria and the two of them I think work great together. They really compliment
each other well. Defensively they were great last weekend. Offensively, they
were both super aggressive. It changes our team obviously when the two of them
are like that.  
It gives us a whole different look than when we have Caroline in there. So I
hope we accomplished our goal that when we saw, bring people off the bench the
game changes, and it certainly has this past weekend.  
  
Q. I know you've played Notre Dame quite a bit obviously, as you mentioned a
familiar opponent. And all the games have been close. I'm wondering, with all
your experience, to what degree do you worry about there being a mental edge
that Notre Dame has here or mental obstacle that your team has to overcome?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I do believe‑‑ I believe in that theory to a certain
extent. I know we have beaten them 12 times in a row. And I'm sure not all of
that was physical. I think some of that was that we had a decided mental
advantage when you know that you can beat someone, it certainly does give you
maybe more confidence and it certainly does give the other team more cause for
concern.  
And the fact that every game has been so close and every game's gone down to
the last, in some cases, last possession, it would be a really different
scenario if we had really, really played poorly and lost a lot and felt like
they're just too good and we don't have it right now.  
But the fact that every game has come down to the last minute means there's a
couple of things that we didn't do well. And there's a couple of things that I
need to impress upon my team over the next three or four days. And I think
come Sunday night, when that game starts, I hope‑‑ and I want to believe that
what's happened in the past is not going to be a factor.  
  
Q. Couple questions on Morgan Tuck. Obviously she had a bruised knee and
then she slipped on the ice. She did start in the triple overtime game against
Notre Dame and played 34 minutes ‑‑ didn't play, didn't start after that. Can
you just talk about the ups and downs for her season, typical ups and downs?
And also her sort of counterpart from this area, Jewell Lloyd has been a huge
contributor to Notre Dame. Can you talk about what you've seen of Jewell in
the three games you've played them.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, as far as Jewell is concerned, I think she's added
another dimension to Notre Dame's team. They lost two really quality starters
from last year, Natalie Novosel and Brittany Mallory.  
And being the center, I think Jewell Lloyd defensively has given them a lot.
Offensively has given them an awful lot. She's a great athlete. And she's
played really, really well in big moments for them.  
As far as Morgan's concerned, I thought the first month of our season, when we
were practicing, I thought Morgan Tuck was the best post player on our team.
She did everything right for an entire month. And her knee all of a sudden
became a real issue and she starting missing practice more and more and she
started to lose a little bit of her confidence and it's been an up‑and‑down
season.  
But I gotta tell you this NCAA Tournament, she's been terrific. And I trust
her. Her teammates trust her. I wouldn't hesitate to put Morgan out there
early and often on Sunday, and I think she's going to have a huge national
championship tournament.  
  
Q. Wondered if you could please address two things, first being the total
contrast in the size of the bracket with two teams that know each other as
well as any two Final Four teams in history. And, two, surprising to a lot of
people is that they are there and they don't know each other at all. And also
if you could address sort of the bittersweet nature of what a triumphant Final
Four this is for the Big East, with three teams, the Big East as we know it is
going away?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I was talking to Pat McKenna, our SID, maybe we ought to do
with the NFL and reseed the teams when they get to the Final Four so we
wouldn't have to play Notre Dame every year.  
But that would take away from the Cinderella nature. Cal's never been to the
Final Four. Louisville's, this is their second opportunity and both Jeff and
Lindsay have done a great job at their schools, and one of them is going to be
playing in the national championship. And that's something that I'm sure very,
very few people predicted that both of those schools would be in that position
that they're in right now.  
So that's just part of the NCAA tournament's beauty. And, yeah, on the other
side of the bracket you've got the complete opposite thing. And it's become a
great rivalry. It's become a game that people look forward to, and we
certainly have had some memorable games already this year and last year as
well.  
And we have three Big East teams in the Final Four and we have two on the
men's side. So we've got five of the eight Big East teams, five of the eight
national championship contenders are Big East schools.  
So I guess the shoutout should go out to all the presidents for having the
foresight to tear apart the greatest basketball conference that ever existed.  
But as basketball coaches, I'm sure Rick and Jim Boeheim and Muffet and Jeff.
And I feel we wouldn't want to be anywhere else. And we wish it didn't happen
but we have no control over it.  
But I guess it's a great swan song. If it's going to end, this is a great way
for it to end.  
  
Q. To follow up on the question about the mental aspect. Do you feel your
team is at a different place mentally than it was going into the Big East
championship game, and also could you update us on Stefanie Dolson?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Stefanie's‑‑ we haven't done anything obviously since Monday
night. And she's in great hands. Rosemary Ragle and our medical staff are
spending every waking moment that we can with her, and we're going to get
together this afternoon so I'll know a little bit more this afternoon. But
obviously she's not going to be 100percent come Sunday night.  
But I thought she was magnificent over the weekend. 21 rebounds on one leg
against those two teams is pretty amazing.  
So I'm hoping, keeping my fingers crossed, that we're going to be able to get
her best effort. But I'm not sure about that.  
As far as where we are: Yeah, that's one of the things we try to do here. We
try to separate the regular season, the end of the Big East tournament from
the NCAA's. And I've always thought that we've entered the NCAA tournament
certainly in the last 20 years with a different mindset than what we had at
the end of the season. This is a completely different animal. It's a
completely different atmosphere, and we approach it completely different than
we do our regular season.  
So physically we're not exactly where we want to be. But we haven't been all
year. Mentally, we're probably in a better place right now than we have been
at any time this season.  
  
Q. First off, I think a lot of people thought Notre Dame would be a good
team this year. I'm not sure anyone would have expected them to have the
season they did. Why do you think for that team things came together as they
did?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I remember‑‑ I remember when we went to the Final Four in
2002. And we won a national championship and we lost four starters. And Diana
Taurasi was the lone starter returning.  
And I don't know that anyone thought that we could win another national
championship but we did. And we did it on the strength of the best guard in
the country.  
And you can't underestimate what having the best guard in the country means.
And when you've got somebody like Skylar Diggins who can control every single
game and make her teammates better than anyone thought they could be, you have
what happened this year. And I think Muffet's done an incredible job of
guiding that team to where they are today.  
And Muffet by herself would not have been able to do it. And Skylar by herself
would not have been able to do it. And I think those two working together have
taken a team that most people thought would be really good to being a great
team. And they both should be commended for that.  
  
Q. Mark Cuban today, I'm not sure you saw this, today said he would consider
drafting Brittney Griner in the 2013 draft. He said she would obviously make
the team but he was thinking seriously about giving her a shot to do that. And
I wanted to get your reaction to Cuban's comments today.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, obviously Mark Cuban's a genius, because he's been able
to parlay some great ideas into billion‑dollar industries, and he's done a
great job as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and he's won an NBA
championship. And he's done a lot for basketball.  
His genius would take a huge hit if he drafted Brittney Griner. And if
Brittney Griner tries to make an NBA team, I think it would be a public
relations thing. I think it would be a sham.  
The fact that a woman could actually play right now in the NBA and compete
successfully against the level of play that they have is absolutely ludicrous.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could just talk about, what do you think is the trademark
of a team coached by Muffet McGraw, what do you see in that, and can you talk
a little bit about your relationship, is it a rivalry between you two?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, the trademark of Muffet's teams is they play well
together. They pass the ball exceptionally well. They play a real intelligent
brand of basketball. They're tough. They're tough kids. They get more than
their share of loose balls, 50/50 balls. They get more than their share of
free throws, because they attack the basket as well if not better than any
other team.  
So you watch them play, and all you can think of is they're really, really
good. They're sound in every area of the game.  
As far as our competition, Muffet and I, we play golf together a couple times.
And she gets all fired up about driving the ball further to me, which is a big
deal when your teeing off 50 yards in front of me.  
That goes to show you how competitive Muffet is. She's incredibly competitive.
But I think the competition between us is about Notre Dame versus Connecticut,
not necessarily about Muffet versus Geno. She doesn't have to prove anything
to me and I don't have to prove anything to her.  
  
Q. You mentioned a few minutes ago about the mental edge or possibly a
mental edge. But on the flip side there's also the law of averages. I think
two years ago when it was the opposite way, you had won three straight and
talk about you had never beaten a team four times in one year and didn't. How
much do you think is that a factor in this game, is that there's three games
where it's down to the last possession, how tough is it to beat a team like
that four times?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's difficult. I don't think it's undoable. I mean,
obviously it's difficult when you're talking about two teams that have played
games that were decided at the last seconds. But if you can do it three times,
you can do it four times.  
As I said, I don't know that what happens on Sunday is going to have‑‑ that's
going to be the result of the previous three. I think if we play exceptionally
well, we're going to beat them. If they play exceptionally well they're going
to beat us.  
And I don't know that the law of averages‑‑ obviously if we play each other
enough, it's going to turn. That's why it turned from where we were with them
before to where they are with us now.  
  
Q. Wondering about the big picture in terms of the Cinderella teams and
Griner and a stalwart like Stanford being out, is it good for women's college
basketball to have new faces out, or is it not a detriment to not have Griner,
the biggest star the game's had for a while?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, one of the things I talk about, when the NCAA tournament
starts with my team is, is the beauty of the NCAA tournament is that it's not
about which team is supposed to be there, which players are supposed to be
there.  
The NCAA tournament, the beauty of it is you have one night six times or
actually four times. You have one night four times to prove that you deserve
to be in the Final Four. And the team that proves it the best, they deserve to
be there. So just like in the years we've gotten beat, Baylor doesn't deserve
to be there. They didn't play well enough. Neither does Stanford. Neither does
any other team that lost. If we had lost or Louisville had lost we don't
deserve to be there.  
So that's the beauty of the NCAA tournament. The fact that you've got new
faces, I think it's great. I think we don't have a face that everyone knows
like Skylar Diggins or Brittney Griner or Elena Delle Donne or all the First
Team All‑Americans, Chiney Ogwumike, we, don't have anybody like that this
year. But I've been there with Diana or Maya Moore and all those people so I
know what it's like to have everyone focused on one individual or two
individuals, and this year I'm sure the focus on the Final Four is going to be
on Skylar Diggins.  
But I think because it's only one person a lot of people are going to get to
see some other really, really good players that people haven't talked about
this year.  
I mean it's just now that Shoni Schimmel and Jude Schimmel are coming into the
limelight. They've been great all year. And if you were in our league you
would know how hard they are to play against.  
The kids that Cal has because they haven't been on national television a lot,
people don't necessarily know who they are. Well, now, for a few days people
are going to be talking about those kids. And that might not be the case if
all the big names that everyone expected to be there were there taking up all
the attention.  
  
Q. You already talked about the Big East being the greatest conference in
college basketball, I guess both men and women, could you give us with your
familiarity with the league, what is Cal in for exactly? They would have to
beat two teams from your conference, you know all three obviously, to win. I
don't know if you would highlight differing styles between the way they play
and the way the Big East plays and kind of along those lines what are your
thoughts on that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I'm not sure‑‑ you mean what are the styles of our three
Big East teams and how they differ from‑‑  
  
Q. How hard is Cal ‑‑ given how good the Big East has proven to be now,
they're going to have to obviously beat Louisville and either you or Notre
Dame.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Okay. Well, that kind of cuts both ways. You know, if
Louisville wins, then it's going to be two Big East teams playing for the
national championship. Two teams that know each other, two coaches that know
each other. That presents its own challenges. If Cal wins and beats Louisville
and Cal is playing for the national championship against a Big East team,
sometimes what you don't know doesn't hurt you. If Cal wins, they're going
into a game against a Big East team saying, okay, so what. If they had played
a bunch of Big East teams before and knew, oh, boy, this is what we're up
against, sometimes that's worse.  
So I think the inner struggles in our conference, the way we beat each other
up all season long, thank God we don't play each other all of us twice, home
and home. We might not have any teams left to play in the NCAA tournament.  
But I do think we look forward to playing other teams from other conferences,
that's why traditionally we've done well in the NCAA tournament as a
conference.  
But I think for Cal it could go either way. They could be intimidated, which I
doubt, or they could show whoever wins our game with Notre Dame a side of a
team we've never seen before.  
So that's the beauty of it.  
  
Q. There's another story about what's acceptable in coaching today in
practice and that, where is the line in coaching behavior. I wonder if you
could briefly comment on how maybe difficult it is for people who don't coach
to understand where the line is between acceptable and not acceptable
practices.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know each coach has their own line that they think is the
acceptable line. And that maybe varies by how a coach perceives they need to
coach to get their team to be successful. And maybe some coaches are on that
line. Some coaches try to stay below that line. I can't speak for other
coaches for sure.  
And, believe me, I acted like an idiot at practice more times than I can ever,
ever recount. But some of the stuff that I saw, and I've got a friend of mine
whose son is on that staff, so obviously it's difficult for me thinking about
it, but if what I saw is accurate, and I would assume it is, there is no line
that could be drawn that would make that behavior acceptable.  
I don't know where you would draw the line that you could say, well, we were
on the line or below the line. From what I've seen, that behavior is the kind
of behavior my son played college basketball. I would not want any of my kids
or anybody be put in that situation ever.  
  
Q. We were talking a little bit about Louisville. You played Baylor this
year. Can you just tell me what it took for Louisville to beat them and what
you feel like they bring to the table against Cal.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know Jeff Walz is going to get a lot of requests at every
clinic this year to explain his defense against Brittney Griner. And I know
he's probably going to get some job offers. Thank God I signed my contract or
they might be looking to hire him. I know all that, if you had said before the
Baylor game, Jeff, you know something, you're going to make 16 3s tonight and
some of them they ought to give you five points because of where you're
shooting from, he would have told you you're crazy.  
So what happened in the Baylor game? It was a perfect storm. Louisville played
hard. They played aggressive. They were tough. They played the way Baylor
always plays. Baylor plays hard. They're aggressive. They're tough. And
Louisville played exactly the same way. And then they added to that just a
ridiculous shooting night that you just can't ever anticipate, and there's no
way that Baylor was, I guarantee you, there was no way that Baylor was
expecting anything remotely close to that.  
So that helped them in the Tennessee game because they came out with the same
level of confidence that they played against Baylor. And right now, let me
tell you something, those Schimmel twins‑‑ not twins‑‑ but those Schimmel
sisters, they might be the most exciting players in the country right now.  
And if I was Cal, I would say I don't know how we're going to stop them. And
that's just two of them. Right now that whole team is playing with an amazing
amount of confidence.  
  
Q. Geno, just to follow up on that last point you made about the Schimmel
sisters. I wonder if you could explain what you've seen from them that makes
them maybe the most exciting players in the country.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I watched the game. I saw pictures of them when they were
young. I couldn't quite listen because my grandson was running around. Where
do they live, Canada, Vancouver, someplace, I'm not exactly sure where they're
from, but they had their outfits on and they had some traditional Indian or
Native American clothes on. And I thought, man, to go from there, where if
there's a traditional recruiting area for coaches, and then to go to
Louisville, which is a great program, but not necessarily a traditional
national championship contender, or won a bunch of national championships,
that the road that those kids have traveled and where they are ‑‑ and no one
knows their story probably, but what they've done in the last week has had
everyone stand up and take notice of these two kids and the joy they play
with, the fearlessness that they play with. They love the game, and you can
tell they love the game. They're tough kids. They're fearless, obviously.  
Man, I gotta find my way to that spot, wherever it is. I don't know if you
have to take a helicopter in there or you need guides or something to get in
there, but I told Jeff Walz this morning I gotta get a couple of those players
for myself.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Kamiko Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25287)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  86  
Tennessee - 78

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're now joined by the Tennessee coach and
student‑athletes. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game.  
COACH WARLICK: Obviously disappointed for us, congratulations to Louisville.
But I want to talk about these two young ladies. These are our two seniors.
They're tremendous leaders for us this year.  
And they put their heart and soul in the whole year. And I just want to say on
behalf of staff and the Lady Vol program, we're extremely proud of both of you
and appreciate all you've done.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kamiko and Taber, would you both talk about obviously you guys got
yourself in a big deficit and trying to fight back, you almost made it. Did
you think you had a shot there?  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: Most definitely. Throughout the whole game we believed in
ourselves. The coaching staff tells you to go out there and fight. And we've
been in situations like that before.  
And we practice it in practice, with practice guys. Having drills where we get
stops. And that's what we tried to focus on was getting stops and convert on
the offensive end.  
TABER SPANI: This team never gives up. And we believed in each other. We just
put ourselves in too big of a deficit at the beginning and our defense wasn't
the way it's been the last few games. It let us down.  
  
Q. Both of you, could you just talk about this season. I know it's just
ended, but did it live up to your expectations? I know a lot of people
wouldn't have picked you to get this far when the season started.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I'm tremendously proud of my team and the coaching staff.
Everybody, like you said, counted us out. We were picked fifth to finish. We
finished first; unfortunately we didn't win the tournament.  
But we made it this far. Believed in each other. Our coaching staff believed
in us. And we just stuck together. It was a family. And we just bonded, and I
love that about my teammates and our coaching staff. And like I told them in
the locker room, I'll take this team over the past three teams I've been on,
because I've never seen so much fight in a group of girls.  
And I actually love that and appreciate that, because no matter what they
always had our back. We knew we could count on them.  
Unfortunately we fell short today. But we fought. I mean, that's all I could
ask for.  
TABER SPANI: Yeah, I just echo Kamiko. I can't say how proud I am of this team
and what we've accomplished. I think any Tennessee team, when you don't make a
Final Four‑‑ that's the great thing and the amazing thing about this program
is no matter what the transition was, no matter what it looked like, no matter
what excuse you might put out, if you're a young team or not, the bar is the
Final Four.  
And I think that's what makes this program special. So to come short of that
is disappointing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Where do you think this got away from you tonight? Obviously you dug such
a big hole there in the second half.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, you gotta get stops and rebounding. We didn't those
especially the first half. And can't give up ten offensive rebounds the first
half and we just dug ourselves in a hole. So we started battling a little too
late.  
  
Q. You were down 3 with four minutes left. What did you talk about the last
four minutes?  
COACH WARLICK: We just talked about just keep battling and keep fighting. And
we're down and then Taber gets a shot at a 3. And it's a good shot. It's a
good look. And it didn't go. And then we fouled and then they were up by five,
and so we just‑‑ we needed to make that 3 to get the momentum, and it just
didn't go down.  
But we talked a lot about not giving up. And that's been the mode of this team
this year. It's like Taber said, we thought we had a good year. But we didn't
have a great year.  
And that's just the nature of our program and our expectations, whether you're
Pat Summitt or myself, it's just what we're all about. It's in our blood. It's
in our makeup.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Louisville and what you see for them going forward?
Obviously they put together a good run.  
COACH WARLICK: They had just a heck of a tournament. You've gotta do something
right if you knock off Baylor, because Baylor's an unbelievable team. And so
to knock them off and then to come in here and play the way they did, they had
a great tournament. And we just‑‑ I think they'll be competitive. And I'm sure
they'll be ready to play in the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  88  
Tennessee - 76

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the victorious Louisville Cardinals. Coach,
opening comment.  
COACH WALZ: Wow. I'd first like to just congratulate Tennessee on a great
season. Holly's done a fantastic job with that group. They're very talented
players.  
We knew it was going to be a battle from start to finish. But we also knew we
had to come out and try to throw the first punch, which is what we've done.  
And I'm just so proud of the entire team. I think we played fearless the past
two games here, taking shots that probably most coaches wouldn't think are
good shots.  
They cut it to 3 and we're pushing the ball, throwing it over the top,
shooting layups and coming down the floor and shooting 3s. And it's a
remarkable group.  
It's an unbelievable story. I mean, it's really what it is. And we aren't
planning on it to end right now. To start the season, this was our goal. Our
goal was to get to the Final Four. And when we lose Asia Taylor, Tia Gibbs,
Shawnta' Dyer, and Monique Reid is playing on one leg, I never would have
dreamed that we would be able to do what we've done. But it's all a credit to
these players.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni and Jude, could you comment on what the coach was saying during the
season, losing the kids you did? At what point did you guys just say, look,
we'll have to make up for that, and was there a turning point in the season
where you felt like you were over those losses?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I don't think we dwelled on it very much because we knew had
to be healthy in order to come back in. Just like Mo came back and made her
comeback, and we just didn't necessarily‑‑ like, we knew they're hurt and we
wait for them, so we did what we could with the people that are available and
healthy. Now we just gotta get those other three healthy and be back next
year.  
For us to make it where we are right now, it's remarkable because nobody
thought we could do it.  
  
Q. Shoni, and actually all three of you, could you talk about what made you
believe when you couldn't get odds in Vegas.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think that starts with our coach. He believed in us so we
believed in him. So that's the mutual feelings you have towards each other,
you believe in us and we'll believe in you. And after watching the NC State
documentary, just put the fire in our eyes. And we were going out there to
win, and that's exactly what we did is beat Baylor and we beat Tennessee, and
now we're going to a Final Four.  
BRIA SMITH: To add on to what Shoni said, to have the coaches believe in us
and we have 100percent belief in them and the game plans that they write for
us. So it's just a great feeling to be where we are right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Jude, do you want to comment?  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: I think we've known all along we had everything we needed to
get to this point. But we owe a lot to each other and we owe a lot to our
coaches. Our coaches have been showing us a lot of inspirational things like
that documentary, the NC State one, and a couple of videos of Muhammad Ali. We
went and visited the Muhammad Ali Center. I think it just has a lot to do with
seeing all the underdog things like that, and it motivated us even more to
believe in each other and believe in ourselves.  
  
Q. Shoni, they cut it to 3 and at that point it seemed like they were
closing in on you and then you went in for that layup. Can you just talk about
how there's sort of a fearlessness that you approach the game with that you
right then almost ‑‑ that told them you're not going to catch up with us?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was definitely playing basketball. So to be honest with you
I didn't know we were up by 3. But for me to just go in there, I saw the lane
wide open, so I took it. And I knew the girl was going to come down on it. So
I had to just time it right, so I just went up. No doubt in my mind that I
wasn't going to make it.  
  
Q. The Final Four looks a little bit like it's going to get the Big East
Tournament. Were you pleased ‑‑ with an interloper from the West Coast thrown
in there. I know you haven't played Cal but you've played the other three
teams that made it through. Do you believe that having lost to them during the
regular season and in the tournament that you've got the ability now with the
momentum that you've got to go all the way?   
COACH WALZ: I'll make the comment on that. In'06 I believe Maryland, it was
the ACC Tournament in the Final Four, and we actually had to go through North
Carolina in the semis and then beat Duke in the finals. The five years I've
been there, that was the first time we'd beaten Duke. We hadn't beaten Duke in
five years. The first time we played them I think they beat us by 60. The
first year there. It kept going down, 60, to 50, to 38. And it was the first
time we'd beaten them.  
And I told our kids that today, as we sat there and watched UConn win last
night. Notre Dame comes through today with a big win. And I said why can't it
be us? I mean, why not?  
All it takes is one game. And that was our motto in the Baylor game. All it
takes is one. Just come out here and you gotta play the best.  
If we go 8 for 23 from the 3‑point line the other night, we aren't sitting
here right now. We figured out a way to go 16 and 24, 16 and 25. But we made
some big ones tonight.  
So we're just excited about the opportunity. I know we're going to have to
take on a very good Cal team. But, again, we're not worried about that right
now. We're going to enjoy this tonight. We're going to enjoy it tomorrow. And
we're going to enjoy it for the next few days, too. And we'll enjoy our Baylor
win, too.  
Life's too short. And I'm not going to sit here and tell these kids, okay,
tonight at 12:01 we've got to start preparing for the next game. We don't need
much time. We figured that out. We're out there defending, we're out there
playing, and we don't know what we're doing half the time. I've got some in
man and some in zone, and my whole coaching staff is saying: What are we
playing? And I go: I don't know. Who cares.  
But that's what our kids know. Our kids know we're just going to try to go out
there and be as unconventional as we can and have fun. And that's what we're
doing.  
  
Q. Coach, second Final Four. Does this in some way validate that one, not to
say that that was a fluke, but does that kind of announce to the rest of the
women's basketball that University of Louisville is a power?  
COACH WALZ: We're trying to put ourselves there. We're trying to put ourselves
there. I mean, our goal every year is to try to compete to get to the Final
Four.  
We've kind of figured out a way in our six years at Louisville that we are
normally playing our best basketball at the end of the year, because nobody
cares if you play great at the beginning of the year. It's how you play at the
end, because that's all that matters. It's March Madness. And it's crazy right
now.  
So we're thrilled. I believe we have a program, not just a team. And I think
we've proven that. But as I got, after our Baylor win, some e‑mails from
people telling how bad our kids were and how mean they were and dirty they
played‑‑ I had one guy send me a text this morning and it said: Go Tennessee,
so I texted him back and said: Go Vols. And what the heck? I'm sure some would
say we did something, like we shot it, we made too many, it wasn't right, the
ball had our name on it. They'll make up something.  
But I'm proud of every single one of them and I know we're getting a chance to
go play in the Final Four. And it's a memory these players will never forget.
You beat Baylor with arguably one of the best players to play in the game.
Everybody thought that was a fluke. And I promise you no one thought we'd win
tonight either except for this team. And we figured a way to pull it out.  
I'm not sure if we trailed the entire night. They may have scored the first
point. I don't know. But we just continue to fight and continue to fight.  
  
Q. Jude and Shoni, at what age do you guys remember, maybe as little kids,
that you might have first talked about playing in a Final Four together or had
that dream? If you guys could both talk about that. And what do you think this
means to your family and people back home?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: To be honest with you, I think we were talking about going to
different schools, because we watched the little Disney show where the sisters
play against each other, and so Jude was always like, I'm not going to the
same school as you. So for her to go to the same school as me and for her to
be here with me along with my other teammates, it's a great opportunity
because‑‑ I'm stuttering‑‑ acting like Jeff‑‑ no, but it's awesome to have her
right here by my side. But also my other teammates are right there, too.  
So, I mean, I remember her sitting there saying she didn't want to go to the
same school. But it was a blessing when she did.  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: She's lying. I tricked her. I was going to go to the school
they went to. It was a crazy feeling. The first time we talked about it was
when we were in middle school, we were young, watching the Disney channel.  
We owe a lot to where we came from, our family and our coaches and teammates,
but really it's just a blessing. And we're just‑‑ it just so happened we made
it to the same school, and I'm just thankful.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, in both of these games in this regional, your team came out right
away playing well, playing with a lot of poise and a lot of heart. It doesn't
look like this team gets very nervous before the game. Could you kind of
characterize how your team was before these games?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, I mean, with both games today, with both games this week,
nobody thought we could win. I mean, there's not anybody here that I think
still actually believes that we beat Baylor.  
So I told our players, we've got nothing to lose at all. So who cares? I made
the comment: We're going to play street ball. And I know it got misconstrued
by Kim. But what we were calling street ball is just we weren't running much
offense. We were just coming down the floor. We were going to drive and kick
and shoot 3s and have fun. That's what you do when you're playing on the
street.  
That's kind of what we did today, too. Tennessee is very good. They're long,
they're athletic, they're big. We couldn't get into a lot of offensive sets.  
So I just kept telling our kids go out there and play, have fun. If you get an
open 3, shoot it. I mean, Antonita Slaughter shot the one 3 from about half
court. And she thought it was a good shot.  
I just kept telling them, hey, you gotta shoot it. So I think because no one
believed that we could win, I just kept telling them we're playing with house
money, people. I mean, if we win, hey, it's one more to chalk up. If we lose,
everybody's going to say: I told you so. So who cares?  
And that's how they approached it. As the game kept going, both games, as the
game kept going our kids started getting more confidence and more confidence
and it didn't matter what the name across the front of the shirt was. They
just started believing in each other and they were just playing basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, I went back after I saw the 16 ‑25 3s to see what your 3‑point
shooting was like the rest of the season. And let's say it wasn't quite that.
Have you been like hiding this as a secret weapon for the postseason, or have
you got some special 3‑point training program that you've been kicking in over
the last week or so? Just where is this coming from?  
COACH WALZ: I mean, it's a great question. Antonita Slaughter, even though she
goes 1 for 6 at the 3‑point line tonight, she's been our best 3‑point shooter
the entire season. It was just back in February, the end of February she went
on about a five‑game stretch where, I think I said it the other night, she was
4 of 34 from the field.  
And finally started to make some shots against Middle Tennessee and Purdue.
She started getting a little confidence. Then she comes out against Baylor.  
But we hit some big, big shots. Shoni hits a big 3 in transition. Jude hits
that huge 3 in transition at the end.  
I mean, it's quite‑‑ Sara Hammond in the first half hits that 3. She started
to think she was Dirk Nowitzki. She wanted to stand on the 3‑point line. And I
said, Sara, please go post up once in a while. I told her at the timeout, I
said, Dirk, can you go try to post up for me.  
We keep it fun. It's enjoyable. Even games when we're getting our butt kicked
sometimes, I'm a big believer. And I always have been especially in games. I
love going to watch‑‑ we recruit, watch high school games, and you see a kid
go to the free‑throw line, they're down one, they miss the first. Coach says
come on, you gotta make it, you gotta make it. I tell our kids all the time
how many players go to the free‑throw line down 1, miss the first, and then
look at the Coach and say, hey, I think I'll miss again.  
Why put the extra pressure on them. So I kind of use the other philosophy. I
like to try to make them laugh. If they go up there, miss the first, I say, Do
you think you can miss two in a row? I want them to laugh. You gotta enjoy it.  
And that's kind of how we've done it. We're going into the Final Four the same
way. We're going out there, if we've got a 3, we're taking it.  
Everybody wants to talk about how we defend, like you guys did a great job
against Baylor, you stopped Griner. Yeah, we held her to 14, but we gave
Odyssey Sims 29. They average 81 points a game. They scored 81 points that
night. We just have to figure out a way to score 82.  
Offense is what's going to win us games in March. We scored 86 against a very
talented Tennessee basketball team that I don't know if anybody else has
scored 86 on them all year.  
And we did it in a regional final game when there's pressure on them. So I try
to take all the pressure off of them. And we're just going out and we're
having fun, and it's paying off for us.  
  
Q. That carefree approach to coaching in these high ‑pressure situations, is
that how you've always coached, or is that something that you developed over
time?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, I try to have fun. We do some odd things. We always
have. We'll start the game with some jump ball plays. We'll come out and trap
when no one's expecting you to trap. It's not how we are in practice.  
I mean, in practice I'm pretty tough on them. Because, like I told them with
about 2:20 to go and it got down to about 6, I said, I make practice miserable
for you all. So situations like this are nothing.  
And they're all going, You're right, you do, you do. And we handled it. And
that's my job. I mean, I'm not here‑‑ as I tell them, I'm not here to be their
best friend. If I have to be their best friend, it's really sad because they
have no friends. I go I'm going to push you, I'm going to be your coach, and
if you need something‑‑ they know to come ask me anytime. There's a situation
going on, I'll do anything I can to help them.  
But I want them to enjoy college, too. It's a job in a way, but when they
finish playing here, when Monique Reid finishes after our next loss, whenever
that might be‑‑ we only have two more opportunities to play‑‑ when somebody
asks about her career at Louisville, I'm pretty confident she'll say I loved
basketball, but I loved my college experience.  
And that's what it's about. You want to get them as well rounded as you can so
when they make that next step and they go out in the real world that they're
prepared for it.  
  
Q. We heard Jude and Shoni's description of how they ended up together.
Would you talk about how you might have envisioned them playing together on
this level?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, my assistant, Steph Norman behind you, we went out
and saw Jude play. Obviously Shoni was a year older. Shoni was the one that
got all the press, all the pub. But we both really liked how Jude competed.  
I mean, she was kind of a little bit everywhere. She's a pest. Get out there
and guard and knock down some shots. I think really you go back to our Baylor
game, and in the second half there's that loose ball with about four or five
minutes left. And it's going in the back court, and Odyssey Sims kind of went
after it and Jude came out of nowhere and cut right in front of her and gets
it.  
Those are the plays she always makes. Our Texas A&M game, first game of the
year, I think we were down 1, and with about 14seconds, sideline out of
bounds, they take it out and she steals the inbounds pass and goes down and
shoots a layup and we win the game.  
She's got very good basketball IQ. And she's really improved her understanding
of time and score. So I'm just really excited for both of them because they
both, I think, made a big jump to come to Louisville, to come so far away from
home. Because it's not the norm. And I think they both are excited about it,
because they've grown as people and grown as individuals, and hopefully when
they're finished up here, they'll be able to either go back home if they want,
go someplace else, but they will know that they can do it because they went
through a great experience here at Louisville.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH WALZ: Just like to first say how honored we are to be playing here
still. It was an unbelievable night for us last night, extremely proud of our
entire team, and we're excited about the new challenge in front of us.  
I'd like to just say thank you to the NCAA. I mean, it's been great because
we're sitting here in the same hotel with Tennessee, so we've just watched
film together. We've already played a pickup game in the backyard and on the
court. I mean, it's been a great setup. We shared breakfast, we broke bread.
It's been wonderful.  
So I just would like to say a thank you for the accommodations.  
  
Q. Monique and Shoni, if you guys could answer, Coach was talking about the
amazing night you had last night on the court, but I'm curious what these 12
or so hours have been like after last night. Can you talk about who you've
heard from, did you get any sleep, stuff like that?  
MONIQUE REID: Well, we still had curfew. So I mean, we got to enjoy it. I
mean, all my family called me. I was lucky enough to have my mother here to
enjoy it with, but I mean, at 10:30 phones were in and went to sleep.  
  
Q. Mo, you were downstairs at 11:15.  
MONIQUE REID: I was hungry. (Laughter.)  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I actually got the opportunity to hang out with my family.
They drove all the way from Oregon to be here, so I was with them for most of
the night. We also had our fans there and our band there and our cheerleaders
and whatnot in our hotel, so it was a busy night for the most part. But I
think everybody hung out with their families and just kind of enjoyed it all
together. It was a great opportunity for us to do what we did last night, and
we embraced it.  
  
Q. Antonita and Shoni, your coach said last night he needed 16 of 25 three
‑point shooting, didn't know if you could even do that with more defenders on
you. I was curious if either one of you ever counted how many threes you've
made in a row in practice or just hanging out practicing on your own.   
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Well, no, I've never really counted how many I've made,
but I know my teammates have confidence in me and that gave me a boost during
the game.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Most of the time we're just messing around after practice, so
not really worrying about how many go in, it's just kind of like just getting
a feel for your shot and kind of shooting around.  
I mean, last night the ball was going in the hoop, and so everybody took their
shots. 'Nita took hers, Jude, Sara, everybody. It was going in. Sheronne even
shot three, Mo even shot three. We were all just shooting the ball, and it
went in for us.  
  
Q. Sara and Bria, if you guys could address what was it like to wake up this
morning and turn on SportsCenter and see yourselves on the ticker? What's it
been like just to wake up and sort of be at the center of the buzz you guys
have created?  
SARA HAMMOND: I actually never turned on SportsCenter the whole night. I just
put the TV and fell asleep, and this morning I woke up and it was on again. I
was kind of reliving it all over again. No, I mean, like Mo said, we just
celebrated after the game, and meeting Kevin Durant was like a big special
moment for us. This morning we woke up, had breakfast together, went on a
little walk and kind of just embraced the win last night. But we're refocused
now, looking for the game plan against Tennessee, and focusing our attention
on them now.  
BRIA SMITH: Yeah, it's definitely an indescribable feeling. This is just
amazing. We embraced the win last night and even this morning, but we're
refocused right now and we're just trying to look forward to what we have to
do for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Monique, last night you said it felt like you were going to a Final Four
but there's still a game to be played. For you and Sara, how do you
emotionally regroup to play another game?  
MONIQUE REID: Well, I mean, of course we're extremely excited about the win,
but I mean, like today we're just going to go out and practice and get this
game plan ready and focus on Tennessee. But I mean, it's still an amazing
feeling, I feel like I'm going to the Final Four. I've been there before, and
it's just an amazing feeling.  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, just like Mo said, it's an amazing feeling. She's been
there before; they went to a national championship. But for some of us younger
ones, the sophomores and freshmen, we've never experienced this, so to come in
here and experience this and knock off the best team in women's basketball
right now is a tremendous feeling, and I'll remember this the rest of my life.  
But we're focusing our attention again on Tennessee because we haven't made it
to New Orleans yet and that's our whole goal, so we're going to stay focused
all throughout today and tomorrow.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you guys felt there were people that came out of
the woodwork or anything like that last night that were contacting you? Did it
seem like college basketball, women's college basketball finally clicked with
them?  
MONIQUE REID: Well, I know I'm really good friends with Peyton Siva and he
texted me last night, and he's like, Coach P is going to text you. I mean,
that was pretty cool getting a great game from them, and they played an
awesome game, too. It was just really exciting, and everybody from high school
was texting me. I'm the hometown kid, and I know everybody is really excited,
and my dad was crying on the phone. It was very good. Everybody was contacting
me, though.  
  
Q. Shoni, to beat a team like Baylor or any upset, you have to have a
certain amount of, for lack of a better way to put it, swagger. When you go
out on the court you have to believe you can do it. You really showed that
yesterday. Can you talk about how important that was and then how you carry
that over against Tennessee?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think the main thing was that we just believed that we could
win. I mean, we talked about it all day yesterday, we're going to go out there
and win. We believed it as a group, but also from hearing it from our coaches,
we just believed it even more.  
For us to go out there and execute a game plan is just‑‑ made it all come
true. That's what we need to do against Tennessee, too, just go out there and
execute the game plan that our coaches are giving us and continue to believe
not only in ourselves but what our coaches are telling us.  
  
Q. Monique, I wanted to ask you as a person who has been to the Final Four,
what do you say to your teammates who haven't been there about how close you
are and what it takes to take that next step to get to the Final Four?  
MONIQUE REID: I mean, to be honest, you have to believe, because I mean, even
my freshman year nobody thought we could do it. We beat Baylor in the Sweet
16, beat Maryland, nobody thought we could beat them. We beat Oklahoma, nobody
thought we could beat them. I mean, it's just you have to believe, and our
coach put a great message in our head. We watched the Jimmy V story about NC
State, and it just touched everybody's heart because we felt like them
yesterday, and I mean, like‑‑ like a lot of them said, it was poetic justice.
It was just an amazing feeling. That really touched our hearts. If we learned
anything from Jimmy V, it's never give up, and Coach Walz, being the great
leader he is, he taught us to believe in each other and we've did that
throughout the season, and we will not give up, I guarantee that.  
  
Q. Sara, I'm all for believing, but I've watched 74 of 75 teams lose and all
of them thought they could do it. If you could talk about specifically, Jeff
is really known as one of the best Xs and Os people in all of college
basketball, men's and women's. How important was it having his game plan, and
how specifically did you follow that game plan to win yesterday?  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, in order to pull this off, first of all, you have to have
a great leader. We all look to coach Walz as our leader, and he's been there,
he's been in that position, and we have 100 percent trust and 100 percent
confidence in what he's doing. And some people might think he's crazy when
they see him on the sidelines, but that's Coach, and we go with it, and he
gets us hyped and he has the perfect game plan.  
I know a lot of teams, they just stick to what they're used to and what their
comfort zone is. He gets us out of our comfort zone and challenges us to go
beyond what we think we can do, and it's worked tremendous for us this year.
You've just got to give him, I mean, 100 percent‑‑ I mean, I don't even have
words for the game plan that he put together.  
We didn't‑‑ honestly I don't think we believed in ourselves that we could do
it, but just the confidence and the belief that he had in us, I mean, you saw
it last night how hyped we got. He's a great leader, and we just follow with
what he gives us.  
  
Q. This is for any player who would like to address it and also for Jeff.
Coach Mulkey was very critical of the officiating after that game. I wonder if
any of you thought maybe that took away something from your victory because
that became almost like a story unto itself.  
COACH WALZ: It saved me the time. I appreciated it, it saved me the time, too.
I mean, it was a physical game. You know, it's fun to be on my side because we
don't have a secretary in our women's basketball office, so I answer my own
phone and I get my own emails. And there's nothing better than when you get an
email from a 63‑year‑old ex‑coach who's telling me that I'm an embarrassment
to the game because I told our kids to go out there and foul every time
Brittney Griner touched the ball. That was never told. That's not what we did.
Our entire goal was to go out there and be vertical and get in her space and
make sure she just couldn't turn, catch and shoot, because if you allow that
you're not going to win.  
There's a reason they pay pretty good money to three officials to be out there
on the floor, so our kids went out and played the game, and nobody seems to be
concerned about the fact when our guards were getting body checked the entire
time bringing the ball down the floor. Nobody cares about that. And that's
okay.  
But, you know, it was a game that‑‑ it was a pretty intense game, and it's a
situation where you hope you have the best out there to be able to control it
and contain it. But at times it may have gotten away. But I didn't see my kids
do anything that was out of line. I was proud of their effort. I thought we
competed. I've always been told, and this is back to my 18 years of doing this
and going to I've listened to clinics, listened to Rick Pitino, all the great
coaches, Mike Krzyzewski, they always say, when you're going into battle and
you're the underdog, you've got to throw the first punch. You've got to go out
and throw the first punch, and we threw the first punch.  
And if you're afraid to get out there and be aggressive when you're‑‑ I only
know it because I heard it on ESPN, but when you're a 24‑and‑a‑half‑point
underdog, I mean, you can't sit back on your heels and say, okay, you do what
you want to do. So these young ladies here and the ones back in our locker
room came out and threw the first punch. And then when you go seven of your
first ten from three it doesn't hurt, either.  
  
Q. Shoni, you guys talked about refocusing. How do you do that when you have
scored such a monumental upset? Sort of get me inside this team and how you do
that, and then I want some numbers, text messages, friend requests, give me
some numbers for the last 12, 16 hours.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Refocus for us, that game is over and done with now and we've
got to move on to the next, and that is Tennessee. We've just got to focus as
a team. I think we're going to do a great job of that because we believe in
our coaches and what they're telling us. For us to just refocus is going to be
the main thing we're going to do, and it's going to help us win on Tuesday.  
Text messages, I think around 60 from last night and this morning, so I mean,
I don't know, just‑‑ yeah. I don't have Twitter and I don't really have
Instagram.  
  
Q. Mo, can you talk about the turning point in this season? You play in the
Big East and all the focus was on Connecticut and Notre Dame but not as much
on Louisville. Was there a turning point for you guys?  
MONIQUE REID: I definitely think after the Big East Tournament when we lost,
we just wanted to come together and have a great tournament, and we knew that
we'd have home‑court advantage first and second round. I think that was our
turning point, and we just got together as a team and practiced hard. I mean,
that's what we just started to believe in each other.  
  
Q. I know you want to focus on this next game, but what you guys have been
through, I think it probably unique. What has this last half day been like for
you? You mentioned getting all your own emails. That has to be pretty crazy.  
COACH WALZ: No, it's been fun. I mean, it's a situation where I told our
players to embrace it. It can arguably be called the greatest upset in women's
college basketball, and I know some people have argued this game or that game,
but we're sitting here playing with three starters that are not playing, that
are out for the year. I mean, we have a great of young ladies that when the
year started I felt really good about our team. I was like, hey, we have a
chance to make a deep run. And then all of a sudden it's one after another
that go down.  
But we had players that stepped up.  
For us I really believe this season all hinged on the three weeks when Monique
Reid went down after our Marquette game, and she missed six Big East games,
and we won‑‑ I think we went 5‑1 in that stretch. There were a few one‑point
games, two‑point games, and it could have gone either way in about four of
them, and we might not have even been in the tournament.  
But our kids found a way to keep fighting, and that to me is what got things
going.  
Right now the most enjoyable thing that's come about from this, and I just
want to give Angel McCaughtry a little shout‑out because she's got a little
Twitter war going on right now with RG3, going back and forth about his
comments about our kids throwing upper cuts and all that stuff and she's going
back at him, and it's been kind of humorous. But it just shows what our
program is about. You've got a young lady who is without question the best
player that's ever played for us, and she's four years removed, and she's
sitting there standing up for her program because she helped build this
program and put it where it is.  
And that means a lot to me because she still believes in what we're doing. Her
dad sent me a great text last night after the game, watched the entire game.
It means a lot when you've got your ex‑players that are sending you text
messages. But when you've got someone like her going into a little Twitter war
with someone like that, it just speaks volumes for her.  
  
Q. Could you maybe address the development and the progression of Shoni on
both ends of the court in the time she's played for you?  
COACH WALZ: She's come a long way. Offensively she can‑‑ like that lay‑up she
made was probably one of the best shots I've seen a kid make. But at the same
time I've seen her do it in practice. It's not like it's the first time she's
done it.  
I tell her all the time, she's talented enough to play for anybody, but not
anybody can coach her, because she's going to do some things that are going to
make you scratch your head like the one behind the back pass she threw off
somebody's head in the first half that I was like, Shoni, the girl was
standing right in front of you. But I'm not going to take her out because I
know that's part of her game. And she's learned to tone some of it down
herself. And because of that, she's becoming a much more rounded basketball
player.  
For us last night, I thought she took good shots. I really didn't think she
forced a bunch. In her freshman year she would have been pressing a lot,
especially when they started to make their run. But she let the game come to
her. The pass in the first half that she throws to Monique under the basket at
the end of the half, about a 25‑foot bounce pass that gets right to her for a
lay‑up, it's not one that you see on SportsCenter, but boy, it was an
impressive pass.  
Defensively, you know, it's not her strong suit. It's not something we're
going to sit down and put her on the best offensive player on the other team.
But what she does do, she understands the game. She floats around and
freelances better than anybody on our team, which is good at times and bad at
times. But she's really learning when to pick the opportunities to try and go
for a steal, when to try and go for a trap.  
You know, I tell her all the time, you've just got to make sure you know the
scouting report. You've got to know who you're guarding. If you get switched
off onto a shooter, you can't go and double; if it's a non‑shooter, go ahead
and try to get a steal.  
But most importantly, I think she's grown. I think she's grown as a leader, as
an individual. Her teammates have seen it. I think she's seen it. Even on the
pass last night that she threw on the sideline, the left sideline across from
our bench in the second half, there was a nice pass to Antonita Slaughter that
went straight through her hands. Right when it goes out of bounds, Shoni goes
up to her and is like, that's all right, that was my fault. And that to me‑‑
it wasn't her fault. It was a great pass. But take the pressure off of someone
else. That's what teammates are supposed to do.  
And I was just really, really pleased with that. And then when she fouled out,
you know, every time‑out, every dead ball, she's getting the kids, she's in
the huddle‑‑ instead of pouting she's encouraging, you guys can do it, you
guys can do it.  
And then you get Bria Smith to foul out, then Sara Hammond fouls out. When Mo
went to the line to shoot the two shots there I was hoping both would go in
because we did not want to play a five‑minute more stretch without those three
kids.  
  
Q. It's been a couple years since Tennessee has been to the Final Four and
Pat is obviously not there. I wonder your viewpoint on their program, still
very good but maybe not the air of invincibility of the team you just beat.  
COACH WALZ: They're a great program. When you've got someone like Holly that's
been on the sideline as an assistant for 27 years, now she's a head coach,
it's just going to keep going. It's not like you've got someone who's coming
in new going to throw in new ideas, bring in their own just complete change to
a system. So we know we're going to have our hands full tomorrow night. We're
going to have to come out and play another great game.  
But why not? I mean, no one expected us to be here today anyway. So what do we
have to lose? I mean, again, I don't think the pressure is on us, so we're
going to come out here, and I know our kids are going to compete and play hard
and we'll put a game plan together and we'll see if we can't go 16 for 23
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. The other day you said you have friends that don't watch the game because
it was always the same. Did you get some people to say, hey, you converted
me?  
COACH WALZ: No, but I did get a few to actually say they watched it from start
to finish, which was great, because I've got some friends that I played
college ball with where they were like I just actually watched the entire game
and enjoyed it, and I text them back, there's a lot more that are like this
than you think. So hopefully going to be able to get three or four of them
because I know the three that actually texted me all have daughters that I'm
like, guys, you're going to have to go watch them play one day, so you might
want to start joining now.  
That's our goal, and I hope a lot of people had the opportunity to watch that
game last night.  
At the end there, it could have gone either way, but I think win or lose, and
believe me, we're fortunate enough to be up here on the winning side of it,
win or lose it was still going to be a great day for women's basketball just
because of the excitement that we threw into it. Normally you don't get even a
game that's coming down to the wire with your one seed versus your five seed.
I mean, there's a reason the line was what it was.  
So I'm just tickled pink that our players did not worry about what everybody
else was saying because nobody gave us a shot. Nobody at all. And I understood
why.  
  
Q. While you were coaching, Twitter was exploding about the women's college
basketball game, and that typically doesn't happen. Do you feel or did you
hear about just kind of that mass emotion from everybody? Do you feel like a
lot of people came to women's college basketball last night?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I hope so. I mean, it's not that that was our goal starting
off, but I know as an athletic department we strive hard to continue to grow
our game, grow our fan base. We're very fortunate to put close to 10,000 in
the stands every night, and it's been a six‑year journey for us, but I know my
first year we averaged about 3,300 to 3,500 fans a night, and now we're at
close to 10,000. So it can be done, it's just a matter of getting out and
selling your product.  
We sign autographs after every home game, win or lose, and some games are
tough. I mean, when you lose at home, it's a tough one. But our players go to
all four corners of the end zones and we sit there for 10 minutes on the
clock, and we sign them. And I think giving the fans the opportunity to
actually reach out and touch your players is what it's all about. You have to
give them the opportunity to feel like they're a part of it, that they're
going through it with you. And if we can continue to do that, hopefully we'll
continue to grow our game.  
  
Q. You sat up here the other day and talked about your game plan against
Baylor, and it was score, score, score, and joking about putting up 16 threes,
but Tennessee has proven to defend the three so well, they did it against
Creighton. I was just wondering about your game plan going against the Lady
Vols.  
COACH WALZ: Lay‑up, lay‑up, lay‑up. If they're going to guard the three, we're
going to shoot lay‑up, lay‑up, lay‑up.  
No, we're going to have to go inside out. I mean, did I think we'd make 16
threes? No. But I knew we'd‑‑ did I plan on taking between 40 and 50? Yeah, I
did plan on taking between 40 and 50. But when you go seven for your first
ten, all of a sudden everybody start to pressure out on you, and we actually
got some really nice drives mixed up into that.  
So we're just going to continue to play like we play. If we can go in the post
and have an opportunity to score, we will. But if we've got to get inside and
kick the ball out, we'll shoot the three, too.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, where is the line in enjoying what you guys did
yesterday and now moving on? Do you at some point say we're not talking about
it anymore and we're moving forward?  
COACH WALZ: No, life's too short. I mean, you can go back and just watch our
men's game again yesterday when Kevin Ware breaks his leg. I mean, why tell
the kids not to enjoy it? Now, we're going to be focused to come out here and
play tomorrow night, but again, we just had the biggest upset in women's
college basketball, ever. Now, it's my opinion, but I've had a few that say
the same thing. Why wouldn't I want my kids to enjoy that?  
Are we going to go out on the floor tomorrow night and go shake hands and say,
hey, we beat Baylor? No, we aren't going to do that. But we're going to enjoy
this, and we're going to come out here and practice here shortly and we're
going to get prepared for it, and we're going to have a game plan, then we'll
go back and eat and watch some more film and talk about what we're going to do
and come back out here tomorrow night and play.  
You know, the one thing I do know is‑‑ the one thing I've learned about all
this is when you get a chance to go to a Final Four as a coach, you normally
have a lot of friends that like to buy you meals or whatever, a beverage,
whatever it might be. I've already had text messages, about 300 of them, when
you get to New Orleans, if you're playing or not, the first beverage or food
is on me. I'm like, boy, I'll be eating for a month.  
But you've got to enjoy this opportunity, and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. You mentioned the men and what they did yesterday. How aware were your
gals of that? How aware of what they were doing for you? And how much sleep
did you get last night?  
COACH WALZ: The first part, we watched the entire first half of the men's
game, and then Candice Bingham here was giving me updates of the men's game
during our game, so I told her I wanted to know how the men were doing, and if
she hadn't done that at the under‑eight media time‑out when they interviewed
me I was going to ask Rebecca how they had done, but since she told me they
had won I didn't have to do that.  
And sleep, I mean, a few hours. You know, trying to get everything taken care
of. Like I said, I get my own emails, my own texts, so I reply to all of them.  
  
Q. Coach Warlick mentioned she tried to recruit a couple of kids she
couldn't get in on and you signed them and you guys just kind of went head to
head with Mercedes Russell. Do you feel like now your program is at a level
where you can compete with the established powers of the game for just about
any recruit in the country?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, we're going to try and recruit the best. That's what
our goal is. Hopefully our game will continue to grow where you get players
that are willing to go outside the norm, and again, that's why the men's game
is so special. And I say in a good way, men are confident and arrogant enough
to think you can go to any school and I'm going to take them to a Final Four.
Women like the security. They like to say, hey, I'm going to go with my friend
here, I'm going to go with my friend there. So it's our job to try to find the
players that are willing to say, hey, I think I can do this. I can sit here
and come in and I see the players they have and we can get to a Final Four. It
takes Angel McCaughtry, Candice Bingham, players that nobody thought that that
team in '09 ever had a chance at doing what we did. And then you've got to
find players that have a bunch of heart. In that year we had Dez Byrd who
played the point for us, and nobody ever thought she'd ever be a point guard.
And then we had two freshmen that came off the bench in Becky Burke and
Monique Reid that just did their roles. For us right now we're trying to find
those players that want to come to Louisville and help us get back to a Final
Four, compete for a national championship.  
But it takes a special player. It takes a special person, because you've got
to have that belief in yourself that it's okay to go against what everybody is
telling you to do, because it's a simple answer, go to this school, go to
school there, go to school B. But if our game is going to continue to grow,
we've got to continue hopefully to recruit these kids and get them convinced
that it's okay to do something different.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH WARLICK: Obviously we are extremely excited to be here, and these young
ladies have worked hard all year, and it's a great opportunity for them. And I
think they look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. Meighan, just like we were all predicting, you guys are going to be
playing Louisville tomorrow. We asked you a bunch of questions yesterday about
Baylor and that's not who you're going to play. Can you talk about your
feelings while you guys were watching that game and what it felt like to know
you weren't going to have to go against Baylor?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: Honestly, I feel like we just had just got done playing
because our adrenaline was flying from watching the game. Like I said to my
teammates yesterday, it doesn't matter who we play, I mean, either way we
would have had to play either team to get to the Final Four. But no matter who
we are, it's just another team that's standing in front of us of getting to
the Final Four and even possibly winning the national championship.  
We just have to take one game at a time no matter what opponent we play and
just go out there and play hard and play Tennessee basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously everyone was expecting a lot from Baylor and now that
they're out of the tournament, now it looks like the field is wide open. I was
just wondering what you thought about that.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think the opportunity is there for both teams, and as
Meighan said, this team has been really good about taking one game at a time,
and that's been our focus. We really have not looked ahead for anyone. So our
preparation today will be for Louisville. They have extraordinary game, and
they're in the same spot we are. We'll prepare for Louisville as we would have
prepared for Baylor, just understanding personnel, understanding concepts, and
it's just a great opportunity for us.  
This team has not been overly hyped and they have not been extremely low, even
after our losses. I think they've understood when we've had a loss they've got
to go back to the drawing board and get better. They're going to be focused,
and I think they'll understand what needs to be done.  
  
Q. Taber, about that, about not being too high or low, you had that real
tough loss at Missouri and then a tough loss in the SEC tournament. Can you
talk about how you were able to sort of regroup after tough losses this season
and come back?  
TABER SPANI: Well, I think it's a testament to the fight and the
competitiveness that we have on this team. I've said this ever since this team
has been kind of brought together: I haven't been on a team so far here that
has that fighting spirit, and we're so hungry, and I think that's helping fuel
our passion to go out and be energetic and play every possession literally
like it's our last because at this point you don't know, nothing is
guaranteed, so I think the fact that Missouri, it was a tough loss, we didn't
play very well but we learned from it, and Texas A&M was a heartbreaking loss
for us, and we all were devastated but we learned from it.  
I think every loss that we've had, I think the focus has been to get better
from it and not to dwell on it, and I think we've done that and we're really
finally meshing and coming together and starting to play the kind of defense
that we pride ourselves on playing, and I think the fact that we're doing that
at the right time is exciting for us.  
  
Q. Ariel, I wanted to get your thoughts on when you look at Louisville's
backcourt, what really strikes you about the Schimmels and Bria Smith and what
really strikes you about how they play?  
ARIEL MASSENGALE: I mean, they play hard. They can put the ball in the basket,
they can get to the rim, they can shoot the three, so it's definitely going to
be a challenge for us. I think in the past couple games we've done a good job
of taking away other teams' strengths so we're going to be aware of personnel
and try to contain Shoni Schimmel, she's been great, she's a great player,
knows how to put the ball in the basket. But I think our coaching staff has a
great plan for us to go out there and hopefully contain that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Holly, when you look at the way Louisville shot from beyond the arc
yesterday, how do you guys plan to attack that and try to defend that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, it was fabulous. I mean, they shot the lights out. We're
going to defend personnel, try to limit touches. We're going to defend by
committee. We've done that all year. We're going to take a lot of pride in
one‑on‑one defense, and as Taber said, we've worked a lot on that and we're
going to mix up our defenses.  
So our game plan is to try to limit their three‑point shooting. We played
Creighton who was second in the nation on three‑point shots and we allowed
them five, so we're well aware of their strengths, and obviously we're going
to try to take them away.  
  
Q. Holly, Kim talked about before playing that it was tough to figure out
what defense Louisville was playing. Do you have any idea what you might face
against them or are they difficult to scout?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think they run just a whole plethora of a lot of
things, and we're not going to try to spend a lot of time figuring out if it's
a man, it's a zone. We're going to try to run offenses that we can run both.
We've been doing that all year, and Ariel has been great at seeing things, and
I'm allowing her to call an offense that she sees fit during the game.  
We're aware of that. We have offenses that can go against both, and we don't
want to slow our game up trying to figure out what Louisville‑‑ what their
defense is doing. We want to continue to attack, attacking the full court,
attacking the half court.  
  
Q. Kamiko, can you address, you guys have played some good three ‑point
shooting teams, Creighton is one, Missouri is another. When teams are like
Louisville was yesterday, they weren't just‑‑ Baylor was defending them and
they were taking some shots that were just crazy, but they were making them.
How do you deal with that both strategically and emotionally as a defender?   
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I think we just make it a pride game. I know Coach Elzy just
pulled some of us aside and challenged us to get in the guarding, and Holly,
as well, and if we all just take it upon ourselves to lock up one‑on‑one and
make sure our girl doesn't score and make it tough for the guards and much
easier for the post players to do their job. I think it's just a pride thing
that plays into it.  
  
Q. Holly, what do you think it does for a sport when a team that seems
unbeatable finally falls?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, that's why you play the game. You just‑‑ it's a game, and
all bets are off. Nothing is guaranteed. So you always go into the game, or
you should, thinking you're going to win. We've been on the Baylor side when
Chamique Holdsclaw was a senior and beat us to go to a Final Four. Nothing is
guaranteed, and if these young ladies understand that and you put in the time,
things will happen. And as Michelle said, Baylor was doing a great job of
defending the three. It was going in, and they were in a rhythm. It's just why
you play the game. It's what's great about this game.  
  
Q. Bashaara, Louisville was very physical yesterday. I know this is a
physical game, but they were doing a lot to grind or they were disrupting her
when she didn't have the ball. As a post player you've gotten used to that in
college but can you talk about how you keep your cool when you're going
against a team that does that?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: You've got to keep your emotion intact. You can't get
emotional when people are battling and the refs are not calling it. You just
keep your emotions and keep playing your game.  
  
Q. Holly, I guess you can spin this either way. We're going to ask
Louisville how they come back after such a big game and we'll ask you guys how
you avoid not saying wow, Baylor is out of the picture. Do you think the fact
that you guys have the experience you have is a big factor? It sounds like you
guys are probably happy Baylor is gone but immediately said, hey, that doesn't
mean we're in the Final Four yet.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I would not be truthful if I didn't say I was glad Baylor
is out of the tournament. But these young ladies have kept things in
perspective, and I think they understand what's ahead of them and what they
need to get the job needs to get done. As I said, we've had lows and we've had
highs, but this is a special group. There's a bond between them and our
coaching staff that I haven't felt in a long, long time. And when you have
that bond, they're not going to overlook anybody. They're not. They're going
to go out and play as hard as they can. I don't care who it is, and that's
what I love about them. They spend a lot of time together off the basketball
court, and when you do that, you form a trust, and I think these young ladies
have a great trust that they're going to go and be up for the game.  
It's a great opportunity for them, and they understand that. But it doesn't
matter who we play, and we're not going in with the attitude of we're just
going to roll over Louisville. No, we have to play and we have to play
together.  
So I think they understand that.  
  
Q. Holly, I know it's kind of difficult to evaluate when you're still in the
middle of the season, but kind of looking back, what's been the biggest
challenge in your first year as the head coach or maybe the biggest thing
you've learned just being in this position versus where you had been for so
many years before?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, my biggest challenge is just my time away from
basketball. Just doing the things outside of being on the court. When you're
coaching‑‑ when you love doing Xs and Os and being around these young women
because that's what you love, and that's what I love, and the time away from
them has probably been my biggest challenge.  
Even if I do something‑‑ these guys bring me back down to earth if something
goes on. They give me quite a bit of a hard time, but then I turn around and
give it back to them.  
But yeah, I just think the time commitment and‑‑ but I'll tell you, I have an
unbelievable staff, and I don't feel like I have to go into a game or to a
practice and I have to make all the decisions. There's no way as a coach, for
me, that if I had to make all the decisions, if I had to sub‑‑ I've got great
assistants that do a lot of things, and sometimes I stand up there and I get
the opportunity to call an offense and a defense. I have a lot of help.  
  
Q. Holly, this doesn't have anything to do with tomorrow's game, but just
historically you guys were every bit the giant, you'd won three in a row, you
had the best player in the country, had taken everybody's best shot for four
seasons and you lost that game, so emotionally devastating to watch. How as a
coach do you sort of comfort those kids even though they've had all that
success that they're going to feel this incredible disappointment in their
last college game?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, it is, I know how disappointed they are. We've been
there. That should not take away the great year they've had, the great career
that Brittney Griner has had, the standard she has set, the standard the whole
team has set. It's tough, and I know it's tough for Kim, as well, but you've
got to look at the big picture and understand where you've taken women's
basketball. You've gotten the interest up. You've got to keep thinking about
the positives and not the last game. It's hard to do. It's hard to do, and
it'll be really difficult for Kim and the team to watch that last game, but
you've got to watch it and understand what you did and learn from it.  
But what a great run they had. We will not see a Brittney Griner time player
probably for a long time, and obviously Sims. That's one of the best
competitors in the game. So disappointing obviously for them to not go to the
Final Four, but it is part of the game, and as you said, I've been there and
we have felt that, and it's tough to go out that way as a senior. But they're
going to continue to play a game, we're going to play the game tomorrow and
there's going to be four people in the Final Four. It's just the nature of
this‑‑ of any sport.  
Not always the best player plays for championships, and we've been on both
ends. We've been on both ends. We've lost 10 games and won a national
championship when the coaches are trying to figure out how we were going to
just get our players to show up. Along with winning comes‑‑ you've got to have
a little luck, and it's about match‑ups, too.  
  
Q. Holly, going back to that season opener against Chattanooga, did you come
away from that game thinking, oh, this team will probably end up in the Elite
8 just needing one more win to go to the Final Four?  
COACH WARLICK: I sure did. I thought we were on our way. No, I was‑‑ quite
frankly I was wondering what did I get myself into, and the first person I saw
was Coach Summitt, and she just assured me things would get better, and she
told me that she lost her first game, and I thought, well, you know, Coach
Summitt lost her first game, I'm going to be okay.  
The worst thing I did was went back to my hotel room and looked at the
schedule, our remaining schedule, and I'm like, I just had to turn it over,
and I had to just start focusing on Georgia Tech because that was our next
opponent. Yeah, it was a little scary. It was a little scary. But we turned it
around. But yeah, to lose your first game to an in‑state school, it didn't
fare too well with a lot of‑‑ myself and I'm sure a lot of fans. They were
ready to get rid of me after the first game.  
  
Q. Holly, just to follow up on that, what kind of changes did you make with
the team going in after that loss?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we've been a‑‑ we've tried to make defense and rebounding
a priority, and I think we had a team meeting the next day, and probably
reidentified roles and what our expectations of each young lady player.  
I think that helped. And then we challenged them. We reminded them who they
were representing, the University of Tennessee, and themselves, as well. We
defined roles, and then we went to work. We took practice a little bit more
serious. We were a little bit more focused. And we went and opened our next
game, we opened up Georgia Tech's facility, their brand‑new facility. So I
think that our practices probably leading up to that game were the best we've
had thus far. We just tried to make sure they understand our expectations of
them.  
  
Q. Holly, what games this year do you think you have played the best
defense?  
COACH WARLICK: I thought North Carolina we played well. I thought Texas A&M we
played well. Gosh. I mean, we played in spurts, but I thought yesterday I
thought probably was our best defensive effort. We got aggressive, we got
after the ball, and I think if you had to set an example of Tennessee
basketball on the defensive end, I thought yesterday was a great example.  
We have been working and working and working out since day one in the fall, so
our defensive rebounding has been such a priority to where we've sometimes
ignored our offense because we needed to get so much better defensively. I'd
say Oklahoma was our best overall game.  
  
Q. Did you look at Baylor yourself any?  
COACH WARLICK: I looked at‑‑ I actually looked at all three, but I mainly
looked at Oklahoma because if we don't take care of them, we're obviously not
going to advance. But all the coaches, yeah, we put in a lot of time with
Baylor and a lot of time with Louisville. That's just the nature of our job,
and that's what you do. I'm sure Dean is not‑‑ I think he'll be okay that he
did all that work and we're not using it.  
But that's what you do. That's what you do. You just put in a lot of time and
watch a lot of film, especially at tournament time. That's just part of our
job and what we do.  
  
Q. I'm sure that you've probably heard from a lot of people after your win,
but did you hear from a lot of people after what happened in that game after?
I'm curious to gauge the buzz that has been created by what Louisville did
here yesterday.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I heard both, honestly. Excited about our win. A lot of
text messages. A lot of people don't call me when I'm here. But a lot of text
messaging during the game of the Louisville game saying can you believe what
happened and those type of things. Absolutely. I think in general it's‑‑ I'm
sure that's what everybody is saying. Louisville had a great game plan, they
stuck with it, and they finished the job.  
I will say this: 16 threes and then Baylor had a chance‑‑ the strength of
Baylor, you've got to understand that they're still in the game‑‑ they give up
16 threes and then they go ahead towards the end of the game. Baylor is an
incredible team. They're just a phenomenal team, and it was Louisville's day
and they did a great job and followed Jeff's game plan and made shots and won
the game. So it was a tribute to both teams. Hard‑fought game with Baylor, but
the perseverance of Louisville in finishing the job.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on Shoni Schimmel particularly? She's sort of a
dynamic scorer when she really gets going and just seemed like she had almost
the game of her life yesterday.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, she is‑‑ there's people who shoot the basketball, and
there's people who score, and she's a scorer. You just hope she doesn't get in
the‑‑ she was in a zone yesterday, and I'm sure the shot that she shot over
Griner was probably the number one play of ESPN top 10. She plays the game.
She plays the game hard, and she wants the basketball, and so that's going to
be a challenge for us. We can't let her get in the zone and‑‑ she was in a
big‑time zone yesterday.  
  
Q. Maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't, but this group of girls having been
to the Final Four and even at a program like Tennessee that's been there so
many times, do you have a sense of what it would mean to get there?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, this group it would be huge. I mean, we've‑‑ three out of
the last four years of Taber and Kamiko's career, they probably had the
possibility of going against Baylor. I think it would be huge, huge for them.
It's unique at Tennessee in we've created a monster because we‑‑ it's great to
win SEC championships, but our fans and everybody, if you don't go to the
Final Four and win a national championship, you've had an okay year.  
Now, that's crazy, and I know I was a part of helping build that, but that's
crazy. And I think these young ladies understand the achievements they've done
winning the regular season SEC and then what's ahead of them. Yeah, it would
be a huge‑‑ it would be huge for these young ladies to go to the Final Four.
I'm not‑‑ I mean, it would be a fantastic opportunity for them.  
  
Q. You were just in a battle with Louisville of sorts in recruiting. I
assume they were kind of primary team you were competing with to get Mercedes
Russell, and what does that say about Louisville's program right there, that
they're competing for the top players in the country?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I mean, I think they're one of the top teams in the
country. I think they're in on a lot of kids, and we did go down to us and
Louisville, and they recruited a kid they got. Recruiting is recruiting, and
it's a battle, and I think it's who you need at the time and what the kid
loves about their program and what they don't. I think Mercedes just saw an
opportunity at Tennessee maybe better than she did at Louisville. I don't
know, but I think we did both recruit her, and it went down.  
But like I said, there's kids on their team, we looked at Bria Smith, and so
there's kids that they've gotten that we didn't get a chance to get. So it's
just part of recruiting and what you need and I guess how you fill your
program.  
  
Q. You talked about that '99 game, and there's obviously been big upsets in
the women's tournament before, but considering the era we're in with ESPN,
everybody knows where the games are, and then you have Brittney, such a
transcendent player, almost like NASCAR people tune in to see the wrecks, last
night people tuned in to see the giant fall. Did something like that almost
need to happen to continue to push women's basketball forward?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I'm not going to say‑‑ it's not going to hurt, but I
think that people wanted to see Griner play, as well. I'm sure they tuned in
last night because a lot of Baylor's games have not been very competitive. We
went down to Baylor, and we were down 20 points before I could even put my
hand up to call a time‑out. I'm sure that people didn't watch it closely and
then they followed it on the ticker last night, they probably went, oh, they
tuned it in and started watching. But it works both ways. I think that people
enjoy to watch great basketball, and then I think Baylor is a great basketball
team, and then they want to see the underdog win. So I think it's helped us
both ways.  
  
Q. You were talking about how much it would mean to go to the Final Four.
People on the outside look at this team, it really has overachieved based on
preseason, unlike a lot of other Tennessee teams. Do you still think the
players, though, if they didn't make the Final Four, would they feel like they
underachieved?  
COACH WARLICK: Oh, I think so, most definitely. I mean, they‑‑ kids think
they're‑‑ we were preseason ranked in the 20, 22, 24 in the polls, and they've
got a chip on their shoulder, and I think they carried that chip throughout
the whole year. And I think they don't see themselves as overachieved. I think
they've seen themselves as a talented group coming together as one and playing
together. Yeah, they'd most definitely be disappointed, but I don't think
they've ever thought they're overachieving. I think they think that they're
becoming‑‑ they're getting better and they're becoming into their own and
playing pretty good as a team.  
They just had a chip on their shoulder all year, and we've played the underdog
role. In the past, not a lot of times Tennessee has been playing the underdog
role, and this team needed that. They needed that. They needed somebody to
tell them, look, you're not really good right now and you have to work, and so
they did. They went to work, and probably after the first loss they thought,
you know what, we do, we need to get back to work and understand the
importance of practice.  
I've said this as a coach; you don't want to coach effort, and I have not had
to coach effort with this team. I've actually been able to coach and teach.
And so when you get a team like that, you've got something special. They play
hard, and that's all I ask for them to do is play hard and play with a
passion, and I think great things will happen because they are talented.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  82  
Baylor  81

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Louisville Cardinals. Coach, your
opening thoughts?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not sure exactly where to start.  
THE MODERATOR: You've got two minutes.  
COACH WALZ: That's it? I stutter, I should get four (laughter).  
It's just a remarkable night by a remarkable group of young women. We put a
game plan together as a coaching staff, which we always do every night we go
out and play. I've been telling them the entire year, if we can just get 40
minutes out of everybody, not playing great, just playing good, we could be
special.  
We have not had that the entire season. I thought our Purdue game, I thought
we played pretty close, but not where it needed to be. We came out here
tonight and we executed a plan defensively, offensively, and did everything we
needed to do.  
I'm just so proud of 'em. Antonita Slaughter defensively is where she stepped
up tonight. She played 40 minutes for us and just did a great job on Brittney
Griner. I told our kids in the locker room before the game, We got to turn
this thing into a street ballgame. You got to drive, kick for threes, try to
make it fun. There was no pressure on us.  
We came out and did that. I'm honored to coach this group of young ladies. As
I told 'em from day one, I'm going to demand them to be great, I'm going to
demand that I get the most out of 'em.  
With the injuries we've had, I'll say it over and over, I'm as proud of this
basketball team as I was of our team that played for a national championship
in '09, and we're still playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. We'll now take questions for our
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, there were two key plays late in the game that led to your fouling
out. One was the double technical foul, then it looked like you'd been tripped
and the foul was called on you. Can you talk about, from your perspective,
what happened on those two plays and what did you say to your teammates to
keep the spirit up?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, what I told them was just continue to play and go out
there and believe because that's what we've been talking about this whole
trip, is just go out there and believe.  
I believe in them. I knew they could do it. I kept saying it all day, We're
going to win. For them to actually believe in me made me believe in them. We
actually went out there and just did what we needed to do, and that was win.  
  
Q. Antonita, Brittney only had 10 shots in the game. How in the world did
you limit her to 10 shots?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Well, I think I could smell what toothpaste she used. I
was in her face all the time with my hands up. That was the game plan the
whole time. I think that was a big impact for it.  
  
Q. Antonita, Baylor coach didn't know what kind of defense you had. Was it
box ‑and‑one?   
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Right, that's what we were going for. Most of the time we
just scrambled. It worked out for us, so...  
  
Q. Jude, can you talk about the defense that Baylor put on you guys.  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: Yeah, we can give credit to our coaches for that. They set up a
great scout for us, got us prepared. We knew coming into this game they were
going to pressure the point guard a lot.  
I think me and Bria Smith knew that coming into the game. We knew we needed to
protect the ball and I think we did that pretty well.  
  
Q. Were you surprised until really the last 10 minutes of the game they
didn't really come out at you on those three ‑point plays?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We knew coming into the game we were going to have to shoot a
lot of threes. Our guards, our posts can all shoot threes.  
For Nita to knock down her first couple threes, then Jude had a couple, even
Sara had one. Anything at that point was possible. The goal was as big as it
could be. We just kept shooting threes. That was our game plan, to go out and
shoot threes, and it worked for us.  
  
Q. Shoni, that layup you made over Griner, first of all, how did you do
that? Second of all, there were some words expressed between the two of you.
Were you surprised you didn't get called for a technical at that point?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was just showing emotion. I was just excited. I just hopped
up and was screaming, Yeah! Nothing personal or anything.  
I mean, I just put the ball in the hoop is how I made it. Nothing too special.
I saw her going one way, caught her off guard, went the other way. She was off
balance for a second, so I just went up on the left side.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on the win. We'll continue with
questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey said the officials allowed more stuff to go on, more
physical play, than any game since she's had Brittney Griner. Did you feel it
was an unusually physical game? If so, did you think it benefited your team as
opposed to Baylor?  
COACH WALZ: I mean, understand, our goal was to stand in front of her, have
one behind her. It's just really hard to comment on that. I really didn't
think it was really all that exciting to watch as an official. I'm not sure
what sometimes they were watching.  
The fifth foul on Shoni, I'm still trying to figure out what took place there.  
You know, we turned and boxed her out. We stood in front of her. We did a
really nice job. I told Antonita, Go under her elbows, go under her elbows. We
tried to stay as vertical as we could without putting bodies on her.  
I mean, you know, it's a game where if you let Brittney catch you wherever she
wants to, she's going to score. She's the best player I've coached against and
tried to game plan against.  
When shots went up, we turned and boxed her out. When she got the ball, I told
them straight up, do not ever bat down on the ball because I didn't want her
to get to the free‑throw line.  
At one point in time, I mean, we're up 20, and it's 8‑0 on fouls. We were
driving at times and kicking, we still couldn't get one called. I promise you,
we were trying to box out every time.  
There's no question, there were a lot of fouls called against us. I was just
thankful on that last drive when Monique Reid went in for the layup, it was a
late whistle, but I was glad he caught it because she got clobbered.  
  
Q. There was a team technical called.  
COACH WALZ: That was on me. I was outside the coaching box. I've learned, I'm
better off if I wear a sport coat because I can step out and rip that off and
go halfway on the floor and you won't get a technical. If you sit on the
scorer's table three feet outside the box, you're going to get one.  
Even though my kid fouled out. My whole thing was, Damn, she fouled out. I sat
on the score table thinking, Who are they going to put in? They run across the
floor and give me a T. I haven't worn a sport coat all season, so I think I
might wear three of them on Tuesday night. It's like that commercial, when you
travel, I can run out, take one off, run back out, take a second one off, it's
okay (laughter).  
I don't know. I mean, our kids still found a way to persevere. Despite me
getting a T, they found a way to grind it out at the end.  
  
Q. Without giving away too many secrets, what exactly was it? Was it a box
‑and‑one?  
COACH WALZ: We came out in what we call (indiscernible) one. It's like a 1‑3
zone. I didn't want to get too set up in the box where we gave the wings
anything they wanted. We had Antonita stay in the front if the ball was on the
one side of the floor. The whole goal was to jab out, come back, jab out, come
back.  
I just didn't believe, deep down I kept telling my players every timeout, if
they make 10 to 15 threes, they're going to beat us. I don't think they can
make enough threes to beat us, but I know Brittney can make three‑ and
four‑footers all night long.  
Odyssey does a good job she went 3‑9 and hit some big ones. Jordan Madden goes
2‑3\. At the end of the night they're 6‑17\. And then we only allowed Brittney
10 shots, she goes 4‑10.  
Defensively we did everything we wanted to do. It got to a point when Sara is
hitting a step‑back three in the corner, I don't know what to do. I mean, from
my side, it's not like I drew that up, all right? We start to make some shots.
I told our kids, The pressure is on them. I didn't want to try to slow the
ball up. You can drive and kick. If you're open, shoot it. If there's any
question, bring the ball back out.  
So defensively that's what we did. We switched a few possessions of going man
to zone for a few passes, then jumped into man, trying to get them a little
bit confused.  
Overall I have to give all the credit to our players. I tell everybody all
year long, I've not made a shot or gotten a rebound all year. So we can put
the game plan together, but it's all about the kids.  
  
Q. So much about the defense on Brittney Griner. What about the offense? You
took her out of the lane. Even on the last play she was out so far, was not
able to get back. Talk about your offense.  
COACH WALZ: Well, that's kind of what we talked about, to be honest with you.
This is what we have to do to guard 'em. I told our kids, If we don't score 70
points, we don't have a chance to win. Our whole goal was to try to get to 70.  
I don't think anybody had scored over 70 on 'em this entire year. I'm 90% sure
nobody has scored 80 on 'em. I told our kids, We got to keep scoring. If they
score, fine, we're going to come down and score.  
I mean, I was all excited because we started the game. I'm sure y'all saw. I
put Bria Smith on the offensive end. With the first possession of the game, it
was five on four them. If we don't foul, they're going to score. We're taking
the ball and throwing it the length of the floor for a layup.  
Bria was wide open, standing back on the three‑point line. It took me two days
of practice to get her to stand. She wanted to come down and guard.
Unfortunately, we got called for a foul so we weren't able to execute it.  
Our goal was to score, score and score. I told our kids, If we have to take 40
to 50 threes, we will. I don't know if we could go out there right now 5‑0 and
go 16 of 25. But we did it in the biggest game of the year for us. Now we're
going to hopefully keep our momentum going and see what we can do on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Did you keep your composure in this game?  
COACH WALZ: I was mild compared to what I usually am. Oh, yeah, my kids know
how I am. I'm fighting for them. So if I think some calls aren't going our
way, I'm not just going to sit there and take it.  
I stood up for our players. I mean, I'll have to watch Bria Smith's charge
there for her fifth foul. With all the contact going on on both hands, how do
you make that call? Shoni Schimmel's fifth foul on the drive, I'm dumbfounded.
Kids are getting knocked down and bringing it across with body contact, it's
not called. That's fine, but I'm not just going to sit there and take it.  
They warned me a few times. Because I was three feet out of my box, sitting on
the scorer's table, they gave me a technical foul.  
That's how I coach, my kids know it.  
  
Q. Outside of this arena, what your men's team did today was the biggest
story in sports. Did you guys know about everything that happened there?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we were all sitting in our locker room cheering on
our men, and we saw it. It's probably the most devastating injury in sports
that I've seen. I was watching I'm not sure what it is when Joe Theismann got
his leg broken. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that.  
I told our kids before the game, I said, You know what, it's a basketball
game. Even for us tonight, I mean, I'm not sure where this stands on victories
in women's college basketball, but I'll have to say it's kind of high up
there.  
At the end of the day, it's a basketball game. Both teams come out here and
compete and give it everything you have. We're watching our men play, and
Kevin has an injury that obviously he's out for the year. Who knows how bad it
is. I just told them, I said, Go out there and give it everything you've got.
But at the end of the day it's a basketball game.  
We all said a prayer for him before we went out. I just have to give a lot of
credit to Coach Pitino, the players, because to be there and see something
like that happen, 'cause I saw the expression of the players on the floor and
the players on the bench, where it was right in front of them, to be able to
bounce back from that and get your mind refocused and win an elite game to go
to the Final Four against Duke, not like they're playing a bad team, I think
it says a lot about what Coach Pitino has done with his team, the type of
players they have.  
I know we were really, really excited to hear that they had won and moved on.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Tennessee  74  
Oklahoma  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Holly Warlick from Tennessee. Coach,
your opening thoughts.  
COACH WARLICK: It was a really hard‑fought game for us. I'm extremely proud of
these young ladies. We talk a lot about where we start and then where we are
now. I keep saying this, but this team, they play in the moment. They play
each possession like it's their last. As a coach, you don't want to coach
effort. I have not from day one had to coach effort. We've actually coached
and taught.  
The credit is to them and how hard they've worked, the hours they've put in,
just their listening and wanting to go to practice. I know it starts with
practice.  
The only time they didn't want to go to practice was the day before yesterday.
They keep thinking we go too long, but I'll let them slide on that one.  
I thought Oklahoma, a great crowd, a tremendous crowd. I think Sherri and her
team have done a fabulous job with the amount of injuries.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kamiko, you kind of set the tone for the game when you got that first
steal. Can you go over that play.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I mean, she smiled at me, so I knew I had to get low. She
swings the ball in front of her, I happened to stick my hand in there. I just
kind of reacted to the ball.  
  
Q. Kamiko, generally being able to slow her down for the game, take her out
of their offense, can you talk about the impact that had.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I think it had a great impact. I think it started in the
locker room. Coach Elzy challenged me to guard her, bring my best defense. My
teammates helped me out. So it wasn't just me.  
Most of the time I was on her and I just tried to live up to that challenge
from Elzy, because if not, I was going to hear about it later. Didn't want
that to happen (laughter).  
  
Q. Taber, talk about how the tone is set with your team on the defensive
end?  
TABER SPANI: Well, I think obviously everyone knows Tennessee is defense and
rebounding. We've stressed that from day one. I think Holly's style is she
really wanted full court pressure or get into the ball and pressure them.  
I think that just plays right into the personnel that we have, with the
athleticism we have, especially at the top with Kamiko or with Jasmine or
Meighan up there on the ball.  
We wanted to come in, set the tempo early, dictate to them that we were going
to be the ones pressuring. We were trying to get them out of their offense
because they're a great offensive team when they're able to run their sets.  
I think that helped us on the offensive end because we got steals, kind of got
into a little bit of a rhythm. I thought we did one of our best jobs all year
of really passing the ball, being unselfish, making the extra pass. We got
into a really nice rhythm in the first half.  
  
Q. Isabelle, talk about the rotation of the guard, the post situation.
Certainly McFarland, she's going to get her rebounds. Talk about the rotation
that you have in the post position.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think for this game it definitely brought a challenge for
our posts to actually have to step out of the paint and guard on the
perimeter. That's something we're not used to.  
Coach Elzy and Holly talked about that today and yesterday, that we have to go
out and get out of our comfort zone and guard the perimeter. I think we did a
pretty good job on that.  
  
Q. Taber, can you talk about how your young posts have developed.  
TABER SPANI: It's been tremendous for us. I think as a player, you see them in
the off‑season, you see the talent, the potential. We've seen that ever since
they stepped foot on our campus.  
The maturity, Izzy has done a great job of taking the post under her wing, she
really kind of owns that group. She wants them to get better collectively and
it will help us as a whole.  
Cierra came in and made really big shots. Both of them have done a tremendous
job of rehabbing in order for them to get back to this point.  
I think Bashaara is just mature beyond her years, the big baskets, the big
boards she provides for us.  
  
Q. Can all three of you players talk about, again, the next game is going to
be played, but certainly you played Baylor, there's no guarantee they're going
to win, but talk about going into that game, just preparing and how you have
to get ready for that team.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I personally think, I mean, Brittney Griner, she looks like
she's going to get hers, but we have to shut down their guards, shut down
Odyssey, shut down Hayden, she killed us when we were at Baylor. Get after
Madden and Destiny Williams, the other post player.  
We can't focus so much on Brittney. She's going to get her rebounds, her
points. I think if we can shut down the perimeter, we should be in business.  
TABER SPANI: I think it's a mindset, us included, so many times we've played
them, you go in and you feel like you have to change your entire game plan
because of Brittney. Granted, she's one of the greatest players ever to play
our game. I think it's our mindset going in, we're not going to be scared. The
power of belief is really big for us. We believe in each other, what we can
do, who we can be. I think that confidence level is going to help us.  
Especially having the experience of going down and playing at their place with
this team this year, we didn't have Izzy because she hurt her ankle that game.
So our mindset is going to be go in and attack, and whatever happens, happens.
But we're not going to go in and let down by any stretch of the imagination.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think, especially being y'all's last season, we're going
to play with a chip on our shoulder. I'm having a lot of flashbacks from last
year that may be the case. If anything, I want to prevent that feeling,
because I don't want it to come back.  
I'm going to give it my all, play hard for these guys, Holly, the rest of the
team, Pat, of course. I'm just going to go at it.  
  
Q. Isabelle, it looked as though you were moving better today and seemed
more comfortable on the floor since you had your injury. Was that the case?
How good did you feel out there today?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I felt really good. I was doing a lot of rehab on this
trip. Me and (indiscernible) have been basically roommates. I'm glad I can get
out there and do the best I can. I need to talk to her when I'm hurting. I'm
feeling really good.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, congratulations on your win. We'll continue with
questions for coach now.  
  
Q. Holly, when your backcourt struggles shooting the way they did, yet you
still controlled this whole game, talk about how many other things you did
right.  
COACH WARLICK: Meighan Simmons, 1 for 15, that's obviously unusual for her.
What I loved about Meighan and what she did, she didn't let her offense affect
her defense. I don't think any of the players did. We've stressed so much on
the defensive side and the rebounding side, I just don't think they had time
to think about what they were doing offensively.  
That's a different mindset than we've had. It's a different mindset that
Meighan has had. I know she wanted to play, and play so hard. But I love that
she was still in the game and still defending.  
We had some players step up. Meighan didn't play well, then we had Jasmine
Jones, who I thought had a great game. So we had people step up, Cierra
Burdick. That's the sign of a solid team. Massengale didn't shoot the ball
well. We moved the ball. 14 assists was good for us. We found a way to win.  
  
Q. Against the predictions of many people, you've earned your way back to
the same position where the season ended last year, going into the Elite 8,
probably to face Baylor. Assuming that's the matchup that you get, you have a
younger squad this year than last. What do you have to do to have a different
outcome?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we should be familiar with them because we've seen them
three out of the last four years in the NCAA tournament. I think we have some
familiarity with them.  
You know, you have to make shots at the outside. You've got to make shots.
You've got to take care of the basketball. As Kamiko said, Griner, she's in a
league of her own, so you can't get caught up in what she does. I think you've
got to take care of everybody else. You got to make shots.  
I think when we played them down there, we played a better second half because
we settled down. Hopefully playing them, especially on their home court, has
given us the opportunity to see her and play against them. It's not our first
time, which hopefully will help us.  
  
Q. The deeper you go into the season, it seems Kamiko keeps raising her
game. Couldn't you almost make a case that she's the most valuable player on
the team at this point?  
COACH WARLICK: Absolutely. I totally agree with you. We're asking her to lock
down the opponents' best offensive player, then we want her to make plays on
the offensive end as well.  
She has stepped up. She has a maturity about her. She's just taken this team.
She's wrapped her arms around this team and said, Let's go.  
I will tell you, at the beginning of the year, if I had to say Kamiko was
going to be our leader, I would say no. But our players love her. She's done a
heck of a job on and off the floor being a leader for them.  
So my hat is off to her. She has exceeded my expectations. I knew what Kamiko
could do. It was just a matter if she was going to commit to do it, and I
think she has. She and Izzy both have stepped up and played big for us. She's
done a heck of a job.  
  
Q. In this game in particular, it seemed like she not only limited
Ellenberg, but she was responsible for entry passes.  
COACH WARLICK: I think Kamiko Williams is an extremely talented young lady.
When she puts it all together, she gets a great mindset, she can do just about
anything.  
I think Kyra spent a lot of time with her preparing her for this game and she
had a mindset of what she needed to do and she did it.  
When she gets zoned in, she understands that our success relies on how she
plays, how hard she plays, what she does on the defensive end. I think she has
now stepped up and taken a lot of responsibility.  
Four years ago, she would not have been mature enough to step up and do the
things she has now. She's a senior. It's her team. It's her and Taber's team.
She's leading by example. I can't tell you, I'm really, really proud of her. I
knew she had it in her. We're just right now getting it out of her. Very proud
of her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your bench and your rotations, substitutions.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think to bring Izzy off the bench is huge for us.
Cierra Burdick, too. Both those young ladies started, then they both went out
with injury. I think they give us a punch, especially Izzy on the defensive
end, Cierra is very consistent offensively.  
So the thing about this team is they have not complained or had a hard time
about starting, who is playing. We've got a good thing going, a good rotation,
and they know they're all going to play.  
So actually I've wanted to get Izzy back in the lineup, but I didn't know
where I could put her because everybody else is playing so well. And Jasmine
Jones, I thought she had a great game for us. She's a freshman athlete that
doesn't know how good she can be.  
I just think we stepped up and did some really good things when we needed to.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the baton that you gave to the girls, the significance
of it, where it came from.  
COACH WARLICK: We have a new coach, a new staff, so we talked about passing
the baton on from Pat's regime and what she has built, the legacy she built,
the tradition she built. There are differences, we understand that. But we
have the same heart and the same drive, the same commitment.  
We just wanted Pat to pass the baton on to our players and understand that we
represent the University of Tennessee, and what Pat built. We want to make
sure we carry on that tradition. There is a new group, a new staff, but we
still have the same belief that we're Tennessee, and we're going to represent
Tennessee and Pat Summitt to the best of our ability.  
  
Q. How big a deal is it that Isabelle will be back for Baylor? She couldn't
play the last time.  
COACH WARLICK: I think it's huge for us in any game. Any big game we have
played, we really didn't have Isabelle. She played maybe about five minutes in
the Notre Dame game and was not very effective coming off one of her knee
injuries.  
She brings this team a lot of confidence. I think she's huge to our success.
I've said it all year. I think when we get her healthy, we have her
availability, everybody else, we're a different team. We're a different team
with her, we just are.  
When you have somebody back there, she makes up for defensive miss‑assignments
or getting beat on the drive, she makes up for her presence inside with being
able to block shots. She's a huge difference for us, huge game changer for us.  
  
Q. So did Pat actually give the baton to them?  
COACH WARLICK: No, we came up with the baton. Actually our staff came up with
it. We just wanted something to represent what was and what's going to be.
Everybody that touched our program, academic advisors, our president, our
athletic director, our associate athletic director, everybody that is part of
our program got a baton, our administrative assistants, because they're just
as much a part of our program as our team and staff.  
We just thought it was important that everybody get aboard. We're not going to
be able to survive unless we have this big huge family. So we gave everybody a
baton. We've just been passing it around. It's been huge for us.  
So it's something that we identify with. Like I said, it brings back our
tradition. But we know we got to move forward and pass the baton and get our
own identity. But we're never going to lose the identity that the Lady Vols
have.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  82  
Baylor  81

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. We'll go straight to questions for our
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, the last play, the foul they called, did you feel like you got
it clean?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, I feel like I got all ball, but, you know, I mean,
wasn't my call. That's all.  
  
Q. Brittney, this was an incredibly physical game. How much might that have
bothered you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We see physical games every night. Most of the time, get more
calls.  
But, hey, you know, you just play through it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, y'all were down 19 with 10 minutes to go. Can you talk about the
way y'all fought back. What got you back in the game?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: We just kept fighting and never gave up. We pushed each other.
Came down to the wire and made big plays.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about when you hit those two free throws at the
end, did you think that might have been enough?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I did all I can for my team. I never stopped fighting. I wasn't
hitting all of my shots, but I never stopped shooting. I made some big shots
down the stretch. I made all my free throws.  
We were right there. Just couldn't finish it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about how difficult it is with a team like that.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: They jumped on us from the start and we didn't respond. Had a
late start late in the second half, picked it up.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes and continue with questions
for coach.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've seen every conceivable defense to stop Brittney, but it
seemed like they always had three players in her vicinity at all times.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm sure Jeff could answer better than I could. I think they
were in a box in one. Whoever was on one side, they had another play behind
her. He can tell you better what they did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their zone, that they were double ‑ and triple‑teaming
Brittney.   
COACH MULKEY: You want to attack dribble‑penetration, but you also have to hit
some 10‑ and 12‑foot jumpers early in the game. I thought other than them
shooting lights out on the offensive end, I thought we were patient with what
they were doing defensively.  
Guys, you just had an opportunity to beat a team that made 16 threes and
Griner got 10 touches, and you go up 1 with nine seconds to go, that's pretty
remarkable. You're supposed to get blown out if you get 16 threes, and we
didn't get blown out.  
  
Q. How critical was it not to have a timeout there at the end? What
specifically should have happened?  
COACH MULKEY: They've been taught what to do there. I think they were in such
shock that it was a foul called, and I'll be glad to answer any referee
question you want to ask me, because I don't mind getting fined, so ask me.
Now is the time to ask me, okay?  
But we didn't do what they've been taught to do. We're supposed to throw it.
You've seen us do it many times, throw it to halfcourt for Griner, then let
the two guards cross and look for a good shot.  
I don't know really other than maybe they were in a state of shock that a foul
was called there. I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the officiating in this game.  
COACH MULKEY: I thought the game started out way too physical, way too
physical. I thought that all three of them, if they go past this round of
officiating, it will be sad for the game.  
I thought the two critical calls at the end of the game were really bad.
Jordan Madden drives in the paint. We already have the missed shot. She calls
an offensive foul on Madden right there. Well, why so late? Odyssey Sims had
the rebound in her hand.  
Then I don't know about that at the end. It was on the opposite end. I'd have
to go see it. You saw it. What did y'all think? Was it a foul? Did anybody
here think it was a foul? Honestly, tell me.  
  
Q. I thought it was a foul.  
COACH MULKEY: Okay. All I can tell you is the one in front of me, the charge
was critical, it was critical. I thought it got personal with both teams. When
you allow it to be that physical, you have taunting. I thought Schimmel went
and got in Griner's face and all they did was warn her. When Odyssey and
Schimmel got into it right there, it became a technical and a technical.
What's the difference?  
It got out of hand and it got personal with players, and you don't like to see
that.  
  
Q. It seemed to get out of hand, like you said. Both coaches were jumping
around. Were you concerned that your players were going to keep their
composure when coaches and everyone were sort of going crazy on the
sidelines?  
COACH MULKEY: When you're down 19, then up 1 with nine seconds to go, do you
think they kept their composure? We were down 19 and we went up with nine
seconds to go? Did they keep their composure?  
  
Q. I was talking about the last possession when the foul was called, were
you concerned people were going to make the right decision?  
COACH MULKEY: The girl drove by Griner, your All‑American post player. I'm not
ever concerned about Brittney making a bad decision. You said it was a foul.
I'll have to go back and see it. I don't think the referee raised his hand
that it was a foul. I thought he was raising his hand that it was going the
other direction. I thought he was just going to say it was our ball. I don't
know.  
I am proud of the fact that the kids fought hard because they could have quit
on you really, and they didn't.  
Compliment and credit Louisville. If Louisville can hit 16 threes a game, good
Lord, they'll win a national championship.  
  
Q. Did you feel those threes they hit, were they open shots? Did they maybe
surprise you with how deep they were shooting them?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the post player that Griner is guarding, she hits a
couple. That's when you know it's going to be a long day. I'm not sure she's
taken a whole lot of threes all year.  
That was their game plan, to shoot a lot of threes, and they made a lot of
them. We would cut the lead, they would hit another three late in the shot
clock.  
Of the 16, I'm not quite sure how many of them were open because of our poor
defense, where they penetrated, kicked out, we helped off. But you got to make
shots. They weren't coming in the paint, were they? And they made 'em.  
  
Q. There early in the second half, you cut it to 5. Then they hit seven
threes. They made the big lead. Did that make it the toughest to come back
on?  
COACH MULKEY: Every three that they hit when we would cut the lead made it
that much tougher. You keep thinking through the course of the game that
they're going to start missing some. But they never did. Then I just thought
that our full court pressure allowed us to make plays and got us back in it.  
Tough way to lose. It's hard to lose when it's your last game, but it's even
harder the way that game ended. Makes it a little tougher.  
  
Q. Did you express your opinion to the officials as the game was going
along? Were you very vocal about that?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, yes.  
  
Q. You've had other physical games since you've had Brittney. Did you think
more was allowed in this game?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, yes.  
  
Q. You hate to see players, not just Brittney, go out after all they've
accomplished fighting back tears. How do you as a coach help your team put
this in perspective so they're not remembering this one loss but all they have
accomplished?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you don't do it tonight. There's nothing I can say to them
tonight that's going to make them feel good. You just try to help them get
their composure and you protect them like a mother hen.  
As I told them in the locker room, I'll take every hit you want to write,
about we choked, Baylor or bust, epic disappointment. Put it right here on
these shoulders. Don't you point one finger on those kids, you put it right on
me.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Tennessee  74  
Oklahoma  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Sherri Coale from Oklahoma. Coach,
your thoughts about this afternoon's game.  
COACH COALE: First of all, I just want to congratulate a very, very good
Tennessee team. I thought they played extraordinarily well today. First half
they really made a bunch of baskets early, kind of punched us right at the
beginning.  
But I am incredibly proud of our basketball team. Thought the final five
minutes of the game they just fought with a passion and spirit that defines
our program.  
Even though we didn't win the game, the season is over, I could not be more
proud of a group of kids.  
These guys have done amazing things this season against really unbelievable
odds. To lose Mo in the first nine minutes of the game, a kid that plays 40
minutes for us, to survive, hang around, keep fighting, just depicts the
character of this team.  
I have loved coaching them and I am so sad that I don't get to coach them
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Joanna, you seem pretty emotional. Can you talk about what the last few
weeks have been like for you and the emotions you were feeling as the final
seconds ticked off.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Well, it's always sad at the end of something. This is just
the end of a part of my life. This team means so much to me that it was really
sad.  
But I'm looking forward to the future and I know this team's going to be great
next year.  
  
Q. Sharane and Joanna, if you could talk about the offensive struggles
today.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: I mean, you can't stop shooting because the ball's not going
in. You got to keep trying. I mean, you just got to keep trying. That's what
we did.  
I mean, eventually we started making shots. But by that time, it was too late.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: We did everything right execution‑wise. We got open shots.
They just weren't falling. I don't know if you could call it nerves or a
different backdrop, I don't know. But sometimes the ball just doesn't go in
the basket.  
We did everything we possibly could. It just wasn't our night shooting.  
  
Q. Joanna, you were so excited to get to come home. Can you talk about the
atmosphere.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: It was amazing. Just running out on the court and hearing
people scream and yell for us, that was really, really awesome. I think just
coming home and playing my last game, our last game of the season at home, was
really special and it's something we'll cherish.  
  
Q. When Morgan had to go out of the game, how did that affect you guys in
the immediate aftermath of that, emotionally and on the court?  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: You got to find a way. I mean, that's the only answer. You
can't panic. We still had basically the whole first and second half to go. I
mean, if anything, play hard for her. She doesn't want you to feel sad, dig a
hole just because we're emotional.  
You just got to play through it.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Yeah, Morgan is our point guard, she plays, like coach said,
almost 40 minutes a game. She's kind of the floor leader, gets us in the
offense and everything. We kind of missed that.  
At the same time we had Jasmine. She's a fifth‑year senior and can run the
offense just as well.  
It was kind of both ways, just a different feel in the game with Jasmine in,
but at the same time, we trusted her completely. It wasn't that much of a...  
  
Q. With all the ups and downs of the season, the emotion after the game, did
you hear the ovation your crowd gave you at the end of the game?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: It was really, really special. I really appreciate them all
staying and cheering and everything. It means a lot to be appreciated for what
we've done this year.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: Yeah, I agree. It was just great. My first Sweet 16 and I
got to come home and, you know, just see this crowd. It was just an amazing
feeling. I want to do it again. I am going to do it again. We're going to do
it again, so...  
  
Q. Joanna, last time we talked about Tennessee you said they were really
quick. Was tonight different from last time? Has anything changed? Did they
just seem like the same team?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Well, I think at first they had a couple quick transition
baskets, and I think it kind of shocked us a little bit.  
We stopped their transition. I don't think it was the quickness so much. We
got a little uptight, wound up, and I think that's what really affected our
offense.  
  
Q. Joanna, if Baylor wins this second game, you know Baylor's post as well
as anybody, you went against the Tennessee post today, can you give us a
comparison between those two post players?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Obviously Baylor has the size advantage. I don't know. I
think it's going to be a physical game between the two of them. They're
similar in some ways, but very different in a lot of ways.  
I think Tennessee is probably quicker. Baylor, it's hard to get around
Brittney.  
  
Q. Joanna, obviously disappointing to have it end this way, but is this a
thing where it may take you a little time to appreciate what you've been able
to accomplish?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Uhm, probably a little bit. We've kind of across the year
taken a step back and, Okay, we're doing something special right now. But at
the end I guess now, it might take us a little while just to really bask in
what we've accomplished.  
  
Q. Joanna, if one of your younger teammates comes to you in the next few
days and says, I want to make the kind of jump you made in your career, what
would you tell them?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: First of all, I'd tell them to get in the gym and work,
because that was a big part of it. But also just to play free and to play to
have no regrets because that's the way I played this season.  
  
Q. What do you see from this team next year? Do you think a game like you
had today, Sharane, can catapult you toward doing this kind of thing box score
‑wise next year?   
JOANNA McFARLAND: We're going to be great next year. The league is going to be
somewhere where they could win the league, I think. They're only losing one
starter and they're going to get a lot of people back. They're going to be a
force to be reckoned with next year. They're going to be really good.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: Well, I feel like I can make an impact. This game alone has
taught me a lot, just this one game. I mean, after the game, I realized these
seniors taught me something. Whitney Hand taught me how to be a leader on the
court. Lyndsey taught me how to play with emotion. Jo taught me how to be
tough, crash, rebound, want the ball. Jazz taught me how to love defense.  
I just learnt all these things from these seniors. I'm going to be a junior,
but I'm going to show all my teammates that we can do this. I'm going to take
this role as being one of the leaders and try to bring us back here, bring us
further.  
I think next year is going to be great. I can't wait.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. We'll now take
questions for Coach Coale.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the impact Kamiko Williams of Tennessee had on the
game.  
COACH COALE: Big, strong guard. Gives us a matchup problem. Try to keep
Sharane on Simmons because she's a prolific scorer, that puts Vegas on Kamiko,
which is a bad thing size‑wise.  
Great athlete, good rebounder, really strong defender, hard to get around,
plays really hard. Yeah, she impacted it in a variety of ways.  
  
Q. Right now, is it hard to embrace don't cry now but be happy because it
happened?  
COACH COALE: Not really. When you're proud of your kids and they did
everything you asked them to do, not really. I would love to be going to New
Orleans to play in the Final Four. The thing that makes me most sad is we
don't have practice tomorrow. I don't get to be around them in the same
environment together that we've been in up to this point.  
That's sad, but at the same time, wow, what a ride they took us all on. They
were unbelievable. I got to be a part of that, so...  
No, not that hard.  
  
Q. Sharane's game was inspiring, how she played. I know she's given you so
many tough minutes throughout the year. When you think about what she could
provide for you, you have to be pretty optimistic about her coming back and
leading this team next year.  
COACH COALE: You know as inspiring as her play was for 40 minutes tonight, I
think that little speech she just gave might have been more so. Now you see
how we were able to do this. They get it. She'll be back for two more years.  
  
Q. This game and this tournament, the emotions run so high. Close games,
emotions peak at the end. This got away from you early. Can you describe how
you manage your emotions during a game when it's clear early on that it's not
your night.  
COACH COALE: Well, that's the difference. You thought it got away from us and
it was over early and I had to manage my emotions. I didn't. I didn't think it
was over. With four minutes left, I thought, Stranger things have happened,
let's go make some baskets. You're in the moment.  
This team has done incredible things this year in the face of situations where
most people would just succumb and say, All right, let's get 'em next time.
Not these guys.  
As their leader, I don't get to do that either. We just played a
possession‑by‑possession game. You think in a minute, those shots Vegas was
getting, they would go. They did go eventually, just too little too late.  
  
Q. Could you talk about when you lost Morgan, what that did in terms of
putting all the pressure on Jazz.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, that was one of those where you're like, Really? Seriously?
After everything, now we're going to drop another one right here in the Sweet
16?  
I had a feeling when Morgan hit the floor it might be a concussion because she
hit really hard.  
Fortunately Jazz has experience leading the basketball team, though most of
the season when she has subbed in, she's not subbed in as point guard, she's
played anything from 2 that 4. Morgan plays 38 to 40 minutes a game. There was
a lot of pressure on Jazz. I thought she handled herself really well. What
hurt us worse was Tennessee changing defense.  
I was really proud of her. I thought she fought like crazy and defended and
rebounded and did all the things we asked her to do.  
  
Q. Talk about the senior class, the legacy they're going to leave here.  
COACH COALE: Well, we have on our locker room door in every entrance, Leave
your story better than you found it. It's what we challenge our kids to do,
every single class that comes through. That's your charge.  
We've had some pretty special people and some pretty special classes at the
University of Oklahoma. That gets to be a rather daunting task after a while.
You leave your story better than you found it. Most of them find a pretty good
story these days.  
These four kids did. The fiber of who we are, the character that they
displayed, their belief, their trust, their faith, admiration in one another
is off the charts.  
All things that are good they left us.  
  
Q. It's a really young post crew for Tennessee, but they're developing
quickly. How would you gauge them, specifically Burdick and Harrison?  
COACH COALE: Really, really good tonight. Really good from the high post.
Really athletic. Have perimeter skills as well as great length. They gave us
trouble. Against the zone, they make good decisions. Against the man, they
were very physical.  
I thought they were really good.  
  
Q. Even though Morgan left the game, she seemed to stay in it emotionally.
Can you talk about her on the bench after her injury.  
COACH COALE: I'm sorry, I was into the game and I didn't really pay attention.  
I expect her to be in the game. She's a leader, she's a captain. It's what she
does. I know she was incredibly dizzy. I know she was capable of doing what
she was supposed to do.  
  
Q. It seemed like you had a lot of momentum when you came out of the locker
room. Can you talk about the adjustments you made at the half?  
COACH COALE: I think we were a little bit like a boxer who got stunned in the
first half, disoriented, shaky, we lost Mo. They popped us pretty good. For a
little bit there they were shooting 85%. Like seriously?  
But then we steadied them at halftime, talked about having been there before,
having come back from behind before, made a little adjust on ball screen
coverage, talked about establishing Nic in the post. I thought she came out
and performed as a different kid in the second half.  
You know, we had ourselves right there. Would love to know how the story might
be different had we made a couple of those open shots early in the second
half. We got stops. Crowd was behind us. We got exactly the looks that we
wanted and they just didn't go in, two or three of them, all the way into the
bottom of the basket and back out.  
It takes life from you when you have those, especially when you're behind, and
they don't go down. Yet we battled, continued, we just couldn't dig ourselves
out of the hole we put ourselves in early.  
  
Q. Considering the narrative of this season as a whole, it didn't end up the
way you wanted it to, did this team climb every step to the ladder?  
COACH COALE: You know what, they did and then some. The way I feel about these
kids will fill me for years. The young guys who got to see the examples set by
the senior class, what a gift they've been given. Whitney and Lyndsey were
absolutely unbelievable this year.  
They're two guys that they don't get to play any more, they show up every day,
they stay invested. That is so hard. The easiest thing to do is just seal up,
maybe be there, but not really be there. Those two guys were all in every day.  
I know that left a gaping, open wound inside their heart, and they did it
anyway. Those kids they did it for, they know. They'll be forever indebted.  
Now they'll treat their future teammates in the same manner. They know what it
means to be right. Preach it all you want, but until kids feel it, it's hard
to get it done. That's the gift the senior class gave these guys.  
Did we climb up the ladder? Yeah, I think we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it was like going against Holly, how she does or
doesn't resemble Pat Summitt?  
COACH COALE: I don't think they look a thing alike (laughter). Thank goodness
I wasn't going one‑on‑one against Holly. I'm a little irritated I didn't get
any asks on where would I be on the one‑on‑one tournament.  
Here is what Holly has done. Honestly, what a tough job. Seriously, do you
want to follow Pat Summitt?  
Holly has put her personality on that team. She jumps around the sidelines,
has a lot of energy, passion, yet she's fun, has some humor wound up in all
that. I think her team is feeding off that. I told her that at halfcourt, what
a difficult position, yet what a fantastic job she had done with this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments.  
COACH COALE: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with head coach Holly Warlick, then we'll take
questions from the floor.  
COACH WARLICK: Excited to be here obviously. Our team has worked extremely
hard to get to this point. We, as everybody else, have dealt with injuries,
and we're young. But that has not played a part in our struggles.  
We have I think the majority of our team, everybody back, except one young
lady, excited about that. Really love this team. They work hard. For coaches,
that's half the battle. As a coach, you want to be able to coach and not coach
effort. For the most part, I've not had to coach effort this year.  
Excited to be here in Oklahoma City. Everyone has treated us very nicely.
We've been here before. It's just a great place to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. You talked about being here before back in 2008. Pretty eventful
regional. What do you remember from that weekend?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we won, so...  
Had Candace Parker. She dislocated her shoulder. We won. You can't forget that
opportunity we had here.  
Yeah, great crowd. We played Texas A&M in the finals, so...  
Very eventful for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the journey this team has been on just to get here,
the ups and downs, what has made it such a special ride so far.  
COACH WARLICK: Sure. Starting our season off with a loss on the road to UT
Chattanooga. When you look at our schedule, I know as coaches it made us very
nervous. First three out of the four games were on the road.  
I think this team, they've worked extremely hard in practice. We've had to
deal with injuries, but we just seem to keep going and different people step
up, just play different positions.  
Kamiko Williams has played anywhere from the 1 to 4 position because we had to
move around. We start off ranked 24. We've just played with a chip on our
shoulder. As I said earlier, when you play hard and you have a lot of effort,
great things happen.  
I think our practices have been very competitive. They listened. Haven't had
to coach effort. I think they understand the importance of hopefully now
defense and rebounding.  
We're an offensive‑minded team trying to teach them to play on the other end.
So I think they bought into it when we got into our season. And I tell you, I
have an unbelievable staff. When I got hired here, the first thing I thought
was important was to go out and get the best staff I think for the University
of Tennessee. I went out and got Kyra Elzy, Jolette Law, Dean Lockwood stayed.
It's amazing how my staff has formed relationships with the players, has a
great knowledge of the game, obviously great recruiters. But we put a lot of
time being around our kids.  
I think it has paid benefits for us. It's a fun team to be around. We get
upset with them every once in a while, but they are a fun group to be around.  
I think we've put in time and a lot of effort in giving them confidence. I
think it's paid off.  
  
Q. Holly, defensively this team has not always gotten it. You've talked
about that. The last game against Creighton you said may have been the best
defensive performance of the year. After that result, can you sense this week
in practice maybe the team is a little more excited about practicing and
learning defense than they have been prior?  
COACH WARLICK: I hope so (laughter). Every time I get up here, I'm preaching
defense and rebounding.  
I do. The worst thing we did in defense is we couldn't guard the three ball.
Creighton was second in the nation shooting the three ball. Something had to
give.  
I think they understood that like Texas A&M, we had a great offensive night,
but we couldn't stop them. So I think after that loss, then what we had to do
the first and second rounds, I think they get it and understand that we have
to play on the defensive end.  
You got to make stops. I mean, Meighan Simmons can score 20 points, but if her
player scores 30 points, it's not helping us. I'm just using her as an
example. Any of them.  
Just try to make sure they understand the importance of defense and really
team defense. You got to lock your player up, but it is a team defense. I
think they're getting it. It's only taken the whole year, but I hope we got
it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're not inside Oklahoma's locker room, but as you watch
film and digested them, talk about what you see that make them go. They
weren't really expected to still be playing at this point.  
COACH WARLICK: I think they were motivated to get back here to play, number
one. I think they're extremely resilient. They're dealing with a ton of
injuries. But I think Sherri is a great coach and they play hard. I don't care
if they're dealing with five people, six, seven, eight, they play extremely
hard.  
She's got them representing Oklahoma. At this point you got to be doing
something right to get to the Sweet 16. I think Ellenberg has stepped up her
game. I think McFarland stepped up her game. I think they play extremely well
together and feed off each other.  
I don't care what their record is. It's survive and advance, and that's what
they've done.  
  
Q. What are your advantages in the matchup tomorrow, what advantages do you
have?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we've got a little bit more players to play, number one.
I think with Isabelle Harrison back, it really helps us inside. Really takes a
lot of pressure off of Shaar Graves. I think we've got quick guards.  
Our thing is we tend to quick shoot the basketball. I just think we've been
seasoned and have all different styles, so I hope that we're ready for their
style and how hard they play. I want to make sure we match their intensity.  
It has been really good to get our big kid back just because we needed a
different presence inside.  
I think Izzy has brought us a lot of confidence since she's been back. I would
hope that we'll use our inside game 'cause of our height and our physicalness.  
I hope I answered your question (smiling).  
  
Q. Holly, whether it's you, Sherri, any women's basketball coach, there's a
very good chance you're going to have at least one ACL or some tough injury.
On the women's side, it's almost like you have to go in with the mindset of I
know we're not going to have everybody we start off with. How much of that has
to be a mindset that you never let be a mental block for you?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, it is. You have to have 15 people on scholarship because
you got to count on, unfortunately, injuries. We got into the NCAA, I've got
to where we didn't go against each other a lot. Any kid that hit themselves
and fell down, you get nervous. I think at times your philosophy changes when
your numbers are down. You don't want to make contact but you still have to
keep them in shape.  
You have to understand, like this year, Isabelle had two knee injuries and
hurt her ankle. Cierra Burdick broke her hand. Kamiko Williams sprained both
her ankles in one game. I don't know how you do that, but she did that.  
It's just part of our game across the board. It's part of the game. I think as
coaches, I know for our team, we're going to recruit more players so we have
enough to play and play the way we want to play.  
  
Q. Holly, I don't know exactly where to go with this question, but I'd like
for you to reflect on succeeding a legend. It's not easy. Are there easy parts
of it that you like very much or difficult parts that are difficult?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think if you think about it, it's difficult to follow a
legend. I just don't let myself go there.  
Pat was my coach. She was a mentor for me. Now she's a great friend of mine.
So I see Pat in a different light than probably everybody else, which is a
great thing for me.  
She's still around. I still love her around. I want her at every practice. I
talk to her daily. But I can't let myself go there. When I think you're
coaching at the University of Tennessee, following Pat Summitt, it blows my
mind a little bit. So I don't let myself go there.  
I think there's one thing that stands out for me that Pat taught me, is you
surround yourself with great people. I think when I got my staff,
administration, on down to assistant coaches, I allowed them to do a lot.
That's what Pat afforded me. She let me do a lot of things.  
So I don't feel like it's me, it's all me, and I have to make every decision,
because Pat didn't make every decision. She taught me that. So it's a group
effort. It's a team effort. That's how I look at it.  
I just try to focus on every game, each game at a time. I still use her as a
resource. I'm thankful that she was a part of my life as far as teaching me
her philosophy and what's important in basketball, what you need to focus on.
I think that has helped me in that transition.  
But I think probably what's difficult has been not having her in the light
that I'm used to seeing her, her sitting there and watching our team. But it
brings to light for me knowing that she is there and I still have her to
bounce things off, and our kids still have her around.  
It's been a great ride for me and a great opportunity. It has been tough, as
well. So it's a little bit bittersweet. I just relish every day she's with me
and the opportunity to still have her on staff.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments and best of luck
tomorrow night.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student‑athletes, Taber Spani and
Kamiko Williams. We'll take questions from the floor for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. I know that you guys were chosen by SEC coaches to finish fifth in the
SEC. I know your coach was just in here and said she feels like you're just
now getting completely invested in defense. With that in mind, how did you go
14 ‑2 in the SEC? What allowed you to sort of take off as a team?   
TABER SPANI: Well, I think I do agree that we're just starting to kind of
finally buy in completely. I think during the SEC, we would have some really
great spurts of defense, but we just wouldn't be consistent. I think with a
young team, consistency, being able to sustain that for 40 minutes was
something we had to struggle with.  
I think offensively our ability to push the ball. We were scoring pretty much
between 75 to 80 points a game. I think that helps you. But I think the fact
that now we're buying into defense is just going to hopefully make us all the
more dangerous.  
But I guess it's the fact when we could turn it on, we could turn it on. With
a Sweet 16 appearance like this, you can't do that. I think we're finally
buying into that.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I mean, I completely agree on that. I think also, too, we
watch film, watch our bad clips where we can learn, and we watch our good
clips on what helped us defensively win that game. We go back with our
practice guys and do it on the court.  
We're winning games. Like she said, offense has helped us. Especially Coach
Elzy stressed that defense was the key to the game. We won the first two
rounds, we're about to play a good team, four players scoring in
double‑digits. We're buying into it. I'm pretty sure in practice we're going
to prepare for it.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about how tough it will be to slow down Aaryn
Ellenberg.  
TABER SPANI: Well, we have a lot of respect for her. I've watched her
throughout her career. She's a great flat‑out scorer. She's not limited on
anything on the offensive end. She's going to get a lot of attention from us,
we'll key in on her and limit touches. When she does catch the ball, make sure
we're in her space and pressure her because she shot the ball very well up in
Dayton. We're going to have to understand that.  
We'll adjust throughout the game depending on how it goes. But she definitely
has our attention and we respect her a lot.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I agree with Taber. At the same time coming from a defensive
mindset, I'm probably going to be the one guarding her, I'm going to have to
not get discouraged.  
Just constantly staying after her, don't give her space, try to limit her
touches, keep my confidence in guarding her. I think that's going to be key.  
  
Q. You mentioned you were playing a great team. I don't know how many people
would have said that about Oklahoma two weeks ago, a month ago, six weeks ago.
Do you really see a great team, and how do you make yourself continue to look
at them that way so you bring your best game?  
TABER SPANI: There's 16 teams left. At this point, especially if you won two
in a row, you can get hot. When you start winning and gaining confidence,
every team is dangerous.  
I think, you know, collectively we haven't watched a ton of film on them from
the entire season. But what they're doing right now, that's what's making them
great.  
As for us playing them tomorrow, that's all you can focus on is the here and
now, how they've been playing lately. They have great players. They have great
elements.  
In the last few weeks, they're starting to really gel and come together. Like
I said, we haven't seen their earlier season, what was going on, but right
now, they're kind of starting to find their way.  
So whenever you have great talent, great players like that, a great coach who
has been to a Final Four, has experience like that, then you have a team
that's dangerous.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: Like what Taber said, they have more than one option they go
to. A lot of teams we play, there's one or two people we have to focus on.
They have a lot of people that can score. That means more than one of us will
have to play defense.  
Like she said, they just have more options, a lot of elements, a lot of people
they can go to. There's 16 teams left, they're one of them, and they're in our
way.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow night and thank you very much, ladies.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Louisville head coach Jeff Walz. Any
opening comments.  
COACH WALZ: I'd like to say thank you. Very excited about the opportunity to
be playing in the Sweet 16 and looking forward to taking on a very talented,
well‑coached Baylor team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Jeff, Kim said she doesn't know what defense you run mixing it up against
Purdue. I guess that's the perception you wanted.  
COACH WALZ: Half the time I'm not sure our players know either. That's what
makes it so good. We're just not in a situation where we can come out and play
man‑to‑man for 40 minutes, I've got you, you've got me. So we have to sit here
and try to disguise things as much as we can, try to catch teams off balance
if possible.  
Being able to do that has given us the opportunity to create a lot of
turnovers, and we've been able to score off of those.  
So we'll come out here tomorrow night. If we can get away with putting six on
the floor, we will, if not, we won't. We'll try at least once.  
  
Q. What have you been doing in practice this week or what do you plan on
doing in the next hour or so to prepare for Brittney Griner?  
COACH WALZ: There's not much to do. I mean, she's just a special basketball
player that we're going to do what the past 34 teams have done when they
played them: try and keep her away from the basket, if possible, try to make
her earn all of her points, try to make sure we don't allow her too many
opportunities, when she does miss her shot that she can get her own rebound.
That's what she does well: if she misses, she usually gets her own miss back.  
We're going to try to be as physical as we can like everybody else and see if
we can't make her shoot turnaround jump shots instead of layups.  
  
Q. From a mental aspect, how do you approach playing the No.1? Do you
approach it any differently?  
COACH WALZ: No, I mean, we're fortunate enough to play in the Big East, so
we're playing Notre Dame twice, UConn. We're playing against No.1's the entire
season.  
At this point in time, you're just going out and competing for 40 minutes of
basketball clock in two hours. We just have to try and do the best we can at
trying to confuse them, if possible, trying to make sure we limit them to one
shot. Then we have to make sure we get good looks each time down the floor.  
But mentally, our kids are excited to play.  
  
Q. You hear sometimes about teams using goofy tactics in practice to
simulate Griner's wingspan. Have you taken to any of those, brooms, paddles,
or more a traditional route?  
COACH WALZ: No, we haven't done anything like that. We've just gone with our
players, our practice guys. But before we left, we haven't done anything like
that at all.  
We're going to come out here. I've told our kids, if you come out and play
scared, it's not going to matter. So we're going to try to come out and
attack. At the same time I might not be smart, but I don't think I'm dumb.
We're not going to throw the ball in the low block and say shoot over her. At
the same time, we're going to try to make her move some and see if we can't
get some other kids involved that she's not guarding to possibly score in the
block.  
At the same time, if we have a shot, our goal is to shoot it and don't worry
if she does block a few of them.  
  
Q. This is a pretty balanced group among your starters. Is that sort of by
design?  
COACH WALZ: We are very fortunate. With the injuries that we've sustained,
we've still been able to compete at a high level because of the balance that
we have.  
I knew going into the NCAA tournament that we were going to need Antonita
Slaughter to make some shots for us, especially when we got past middle and
the first round. I knew she was going to have to score in order for us to get
past Purdue.  
She got back to shooting the ball like she had the entire season. She took
about a month off, but we were just happy that she found her shot again.  
We have about six or seven that can score between 15 and 18 on any given
night. With having that ability, it at least makes it a little harder for
teams to try to focus on just one player.  
If we're going to have the opportunity to have success and have a chance to
win tomorrow night, we're going to have to have everyone show up and make
shots.  
  
Q. You talked about the way you try to create turnovers. Facing Odyssey Sims
on the other side, how key is it for you to not start turning it over?  
COACH WALZ: It's important for us any night we play. We've actually done a
much better job the past month and a half on taking care of the ball. We've
talked about that. That's part of our focus. Hopefully we'll have the same,
you know, outcome tomorrow night, that we'll get shots and not turn the
basketball over.  
  
Q. I know there are some things you can't do in the shot clock era, but I
remember UTEP beating Kansas with a score in the 30s. Do you think about
trying to do something crazy, strange, getting completely out of your own game
in an effort to try to do something against Baylor and Griner?  
COACH WALZ: I'm trying to put six. I'm hoping our officials are bad at math
tomorrow night and we just get 'em real confused (laughter).  
No, with the shot clock, you have a choice. You can't just pull the basketball
out and try to hold it and just try to milk the clock.  
What I want to make sure is, we're going to try to make sure when we have a
good shot, we get a shot. The whole key to anybody who has any kind of success
against them, they've been able to score.  
They're as well‑balanced as any team I've tried to prepare for. If you don't
score, you don't have a chance. So instead of sitting here and being so
concerned about how are we going to stop them, my biggest concern is to make
sure we score.  
We're going to come out here once we're finished for an hour and a half and
shoot. I'm not worried about how to stop them. I mean, who has stopped them?  
Instead of getting all concerned about how are you going to stop Brittney
Griner from scoring 30, forget it, she's going to. Figure out a way how we can
score 70. If we can figure that out, then you might have a chance to get the
last five minutes of the ballgame where shots start to matter.  
With the success they have had, it's been a while since a shot's mattered in
the last four or five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Jeff, you went against the national championship game, that UConn program
that won two championships in a row. You spoke about Baylor being as balanced
as any team. The personnel is different between these two teams. Can you make
some comparisons about programs reaching that level where they're so hard to
beat?  
COACH WALZ: It's really hard to compare because I look at the UConn teams, you
have Renee Montgomery, Tina Charles, Maya Moore. You have six or seven of them
that were scoring between 15 and 10. There was absolutely nobody that you
could back off of and say, Make 'em shoot the ball.  
On Baylor's side of it, you've got a post player you can't play one‑on‑one.
You just can't. It's about impossible. She's going to score on you. Then you
got Sims at the point, you've got Hayden, guards that shoot well enough from
the three‑point line that you have to guard 'em. They're shooting 40%. You
can't just say, Shoot all you want, because they are good enough to make 'em.  
It's a situation where that one player really makes them a difficult matchup,
but they've got five or six others that are solid basketball players.  
It's hard to compare the two teams. I know I'll be fortunate enough to have
played both. We'll see what we can do tomorrow night because we didn't have
much success with UConn.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you were as proud of this team as your national runner
‑up team. What are the elements that have led you to say that?   
COACH WALZ: Well, I go back and you prepare for a year, you're sitting here
going through your roster trying to put pieces together of who's going to play
where, who's going to be able to do this and do that. Then all of a sudden
Asia Taylor, who we expected to have back in November, is gone for the year.
Tia Gibbs, who we expected to have back for the start of practice does not
play at all during the year. Shawnta' Dyer, who started for us, tears an ACL
in mid December. Then Monique Reid comes back from missing a season from a
microfracture surgery on her knee, and she's playing with one leg for most of
the year, fighting a way, figuring out a way to do it.  
We take four players right there that started for us at one point in time. To
have them not available or limited minutes, but to still have everybody else
step up, for us to be able to continue to have success we've had, now come to
our fourth Sweet 16 in the six years we've been here, it speaks volumes about
the type of players we have.  
Instead of making an excuse, they have just taken more responsibility and
said, Hey, I have to now step my game up. You have players like Antonita
Slaughter, Jude Schimmel, Sara Hammond that have improved from last year to
this year, and you have Bria Smith, Shoni, that have continued to take on the
responsibility as they did the year before.  
So we're very fortunate to have a program and not just a team. If this was
just a one‑year thing, when you lose the amount of players that we've lost, we
wouldn't have had the success that we've had.  
We take great pride that we're building a program here, and our goal is to
continue to raise the bar.  
  
Q. Tennessee is the traditional power. Let's say 15 years ago, Louisville,
Baylor, Oklahoma, not only had they ever been to a Final Four, none of them
had ever been close. Now all of you have gone to Final Fours. Baylor has won
two championships. What does that say about building programs, how that's
helped the game?  
COACH WALZ: It sure has. That's one thing I think all of us coaches are trying
to do, is we know in order for our game to grow, our programs have to grow. I
know that Geno, everybody would like to go to the Final Four every year. In
order for our game to grow, we've got to have some programs that can continue
to put some pressure on, so it's not the same four No.1 seeds in the NCAA
tournament.  
For all of us that follow women's basketball, that's fine. But I've got
friends that won't watch it because it's the same teams every year that are
your top four seeds. If we're trying to grow our game, we have to do our job
as coaches and programs to put some pressure on them so we can get some new
faces out there, and then hopefully our tournament can get at the level the
men's is, where you watch an open practice, and there's 6,000 or 7,000 fans
there watching it.  
That's where we have to continue to make sure we take advantage of growing our
game. If you can take opportunities to get fans to come watch us practice in
these venues, you have to take advantage of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Wish you the best of luck tomorrow.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville student‑athletes Sara Hammond,
Antonita Slaughter and Shoni Schimmel. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Shoni, if you could, Coach Walz talked about some of the injury problems
you had, some uncertainty there. Talk a little bit about that, what was that
like, and how you have been able to fight through that.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, with losing four of the girls that could actually start
on our team, it was a big issue for us. We didn't really think about it that
much. We kind of moved forward with it. We ended up getting Mo back, so that
helped us a lot.  
For us to kind of not to worry about what happened, them getting healthy,
we're focused on the people that are actually able to play and help us win
games.  
It's not like we don't need 'em or anything. We still want them to get healthy
and whatnot, but we're just kind of moving forward and living with their being
hurt.  
  
Q. Sara, did you feel like there was a moment this year where things kind of
righted for the team as far as getting to this point? Was there a game or a
coming ‑together moment?  
SARA HAMMOND: I don't think there's like one game in particular. I think just
over the period of the season, we just continued to get better and certain
players matured and started step up. Look at Jude Schimmel over the past
couple games, her confidence level has risen. Her defensive presence on the
floor, her ability to get to the basket have been tremendous.  
We have Antonita Slaughter who has shot the ball like crazy. She's a person we
feel really confident in shooting the ball. Also her length and her defense
and rebounding ability.  
I think it's just a process of everybody maturing and growing throughout the
season that's kind of brought us to where we are now.  
  
Q. Antonita, coach was saying the fact that you guys have gone against two
of the No.1 seeds, you're familiar with Notre Dame and UConn, you're not
intimidated by a No.1 seed. Baylor is different in that they have Griner.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Yeah, I definitely think playing in the Big East has
definitely prepared us for this.  
But Brittney Griner, like you said, is a different animal. Coach has a game
plan for us. We have confidence in him. I think our game plan's going to work.  
  
Q. Sara, your game plan defensively has kind of changed a lot. Coach Walz
joked maybe even you guys don't know what you're doing. Talk about how the
defense has evolved.  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, we have all the confidence in the world in our coaches in
setting a great game plan defensively and offensively.  
I think coach just has like so many different things, he's so experienced,
knows so many different strategies of beating teams.  
We joke all the time, half the time we don't know what we're doing out there.
Other teams don't; it's working for us.  
With Baylor, they've had everything thrown at them. The coaches have worked
non‑stop this week to come up with a good game plan defensively.  
We like to get teams rattled and we just scramble on defense and try to make
them make bad mistakes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Best of luck.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Mulkey from Baylor. We'll go straight
to questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotions of the last game, how it is coming into
this? Can that carry over?  
COACH MULKEY: At the time the emotions of those seniors playing in the Ferrell
Center for the last time was, as you would expect, a lot of tears, but not too
much. They were tears I guess of nostalgia and also tears of joy.  
But we've moved on and forgotten about it. We're here on a business trip. The
next game against Louisville is really all we're focused on at this time.  
  
Q. Kim, one thing I've noticed with a few players, a care ‑free attitude,
fun‑loving group. Does that help defray some of the expectation?  
COACH MULKEY: That's their personality. I just stay away from 'em because the
way I get prepared for a game when I was a player and now as a coach is a lot
different than young people do. For a lot of basketball games, that's how they
prepare.  
Jordan is just the fun‑loving, happy‑go‑lucky player. Brooklyn is the
sarcastic, quick‑witted. BG is the free spirit. But they know when to focus.
It's not that they're not focused, it's just away from the court they're
college kids. Sometimes we forget that.  
So I learned about their sophomore year to not walk in that locker room before
a game because the way I think you should prepare for a game may not be the
way they prepare for a game.  
Whatever they've been doing, it's been successful, and you don't want to
change 'em.  
  
Q. Can you expand on that a little bit? When you were playing, were you an
ultraserious type?  
COACH MULKEY: Back in the day, I hate to say it, it sounds like years ago, but
I guess it is years ago, you don't have all the social media, the cell phones.
You don't have even the TVs in the locker room, the computer stuff in the
locker rooms.  
I'm not even sure we had a stereo system in our locker room. You went in, got
dressed, got taped, sat around, then you played. It's not that I was serious,
it's just that we didn't have distractions I guess I would have called it at
the time.  
I think a lot of the things these kids have access to could be distractions.
But we didn't have all that. I think back in the day all we had, the invention
of the bag phone. I know y'all don't know what that is. But I did take a bag
phone one time, or had a bag phone one time.  
  
Q. Does it challenge you as a coach to deal with personalities, free
spirits, stuff like that?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think when they're young and freshmen and sophomores,
you have to deal with it. If it is a personality that is not good for team
chemistry, it's a personality that is not focused, a personality that affects
what we do on that floor, yes, we deal with it. I did.  
I dealt with Jordan. I sat her for being silly on the floor. When you leave
that floor, if they've given me everything they have, I have to let them be
college kids after I let them out of that locker room. It's the floor that you
are mainly concerned about, how they represent you on that floor.  
Now with the thing that happened with Whitney the other day, I now had to
address that. But you address it, you teach 'em, you move on.  
  
Q. Can you speak to what you've seen out of Louisville from game tape, maybe
some areas where you plan to attack.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm not sure I know what defense they run today after watching
them because they disguise it. You think they may be into a zone, then 10
seconds into the shot clock, they're in a man. You start off running a man
offense, you see something...  
They just do a lot of things in a possession defensively.  
That's why they're very good. If you look at stats, they create a lot of
steals. When you look at them, they have great length everywhere, but you
wouldn't think they would have that many steals. I attribute that to what Jeff
has them doing defensively. When Jeff got in the game, he was with Paul
Sanderford at Western Kentucky, and his sister played there, Jaime. He learned
from some good coaches. Jeff is just an outstanding coach.  
We understand we're going to have to take care of the basketball. We
understand we're going to have to get back in transition defense. We
understand they score a lot of points.  
  
Q. Have you noticed your team being different as opposed to when you were
trying to win your first one, how they approach games?  
COACH MULKEY: I would use the word 'mature.' When you have that many seniors,
they're a lot more mature. I think they're a lot more relaxed because of the
experience that they now have having won and having lost. They lost an
opportunity their sophomore year to go to a Final Four again, then they did
what they did last year.  
They've pretty much experienced it all. Certainly more success than failure.
But they've experienced it all.  
  
Q. I know your focus is on Louisville. You have another Big 12 here. Kansas
made it. I think a lot of people kind of focused on you alone in the Big 12.
Having four teams make it say a lot about the conference, specifically
Oklahoma as a No.6?  
COACH MULKEY: Every time a Big 12 team plays, I'm rooting for them. I do agree
with you, people tend to judge our league, and it's not fair, because I know
what I have. Everybody thinks we ran through the conference these last couple
years, there's such a big gap between Baylor and everybody else.  
There may be that gap, but that doesn't mean everybody else is not very good.
This is a competitive league. It's a tough league. It's a well‑coached league.
Just look at Bonnie at Kansas. Our seventh‑place team, who everybody was
holding their breath could we get seven in the tournament, she's in the Sweet
16 for the second consecutive year, beating a team that was seeded higher and
finished higher in the SEC. I can't remember who she beat in the first round.  
  
Q. Colorado.  
COACH MULKEY: Colorado. That's two different conferences right there.  
But the Big 12 night in and night out is tough. It's just tough.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked the other day about how difficult it is to win back
‑to‑back titles, but harder to win all those other games. How has this team
for two years been able to win 74 of 75 games?  
COACH MULKEY: Talent. I'm a coach that believes in acknowledging what you
have. Recruiting is so difficult now to assemble that much talent on one team.
You have too many egos, too many parents' egos. You have too much selfishness.  
How many times as a coach can you go recruit that much talent on a team and
they all agree to come play for you? It's a rarity. They wanted to do it. They
wanted to do it because they wanted a degree from Baylor, I hope, and number
two, they wanted to win a championship.  
For the most part looks like they're all going to do that, some later than
others on graduating. But it's just talent.  
And I do know this: the most talented teams don't always win. Y'all know that.
You've seen it too many times. Once you assemble that talent, you've got to
fix egos, fix roles, let people know what is expected of them. That doesn't
happen overnight. Just to watch each of them evolve into what their role is,
accept it, be content and happy for each other, for our program as a whole,
makes you proud as a coach to have 'em.  
  
Q. You obviously lost to Louisville four years ago at this stage. Is that a
topic?  
COACH MULKEY: Look, they had Angel on that team. They were supposed to win.
That team that beat us went on to the Final Four that year, I think.  
You have to evaluate your team and place expectations that you as their coach
think is fair. I thought that we gave them a very good game. I thought we
played extremely hard. They were the better team. They went on, as I said, to
make it to a Final Four that year.  
  
Q. The one thing coaches can't control is injuries. I know you lost Shenay,
but for the most part you've been able to stay relatively healthy. How
important has that been?  
COACH MULKEY: This time of the year it's very important. I'm going to go back
to our second year when Melissa Jones, senior class come off a Final Four
their freshman year, her injury, when it happened in the Oklahoma game, was
devastating to our team.  
Injuries can completely take you out of sync and change the complexion of your
season at whatever point it happens. Sometimes you can't recover from it.  
We have been fortunate that our trainer, Alex Olson, he's been with me the
entire time he's been at Baylor. He understands when to tell me what I need to
do. I will never compromise a player's health to win a basketball game.  
We've had the little nagging injuries throughout the year, but we've been
smart in that we just rest 'em. There was a period of time when Griner's shins
were bothering her, and I wouldn't give her 20 minutes of a game. If she falls
short of the scoring record, blame me. I should have given her more minutes.  
You gauge it and do the best you can. You can't control injuries. That's a
part of the game.  
  
Q. It was a long time ago, but nine years ago this city, 0.2 seconds, how
much did that game impact you in terms of what you've even done since then?  
COACH MULKEY: First of all, it wasn't this city, it was Norman, Oklahoma. I
won't ever forget it as long as I live. I do feel like it cost us our first
opportunity to have a chance to go to the Final Four. It motivated that next
year's team that won the national championship.  
But this bunch, they don't have a clue. They would go, Huh? They don't know
that. They don't remember it. For me, I'll never forget it. Coaches have
memories like elephants, they remember things. But it doesn't affect anybody
in our locker room today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by our student‑athletes from Baylor
University. We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, if you could, talk a little bit about the personality of this
team. Coach Mulkey was talking a little bit about how now she leaves you alone
in the locker room, do your own thing. Was that a struggle at first, getting
everybody with the personalities on the same page?  
BROOKLYN POPE: Maybe last year, but this year, I think everyone knows the goal
ahead and everyone's on the same page to let our egos go to the side. The
personality of this team is mainly pride and focus. If we focus and play with
pride, we'll be fine.  
That's how I think this team has decided to approach the game of basketball
this year.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, along that same line, did it take you a while or maybe Kim a
while to let you be you?  
BROOKLYN POPE: Like me personally or the team?  
Yeah, I think me and Coach Mulkey didn't really know how to bring out the best
in me. I just think this year, it kind of came together that I'm not the type
of kid to howl or text after a game, after a practice. It's just, let me go
with it and it will be better if I find my way versus you trying to guide me.
Let me do my thing, everything will go smooth. She don't bother me at all.  
  
Q. Brittney, what has been different about going through this tournament and
trying for a championship knowing that it's going to be your last?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, just knowing that it's your last run, a little bit
different. You appreciate everything, take in everything. A little bit more
emotional, I guess you could say, after every game, knowing it's your last
time at that spot, your last time on the home court.  
That's about the only different thing compared to last year. I knew I had one
more year to do it. This time it's my last one.  
  
Q. Brittney, Kim called you a free spirit when she was up here. Does that
help you deal with some of the national attention and the expectations that
you've dealt with?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely. Like a little butterfly in a cocoon coming out.  
I don't know, it definitely helps. My personality helps me out a lot just
dealing with everything. The hateful comments and everything I get, it doesn't
bother me at all. When you're out there, Hey, that's what you think, okay,
cool. I just kind of go with the flow really.  
  
Q. Brittney, you win 74 of 75. What drives you as a team?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It's really not hard to motivate us. Coach does a great job
at it. Everybody on this team hates to lose. We love to win. That's motivation
enough right there.  
Even if the score is lopsided, we're still playing hard. Coach challenges us
every media timeout, win each media timeout, don't look at the score. If we
don't win it, she definitely lets us know. I think that's what makes us go
harder every time.  
We don't pay attention to the score, we just try to go as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Odyssey, what would you say are maybe the way or a couple ways that you
have most improved as a point guard in your time at Baylor?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I'd just say just learning the game of basketball. I think
coming from high school to college was a big step. I didn't completely
understand the game like I thought I did. Coach Mulkey, she did a good job of
helping me my freshman year, considering I had to learn everything on my own
and I had to learn quick.  
Sophomore year I kind of grew up. I just had to grow up, I guess, fast.
Winning the national championship made everything better.  
Now that I know my role, know what I got to do for my team, I understand that
it's not all about points, it's not all about stats. As long as my team wins
and I do my job as far as taking care of the ball, managing the game, then I'm
fine, and my teammates, too.  
  
Q. Odyssey, Kim talked about that she just stays away from the
personalities, the way you guys prepare for a game. With all the personalities
on this team, you as a point guard, how do you deal with that? Is it different
on the court?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: This team, we do have a lot of different personalities. I think
before the game, everyone has their own kind of way of getting ready for the
game. We understand each other. When someone has their headphones on, we don't
talk to each other.  
We just kind of go with the flow. We talk to each other sometimes. Everyone
gets into their zone a different way.  
We understand that I think on the court it's more together. We play good
together. Our personalities are set aside and we know we're on the court for
one thing, and that's to win. We take it one game at a time.  
We have a couple of differences, but on the court at the end of the day, we
bring it together and we know what we got to do.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, the Florida State game was emotional I'm sure for all the
seniors. Obviously the way the game went with Brittney dunking three times, do
you use that emotion?  
BROOKLYN POPE: With BG dunking, just how everyone feels, it was great for the
crowd. It was great for everyone who support us, Baylor, Waco. I felt like all
that adrenaline pumping inside the gym, all the positive energy on behalf of
Baylor, just really helped out team know that this is the last time we're
going to play at this gym in front of this crowd.  
I'm happy we went out the way that we did. The crowd got to see BG dunk. She
rarely ever dunked in Waco, she always dunked away, which is weird. But she
gave 'em three. It was three of her best dunks ever ‑ so far...  
  
Q. Odyssey, how much have you studied Louisville? One of the things they
like is to create a lot of stuff forcing turnovers, their steals. How much
does that put on you?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: We actually watched film two days in a row. The first day, we
just went over player profiles, who was going to guard who. Second day, we
watched their defenses. I think they're a great defensive team. They change
their defenses a lot in the middle of the shot clock, off rebounds. So that's
our main focus, trying to figure out what we're going to run as far as when
they change their defenses.  
We're probably going to watch some more film tonight. You can never watch too
much film. This is a new team. We don't know too much about 'em, so we have to
continue to watch a lot of film.  
Coach does a great job of that. So I think after we watch film tonight, we'll
be ready. We understand we're going up against a great team.  
  
Q. Brittney is a unique talent. Nobody dunks like her. Just her ability to
catch almost any pass thrown. Can you even take more chances with a player
that's as talented and as big as she is in terms of passes you wouldn't throw
to somebody else?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: First off, you're not going to come across too many 6'8" girls
that can dominate the paint, can be as athletic as her. I do take risks that I
never took since I've been playing basketball as far as some passes. Me and BG
have an understanding of how I pass the ball to her. We kind of bumped heads
last year about how I was passing to her.  
But I think I throw my passes really, really high. I probably won't ever have
to throw high passes ever when she leaves. So it does change it a little bit.  
I just think she changes the game completely: passes, dunks, shots. Everything
she does is just phenomenal. It's something like I've never seen before.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on your wins and your thoughts about
this upcoming event.  
COACH COALE: We're thrilled to be back in Oklahoma City, have the opportunity
to compete in the Sweet 16. Four tremendous basketball teams at this location.
It should be a great weekend of the highest caliber of women's basketball.  
I'm proud of my team. I'm proud of our fan base for how they're supporting and
buying tickets. Can't wait for Sunday afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. This is an interesting matchup because even though the Lady Vols like to
run, so does Oklahoma. Could you talk about this matchup.  
COACH COALE: I think we do both like to play up‑tempo, although our up‑tempos
are a little bit different. Tennessee is really, really fast, explosively
fast. Meighan Simmons might be the fastest guard I've ever seen on the floor.
You remember I coached Danielle Robinson for four years.  
We like to play fast as well. I think it's really important to play at our
speed and not theirs. Part of that is taking care of the basketball. You can
limit their ability to run a little bit if you don't turn it over obviously in
the open floor.  
I think another part of that is shot selection. We have to take the right
shots so there aren't long rebounds that lead to that transition that they
love, as well.  
  
Q. Can you describe how you held it together this year with the loss of
Whitney and injuries, your mindset after that game.  
COACH COALE: You know what, it's been a crazy ride this year. I still remember
vividly exactly how I felt the moment Whitney went down. I don't remember with
much clarity what happened after the game. But the moment she planted her feet
and went up for the jump shot I remember clearly.  
I remember holding her hand on the court and I remember walking out of an
arena that had the absolute breath sucked out of it. It was the quietest and
yet an arousing standing ovation for her. Just one of those moments in sports
you don't see very often, thank goodness.  
But we made a decision that we were going to find a way to do special things
and to be extraordinary. I think that's been the most rewarding part of this
journey, has been the continuous correct decisions by a bunch of courageous
young student‑athletes who simply wake up every day and decide they want to be
special. I don't use that word 'special' very often, but this group is
special.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your overall satisfaction of making the Sweet 16. What
does it say about this team?  
COACH COALE: That's a really fine line because we are incredibly proud of what
we've done. It is very satisfying. Here is my thing. I always have these
really smart kids. I can talk around stuff. They're going to know what's
happening anyway.  
So we just call spades spades. We talk about what an accomplishment this is to
be here. We let it sort of sink in. We looked at each other, we talked about
it, we digested it, then we said, Okay, that was fun. Now we have work ahead
of us. Don't let this be the end all. Just getting here is not enough. Who is
to say what is enough? What is enough is what you're capable of.  
We believe we have a lot of basketball left in us and that's what we're
looking for on Sunday.  
  
Q. You talk about smart kids, tough kids. Joanna McFarland embodies both of
those, especially when you've needed her in big situations. If you could
expound a little bit how she's done that.  
COACH COALE: She's one of my favorite stories because Jo is a perfectionist,
probably has been since the moment she came into the world. As a high school
player, when I watched her play in the summer, if she missed one shot, she
acted like she could not believe she missed a shot. I loved that competitive
bend she had. I loved how physical she was.  
She got to Oklahoma and expected to be perfect every day. It plagued her for a
while because one mistake would sit on her back and ride with her to the other
end. After a four‑minute interval, she couldn't move. Basketball moves too
fast, no such thing as a perfect player or a perfect game.  
In the classroom she's the same way. 98 on a biochem test isn't enough. She
thinks it should be 100. That's why she has 3.92 in biochemistry and has been
accepted into pharmacy school. It drives her it makes her great, and yet she
had to figure out how to get on the right side of that line.  
It's a precariously difficult balance to find and she found it just when we
needed her to find it most.  
That's a great story.  
  
Q. I think you've had other teams that sort of bounced around and tended to
find themselves here at the end playing their best basketball. This team did
that. It sounds like what you're saying is behind the scenes they weren't
bouncing around. Take us inside. How were they special? Even while out on the
court there were these things happening. Tell us about that.  
COACH COALE: Well, depends on what your definition of 'together' is. The
transcending trademark of this group of kids has been how much respect and
admiration they have for each other. That's been the trademark of this group.  
Never once in all of the difficult days that we went through, injury, gather
ourselves, another injury, gather ourselves. Those are lots of dynamics going
on there. Never once did that care, admiration and respect that they have for
one another vacillate in any way.  
Then we get into Big 12 Conference play. Here we go. We go great for a while.
Then all of a sudden a really tall mountain, we can't get over it, we find
ourselves in a swamp, in the middle of quicksand. In the midst of all that,
these guys continued to respect one another and care for one another. There's
just an absence of pretense that grows from that. When people are real with
one another, that allows you to continue even in the face of difficult
circumstances.  
As long as they were trying to do that, this isn't working, we have to figure
it out, if you have that core, that core is tight, and people trust one
another, they believe in one another, they have respect for one another, then
anything is always possible. So that's been the thing that's made them special
throughout the entire season.  
  
Q. One of the best moments of this program was a few years ago when Whit was
a freshman and Tennessee came, Oklahoma put on a show that day and upset
Tennessee. Coach Summitt was very close to a milestone. That was a great
moment in Oklahoma history. What did that do for your program going forward?  
COACH COALE: I love what you just said when you said Oklahoma put on a show.
What I remember most about that is Oklahoma did put on a show. I'm not talking
about my basketball team, I'm talking about the state, that environment, and
it was nationally televised for everybody that had a camera, potentially Coach
Summitt's milestone. Whether you were a women's basketball fan or not,
everybody was watching. I think Bob Knight was calling the game for heaven's
sakes.  
The state of Oklahoma, we really looked good that night. Danielle Robinson and
Whitney Hand made us look really good. That game played back yesterday on a
couple networks. I had people texting me, Does Whitney ever miss a shot? I
think she missed one. That was sort of the opening window of this is who
Whitney Hand is for the rest the world.  
Physically her career didn't play out the way the rest of us wanted to. The
light she brings, the way she makes a part of all these better, that continued
throughout and is still happening today.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the situation Holly is in. She's there as an
assistant forever, now taking over, trying to establish herself. And does this
look like the same old Tennessee or do you see some differences in them under
her?  
COACH COALE: First of all, I would just be guessing like the rest of you what
that might be like, because I never sat in that other chair, which is really
weird. Folks that have sat in it have told me that's a long, long way, those
15 inches.  
I think that Holly is in a tremendous situation, though, in that if you're
going to sit next to somebody for a long, long time as an assistant coach,
don't you want it to be Pat Summitt, really? What she's learned, been able to
acquire over the years, now it's her turn.  
I think it takes somebody who really gets that program to be able to follow
Coach Summitt, to be able to bridge that, share all those lessons and that
tradition with them. I think it was a natural choice, a great choice.  
I think she's done an amazing job. In many ways, it is vintage Tennessee. They
have better athletes at every spot than we do. They're athletic. Their guards
are big. They can all shoot it. They get after the basketball. They deny
passing lanes. All that is Tennessee and has been Tennessee for decades.  
Yet there's a little something about 'em that's different, and it's hard to
put a title on. I don't really know how to even describe it. But there's a
little something different. That's Holly Warlick. That's the stamp she's
putting on this program.  
  
Q. You mentioned the game where Whitney was so good here against Tennessee.
I know it has nothing to do with tomorrow, all things pretty much meaningless,
but then I think back to Bob Stoops after winning the 2000 Orange Bowl, like
there's some connection. Are you able to draw some connection for your team to
maybe put them in as good of a place as they can be going into it?  
COACH COALE: That's the beautiful thing about sports. If you look hard enough,
you can draw a correlation to make it feel like it's all in your favor, no
matter what.  
I think our guys do have a great, great feeling about Oklahoma playing in this
building. I think we obviously have a great feeling about playing in front of
Oklahoma fans.  
So I think as things line up, I was thinking earlier this morning, I don't
even know if Maddie Manning and Nicole Kornet, youngest on our squad, if
they're aware of that game. I have no idea. We've not referenced it much,
though I'm sure everybody around them is talking about it.  
Having been in this arena and played here and played well here on a stage with
a lot of pressure, it wasn't to go to the Elite 8, but there were a lot of
eyes on this game, to play as well as we did can only be good.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck tomorrow.  
COACH COALE: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma student‑athletes. We'll begin
with questions.  
  
Q. Joanna, when Whitney went down, a lot of people felt that's it for
Oklahoma. You rallied and played some really good basketball from that point
on, especially you. What happened that day? Why did this team actually play
even better basketball the rest of the way without your best player?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Because it was a lot of playing for the people who couldn't
play. When Whitney went down, it was four total. I remember right from our
next game, they applied a motivational clip for people who couldn't play or an
injured player. That's what hit me. I'm going to play for the people who
can't, especially my fellow seniors. I know it killed Whitney as a senior who
couldn't play.  
I think it was all of us stepping up our game so we could give the people who
couldn't play an opportunity to go and be a part of something special.  
  
Q. You played likely your best game of the season against UCLA. How do you
replicate that game, bring it back?  
MORGAN HOOK: We just went out there and said there's nothing to lose. We were
the bottom seed. We were going to go out there and play for each other. Just
like Joanna said, when Whitney went down, we were all playing to play another
game to with Jazz and Jo.  
  
Q. Joanna, I covered both of your older sisters. Both of them had different
games. How much learning from them helped you? Coach was talking about your
perfectionist streak. How have you learned to manage that?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: It's been hard. I think that's been the place that I've
grown the most over my four years, is coming to grips with the fact that you
don't have to be perfect, as long as you give everything that you have. You
can rest easy at night, have no regrets.  
As for my sisters, I owe a lot to them because they took me to our little
recreation center and beat me in the paint, taught me moves. I was probably
ahead of the game a little bit just 'cause they knew so much and told me so
much.  
  
Q. Aaryn, after all you have been through, what does it mean to make the
Sweet 16?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It's definitely a big accomplishment for us because, I mean,
we expected to be here, but not in sort of the way it went. We expected to
have Whitney and everybody by us. They're still there on the bench, but it's a
little bit different.  
It still means a lot.  
  
Q. Morgan and Joanna, do you sort of take pride in the national stage that
Oklahoma is going to be on? This is a program that is very well ‑supported.
Just the fact you're going to have your home fans, national TV audience, what
that means to you, the appreciation of women's basketball in this area.   
MORGAN HOOK: I think it shows a lot about our fans. I know they've told us so
many tickets have been sold. We can pretty much guarantee a lot of those will
be fans for us.  
It just shows that people still are interested in women's basketball and do
enjoy watching us play. I think as a team, we play with a lot of class, a lot
of championship behavior. I think it's a positive for women's basketball.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: I would agree. I think a lot of it also is the people who
came before us, the players before us who built the program, built the legacy
that we play in now. Class and grace, pass it on, a big thing in our locker
room.  
It is fun to play in front of a home crowd in Oklahoma City because it is a
really good base for women's basketball.  
  
Q. Aaryn, what is your job tomorrow and specifically is it your job to get
going quickly, to be a factor early in the game?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: My job's really just to do what I've been doing. I mean,
there's no added pressure or anything for me to try to go score the most
points or score all the points early.  
Just pretty much do what I've been doing and really just play along with the
rest of everybody else and we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Joanna, you've gone against as good of posts as there are in the country,
one in particular. Your thoughts specifically on Tennessee? It's a young,
athletic group. What are the biggest challenges that Tennessee will provide
inside?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Like you said, they're very athletic. Just from the little
bit of film we've watched, they're animals going on the boards. I think a big
thing is going to be rebounding, like always. Post defense is all about
position early. It's going to be a lot of that position game, staying low,
being ready.  
  
Q. Morgan, being the point guard of this team, you know the weapons that you
have. Griffin has grown up as a post player for you, playing well. How good
has she become and how much has she helped this team this year?  
MORGAN HOOK: She's grown with her confidence completely. I think that's what
it stems down to. I mean, last year she wouldn't call for the ball. Now she
demands the ball when she's in there. It gives us as guards confidence to pass
it in there because she is ready for it, has great position.  
I just think it comes from her confidence. That's why she has been such a
factor for us this year.  
  
Q. Aaryn, Morgan, Joanna, what is it in Coach Coale, was it somebody on the
team that brought you to where you are after everything fell apart? Did she
say something special?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It's probably just a combination of a lot of things. Her just
never letting us be satisfied with just being okay after we've lost so many
people. Just with everybody in general in our mindset as to, This isn't good
enough. Yeah, we've lost four people, but nonetheless, we're still going to
play hard and expect from ourselves just as much as we expected before.  
MORGAN HOOK: Yeah, I would say that she just never let us feel sorry for
ourselves. She said she recruits character, I think that showed when the four
injuries happened. We kind of got together and said, This is it, this is what
we have now, this is what we're going to have to do. We never had that moment
where we felt sorry for ourselves. That came from Coach Coale not letting that
happen.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: I remember being in the film room after Whitney went down, I
can't remember now, I lost it, but something like how great of a story is it
going to be. We've been through all this adversity, how great is it going to
be when we do something special. That really motivated me ‑ I think all of us.  
  
Q. Joanna, what have Whitney and Lyndsey, two senior captains who cannot
play, what has it meant their sticking around the program? What have they
given you, albeit not their presence on the court?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: They have a lot of knowledge. They've been in the system
four years. Especially Whitney, five. They know a lot and they try to help us
in whatever way they can.  
I know for me personally, because they're my senior class, I try and do
everything I can when I'm on the court for them because they can't be out
there.  
  
Q. Aaryn, how critical is hitting three ‑pointers early? That's such a big
part of the two victories you've had already. Is that something you're
consciously thinking about, getting hot early from outside?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Definitely. I mean, that's a big part of our identity. We're
all really good shooters. For us to just be able to knock down shots, it gives
us a breath of fresh air for just other things, just to be free to go after
rebounds, get lower in the stance. It's definitely important for us to make
shots.  
I think regardless of any of that, we're going to have to do a lot of other
things really well in order to win a game.  
  
Q. Morgan, Coach Coale said you guys are a special group. Do you feel
special? If so, why? What is it about you that is special?  
MORGAN HOOK: Just our togetherness. I mean, we have this bond where we want to
continue to play so we have another week together.  
I mean, I think all of these girls can vouch for it. We're like sisters. We
have that sisterly love. We go out there and play the way we play for each
other. I think that's why she says we're a special group. A lot of teams don't
really have that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Have a great game tomorrow. Thank
you.
