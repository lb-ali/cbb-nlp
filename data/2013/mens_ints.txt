_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

Saint Louis  62  
VCU ‑ 56

  
SHAKA SMART: Congratulations to Saint Louis. I thought they played great. They
were the best team in the league in the regular season, and they were the best
team in the league in the tournament. And I thought our guys fought hard,
battled, almost overcame a terrible shooting day but didn't quite overcome it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that second half run that got you guys back in it?
What kind of got you guys going?  
DARIUS THEUS: Just a little bit of spirit that coach has been talking about.
He wanted us to bring that spirit, and we got it going a little bit when I
started to play, and it helped us to cut down to the lead, started with
Briante. He brought an energy that he always brings. We just used our spirit
and our style of play, kind of helped us just to cut down the lead.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it was that Saint Louis did defensively to
frustrate you guys and cause such a rough shooting night for the team?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Definitely they backed up a lot, forced us to shoot a lot of
threes. They weren't really falling for us tonight. The shoots that we
normally make weren't falling for us.  
  
Q. Do you take any consolation in the fact that despite the loss tonight
that you guys can still look ahead to the selection show in a few hours and
the NCAA Tournament?  
DARIUS THEUS: Yeah, that's what Coach said. That's about the positive thing
that you can bring out of the situation. We did battle through all season, so
already had that bid and stuff for us to be in the tournament. But we really
wanted this one bad. But still, that's a positive out of the situation.  
  
Q. Darius, can you talk about, it's two games you've had a really hard time
against their defense. What is it that doesn't allow you to get into your
style?  
DARIUS THEUS: You know, they play aggressive defense, try to push you out,
denied the wings, just pack in a wall right there so you can't get in the lane
too much. They try to speed you up a little bit. But like I said, they're
aggressive and they're denying the wings.  
  
Q. Can you talk for a second about what it's like to try to guard Dwyane
Evans? He's a pretty formidable guy down low.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Real physical. I mean, when he posts up it's hard to get
around him, so you've got to fight hard to get in front, do the work early,
and then when he gets it try to square up as best you can because he's real
physical with the right hand, jumping up and going to the rim.  
  
Q. The same question: Why was it so difficult to get your style going
against their defense?  
SHAKA SMART: We had our style going for parts of the game. We just didn't have
it going for enough of the game. To be honest with you, we missed some shots
that‑‑ had pretty good looks that we normally would knock down. We shot a
lower percentage. I think Saint Louis certainly deserves some credit for that.
I think all year they've been the best half court defensive team in the
league, not just against us but against a lot of people.  
But you know what, with the way the game went and the way that we defended
them, particularly from the field, they got a lot of free throws, but
particularly from the field and turning them over, I'll take the shots that we
got, and I think on most nights we'd give ourselves a really good chance to
win with those shots.  
  
Q. You came into Brooklyn on a relatively strong streak. How much of a wake
‑up call is losing in this championship and what do you think it's going to do
for the team heading into the NCAA Tournament?   
SHAKA SMART: I don't think our team needs a wake‑up call. Our team played
well. I mean, I don't know what game you were watching, but somebody had to
lose tonight, today, and Saint Louis didn't want to lose, our guys didn't want
to lose, and the guys did a terrific job fighting when we got down by 13
points. I thought probably the shot of the game was Kwamain Mitchell's deep
three with the shot clock winding down, and that's a tough shot to make over
Juvonte Reddic. But that's what good players do: They step up and make shots.  
I don't really know what you're getting at, but we're going to the NCAA
Tournament next week, and if you're not motivated for that, then you shouldn't
be playing.  
  
Q. This league had at least 10 good, competitive teams. How much do you
think that will help you in preparation for this tournament?  
SHAKA SMART: Quite a bit, yeah. I think that's a good point. I thought going
into the season that this was as deep as any league in the country, and I was
wrong; it's deeper. It's deeper than any league in the country.  
You know, if you just look at the teams that were fighting to get into the
tournament, the Atlantic 10 tournament on the last day of the regular season,
those are really good basketball teams. Yeah, I agree with you. There's so
many different styles of play with there being 16 teams that the preparation,
playing against teams like Saint Louis, teams like Xavier, teams like Butler,
LaSalle, that'll really help us going into the tournament.  
  
Q. You guys were down 45 ‑32 and then you really hit them in the mouth, you
got it back to 46‑45\. Can you talk about what makes that Saint Louis team so
resilient in those situations?   
SHAKA SMART: Good players, and I think led by their coaching staff. They don't
get rattled.  
Our whole style of play is to get the other team rattled, and I think for a
stretch there we had it going the way we wanted. They were having trouble even
getting the ball inbounds. But then, they've got some older guys that stepped
up, that made big shots, the three by Mitchell, Ellis made a couple really
big‑‑ he hit that three in the corner, that was a huge one. Evans was terrific
all night. He's a tough match‑up. I thought our guys did a good job on him but
not good enough. I don't think it was so much our defense, it was more he's
really good.  
But yeah, I think we came at them. They took a punch from us, and they
responded, and that's why they're the champions. I think the bigger key for us
is that we can't dig ourselves into a 13‑point hole against a team that good.  
  
Q. Just touching upon your overall impressions of your first year in this
league, your league may get six teams in with LaSalle and UMass on the
bubble.  
SHAKA SMART: I think it's a terrific league, and it's a shame that it can't
stay the same. But that stuff's out of my hands as a coach. You know, I'll
tell you what, I'm really proud of our guys for the way that we stepped into
this league and competed both in the regular season and in the conference
tournament.  
You know, I think sometimes the media likes to question people and question
players and coaches and teams, but then when they do things, when they do find
success, it's almost like you should have done it, and I think if everyone
stops for a second and realize what our guys have done, went from a league
that was I think this year the 25th best league in the RPI to a league that's
in the top six or seven conferences in the country and we finished in the top
two, came very close today to winning the tournament championship, that's a
testament to our guys.  
We didn't know we were in this league until last summer, and our guys never
turned away from the challenge. They stepped up, they battled. They're in that
locker room crying right now, but they have nothing to feel sorry about
because they battled and fought, and honestly, we're one or two plays away
from not only at least sharing the lead, the title in the regular season, but
also winning today.  
But Saint Louis gets credit. They did what they needed to do. They have a
veteran team. They're very well coached. I think Jim Cruz did a phenomenal job
stepping into obviously a difficult situation, and they're going to be a very,
very tough team for someone to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Brad Stevens has called Saint Louis a Final Four team. Is this a team
that kind of has that potential?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, I think that first of all our guys set a goal at the
beginning of the year‑‑ we set several goals but one of the goals was to win
today, and the guys did a great job of getting to the point of having a chance
to win this game today, but we came up short. And when you come up short of
your goals and they really, really matter to you, it hurts. It hurts the
coaches, it hurts the players, it hurts our fans, it hurts the families, it
hurts everyone that's invested.  
But the reality is the season is not done. There's teams that lost in this
tournament, and it was their last game. We're not one of them. So I told our
guys, hey, we're going to use this to motivate us and we're going to use this
to provide fuel for what we want to do going into the NCAA Tournament.  
In terms of Saint Louis being an NCAA Final Four team, sure, they could do it.
They definitely could do it. I think it all depends on match‑ups. I mean,
you're talking about being one of the last four teams playing in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a very tall order. But it's definitely not out of the realm
for those guys. They have all the ingredients of a team that can make a run in
the NCAA Tournament. They're very well coached. They've got older guys that
don't get rattled. They're good inside, they're good outside, and they defend.  
Like I said, they're going to be a very, very tough team for someone to deal
with in the NCAA Tournament. Now that this tournament is over with, I'll be
pulling for them. I'll be pulling for all the Atlantic 10 teams, and there's
enough of us that are going to make it, so who knows, maybe we'll get a chance
to play each other again if we advance.  
  
Q. Daniels picks up a couple ‑‑ the foul early in the second half. How much
of a factor and challenge was that for you guys?   
SHAKA SMART: Yeah, it was tough. You know, he obviously did not have the type
of game that he nor our coaching staff envisioned him having. He was terrific
yesterday shooting the ball. Today he never really was able to get going, and
that's a key, a key part of what we do. If you look at the stat sheet it tells
the whole story for us, at least offensively. We had Reddic and Graham score
like they normally do, but when we've been at our best we've had a third or
fourth scorer emerge, usually Daniels or Rob Brandenberg, and they tried, but
it just wasn't their day, and Saint Louis had a lot to do with that.  
In terms of the foul trouble, hey, it is what it is. I tell the guys to
control what we can control, and we just need to do a better job of defending
without fouling.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

Saint Louis  62  
VCU ‑ 56

  
Q. Kwamain, can you just talk about your injury, sitting out two years ago
and everything you've gone through in your four or five years here, can you
talk about what it means for you and this program?  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: It means a lot to me. Myself and my team has been through a
lot, me being injured, losing one of the best coaches in NCAA basketball. But
I think all those things kind of brought us together, all those hard times,
and it paid off. Right now I'm just excited that the guys stuck with it, and
right now just carry it over to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Kwamain, can you talk about that three ‑pointer that you hit with that
shot clock winding down? When it left your hand, did it feel good?   
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: Yeah, it kind of reminded me of home game playing against
Davie. It took us to overtime and it went in off the backboard. But that whole
time I just said, I don't want to let my team down. Reddic, he's a great
player, and I kind of got a little space and got it up there, and it went in.  
  
Q. Dwyane, you had one iso post ‑up today where you caught and then you
kicked to Cody in the corner. The shot went up and you just started running
back like it was already‑‑ can you just talk about the kind of trust and
confidence you have in your teammates?   
DWAYNE EVANS: Yeah. I mean, they were staying in on me in the post the entire
day. I knew once I kicked it out‑‑ I know Cody had missed a couple, but when
we need them he can make the shots. The same goes for Kwam. I just had a
feeling it was going; I don't think I turned around. I just have so much trust
in my teammates and I know they're going to be there for me and I know I'm
going to be there for them.  
  
Q. Kwamain, you guys handled the havoc defense pretty well today. Can you
talk about why they weren't able to get you out of rhythm aside from that one
stretch in the second half?  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: I think it was just keeping off the post. Just looking at
the UMass game, they kept trying to get the ball in the corner. Coach Crews
always says keep the ball off the of the corner, around the half court line.
We try to keep it in the middle. We knew they were going to try to speed it up
and cause turnovers. But I think everybody, all five guys on the court kept
thinking about keeping composure, they're going to make their runs, and at the
end of those three minutes we stayed together.  
  
Q. What was said in the huddle or time ‑out when they were making that
stretch run because VCU that's kind of what they do, they claw back late in
games with the crowd and everything going. How did you guys stay focused and
maintain such a big spot?   
CODY ELLIS: We just stayed composed. We had trust in each other that we could
get out of the little slump that we were in and stop their run. And Coach
Crews did a good job of making sure that we were settled down and we weren't
worried, they were only a point behind after being up 10, 11 points. The boys
did a great job. The composure was unreal. This is a testament to how far
we've come this season.  
  
Q. Kwamain, can you just talk about your injury and stuff, how frustrating
was that for you beginning your final season, and what was going on throughout
your rehabbing and when you finally got back?  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: It was heartbreaking. It was the second or third day of
practice, and I feel like all the stuff we put into preseason and during the
summer, I felt like we were going to have a great year, not only personally
for me. But I just want to thank the guys for how they handled the team when I
was out. They kept fighting every game. They didn't worry about if I was out
there or not. I know what helped me get through rehab and everything was the
team. They saw me up there working on the bike, getting in shape, and I've got
to thank my strength and conditioning coach and my trainer for everything they
did for me to get me to the point where I'm at now. I can't even explain right
now in words. I'm just so excited right now.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Coach Crews did a good job of settling you down.
Exactly how did he settle you down because there were those few moments when
it was getting kind of tense, there was some trouble inbounding and guys did
get uncharacteristically get a little rattled.  
CODY ELLIS: I mean, he just stays calm and composed. You know, we were in
time‑out and he was there making sure that we were all good and making sure
that we were settled down.  
I think VCU sped us up a little bit, and I think us slowing down started in
the time‑out. He made sure that we were ready, made sure that we were still
good. Yeah, he's done that all season. When teams have made a run, he's been
calm and composed for us.  
  
Q. It is Selection Sunday, so I guess we should go ahead and get that over
with. How big are your NCAA dreams?  
DWAYNE EVANS: I mean, with a team like this, I don't think there's a limit how
far we can go. We've got a lot of really good special pieces that work well
together, and I really don't think there's a cap how many games we can win or
what we can do.  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: Last year I kind of had a little taste of it and played a
great Michigan State team. But I think we can go even farther than that with
the group of guys, with the experience that we've got, just the momentum that
we've got right now, I think we can go deep in the tournament.  
CODY ELLIS: Yeah, I think we've got the team to make a pretty deep run. I
think we're playing really well right now, and I think we're going to scare
some people in match‑ups. If we keep playing the way we've been playing, we're
going to do well.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the history of the program, the second tournament
title. You guys have accomplished something that not a lot of other teams at
Saint Louis have accomplished. Talk about putting this program back on the
map.  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: It just shows how all the stuff that we've been through, we
stayed with it. Coach Crews kept saying there's not a lot of teams that can
win a regular season conference and the tournament conference, so throughout
the whole game, that was running through my mind throughout the whole game,
and I just felt like every possession had value, and I made sure my team did
that, too, and I'm thankful for the Saint Louis community who supported us
throughout this whole year, with coach passing away, me getting injured, all
those things that I'm just thankful to Saint Louis for having our backs.  
  
Q. Cody, you mentioned that you guys can be a scary match ‑up for some
teams. When teams look at you guys on tape, what do you think it is about you
guys that frightens them the most?   
CODY ELLIS: You know, I think our defense is a big part of why we're
successful, and I think teams find it hard to run their sets against us and
get into the flow of an offense because we try and disrupt that sort of stuff.  
So I think that's going to be a big, big part of the match‑up problems.  
  
Q. Kwamain, you mentioned that with the passing of Coach Majerus that was
another obstacle that you guys have overcome this season. What kind of things
did you guys do to come together after that and now looking at this tournament
championship, what does it mean to you guys?  
KWAMAIN MITCHELL: It's an honor. Us hearing news like that, the quick reaction
is to weep and feel sorry. But I feel like the guys‑‑ Coach Majerus was a big
part of this program, obviously individually, including me. Stuff like that
happens like that. Just kind of me, Cory and Cody as seniors and leaders, we
made sure the team was together. We didn't let stuff like that affect the way
that Coach would want us to play.  
I could just hear him up there telling us with just joy and being part of a
great group of guys. This accomplishment is great, and it means a lot to us.  
JIM CREWS: Well, we're obviously very thrilled to win a championship, and as
we went into the season or into this week I should say‑‑ when they announced
that the tournament was in Brooklyn, I was really excited about that because I
just think‑‑ I might have mentioned it yesterday, but it's an exciting thing.
It's a great experience for kids to play in New York, and I can speak about
that from experience when I was younger, and any time when I was coaching and
we had chances to get to New York, it's just a different place.  
That being said and then winning the championship, that's just tremendous
icing on the cake.  
These guys being able to win two championships within a seven‑ or eight‑day
period, whatever it is, is quite a testament not only to them, they just keep
doing the next right thing. I mean, basketball is not a game of perfect, and
we aren't perfect by any stretch with things, but they just keep plugging
away. VCU, that behind‑the‑back pass was like the best pass I think I've ever
seen; for a three, that was awesome. I almost applauded‑‑ that would have been
probably inappropriate for me to applaud, but that was really‑‑ I liked that.
That's good basketball there. I love that. I love that, and that spearheaded
their run, and we knew VCU was going to make a run, and we didn't want them to
make a run and we tried to stop them from making a run, but we knew they were
going to come. They're so well set up and so difficult to play against, and
they compete.  
But our guys, they were able to take more than one or two hits and then make
some really big plays.  
I think we didn't lose our aggressiveness, which I was really pleased with
both offensively and defensively.  
Any questions?  
  
Q. The guys have done a great job of running shooters off their spots all
year. The adjustment going from Butler to VCU has to be significant, and can
you talk about that?  
JIM CREWS: Yeah, really hard. It's hard to play back‑to‑back games, and the
A‑10 has so many different systems of play, it's kind of a really unique
league from that standpoint. Fun, but you're certainly almost starting from
scratch each game it seems like.  
And obviously VCU, nothing is‑‑ you've got to go over the sideline, how to get
the ball‑‑ most teams, we let everyone have the ball in, which 99 percent of
people do, well, VCU doesn't do that. And if the ball goes in the dead corner,
they've got a press on you there, so you've got to go through that.  
And then it's a full court press situation, and they change up the presses,
but then if you just get over half court and say, okay, now let's run this
offense, they just relo run you again, so we think you've got to run one
offense, and our guys did a good job of that.  
I thought early we were able to ‑‑ early and then some other part of the game,
mid second half, our kids really did a good job of getting stops and pushing
the ball up the floor and getting some buckets that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kwamain, he sat out a couple years ago and then came
back and he was injured early in the season, didn't play for one third of the
season, then came back. Can you talk about his performance today and the
growth he's made over the past year.  
JIM CREWS: Well, Kwamain is a really good player, but if I'm going to be on
the mountaintop cheering for something, it's cheering just how he's matured
and how he's grown. He was out for two and a half months, he didn't have a
pity party. Second day, last year, out ‑‑ two and a half months is a long
time, but he came to practice every day and he was an encourager, he passed
his wisdom on, he had a great attitude about it, and then when he finally
comes back, he didn't try to push, whatever, the Kwamain Mitchell show or
anything else or the Jim Crews show or whatever. It was all about the team.  
He didn't try to overdo things, and that's a mature, unselfish kid, and I
think that‑‑ we talked about the best success is shared success, and he has
been certainly a pillar with that kind of mentality and attitude.  
He's been good. I mean, I think‑‑ he said it today, too; there's been a couple
games where he's telling us, hey, let's get it inside, where he's always been
a scorer. Great tribute to him in terms of how his attitude and mentality and
really serving others instead of worrying about himself. Pretty cool.  
  
Q. VCU cuts it to one and they go on that frenzy and you guys are starting
to look a little bit frustrated, crowd is into it. Cody said during the time
‑out you did a good job of settling them down, you've done that all year.
What's the key to that when everything is kind of jumping off like that? What
gets them to settle down that you have to do?   
JIM CREWS: Well, you know, these guys off the court have had a lot of
situations, and certainly on the floor you always have different situations.
You're going to have ebb and flows, you're not going to not play well, you're
going to make a mistake, you're going to have a period of time where things
aren't going your way, things you might not even understand, on the court or
off the court. And all you can try to do is do the next right thing. So if you
make five mistakes in a row, hey, no one is perfect, let's just try to do the
next right thing.  
We just talk about, hey, eight minutes, seven minutes in the game, whoever
rebounds the best, whoever keeps the ball in front of them the best, whoever
is the strongest and the best is going to win. It's not the end of the world
if we lose, but hey, let's try to do our best and compete and let's be
aggressive. We're going to go down, let's go down aggressively.  
  
Q. Some of your players mentioned your calmness. Can you talk about that?  
JIM CREWS: I don't know. I'm old. My wife says boring. (Laughter).  
  
Q. We like to write and talk about how composed your team is, but at Jordair
Jett appears to be a completely transcendent level of composure and calmness.
Can you talk about his approach to the game?  
JIM CREWS: His approach to the game? I think we've got a lot of guys‑‑ again,
this team is not a jump up and down, let's get excited‑‑ they might be
excited‑‑ they are excited, but outwardly they are not a real outwardly
exposed team.  
Actually yesterday this happened: Probably shouldn't say it publicly but you
guys aren't going to write this stuff, I'm sure. (Laughter).  
Talked to the team before the game, and pretty big game, pretty big game, just
like every other game, they just kind of stand up. They don't even stand up
quick. Get together, a little team together, walk out of the locker room. And
for the first time ever in my life, I thought, I want to be able to coach the
pros because we don't have any of that college rah‑rah. We have very little of
that rah‑rah, and Jordair is probably the prime example of it.  
But they play with such a passion, but they aren't real outwardly excitable
guys.  
  
Q. You mentioned how special it was for the players to win two championships
in a span of around eight days. How much more special does it make it after
what happened earlier in the season with the passing of Coach Majerus?  
JIM CREWS: I think‑‑ I don't know to tell you the truth, because Rick's
footprints, fingerprints, his lessons are embedded into those guys, his wisdom
is embedded into those guys, which is pretty cool, and that's been a fun thing
for me, and I think I mentioned it yesterday, they've taught me things and
brought light to this or that, and when they take ownership like that, you
know you've got a chance to be a pretty good team. I've had teams like that
before, and when they start interjecting, and they have ‑‑ hey, that is better
than what we said; that is a better idea how to play this or how to play that.
And that's pretty neat.  
And it would be great for me to say‑‑ and again, I don't know if I'm right,
wrong or indifferent, I really don't. It would be great to say, hey, this is
for Rick, this is for Rick, this is for Rick. But you know what, what if they
lose. I just don't buy into that. Rick's life and his friendship and his
coaching and the relationships that he had and the people that he touched is a
lot bigger than winning a game or winning a championship or having a good
year. That's how I see it. Again, I don't know if I'm right, but that's what I
think.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2013

  

### [Derek Kellogg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23395)

### [Chaz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23397)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  71  
Massachusetts  62

  
THE MODERATOR: From UMass, Coach Derek Kellogg, Chaz Williams.  
COACH KELLOGG: I thought that was a high‑level basketball game. I was proud of
the way our guys came out and played. With very little time to prepare, I
thought they did a very good job of trying to execute the game plan. They did
a much better job against the press.  
You know in college basketball, a lot of strange shots will go in. We had a
couple last night go in for us, and the three in the corner put them up seven.
Chaz was draped all over him with four left on the shot clock, and sometimes
in, I guess, big‑time college basketball games that happens.  
I thought we did a good job of playing hard. Our guys played well. They came
out and competed. We just didn't win the basketball game.  
  
Q. Chaz, with 20 seconds left, there was a time ‑out on the floor. Cady was
bent over, and you seemed to hug him and slapped‑‑ hands. What was going on in
your head?   
CHAZ WILLIAMS: I just told my guys I loved them. We fought and fought and
fought, and we came up short. I wanted my guys to know how much I loved them
and how much they meant to me.  
  
Q. Chaz, can you sum up being a Brooklyn product and playing here at the
home of the Brooklyn Nets in front of friends and family.  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: It was a great experience. It would have been even better if we
could have walked out with a championship. It was a great experience for me,
for my team, and for us as a program.  
  
Q. Chaz, how deflating was it for you guys to have played defense as well as
you did on that possession and have him hit that kind of tough angle three
‑pointer in the corner?   
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Coach said after the game, it's one of them plays that
happened. For T.B. it went yesterday. For Fred it went also. God was on their
side today. Hopefully he's on our side tomorrow, Selection Sunday, and
hopefully we get in.  
  
Q. There was a point where you stole a ball from Theus, ran down, and got
the ball up. It was obvious you did a little talking with him. How much was it
that the intensity of that game turned up for you, and what was the momentum
at that point of the game?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: I felt he was a little too comfortable. I wanted to get him out
of his comfort zone. He would get a little flush with the ball. So I kept
picking my spots, picking my spots, and I just went for it and got the steal.  
  
Q. Just how tiring was it, obviously, three games in three days, but also
the pressure they put on, just all 40 minutes?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Not tiring at all. Coach Hogans did a great job pushing us in
the off‑season. Coach push us every day in practice. It's something we're used
to. We push. We run. It was nothing they did. It was just us executing our
game plan.  
  
Q. In the first eight minutes, you only had two turnovers, rest of the game
you had 22. What was the difference? Did you feel like they started to beat
you guys up at all?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, they possibly sped us up a little bit. It was just us
being poised, taking control of the game, and just slowing things down. They
got better stops and caused a lot of turnovers.  
  
Q. Chaz, if you had one sales pitch to give to the Selection Committee in
favor of you guys making the tournament, what would you say to them?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: We're a very exciting team. I feel like everybody across the
world would want to see us play, and we feel like we needed the opportunity.
Once we get the opportunity and our feet wet, sky's the limit from there.  
You've got a bunch of young guys that's just hungry to win. Putting us in the
tournament would be very great. Hopefully, they do.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, will you spend the next 24 hours looking at stuff
on the Internet and watching TV, or will you try to get away from all that?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Not really. I'm not really going to pay attention to that. You
can only worry about Selection Sunday. That's the truth right there. All the
media and stuff people are saying, you play the game the first hour, things
like that, the committees are what say you're in or you're out. We're just
waiting for tomorrow.  
Hopefully, they find some things. Hopefully, they were here tonight to watch
us play, and feel that we deserve to be in.  
THE MODERATOR: Chaz, thank you. Questions for Coach Kellogg.  
  
Q. From what you told Chaz, do you feel you're a tournament team right
now?  
COACH KELLOGG: The question that I have is do we pass the eye test? You can
take the BPI, the RPI, the ZPI, whatever you want to call it, when you watch
us play against GW, Temple, Xavier, Butler, those teams, and a team in the top
25 on a neutral site, that's the main thing. I think the RPI is good enough
for pretty close.  
We played 18 games away from the Mullins Center, which a lot of BCS schools
won't do. We've been on the road with a great road record and had to travel a
lot this year. I think we've improved. At this point in the season, I would
say we're an NCAA Tournament team. Does that mean we get in? I'm not sure, but
I hope we do.  
  
Q. Derek, you guys missed a lot of shots in the paint and a lot of shots in
close. Is that haunting you at the moment? Is some of that from fatigue?  
COACH KELLOGG: I was just talking to Cady and Maxie. It felt like they were
playing volleyball with the ball. They would miss and he got it and he missed,
I'm not quite sure what it was. There was a lot of bodies in there hanging
around.  
You've got to be a little more physical. A little bit was fatigue. A little
bit was inexperience. I can bet you that those two won't be missing those next
year. Another year of training and what not.  
I thought those were big plays, the one they missed, and then came down and
got an and one on Sampson, I thought, was a big play also.  
  
Q. On that exact play you just mentioned, looking back, was that the turning
point in your mind?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: I thought it was pretty close, absolutely. We had two or three
looks at it. There was a lot of body slamming down there, and they came down.
I think it was a block, honestly. It's just a tough call in that situation. It
kind of turned where I thought the momentum was going our way. I think we were
down two, had three or four looks at it right around the rim, and they came
down and got an and one.  
That's what happens in tournament basketball sometimes. All the breaks don't
go your way.  
  
Q. Did you guys block out?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: No, I thought it was a block and fall from my view on Sampson.
But I'm not a ref. I would be a good one, though.  
  
Q. You're bigger than VCU. Many teams are bigger than VCU. What do they do
to neutralize the size disadvantage they usually face?  
COACH KELLOGG: They do a great job of playing their style. They try to get you
into an up and down game, where it takes away the size factor. I thought we
actually did a pretty good job tonight of using our size. I thought we beat
them on the backboards. I thought we were able to get the ball one foot
numerous times. We didn't finish every one.  
Normally, they're able to get teams out of their style by getting you to play
fast. And obviously the 24 turnovers. It's kind of the turnovers versus the
rebounding. We've been in that situation before. How many times they turn you
over versus how many offensive rebounds you're going to get.  
I think they were fortunate tonight to get a few more turnovers than we got
offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Just following up on that, it's difficult to prepare for this team with a
few days. Can you talk about how hard it is and how you felt you guys did
overall.  
COACH KELLOGG: I was really happy with our guys' preparation. We got back to
the hotel at about 1:00 a.m., 12:45, whatever it was, had a quick sandwich for
each guy, and I put them to bed.  
We got them up around 11:00 today. We had a film session, a walk through, and
I thought their attention to detail and how they prepared for the press
without‑‑ we actually prepared because we had played them once better one day
than we were able to the last time because we hadn't seen it already.  
I was proud of the kids the way they prepared and the way they paid attention
to detail. It wasn't perfect, as we all saw, but they gave it the best effort.  
  
Q. What are you going to be doing the next 23 hours, and where are you going
to be watching the selection show?  
COACH KELLOGG: We're going to actually stay in Brooklyn tonight. We have the
rooms for a night, so we're going to relax. Chaz is from here, and he'll
probably maybe take a few guys to his house and hang out. A couple other guys
are from the area.  
And then we'll get up in the morning, take the bus back to Amherst, and I'm
not sure yet. I may set up a lot of candles in the basement and go hang out or
may have the guys over. I haven't thought about that yet.  
For me, there's a great oyster bar I went to the other night. It was
fantastic. I may try to go over there, if possible.  
  
Q. Derek, can you talk about the effort, especially defensively, in
rebounding from guys like Sampson and Maxie, who have been inconsistent at
times, and just really the past two games.  
COACH KELLOGG: That was one of our‑‑ I thought we played great defense
tonight. I thought we did a great job. Sampson, Maxie, Cady plugging the lane.
Overall, we gave Daniels some open looks and got him going. We turned him over
and he got transition baskets, but when we sat in our half‑court defense, that
was almost as well as we've done in a while. We had rebounding.  
It was the middle of the game where they got turnovers and had some easy ones.
But I thought Sampson and Maxie played very well.  
  
Q. You touched on it already, but Shaka mentioned they chart every shot of
every game. You said you do something similar, good, whatever, and you said
the corner three was the worst shot of the day.  
COACH KELLOGG: For his team. He probably didn't see a few of my good shots.  
  
Q. When you saw it go up, were you thinking there's no way the shot's going
down?  
COACH KELLOGG: You know what's crazy? I kind of thought it's going in. This is
one of those, it's going in. I can't believe it. It was like Terrell Vinson's
last night. In my head, I thought that's in too. The way he was draped on him,
but he double clutched and shot a curveball. It looked good.  
It was unfortunate. If we rebound the ball and come down and score, it's a
two‑point game, and it comes down to the end.  
  
Q. Derek, you guys got off to a good start, and Troy Daniels hit those three
threes in a row, and VCU got the 11 ‑0 run. How big was it in the game in
terms of a momentum shift?   
COACH KELLOGG: It was huge. That was probably the one small section of the
game that we maybe didn't pay as much attention to detail as we probably
should have. They got a couple of looks that got them going. I thought our
guys responded pretty well.  
I've seen teams and coached teams at times that have played VCU, and that run
extends itself. I thought we did a good job of calling time‑out, getting
organized, and coming back out and keeping the game close. Not letting Daniels
get off really any shots or as many from that point on.  
  
Q. Off topic, with the parity across the country, do you feel like 16 is any
closer to beating a 1 at this time of year?  
COACH KELLOGG: I'm not sure. It's never happened before, so I probably
wouldn't go against the odds. I guess the 15s are doing pretty well now.  
I think that would be tough to have happen honestly.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Briante Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25083)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  71  
MASSACHUSETTS  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Statement from Coach and then questions for players. From VCU,
Head Coach Shaka Smart, players Briante Weber and Troy Daniels.  
COACH SMART: It was a hard‑fought game, and I'm proud of our guys that we were
able to come out ahead, especially on a day where we did not shoot the ball
particularly well. Some of our guys that typically shoot it in at a pretty
good rate struggled, especially from outside, and even from around the basket.  
We found a way to get it done. I thought we got enough stops in the second
half, holding them to 28 points. That was good enough to win, and that's what
we need to do this time of year.  
I'm proud of our guys, but we're not satisfied. We've got another game
tomorrow in less than 24 hours. Excited about that challenge.  
  
Q. Troy, can you just talk about how you matured as a shooter and a player
this year and maybe over the last two years.  
TROY DANIELS: Credit goes to my coaching staff and my teammates. I get in the
gym a lot during the off‑season, and they want me to shoot the ball. That's
what I do. Shot discipline and stay with it, and the results will follow.  
  
Q. Troy, when you went on that stretch and hit those three threes in the
first half, is it just a matter of getting into a rhythm and just was it
automatic almost for you?  
TROY DANIELS: It's a confidence thing. When guys go out on the court and have
VCU across their chest, we feel like we can do anything. That's what it was.
It wasn't a matter of thinking it's automatic, every time I shoot, I think
it's going in, but it's just a confidence factor that I have.  
  
Q. Briante, you guys are almost always a smaller team. You seem to always be
outweighed. Yet you seem to still be able to grind people down, still rebound
well. You outrebounded by 14 today. What goes into the efforts you guys put
out to get things done like that?  
BRIANTE WEBER: It's a mindset, and it's just that coaching staff is telling us
that we're always going to be smaller. We've just got to tough it out and be
more scrappy than the other team. That's what we go into with our mindset,
we've got to be a scrappier team. We've got to scrap out everything. Every
loose ball, every rebound, everything.  
Got to get to the 50‑50s, and everything else will fall.  
  
Q. Troy, did it feel like for you guys, when they cut it all the way to two,
and then they missed the two shots inside to tie it, and then you had the
three and Briante had the three ‑point play‑‑ did it feel like that was a
pretty big turning point in the game?   
TROY DANIELS: Definitely. We knew Massachusetts was going to make a run, and
they did. We just stayed with it. Coach Smart said they're going to make a
run. So we just had to get stops, and we did.  
  
Q. There were two turnovers, and the rest of the game they committed 22.
Could you sense it speeding up at all or was there an initiative to started
causing some trouble there?  
TROY DANIELS: Oh, yeah. This guy with the head band on is Mr. Havoc. He speeds
a lot of guys up. That's our motto going into the game, our mindset going into
the game, and I felt like we did that towards the second half. We did that a
little bit in the first half, but really did it in the second half.  
  
Q. Briante, when the game got down to two, take me through the two plays
that you turned in, first the three ‑point play and then the steal that led to
that.   
BRIANTE WEBER: Basically, it was just being in the right spot at the right
time. Pushing it after the rebound was just something we always do. We just
attack the rim and go easy rim is what Coach said. So I just seen it was
one‑on‑one and the big man was in front of me. So I was backpedaling, and he
just attacked and fouled me.  
  
Q. For both players, what do you recall about St. Louis that seemed to be
the one team that really gave you guys the most trouble, and what do you think
about tomorrow's game?  
TROY DANIELS: It's going to be a hard‑fought game. Last time we went out to
St. Louis, and we just weren't playing VCU basketball. It's a testament to
Coach. He has us ready. So we'll be ready to go out on championship Sunday and
play VCU basketball.  
  
Q. Briante, take us through the steal after the three ‑point play.   
BRIANTE WEBER: Basically, they were trying to push it and do something that we
basically sped them up to them doing something they didn't do. I was being in
the right place at the right time once again and seeing if my shooter on the
left wing.  
Thanks to Juvonte running the rim, which made the defense commit and hit the
buzz wide open.  
  
Q. Bri, can you talk about the three threes that Troy hit on the 11 ‑0 run
in the first half and how important that was in terms of momentum.   
BRIANTE WEBER: That was a big momentum swinger and knowing that, once he hit
the first one, we were coming back to him, and he hit another one. First call
was buzz, which is his play. And we went back to him, and he hit another one.  
That really turned the tide for VCU. So we rode him.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to guard a player like Chaz Williams, who's so quick
and can crash to the rim so effectively?  
BRIANTE WEBER: It's pretty tough seeing that he's smaller and quicker than
everybody, and he's low to the ground. So he pretty much plays lower than
everybody else. It's just tough, but I mean, he did what he did, and we did
what we had to do to get a "W."  
THE MODERATOR: Troy, anything to add?  
TROY DANIELS: He said it.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the players? Thank you. All right.
Questions for Coach Smart.  
  
Q. Did it seem like the three ‑pointer that Brandenberg hit so deep in the
shot block that he had to put up and kind of not really in rhythm. Seemed like
when he hit that, that was the knockout blow.  
COACH SMART: That was the dagger. We chart shot quality on our team after
every game. We look at whether on each possession we got a great shot, a good
shot, a decent shot, a bad shot, or a no shot, and that was one of our worst
quality shots of the game, but he had to take it. He had to take it, and he
made a big play, jumped up and shot it over Chaz Williams.  
It's a little ironic because we missed a lot of wide open, easy shots
throughout the game, and then that was the play that, I guess, kind of put it
out of reach, making a tough one from the corner there.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Troy's maturation as a shooter. I
know early in his career you tried to get him to be able to go from practice
to the game, and now he's done it. He's hitting big shots in games. Can you
just touch on that.  
COACH SMART: Yeah, he's just a great shooter. He's the best shooter I've ever
coached. He's always been terrific, as you mentioned, in practice, but his
first couple of years, he had a hard time playing with the confidence to go
out and shoot the ball in.  
Today he did, and all year he has, and that's why he's one of the top
single‑season three‑point shooters in Atlantic 10 history. We need him to make
threes because it's a big part of what we do. I think it fits well with our
style of play.  
And our guys, as Bri mentioned, our guys do a nice job finding him.  
  
Q. Coach, you got off to a strong start in the second half against them. Did
it feel like you were going to run them out of the building again, or what was
different this time?  
COACH SMART: No. You're playing a good team that's got their back against the
wall. It's tough to run those teams out of the building, particularly when you
shoot 35 percent, 36 percent from the field. I think, if we'd had made more
shots and the scoreboard starts moving and you hold them to 28 points in the
half like you did, you could maybe win by more. But I'll certainly take a
nine‑point win now.  
  
Q. St. Louis only committed eight turnovers in a 56 ‑possession game.
Granted, that was at their place, but tomorrow how can you increase that
number? How can you get the Billikens to cough the ball up?   
COACH SMART: Play better. We've just got to play better. There's all kinds of
strategic things that we'll talk to with our team, but the bottom line is St.
Louis was better than us in every aspect of the game on that night. Now we get
another opportunity to play them on a neutral floor, and we're going to have
to play better to win.  
But I think our guys understand that. We're comfortable with that. Now it's a
matter of going out and doing it.  
  
Q. Shaka, I'm sure, if you could, you'd recruit 6'10 " guys who run like
gazelles and have power rebounders, but you tend not to get those guys. What
do you go‑‑ what's your mindset for recruiting? You always seem smaller. How
do you overcome that so efficiently?   
COACH SMART: That's a good question. The way we play, it's speed and quickness
and energy. Smaller guys tend to have more of that. As you mentioned, if we
could find a 6'10" guy that has speed, quickness, energy, and can shoot
threes, I will take him. If you've seen one, let me know.  
The problem is Kentucky and North Carolina want those guys too. But, yeah,
you've got to make a decision in recruiting and what's most important to you.  
We recruited some big guys or some young guys that are, I think, getting
better. They gave us good contributions tonight with Jarred and Justin.
Juvonte obviously has developed into a really good player for us. It's just
that we've had more perimeter guys that have blossomed into the type of
players we want them to be.  
In our recruiting, ideal team with 13 scholarships, our ideal team would have
8 perimeter players and then one guy that you can kind of shuttle back and
forth between the perimeter and inside and then four big guys.  
Especially by the time you get to this time of year, there's very few ideal
teams out there. You got to work towards getting better the next year.  
  
Q. Coach, you've obviously gone up ‑‑ you guys have had great success in the
NCAA Tournament and gone up against a lot of tourney teams. In this game,
would you say that you have passed the eye test for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH SMART: I think they did. I think that they‑‑ they've been extremely
competitive in our league. You look at their games, they've been within an
eyelash of being a team that had a bye in this tournament and maybe finishing
top two or three. So if I had a vote on the selection committee, I would
certainly include them in the field.  
Everyone has a bias. I'm biassed towards the Atlantic 10. I think it's a
phenomenal league. I think the top six or seven teams in this league all
deserve extreme consideration. But I understand the Selection Committee only
has a certain amount of at large bids to give out.  
  
Q. Shaka, when you were shooting and having such a hard time making baskets,
did you call those three plays in a row for Troy, one? And then two, I have a
second question after that.  
COACH SMART: Trying to think. The one that Bri passed to them, I definitely
didn't call that. That was in transition. I think his teammates just found
him. There was one we called for around that time, but UMass did a good job
defending it, and he didn't get one off there.  
We call a lot of plays for him throughout the game. Sometimes he gets open.
Sometimes he doesn't. But what's much more effective for him to get open looks
is when he gets out on transition and our guys get in the lane and force the
guys to converge, and then we find him at the top of the key.  
  
Q. Why does Briante always seem to be in the right spot at the right time?  
COACH SMART: Energy. He's the most energetic person I've ever been around in
my life, basketball or otherwise, and that's his gift. It's a terrific gift.  
If a player is able to receive a scholarship at this level, then there's
obviously something that they do well, and for Bri, he's energy, enthusiasm,
anticipation, and that's why he's one of the best steal guys and one of the
best deflection guys that I've ever seen.  
  
Q. You had mentioned there's really no ideal team out there from what you've
seen and with the parity across the country. Do you feel like a 16 is any
closer to being a 1?  
COACH SMART: I don't know. I think‑‑ it all depends on the game. It almost
happened a couple of years ago. Maybe it was last year, and there was a really
close one that we were watching.  
But those 1 seeds are really good. Last year you had a 15 beat a 2. So it's
never happened with 16 beating 1, but if you think about it, it's really not
that big of a difference. 16 versus 1, 15 versus 2. That will happen at some
point. We won't be a 1 or a 16, so it really doesn't matter to me.  
  
Q. Shaka, you mentioned a moment ago about Troy getting a good shot in
transition. You guys get a lot of good shots in transition, and that's not
anything you can really plan. Your guys make good decisions in transition.
Talk about how much you work on defense in practice. What do you do to get
them to make such good decisions in transition? And where do you think you
should be seeded?  
COACH SMART: Let me answer your first question. We work on what we call
transition cycles in practice, which is just five on oh getting up and down.
We'll do a lot of times down, back, down, back, down, so five different trips
and we take advantage of different options. Five on zero. That's good for
conditioning. It's good for working on tempo.  
Sometimes we'll play style of play games, which is you never stop. So we get
up and down, and we're pushing the tempo. When there's a foul or something, we
quickly get the ball out and keep playing. We don't stop at all. Again, that's
great for conditioning and also pushing the pace.  
I thought today at the start of the game we were a little sluggish with
pushing the ball and attacking. I really thought our second‑team guys came in
and gave us a lift there and gave us more spirit and energy. And then in the
second half Darius and the starters did a better job.  
In terms of seed, I have no idea. A very, very poor frame of reference right
now in terms of the other teams that are out there and what their resume is
and even their RPI. I have no idea. I'll take a 1 seed if they want to give it
to us. Whatever we're seeded, it's not‑‑ everybody makes such a big deal out
of the seeding. To me it's more about matchups. You can get a great seed, but
you can be matched up with a team that is a really tough opponent for the way
you play. Or if you look at us last couple years, we've so‑called been an
upset team, but those were good matchups for us, and that's why they worked
out.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

SAINT LOUIS  67  
BUTLER  56

  
THE MODERATOR: While we wait, a quick note. This is the second time that St.
Louis has defeated Butler three times in one year. The other time happened in
'88/'89 season.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Crews.  
COACH CREWS: I thought obviously two really good basketball teams. We've got
all the respect in the world for Butler and their program, who they are and
what they are and how they represent college basketball. There's nothing
better than that. So we have a lot of respect for that.  
And being able to beat them a couple times this year, that was certainly a
great accomplishment for these guys here. I thought at halftime we did a
better job. The second half we did a better job of competing shots. I thought
we got a little anxious the first half. We took some low percentage shots at
times.  
Butler really gets into you at different places, different pressure points,
and maybe got us a little bit hurried at times. I thought our guys made a
great adjustment at halftime. Not halftime, but the second half. Did a good
job. Dwayne was really good inside, and guys got him the ball, and Cody played
a great game. We had a lot of guys playing a great game.  
We're not a big stat team. These guys got tremendous wisdom, and that doesn't
show up in stats in terms of how many things that you do. So we like that. So
that's good.  
We're really pleased and excited about trying to win a championship in New
York. It's a great place and pretty neat for these kids for that experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. For Cody, the feeling, like reminder of the last Butler game when you
fell behind there in the first half, they got to around maybe a seven ‑point
lead in that game, and you guys turned it around and got back in it.   
CODY ELLIS: I mean, a little bit. They came out pretty hard. Clock ran out,
but he knew what he was going to do. Coach always stresses at that point in
the game you can't win it with 10, 15 minutes in the game. Comes down to the
clock.  
Guys did a great job of picking up pressure and doing what our game plan was.  
  
Q. Dwayne, your second strong performance. You had 27 yesterday and 24
today. Again talk about what you were seeing inside ‑‑ yesterday you were
talking about what you were able to see yesterday, but today against Butler
you had the same kind of performance.   
DWAYNE EVANS: It was kind of a different setup because they played a lot of
zone. Early on, I just kind of went to spots. When they went man, I kind of
tried to maximize size advantage or match up what I had in size. Guys were
hitting threes so they couldn't really sag off. It really was a team effort.
Wasn't just me.  
  
Q. I would like to follow up on what the coach said that you guys have
wisdom. In your opinion, where does that come from?  
DWAYNE EVANS: We have a lot of experienced guys that have been here three,
four years, been through the good and the bad. We know when teams make runs
and we're not hitting shots, we can't let that little lull last too long. I
think that wisdom is one of the things that's made us successful towards the
end of the year that we didn't really have at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. Cody, you were telling us yesterday you thought the worst was behind you
on your shooting slump. It looks like you were pretty accurate on that one.
Must have felt good today.  
CODY ELLIS: Definitely. It had been a struggle my last couple of games. Got to
have that shooter mentality. Came out and felt good that Dwayne opened it up
for me outside. Hopefully, it continues.  
  
Q. Butler's known as a really strong man ‑to‑man team. What do you guys feel
like you do that's made them want to play zone today?   
DWAYNE EVANS: We have a lot of action. We can do a lot of different things.
I'm sure teams get tired of guarding ball screen after ball screen and the
various things we do on offense. We're not surprised they go zone. A lot of
teams have.  
  
Q. Dwayne, guys your size, your body type tend to be the high flyers and
want to do all the highlight stuff. Where did you get this old school, down
low game from?  
CODY ELLIS: Because he can't dunk.  
[Laughter.]  
DWAYNE EVANS: Don't be fooled. It's just a choice. It's just a choice. I like
the ground game. I don't know. I'm going to go out and dunk on them all just
to prove you wrong on that one.  
I don't really know where it came from. I kind of take what comes.  
  
Q. Cody, I'll ask you then. What do you see in his game that makes him so
effective out there despite not being small?  
CODY ELLIS: He's a real smart player. He knows how to get position. He's
really good at fielding his man. Easy to get to him. When he gets it, he's
really slow, really controlled, and he's a really good finisher down there.  
  
Q. Cody, you guys beat Butler three times this year, and you'll go down in
history as the only A ‑10 team to beat Butler three times. To beat a team with
that reputation, with that‑‑ they knocked off Indiana and Gonzaga. What does
it mean to you guys?   
DWAYNE EVANS: To beat any team three times in one season is an accomplishment.
To beat a team like that with the accolades and the guys that I have on my
team is really a confidence builder. We were in the same predicament last year
with Xavier, and we ended up losing. I'm happy that we came out and took the
ball like we did and got the win.  
CODY ELLIS: Big boost for the team. It's hard to beat anything three times.
Butler is an unbelievable team. Really talented, really great, and they play
really good basketball. The guys did well with coming out, had the win behind
us, and making sure we win today.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Questions for Coach Crews.  
  
Q. Cody, is your shooting mentality that if you make one you're hot. I like
that mentality.  
  
Q. Jim, the same question I asked Dwayne. Where does that savvy low post
‑game that he has come from, do you think?   
COACH CREWS: Where does it come from? He played there in high school, inside.
And actually, almost all the things that we work with him is outside, to be
perfectly blunt, from shooting. He's always with the guard shooting. We don't
put him down with the post guys very often. He's coming off ball screens at
times and driving the ball.  
He's really worked on his outside game. I think he hit a three today, didn't
he? So that complements it.  
Cody is very, very effective. He's very good. He's strong. He's broad
shouldered. He's got good touch. He keeps his eyes up on the rim. He's not shy
away from contact, and he's pretty close.  
He's not a big jumper, but he's an explosive guy getting off the floor, and
he's got a soft touch. That layup he missed, that was an awesome move.
Actually, that was kind of funny. That was a tremendous move. He keeps his
knees bent and his eyes up and plays slow, like Cody said.  
Some guys have a feel for where the bucket‑‑ it sounds stupid because that
bucket doesn't move, but you've got to have a sense where that bucket it, and
he's got a great sense where that bucket is.  
  
Q. Jim, you talk about their wisdom. How much do you trust this team, and
how much of a luxury is it to do that, to trust they'll make the right
decision in a tough situation?  
COACH CREWS: Immensely. A lot of times I'll say, "What do you guys want to
run? How do you want to play that?" They're not shy about it. They do have
wisdom, and they feel comfortable with one way or another, and they understand
situations.  
No, it's a real luxury. It's a fun thing from my standpoint.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys forced 20 turnovers against Butler and 7 from Clarke and
Dunham. Was that the game plan to really hound the two guards and force them
into making bad decisions?  
COACH CREWS: Those guys play in a way, if you give them an inch‑‑ and this is
where our guys really gear it up because they know, if you relax for a second,
you're getting drilled by those guys. They're just that good. They shoot
threes like I shoot layups if you give them space.  
Clarke was doing a good job getting by us because we really didn't want to
give them a whole lot of space, but you've got to stay in that space and can't
get caught underneath things. So we wanted to increase the pressure.  
Obviously, they played the third game in three days. So that has a little play
into it too, and I'm sure that might be one of the reasons Brad played zone,
or he probably saw us play zone offense yesterday, and it wasn't so hot.
That's kind of what I think.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious about what you think of the possibility of this NCAA
Tournament having a lot of success from mid ‑majors at the same time that a
lot of the schools like you have outgrown that mid‑major tag.   
COACH CREWS: It's hard to coach one team. I haven't given it an ounce of
thought.  
  
Q. You're not worried you've outgrown the mid ‑major tag?   
COACH CREWS: I never really worried about what people called things, all my
life‑‑ I'm serious. I'm not trying to be sarcastic. Some guy in Idaho is
telling me what‑‑ I mean, who cares? I don't care. It doesn't make any
difference. That's not why you play the game. You play the game because you
love the game. You have a passion for the game and play it no matter who we
play. If that's in front of no one or that's in front of 20,000, great.  
But I mean, it's an amazing, fascinating game, and you're always trying to
figure it out. Guess what? You never will. That's the only thing I can come up
with. You'll never figure it out.  
  
Q. For those of us here in New York that don't get a chance to see you that
much, how did you keep all of this together this year? This is an
extraordinary circumstance. To this day, what impact does Rick have on you and
all these guys?  
COACH CREWS: Rick has a big impact. Rick is someone we all miss and I
certainly miss, not only from a comrade in coaching but from a friend I've
known for a long time. I don't know what the question was, but the answer
here, we had eight guys that are juniors and seniors, and they've invested a
lot into the program and invested in each other. So there's a relationship.  
Relationships trump everything, in my opinion. So they got very strong
relationships. We've got a very unselfish group here. We've got all kinds of
different personalities here. But they have a real fondness for each other.
Over time, that's what it is.  
I think there's nothing better than being in a college experience‑‑ winning
games is great. Championships are awesome. That's all really good stuff. But
the guys in the locker room know who the good teammates are, and we've got a
team full of good teammates, and that's what we try to promote, and that's a
lifetime thing.  
I think these guys will remember it for a lifetime because they've had the
good, the bad, and the ugly and the tragic of all the things that have gone
on. They've stuck together, stayed the course, haven't gotten too high,
haven't gotten too low, and that's certainly been a credit to those guys.  
  
Q. The fact that you have all those guys, is that a reflection on him that
he brought this group together?  
COACH CREWS: His fingerprints are everywhere, absolutely.  
  
Q. What has this experience been like for you playing in this gorgeous
building, Brooklyn, New York, the big city, the big stage, and you're in a
championship game tomorrow for the right to go to the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CREWS: I was really excited when this went to here. Not to talk about
the old days, but when I was in school, we were able to do some pretty decent
things, but one of the big, big thrills was playing in New York City. I didn't
do it all the time with teams that I coached, but we tried to get to New York
any chance we could.  
So I just thought that was absolutely fantastic that A‑10 went to here, and I
told our players coming here is different. There's going to be‑‑ I don't how
many leagues there are, but there's going to be 34, 35, 32, whatever the
number is, I have no idea, champions this week, but there's only two that are
going to win in New York, and I think that's pretty‑‑ that's part of a great
college experience, in my opinion.[end 5].  
  
Q. What makes you [start 6] guys so tough to prepare for on a short
turnaround? Is it the way you guys execute? Is it your experience? What makes
you guys so tough to prepare for?  
COACH CREWS: I don't know. I don't prepare for us. We do a lot of bright
things. Sometimes if you don't know what we're doing and you don't turn the
ball over and you don't take bad shots, they don't know what you're doing
either.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Thanks.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

SAINT LOUIS  67  
BUTLER  56

  
THE MODERATOR: From Butler University, Head Coach Brad Stevens, players Rotnei
Clarke and Roosevelt Jones. Opening statement by Coach Stevens.  
COACH STEVENS: I thought our guys until the last ten minutes of this game
really showed themselves great in this tournament. Certainly, the number one
factor in the last ten minutes was St. Louis. I've said all year to the people
that have listened, and some that don't, how good they are. They are a
legitimate contender for the whole thing.  
I believe that wholeheartedly. They've got eight guys that are all strong,
big, physical, tough, smart, skilled basketball players, and you don't need
anything else if you're all together, and they've got it all.  
And I thought then the second factor‑‑ and far second, certainly, again, it's
St. Louis that beat us. That's why you try to get there. The third game in
three days against a team that physical that's going to steer you and be on
you and ride you and bumper cuts and all that stuff, you've got to have some
stuff to you to do that for 40 minutes when you're fresh, and you kind of saw
the last ten minutes they got better and we didn't play as well.  
But kudos to them. It's a great basketball team.  
  
Q. Roosevelt, what makes a guy like Dwayne Evans so difficult to guard?  
ROOSEVELT JONES: He's a very physical player. He's probably the most physical
player that I ever played against in my life. I really thought that he should
have been Player of the Year in the conference. He's a real good player.  
  
Q. Is it his body type?  
ROOSEVELT JONES: Yeah, he's kind of got a body type like me, but he's taller
than me, so he's able to outphysical me, which is surprising to me. I never
played against anybody that physical. So he got the best of me today.  
  
Q. Roosevelt, the first half you had to chase down a ball against the
backboard. Do you view that as a possible coming off point for the team really
getting behind?  
ROOSEVELT JONES: No, I was just trying to get back because I made a turnover.
I thought I could help my team out by getting the block down.  
  
Q. Rotnei, they're not a team that uses the entire court all day, like you
or Louisville does. What makes them so effective?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: They run their system well. Like Coach said, they're extremely
physical. They're not going to‑‑ they're really disciplined. They're not going
to jump over any cuts. They're going to ride you and steer you the whole way.
They're really good trailing off screens, and they've got‑‑ like Coach said,
eight guys that can really go, and they're together, and they're a tough team.  
  
Q. Rotnei, following up on that, could you talk a little bit about what
Jordair Jett did specifically against you to kind of keep you away from your
rhythm there.  
ROTNEI CLARKE: He's just a physical guy. He did a good job of trailing me.
They did a good job off ball screens. He just stayed down, and he moves
laterally really well. Not only that, he's strong. He's a really good
defender.  
  
Q. Is there a particular way that Coach Stevens handles losses that helps
you guys move on to the next game?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: He definitely gives us confidence going into the next one.
Obviously, this was tough, but we're stressing putting this behind us right
now and getting ready for the one that really matters. I mean, this one
definitely‑‑ we obviously want to win the Atlantic 10 Tournament, but we want
to make a run into this next tournament more.  
He puts confidence in us in the next game, and we're the most prepared team in
the country by far every game. We always have confidence going into the game.  
  
Q. Roosevelt?  
ROOSEVELT JONES: Like Rotnei said, Coach Stevens puts us in a situation for
every game to win. We've got to go out there and execute. Most times we do and
sometimes we don't. Coach Stevens always has us prepared well for every single
game.  
  
Q. Not in terms of the style of play, but in terms of the intelligence and
their toughness, does this team remind you of your group from 2010 at all?  
COACH STEVENS: Does it remind us of the 2010?  
  
Q. Does St. Louis remind you?  
COACH STEVENS: The 2011 team was probably more like that because those guys
were actually a little bit older. The 2011 team, we started three sophomores,
just happened that two of them are now playing. One of them is playing here
tomorrow night, and one of them is playing on ESPN with the Jazz tomorrow. So
that certainly helps.  
The thing that I just go back to, Dana, is Cody Ellis and Jordair Jett are two
of their best players. They're not in the starting lineup. Their starting
lineup is really good. So they have depth. They have physicality. They have
toughness.  
It does remind me in some ways of our teams. I actually think this team‑‑ the
St. Louis team is the strongest of any team we've had. We've never had a team
that looks like St. Louis strength‑wise. They're the strongest team we've
played against this year. Oh, yeah.  
And Indiana's great. I think Indiana's at the level that everybody's going to
be chasing them in the NCAA Tournament, but as far as pure strength, men, St.
Louis is old. They've been through it. They've done it. And they are men.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Dwayne's game. I was joking with him. I
said, "Guys your size, your body type, don't play below the rim." He's got
like an old school game.   
COACH STEVENS: I think he's probably a better athlete than people may realize,
but he's always got a body on him when he's jumping, which makes it harder to
jump. He is such a physical basketball player. It's not just on the offensive
end. He's great in the post. He can post anybody from our 6'11" center to a
guard.  
If you can post and score on Rose, you are a player. Rose, he was very
accountable when you all talked to him. Rose doesn't get outphysicaled very
often, and Dwayne Evans is a tough matchup for him. He's a tough matchup for
everybody, and on the other end, he's dynamite. He plays passing lanes. He
plays on top of you. You can't run cuts. He denies people the ball. He's
aggressive. He's smart. He's in tune.  
I think he's really good. I think he's really good. And he deserves all the
credit for being a First Team, All‑League guy. I thought he was a very viable
Player of the Year candidate as well.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just reflect on this year in conference play, and if
this was, in fact, the final A ‑10 game for you guys, the challenge of playing
in your third conference in three years.  
COACH STEVENS: I don't know about that, but I know this. This was a heck of a
challenging year. This is a heck of a league. To win 13 games in this league
and to win seven away from home against teams that we had to beat against our
schedule‑‑ when I first looked at our schedule, when you're thinking about
we're going to St. Joe's and Dayton to open it up. You've got to go to VCU,
you've got to go to Davis, go to LaSalle, go to UMass, and only St. Louis
comes back to you, which, by the way, you don't really want them to come back.  
It was a remarkable run for our team. It's one of the best nonconference‑‑
excuse me. Pre‑NCAA Tournament groups as far as what they achieve that we've
ever had. Because the schedule they played was incredible, both non and during
league.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
COACH STEVENS: Thank you.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

MASSACHUSETTS  79  
TEMPLE  74

THE MODERATOR: We\'ll start with opening statement from UMass Coach Derek
Kellogg.

COACH KELLOGG: It\'s what we\'ve come to expect out of the UMass/Temple games
a long time ago. I thought it was another battle that we were fortunate enough
to make some big plays down the stretch, and I love the way Temple, even in
defeat, handles it with such class. Talking with Coach Dunphy after the game,
the players really do things in a professional manner.

So one thing that I always liked about him and his program is the way they
operate. So I wish them the best of luck in the NCAA Tournament, and we
obviously have a very tough game tomorrow against a team that handled us
pretty well down in Richmond.

THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.

Q. Terrell, you had the big three there as the time ran out on the shot clock.
Were you thinking when you had the ball, you wanted to take a shot at that
point?

TERRELL VINSON: Yeah, yeah, I was thinking of taking the shot. It was denying
Chaz. They pressured. They switched out. There was about three seconds to go.
I had no choice but to shoot it.

Q. What were you thinking after the win?

TERRELL VINSON: Just happy.

Q. Chaz, in the stretch, it seemed like every time down the floor, it was
right to the basket. Can you tell us what was going through your mind?

CHAZ WILLIAMS: Just wanted to win. Just really wanted to win. Coach been
preaching to us all day that we got to rebound, got to push Temple. So we did
whatever we had to do to win today. Just happy God blessed us tonight.

Q. Did you feel like it was your responsibility to kind of take over?

CHAZ WILLIAMS: I was just basically doing what the team wanted. It was kind of
getting close. Freddie was being denied. They were playing on him. So I just
had to make plays.

Q. Freddie, the season\'s been kind of a journey for you. This defensive
performance you feel like kind of put a finishing touch on your
transformation?

FREDDIE RILEY: I don\'t think so. I think the finishing touch would be ending
the season on a win. So we\'re just going to try to play defense the best I
can and help my team to be in a position to win.

Q. Chaz, there were a couple times where you came up the floor, banged up your
leg or your hand. How much of a toll does it take on your body? Every time you
crash in the rim, it seemed like you were on the ground or on the floor. Very
hard getting banged up?

CHAZ WILLIAMS: I played football, so I\'m kind of used to it. Every day at
practice, it\'s tough. These guys out here don\'t make it easy for us. My
teammates, we go hard every day. So it\'s something you\'re kind of used to.
Just got to fall and get back up.

Q. Chaz, one of the timeouts, it really seemed like you were bent over and you
were gassed. Looked like you were gassed. How tired were you at that point?

CHAZ WILLIAMS: I was pretty exhausted. That\'s close to that media timeout, he
left me in. So I was trying to play. When the media timeout came, I just knew
I had a nice little break so I just wanted to get as much time in and catch my
breath.

Q. Chaz, was this like the game was on the line, was it basically like
[indiscernible] carry it?

CHAZ WILLIAMS: No, not at all. We were together. No matter what. If I\'m
scoring, one of my teammates got a pick or a steal down low. So I always play
with my teammates. Tonight was just one of those nights where God blessed us,
the shots was falling. So they just kept going to me.

Q. Chaz, I know you were passing, but obviously Freddie did it most of the
game. But talk about the job you did and how tough of a job it is.

CHAZ WILLIAMS: Freddie is a great defender. He gave me tough battle in
practice. He\'s a tough cookie. So he\'s just out there playing as hard as he
can. He did a great job. For Wyatt to go 4 for 19, I tell Freddie, "Good job."

Q.Freddie, at the end of the game, you hit the three‑pointer. You jumped in
the air, you pumped your fist, because it put you guys up five points. Tell us
about your feelings at that point. It was a huge shot for you.

FREDDIE RILEY: I was actually just happy I finally made a shot. I had a
drought for a long time. I was happy it extended the lead. I knew that if we
got enough stops, the lead would stay up and we would win the game. So I was
happy to get the lead up to maybe two possessions so we can be in a good
position to win.

Q. So obviously, now, it\'s VCU, and last time, the second half didn\'t go the
way you guys wanted it to go. What can you guys take away from that,
especially that half? Especially in the opening minutes. With the press,
you\'ve got to stay away from it.

UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Gone from the good to the bad. Coach going to do a great
job breaking down the film and giving us a game plan. So we\'ll learn from our
mistakes from the last game and keep it positive, just improve.

THE MODERATOR: Two more questions for the players.

Q. You said the crowd was a factor in the first VCU game. Did you guys see the
crowd tonight in the first game when you got here and any thoughts on that?

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I guess their crowd travels wherever they go. I mean,
it\'s good to have a good crowd here for‑‑ it\'s kind of a big arena. I\'m
expecting a lot of UMass to be here tomorrow and the next day. So we can\'t
get caught up in the crowd situation. Just got to come out and execute the
game.

Q. Chaz, do you think you guys are an NCAA Tournament team?

CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, actually, I believe so. That\'s what we\'re working for.
We\'re trying to prove to the world that, and we\'re just fighting \'til we
make it.

THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

Q. Derek, same question.

COACH KELLOGG: I forgot that question already. No, I believe we\'re a very
good basketball team, and I believe‑‑ I leave that to the powers that be to
make that decision. And I\'m really just worried about getting ready for VCU
tomorrow and not really having as much time to prepare as we did for Temple.
We at least had 24 hours. Now we have, by the time we get home, after our meal
tonight, we\'ll probably have about, you know, 12, 14, 16 hours, whatever it
might be. So that\'s the biggest thing on my mind right now.

Q. Coach, Khalif Wyatt is a Player of the Year. He\'s 4 of 19 tonight. What do
you think you guys did defensively well against him tonight?

COACH KELLOGG: I thought we did a good job of crowding him, really making him
work for every basket. It was a team effort and Freddie took out a challenge
of making it hard for him. When you\'re playing a player of his caliber, it\'s
a team effort to make it hard on him.

And then he didn\'t get as many kind of break‑away lay‑ups. A lot of time, he
helps our defense, goes for some steals, gets two or three of those a game,
and that helps get him going.

Q. Coach, how much has the Temple/UMass rivalry meant to the two programs?

COACH KELLOGG: I think it\'s been‑‑ it\'s something that obviously as a
player, it was big time and I think it still carries some weight. But we have
a lot of‑‑ I think with so many good teams in the conference, there\'s a lot
of games that are starting to really have a lot of rivalry feeling. It\'s one
of those things where we\'re going to miss them. But same token, we\'ve got to
pick somebody else now, I guess.

Q. Coach, did you get a chance to see the VCU game as well? What are your
thoughts?

COACH KELLOGG: No, I stayed in the locker room. I heard the fans. I think
it\'s going to be a battle, who can have the most fans here tomorrow.

Q. Derek, you guys killed them on the boards, 40 to 23, and Anthony Lee just
wasn\'t right tonight. How much of a factor was that in this game?

COACH KELLOGG: I thought they tried to go small and take Cady out of the game.
They were playing a game that they were putting a shooter in at the 5‑spot so
we had to get Cady out of the game. Cady had a nice run in the last five or
six minutes where he kind of dominated the boards and did good things for us.
And he stuck to his game defensively.

I thought it was a chess match with Coach Dunphy that he was putting a shooter
in there so we had to get Cady out of the game.

Q. Just another game from Chaz. Can you describe what he does?

COACH KELLOGG: He played tonight. I thought last night he waited a little too
long to step on the gas. He had the Brooklyn jitters and playing in the
beautiful Barclays Center. But tonight he played well. He was using those ball
screens and rifling them up and doing a great job. I thought our guys did a
nice job also of getting him open, of setting good ball screen, of kind of
moving into good positions to get him open.

So when he plays well, it\'s kind of a team thing, where they make plays for
him.

Q. You were in the same position last year. How much different was this
preparing and how much executing in this game?

COACH KELLOGG: It was very‑‑ I think it was similar, except last year we were
able‑‑ we went from the home game and had an extra day between to really rest
up a little more and be prepared probably a little bit more. I thought our
team, our run last year in the A‑10 Tournament and the NIT, I think the guys
have matured a little bit in that situation, and I think that helps us today.

THE MODERATOR: Anybody else? Thank you.

COACH KELLOGG: Thank you.

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  82  
SAINT JOSEPHS  79

  
THE MODERATOR: Opening statement from Coach Martelli and then questions for
Langston Galloway. Coach, please.  
COACH MARTELLI: I just complimented my team, told them that they played hard.
We asked them to play a full 40. Actually, we played 'til the last possession
there. We didn't play well, but we played hard.  
Missed opportunities in the first half. It opens with a breakaway. And the
free‑throw line let us down the entire game, especially in the first half.
Really, that was a nice tempo. You know, if you extrapolate that out, that's
66 points. We could get there. We're not going to get there 83, 84, 85, which
we had to do. Had some not empty possessions, but empty positions. We didn't
get everything out of the positions tonight. Playing against teams with that
kind of firepower, you need everything going for you.  
  
Q. Langston, can you talk about how this team, you looked very
[indiscernible], kept fighting and came back?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, Coach just said to keep playing hard and give it
all. That's what we did. He said play all 40 minutes. We wanted to keep
fighting and hoping it could turn around.  
  
Q. You guys played these guys earlier in the year, but now playing them for
the second game, two days in a row, did you feel that effect in your legs a
little bit?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Not at all. I mean, we got some good rest last night. And I
personally got good rest. And I feel like we came out and played hard. The
ball didn't go in the hoop tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult it was from the three ‑point line
[inaudible].   
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Well, we messed up on a couple. They hit jumpers when they
needed to, and that was the difference in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the players [indiscernible] tonight.  
COACH MARTELLI: Scored a lot of points.  
  
Q. It didn't seem like it was necessarily that their [inaudible].  
COACH MARTELLI: We didn't do a very good job, Mike, with how quickly they
moved the ball. That's my responsibility to explain that more to them. We did
an extensive scouting report today. But the ball was really hot for them.
Very, very hot. And those‑‑ that ball movement, and then we had some
assignments, we had some assignments that we thought were sound. Maybe we
didn't have‑‑ maybe it wasn't explained well enough. But we missed assignments
in some of that run, and we, like some young players, most young players, we
dropped our head a little bit when the ball wasn't going in.  
Let me just follow that up. Like when your team loses, scoring points means
nothing. So nobody on our team played well. We lost.  
  
Q. Phil, what [indiscernible] technical and how big an effect did that
have?  
COACH MARTELLI: I don't quite know, and I'm not‑‑ they said when he went by
somebody, that they interpreted that he threw his elbow back at the guy and
caught him in the chin or the throat. I don't know. I mean, I have nothing but
praise for those guys. They‑‑ it was a hard game right in the very beginning,
but it's the most time that I've met with a referee in all of my time. We had
three meetings. I thought I was being called to the principal's office, that I
had done something wrong. But they said that‑‑ and to be honest with you, it
was just playing the game, so to speak. So I think it took it‑‑ I thought we
had a bucket and a foul to cut it from 8 to 5, and it went the other way, and
it was ten. It didn't stop us from playing. I tried not to dwell on it in my
own head, because I thought it was a hard game, because I did think that both
teams played probably at times too hard.  
  
Q. Phil, again, I know the main thing is to win, but is there anything
positive you can take out of the last two nights here?  
COACH MARTELLI: Not all losses are losing experiences and not all wins are
winning experiences. I compliment, as I said in the beginning, I compliment my
team. We asked them to play a full 40 minutes. They played a full 40 minutes.
But you get a scholarship to play hard and you have to play well. I don't
think we played particularly well for long stretches of this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, everybody.

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Tyreek Duren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25052)

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Jerrell Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25053)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

BUTLER  69  
La SALLE  58

  
THE MODERATOR: From LaSalle University, Dr. John Giannini, and Jerrell Wright.  
COACH GIANNINI: We lost to a very good team. Their defense had a lot to do
with our frustrations. The size of rebounding had a lot to do with our
frustrations. I don't think we played particularly well. We had a few
situations there. We really cut it down. We had a wide open three and really
cut it down late. Just couldn't get over the hump.  
We're second in the league in three‑goal percentage, and we've been missing
some that could really us the last couple of games. Really wasn't our best
game. When Tyreek Duren doesn't get an assist, when Ramon Galloway have one
goal apiece, you're not playing your best.  
Now, Butler has a ton to do with that, but I thought there were times we could
have had something to do with that. Maybe not the whole game, but there were
key times we had opportunities, and it just didn't go for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Tyreek, I know how much you guys love coach and how important this is to
you. Was anything said specifically by you to Ramon?  
TYREEK DUREN: I said our season's not over. We have more games to play. This
isn't your last basketball game. We have plenty of more games to play. Don't
let it affect your last couple of games.  
  
Q. Considering how important this game was, you guys talked about the NCAA
Tournament and hoping to get a win. Was it extra disappointing that it wasn't
your best game today?  
TYREEK DUREN: I think every game you lose is a disappointment. We wanted to
win this game and advance to the tournament, but we've got to move forward.
This isn't our last game. We've got to put it behind us.  
  
Q. At times it was an intense defensive game. Do you think exhaustion on
either team played into some of this?  
TYREEK DUREN: It might have. The biggest thing with us is we weren't
rebounding. I think any time you get outrebounded, you're not going to win a
game.  
  
Q. Jerrell, how tough was it with Smith and those big guys in there? How
difficult was it to fit in there with all the size that they had?  
JERRELL WRIGHT: I don't think it was that tough. During the game, I was
expecting it. I was expecting to get screened when I had the ball. So I was
aware of every play.  
  
Q. You said that ‑‑ Tyreek said that you guys have more games to play, and
you certainly do. Are you a little more nervous now about Selection Sunday?   
TYREEK DUREN: I don't want to say we're nervous. Depending on how other teams
do. I think we belong in the NCAA Tournament. Like I say, any way you look at
it, this isn't our last game.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, do you want to make the case for your team's inclusion in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH GIANNINI: I don't think I have to. I don't even think I should. Our
record speaks for itself. Our standing, finishing third in our great league
speaks for itself. I think we have some high‑level wins like VCU and Buffalo
and Villanova that speaks for themselves.  
But there's some good teams out there. I have no idea how we compare to these
other teams. I think we've been in the discussion. The crazy thing is, if you
talk to the people who studied us, we've been in pretty much all year. It
would be pretty sad for us to lose it here in the last two, three days.  
Again, people you respect have had us in for a long time. So we must have some
of it on our resume. There's no question, if we won today, we're in. And now,
frankly, we might be at the mercy of others a little bit. And the crazy thing
is a lot of the people that were fighting for those last spots, they have
awfully tough games too.  
  
Q. John, can you just talk about Brad Stevens as a coach. What makes him so
good. What is it like coaching against him?  
COACH GIANNINI: I think always, as good a coach as he is, it goes back to
players. A coach at our level selects the players. I think he has a certain
kind of guy in mind, and they turn out to be super tough, extremely skilled,
really smart. Of course, he's built a culture over there. So I think‑‑ I don't
go back to late game adjustments or game planning. That's all fine. But if you
don't have players and the culture and guys who fit what you want to do, it's
all for naught.  
I credit him with building a program. That's what he's done. He's built a
program. More than win games, he's built a program.  
  
Q. John, Ramon obviously didn't have the greatest offensive game. He was
chasing Clarke around the whole game. Did that factor in the other side of it?
Or was that a gamble you made?  
COACH GIANNINI: I was a little bit disappointed with the week that we had. We
had some guys banged up, and we tried to go hard Monday, and it was clear,
whether it was physically or mentally, we weren't getting a great practice and
a great physical effort.  
And I think keeping guys fresh and healthy is important. So we did a lot of
skill work, but I do think we got fatigued today. In hindsight, we probably
didn't do enough this week, but in our defense, when we had guys with lower
back things and form issues and calf issues, it's hard to try to squeeze blood
out of a rock and march in practice. That's what we felt like we were doing.  
I felt like the fatigue was a big factor, which is crazy because they played
yesterday. But we were‑‑ I think we were real tired, and I don't know what I
would have done differently, but we didn't look like we had the ability to
really push them physically this week. I think it really hurt us today.  
  
Q. John, you have one of your best players like Galloway, just to kind of
follow up on Sam's question. When he has a game like he's having, 1 for 10,
seems like he's struggling every shot, what's going through your mind? Do you
have to walk a fine line at all about how much rope you give him?  
COACH GIANNINI: No. We've come this far. When you come that far with a First
Team All‑Conference guy, you're not changing at the last second. I think
continuing that confidence in guys is important, not only in this game, but
moving forward. And at any moment, he could make four or five in a row.  
In fact, when a good player is struggling, I expect them to start making shots
at any moment.  
  
Q. John, did you feel Ramon was pressing a little, and did you feel the need
to take him aside and calm him down a little?  
COACH GIANNINI: Both. I think he tried really hard. I think he wanted to win.
I think he wanted to be aggressive. I certainly wouldn't fault his effort in
this game at all. I think he played really hard. If anything, he might have
tried too hard.  
  
Q. Coach, when guys struggle from time to time, you've talked about floor
shots may not go in. In a big game when it happens to a guy that means so much
to you and your program, do you hurt for him even more?  
COACH GIANNINI: There's no time to hurt during the game. During the game,
you're trying to win, and you've got to be tough, and it's not the time. Game
time is not the time to be sensitive. You've got to be smart. After the game,
of course you feel awful, and he feels awful. Of course you feel awful after
the game.  
These kids have a schedule that most people can't imagine. They're up early.
They're lifting and in the training room, and they're in study hall, and
they're in class, and they're at practice, and they're in video rooms. They
work awfully hard for all of us, and when you have good kids and good players
like us, you really come to appreciate them. Of course you're going to feel
bad when they come up short.  
  
Q. You mentioned the loss, but you don't feel like you have anything to
apologize for what you've done. Do you feel like you're hurt or could be hurt
in the eyes of the committee by the fact that LaSalle hasn't been on the NCAA
radar in a little bit?  
COACH GIANNINI: No, I think that their job is to pick who they think the best
teams are. We did win 20 games last year, and we have been on discussions
throughout the year. The mock exercise, we were in. So I don't think they're
going to be surprised by considering LaSalle based on last year and this year
at all.  
  
Q. Following that up, John, what will you do the next couple of days? Are
you going to watch various league games and try to figure out where you
stand?  
COACH GIANNINI: It's interesting. One of the schools in our situation is Boise
State, and I think he said, when he was in this situation once before, he
watched every school and made himself nuts. He's not going to do it. For the
record, I'm going to make myself nuts.  
  
Q. [Inaudible.]  
COACH GIANNINI: No, you just live and die with every play. You know who needs
to win, and you know who needs to lose. We get a break, and we end up being
judged on 30 games as opposed to our last two. By the way, our loss is to
potential Final Four teams.  
  
Q. If you are able to get into the tournament, given everything that this
whole season has been like across the country, do you just feel like ‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: I'll talk about another A‑10 team here. Two years ago, we had
an underachieving team. They finished 15‑18, not a horrible team, but we were
pretty talented. Our preseason that year was against VCU, and it was a
15‑minute, dead even, down to the last point, even scrimmage. If someone told
me after that scrimmage that one of the teams were going to the Final Four, I
would have been pretty excited because it was that even.  
So I think if you‑‑ yeah, I think there's a ton of great teams out there. The
team we lost to, they beat two Number 1 teams. There's no question. The reason
why, it has nothing to do with players leading their way into the draft or
nothing like that. The reason why is schools are very committed. At LaSalle,
we take basketball very seriously. When you take basketball seriously, you
build a program, and there's just a lot of good teams. There's a lot of
schools that are very committed that want to be in that NCAA Tournament. They
invest a lot into it, and we're one of them. There's a lot of good teams.  
There's more good teams where people talk about college basketball being down,
maybe it's not the Jordans and Ewings out there, but there's more good teams
than ever.  
  
Q. First of all, up to the breaking news, they have you as the last team in
right now. I just thought you might want to know.  
COACH GIANNINI: I hope that's not a Philly favorite, by the way.  
  
Q. There you go. Good point. Can you speak on the power of the A ‑10 and
kind of trampoline off of the different kinds of teams and styles and how that
will benefit you if you do get in, no matter who you get.   
COACH GIANNINI: I think we're really hard to play against. We're a little
smaller, but we're hard to play against. One of the things about how we play
is people aren't used to us. Obviously, we had more success against Butler the
first time around. They missed a key player the first time. We missed a key
player the second time.  
When people are familiar with you and you have a different type of style of
play, when you are smaller and quicker, that is very different. I think, when
people play us for the first time, it's hard for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Khalif Wyatt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21967)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

MASSACHUSETTS  79  
TEMPLE  74

  
COACH DUNPHY: This second year in a row, UMass did a good job against us to
find a way to win the first‑round game for us. It's a little bit of an
advantage when you can play on Thursday, a little bit of an advantage on
Friday, and then the advantage goes the other way if you get a little bit
deeper. But we were a little bit fresher early, but we didn't take advantage
of‑‑ they turned it a lot in the first half. We didn't take advantage, and
then they made shots in that second half. And we came up a little bit short.
Credit to UMass.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of the players.  
  
Q. Khalif, can you talk about your shooting form tonight, what was going
on?  
KHALIF WYATT: I had some good looks. They kept coming to me, and kept on
trusting me. The ball just wasn't going in. Took some tough shots. Just trying
to make plays and ball wouldn't go in today.  
  
Q. Rahlir, would you describe from your perspective the play in the last 20
seconds or so, where it looked like you might have forced a jump ball, and
then the whistle blew and UMass got the ball back?  
RAHLIR HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: I just thought I had my hand on the ball and I felt
that he caught a jump ball, but I guess‑‑ or he stepped out of bounds. Nothing
you can do about that.  
  
Q. Rahlir, your 30 minutes tonight, just talk about your overall
performance.  
RAHLIR HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: Just was trying to make sure, trying to help my team
get a win in the first round of the tournament, and help the other guys get a
taste of wins in the A‑10 Tournament.  
  
Q. Khalif, how frustrated were you not only by Chaz guarding you, but seemed
like UMass threw multiple defenders on you to throw you off your game. How
frustrating was that for you?  
KHALIF WYATT: They did a good job defending me. I still had some good looks.
Just couldn't put it in. I mean, they're a good defensive team. They're
athletic. They're strong. They play hard. So just give them a lot of credit
for playing solid defense.  
  
Q. Khalif, last year you guys lost the A ‑10 Tournament to UMass. This year,
you played them, and you guys beat them by one point. Tonight, you're not on
the winning end of things. How much of a tough matchup is this UMass team when
you play them?   
KHALIF WYATT: They're a good team. They play hard, they play together. Chaz
Williams is one of the best players in the conference, and he plays‑‑ he
definitely leads this group and it was real tough down the stretch. He made
some plays to help his team get over the edge.  
  
Q. Khalif, I guess the main question everybody's asking is what will the
next 48 hours be like for you guys? Everybody thinks you're in the tournament,
but is there a sense of nervousness right now?  
KHALIF WYATT: Yeah, it's up in the air. It's nothing we can control for the
next two days. Just going to go back to Philly, get some rest and wait for
Sunday and hope that our name gets called.  
  
Q. Rahlir, you guys were down 40 ‑23, what was going on [inaudible]?   
RAHLIR HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: Well, they just got to the glass, the offensive
glass. We weren't able to get a body on them sometimes, and they just were
able to hunt down the ball and rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Dunphy.  
  
Q. Fran, you guys tonight, the rebounding, how much do you think that was a
factor in what happened?  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, the rebounding edge is 13‑9, the way I look at it. They
got four more offensive rebounds than we did. They didn't miss as many shots
as we did. So that's going to be the discrepancy. We didn't check them off.
They got 13 tough offensive rebounds. We only could come up with nine of them.  
We didn't do a great job rebounding. Gave them a couple extra possessions. But
I think for us, we got‑‑ we turned them 19 times, which is pretty good for us,
and we only turned it ten times. So we got some extra possessions. We had a
few more shots attempted than they.  
(The balance of this press conference has not yet been provided for

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  82  
SAINT JOSEPHS  79

  
THE MODERATOR: Opening statement from Coach Smart and then we'll go to
questions for the players only. Please address your questions directly to the
players. Coach, go ahead.  
COACH SMART: It's a hard‑fought game. St.Joe's, give them lot of credit. They
really battled in the second half. They came at us, shot the ball extremely
well, made threes. We obviously played better defense in the second half.
That's what won us the game was the first half defense, which gave us a
ten‑point lead going into halftime.  
We shot 50 percent, but we did miss a lot of easy shots, open looks. We'll
make those as we go. It's good to survive and advance.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Shaka, can you talk about ‑‑  
COACH SMART: I think they want you to ask questions of the players.  
THE MODERATOR: Players first.  
  
Q. Troy, can you talk about the foul trouble and how to manage the roster,
you and Melvin adjusted and other guys.  
TROY DANIELS: The young guys, we stepped up. Once the older guys, talking
about guys, they came in the game and gave us a big push. We needed that.
We're going into March. We need that, for the younger guys to step up, and
they did.  
  
Q. Melvin, how nice was it to have a game like this in front of a lot of
friendly faces?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It was unreal. I just wanted to come out, play my best and
perform as well as I possibly could and just get a team win, and I think
tonight, I feel proud of myself.  
  
Q. Melvin, following up on that, in the first half, St.Joe's cut it to three
and then you scored six straight points. Can you just talk about that stretch
and what it felt like for you, coming to a game in New York and playing in
Barclay s. Talk about that a little bit.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I didn't anticipate that. I just tried to come in and do
whatever a team needs. I didn't want to try to do too much extra to impress
anybody in the crowd. But Coach give me a green light. I felt as though I had
some great coaches. He ran my play a few times, and I just made some plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the players?  
  
Q. Troy, talk about what happened in the last two minutes? Can you talk
about that? You jacked up a couple.  
TROY DANIELS: Just went out there playing loose. We have to play our
basketball, and we just attack the ball. Coach gave us the green light, and we
made the shots, and he didn't have a problem with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Thank you.  
All right, questions for Coach Smart.  
  
Q. Shaka, could you talk about how you had to manage your bench in the first
half? You were shuffling players in and out. Some players hadn't gotten a lot
of minutes this year and what your thought process was to keep your team in
the game.  
COACH SMART: Well, we planned on using all of our guys anyway, just because
this type of setting, if you're fortunate to advance, you have to play
back‑to‑back games, and if you advance again, you have to play two games in
two days. We got some good contributions when guys got in foul trouble. Some
guys on the team I'm comfortable putting back in the game that have two fouls
in the first half. And then there's other guys that I don't quite have the
same comfort level with. So they got to come out and need someone else to go
in.  
I thought Teddy, Jarred, Justin, David Hinton, they did a nice job holding the
fort down. We were really, I guess the best word is outweighed out there in
the front line for much of the first half. They just had a little more size.
But our guys battled and fought, and that was what helped us build the
ten‑point lead.  
  
Q. If they hadn't played as they had, you guys might have been in danger of
letting that game get away in the first half. It seems to me that's the
case.  
COACH SMART: No question. We had other guys on the bench. So those guys that
came in the game had to play at a high level. Otherwise, you're exactly right.
St.Joe's wouldn't have gone on a run and we'd have gone into the half with a
ten‑point lead. And we needed that. We needed that lead at the half because
our guys did not defend particularly well in the second half and the final
margin was three points.  
  
Q. [No microphone.]  
COACH SMART: He's still making the adjustment. He's made really good strides.
And I got a text message from his mom yesterday, and she said, "My nerves are
shot," and I said, "Okay, well, don't talk to Melvin because we don't want
Melvin to feel that way."  
But he's a confident kid to come out in this setting as a freshman and attack.
I actually thought, you know, he had 12 points, but there were some balls that
he didn't make that could go in. So it certainly could have been much more
than that. But certainly, the contribution he gave us was huge.  
  
Q. Coach, how happy were you with the overall poise of your entire team,
given the disparity with the fouls, especially in the first half?  
COACH SMART: Yeah. I was happy with the boys. I mean, we talk about having
great spirit on our team, and that's where we're at, we have spirit. I think
the teams that win this time of year are able to respond when things don't go
their way, whether they're bad calls or receive bad calls or, you know, missed
shots or the other team goes on a run. You know, what really helped us with
that was our crowd. There was a phenomenal group of fans from VCU that
traveled up here from New York. And I haven't had an official count, but it
looked like we had as many or more than anyone else, and that just says a lot
about our fans. That helped tonight, because like you said, there were some
things that went bad, and we stayed tough.  
  
Q. Coach, Briante, five assists tonight, and five steals. Can you talk about
the skill set he brings to you guys, especially in the context of the
system?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I think with those five steals, he became our all‑time
single season guy, record holder for stealing the ball. He's huge for us,
because he really causes problems for opposing ball handlers. Whether he
steals the ball or not, he's always a threat.  
I thought he gave us terrific energy. We hit a lull in the first half, and we
had some guys that looked a little tired and a little‑‑ lacked a little
confidence in there. Bri really had good spirit. He was clapping and energized
and getting his teammates going. He was instrumental in getting Juvonte here
to kind of get him going a little bit. He's got the most swagger of anybody on
our team. And that's really important, because we don't have an extremely
confident team for a team that has the type of record that we have.  
  
Q. Shaka, conventional wisdom says 15 ‑point lead, two and a half minutes
left, you know, you run some shot clock. Conventional wisdom was almost right
tonight. But can you just give a lecture on your philosophy a little bit?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I don't know if you know too much about our school. We're
not conventional. Think about it this way. If you got a wide open trey for
Troy Daniels, wide open, on the line, I'll take that. Maybe conventional
wisdom says otherwise. But I'll take my chances with that. I've seen that guy
make too many shots, and he's made‑‑ I think he's made as many as anyone in
the Atlantic 10 except for a handful of guys.  
So he was 4 for 13 tonight, which isn't a great percentage for him, but they
were pretty much all good looks. I think he might have rushed one. That's just
what we do, you know. We're not very good on not being aggressive.  
Now, some of those possessions, I'll agree with you, didn't go our way because
we missed, and they got the rebound and then not much time came off the clock.
But that's a gamble that I'm Willing to make, because again, that's going to
pay off most of the time.  
THE MODERATOR: Two more questions.  
  
Q. Shaka, can you talk about, there were two testy moments in this game that
kind of got you a little bit. One was the tie ‑up when Briante got the ball.
Talk about what happened after that. And the other was the flagrant foul.   
COACH SMART: Yeah. Bri also seems to be in the middle of those types of
things. He's a scrapper and we need that. That's what we're about. We're not a
pretty team. We're a scrappy team. And he was in the middle of the loose ball.
We take pride in getting to the floor before anyone else does. So that's what
happened there.  
And there were all sorts of things that happened that energize our guys.
There's a lot of pent‑up emotion and energy inside of you when you're waiting
all week to play, particularly if you're coming off a loss, like we were. So
those types of things get us going.  
And then in terms of the flagrant foul or technical foul, you know, I actually
didn't see it. I have to watch it on tape. I guess there was an elbow thrown,
and we got two free throws.  
  
Q. Can you say, somebody said something to you, and you all came on the
floor. What happened?  
COACH SMART: Oh, yeah, there was a little jawing out there. But that's what
happens. I like that. In fact, there were some guys talking trash to me before
the game. I just smile like that. Because reality is we're competitors,
whether you're a coach, a manager, a player. We're here to compete.  
St. Joe's is a very good basketball team and a very well‑coached basketball
team. It's not easy.  
The reason I went out on the floor at that time is I just wanted to make sure
guys were broken up and there wasn't any extracurricular stuff involving our
guys or their guys.  
  
Q. Coach, the three from Troy, is that a secret weapon you've been holding
out for the post ‑season or is that just ACL basketball?  
COACH SMART: He can shoot. He can really shoot. You'll see a lot of those as
we go. He just didn't make it at all earlier in the year when we were playing.
But he's spent countless hours after practice working on his shooting with our
coaches and getting to the gym on his own.  
It paid off tonight. I told him in the locker room, I said, "You know, I know
it's just one shot, but I don't know if you know this, but we won by three,
and you hit a three. So we needed every basket." I think overall, just the
contribution that he made in 14 minutes after not having played much lately
says a lot about his future.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Dwayne Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23453)

### [Mike McCall, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25046)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

Saint Louis  72  
Charlotte  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Head Coach Jim Crews, Mike McCall, Jr., and Dwayne
Evans.  
COACH CREWS: I just thought we really got off to a good start. I thought our
defense generated a lot of good things for us. From an offensive standpoint,
probably the first 10 or 12 minutes. Then we got a little stagnant, went zone,
gave us a little problems for a while, and we kind of got a better rhythm for
the situation.  
Then I thought at the 15‑ or 16‑minute mark of the second half, about five
minutes, we kind of had another good little spurt that really was able to help
us.  
I thought our guys did a good job of going from the zone defense and switching
back to man‑to‑man defense, did a nice job, and we did a good job‑‑ I don't
know what the stats showed or not, but they got ten offensive rebounds.
They're a very physical team, very strong team. I thought that our guys did a
nice job of collectively rebounding.  
It looked like Dwayne got a lot of rebounds. I don't know if he got nine. He
did a great job on boards. So we're really pleased to beat a stellar team.
Tournament play is tough. We know we've got another tough opponent tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Both you guys feel free to answer. Playing here in Brooklyn, just
obviously, you know, a very bustling, bustling scene, so to speak, and I know
you have a business ‑like attitude with this, but it obviously still is a very
big thing to be moving to Brooklyn, playing on that stage, coming in,
remaining focused, but still appreciating for the scene that's around you.
First to you, Dwayne, and then you, Mike.   
DWAYNE EVANS: To play here is amazing. Would love to check everything out.
Even then, we know what we came here for.  
MIKE McCALL, JR.: Like Dwayne said, it's always good to play in an NBA arena.
Throughout the tournament, you've got to keep staying focused.  
  
Q. Dwayne, could you just speak to whenever you guys were able to get the
ball. You especially hit 8 of 9 shots and were very effective. Just how it was
inside when you got the ball.  
DWAYNE EVANS: It was good because we've got a bunch of guys who are really
good three‑point shooters. You have to cover them and leave the inside open.
So we kind of played in and out. And they went out to in. It was effective
because we had a bunch of guys that could do a bunch of different things.  
  
Q. Mike, for the guards, when Dwayne is having a game like this where you're
getting the ball inside and he scored almost every time, what's it like for
you guys as the play makers and ball handlers aren't getting it to him?  
MIKE McCALL, JR.: I mean, he scores almost every time I give him an open shot,
and that's something that he wants. Give him the ball, and it's going up.  
  
Q. Dwayne, can you talk a little bit about the entry pass that you guys were
getting in from the guards. It gave Charlotte a lot of problems. Could you
talk about that.  
DWAYNE EVANS: I thought we had some of the best passes in America out there. A
lot of those passes I hardly saw coming from Jordair, Mike, even our bigs.
That's something we stress in practice, and something we were able to do.  
  
Q. Mike, they had cut it to three in the first half, and then you guys had a
spurt where it was like 13 ‑0\. You had a hand, it seems, in every play during
that time, either scoring or assisting. It seemed to go by in a blip. Take us
through that a little bit.   
MIKE McCALL, JR.: Yeah, teams are going to make runs on us all the time. We
just need to go on to the next play and try to make a run ourselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players?  
  
Q. Dwayne and Mike, you guys don't know who you're going to play next, but
having beaten Butler and LaSalle pretty handily the first time, can you talk
about what it's going to be like playing those guys and actually,
specifically, like what do you remember about the first game against
LaSalle?  
DWAYNE EVANS: I mean, they played four guards was the biggest change. They had
a lot of speed out there on the court, and their big was inside and did a lot
of damage too. It's a different game playing them. We've got to keep getting
up to the line, keep at the three‑point line, and it's really been the same
formula all year.  
MIKE McCALL, JR.: Like he said, they play four guards, and mostly they play
like a lot of one‑on‑ones. So get the guards in there and keep them in the
lane. Make it a tough shot for them.  
  
Q. Dwayne, just talk about getting the quick start you guys got off to in
forcing the turnovers. Charlotte having played a game, you guys hadn't played
since last Saturday, and the importance of being able to do that today.  
DWAYNE EVANS: Yeah, we got out to a really quick start, and the guys were
feeling really good, especially after we got that first round bye. But, yeah,
our defense, we weren't gambling with steals, making really solid defensive
plays, and that's what contributed to the run.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Thank you so much.  
Questions for Coach Crews?  
  
Q. Coach, once Dwayne has three fouls fairly early in the second half, it
made a little bit of a run, and you kind of knew you had to get him out there
at some point?  
COACH CREWS: I think you always have a hard time sometimes with fouls. I know
a lot of coaches have a two‑foul policy in the first half. We can't play off
the seat of our pants a little bit in terms of situations and where we are.
But we'll play guys with two in the first half, and then what we usually do,
if they get two or three quickly in the second half, take them out for a
little bit, but we want them back in.  
One thing that we feel like, if guys are playing‑‑ it kind of screws up our
rotation. We just want to keep the rotation as good as we can. Every situation
is a little bit different that we play with. We're not right all the time.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like during the first half there were a few points where
Charlotte got the lead to three and then Kwamain hits the three and gets the
four ‑point play, and you guys go on that run. Can you talk about the ability
of your players to make those plays to stop Charlotte from really making it a
close game.   
COACH CREWS: I think the guys did a tremendous job. Basketball's not a game of
perfect, and so you're going to make mistakes. When you make a mistake, or
things aren't going your way, you just try to do the next right thing. That
doesn't mean that things aren't going to go well, but if you keep doing the
next right thing, eventually good things are going to happen.  
I think our guys have really had a good mentality and attitude with that type
of attitude and mentality in terms of, hey, we're going to make mistakes, but
it's going to be aggressive, and we're just going to bounce back and just play
the next play.  
There's, whatever, 160 plays a game. You have those opportunities. Now, if you
have a mentality where there's 160 plays so we can keep making mistakes,
that's not good. I think they're always‑‑ they don't waste too many
possessions.  
  
Q. Coach, does finding out your opponent give you a chance to make any last
‑minute preparations at all?   
COACH CREWS: It's interesting. We practiced Monday through Thursday, and we
didn't know who we were going to play. Every practice was done, and we didn't
know who we were going to play. So that's interesting. That's different. I
don't think seeds mean anything in the tournament. The number one seed, the
thing we liked about it is our guys won a championship. That's the only thing
that it means.  
Seeds mean nothing because the A‑10 is so strong. So that's all thrown out the
window. And it's another question about Charlotte playing the second game.
It's always you like it, getting that bye, definitely you like getting the
bye, but as soon as the other team wins and you know who you're playing,
you're going, you know what, they feel really good about themselves, and
they've got experience with winning. So it's not such an advantage, you don't
think, all of a sudden.  
I don't know what the right answer is, but it does. We play every 24 hours. So
there's not‑‑ you can't do a whole lot of tweaking.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at the stats, you guys shot 37 percent. Aside from
Dwayne, it was like 27 percent. Can you just talk about the other ways and the
things you saw them do today that they got the win, helped the guys get the
win.  
COACH CREWS: I think we got the win kind of like we usually do. It comes from
all kinds of different‑‑ I mean, we get a little from the defense, a little
inside. We don't shoot the ball that well from three. It seemed like we get
threes at the right time, get to the line‑‑ I mean, we have a lot of different
ways. I don't know if we're really, really good at any of them, but we're good
at a lot of them.  
And same thing with the players. They just‑‑ this guy, this game or next game
or these three guys or those four guys. That's kind of the beauty of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned earlier a crazy defensive start in this game. The
team that you were focusing on trying to stop their post ‑scoring, how much
emphasis did you put on that before the game, and what was your defensive game
plan before this?   
COACH CREWS: They had 44 points in the game, and they're very, very physical
in size, so the inside game was paramount. So that was a focus of ours.
There's a lot of things that go into that from the perimeter standpoint. It's
not all isolated. Getting guys to catch the ball maybe a little further out so
the passes are longer and really have an active hand so the ball doesn't go in
the post and get help side from the back side.  
So it's a team thing to take away the post, but definitely‑‑ and they are
extremely good interior passers with their big guys. I mean, extremely good.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys won 13 of 14. Can you just talk about the level of
confidence the team's playing with and how their maturity has really built
over the years. I think you're 21 ‑3 since the first of the year.  
COACH CREWS: Our guys have had a good maturity on the court and off the court
with a lot of different situations. I think that they've really‑‑ another
thing that we have which is a little bit different, I think we've got a bunch
of guys that are leaders, but we don't have one or two guys that kind of stand
on top of the mountain top and say whatever needs to be said. We don't have
those type of personalities.  
So everything has kind of peaked with us. They don't get real excited. They
don't get real down. They just kind of keep plugging away. That's a great
trait that they have.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thanks.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Rotnei Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19418)

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

### [Kameron Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25051)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

BUTLER  69  
LaSALLE  58

  
THE MODERATOR: Butler University first with Kameron Woods and Rotnei Clark.  
COACH STEVENS: I thought we played well the majority of the game. Hard team to
play against. Hard to guard those guys. They drive it so well. Thought we had
a number of contributions from a number of different guys. The difference
between last time and this time, certainly adding Rotnei helps, but the other
difference, I thought our 4 spots played great, both Khyle and Kam really,
really.  
They switch all those screens. They had guards on those guys a lot. Those guys
did a good job of going back to the ball and not accepting switching. It was
one of those things midseason where we probably hadn't worked on it enough to
be as effective as we should have been and clearly have gotten better at
handling it, which is a positive sign moving forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Rotnei, can you talk about what you've seen out of Kam, especially the
last couple of weeks.  
ROTNEI CLARKE: He's really stepped up his game the last couple of weeks. It
starts in practice. He's an extra spark for us when he comes in. He's all over
the boards. He makes all the energy plays, effort plays. He's especially good
on the offensive glass, we got a lot of putbacks and got some end ones these
last couple weeks. So he's been huge for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you tried to control yourself offensively,
considering LaSalle plays a small lineup with the four guards. Is it something
you talked about coming into the game?  
KAMERON WOODS: We definitely talked about it coming into the game. When people
switch, sometimes you can guard and create opportunities for them because at
the 4 spot we've got a lot of screens and pop. So it gives us a lot of
opportunities. Switching, you think, takes it away.  
I think this team went with smaller guys on you pretty much the whole game.
Whether it be slipping the ball screen or trying to post, my main thing is I
was just trying to attack the ball, so shot went up. I'm trying to go get it
or slipping and posting hard. Just all the little things.  
I don't think it was necessarily one thing that stuck out. I was just trying
to be really accurate. Trying to go get the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Bye, guys. Thank you. Questions
for Coach Stevens.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could just talk about what it's like playing here
in New York, in Brooklyn, how do you feel it's going. If you guys were to
potentially play at the Garden next year, what are your thoughts on that?  
COACH STEVENS: I don't know about any of that stuff. But certainly it's an
honor to play here in Brooklyn. It's a great tournament, and I feel like it's
going pretty well so far.  
  
Q. Coach, you had two games against Ramon, and he's got 10 points combined
against you. He hasn't done that against most teams. Is there something you
guys are doing differently, or is he just missing shots?  
COACH STEVENS: Glad you said that because I only remember two, and I remember
it very vividly where he laid it in to beat us. He's a really good player. I
think clearly we put our best defender on him. Roosevelt Jones is a heck of a
defender, and there's a reason he was All‑Defensive Team.  
But you have to pay him a lot of attention. The problem with putting Roose on
one guy, he can't guard the other guys, meaning you're going to have trouble‑‑
you're going to have to give up something.  
I thought Wright played well in there. We gave up a few more opportunities.
And I absolutely love Duren. I think he's a great point guard. He's a really
good player. I certainly hope they end up making the NCAA Tournament because
they'd be a hard matchup.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how the night that Rotnei wasn't shooting the
ball very well, how the rest of your team stepped up, especially the bigs.  
COACH STEVENS: The bigs have played well. Andrew Smith played great against
these guys the first time, and Fromm has really played well in limited
minutes, throughout the whole season and certainly the last two games. We need
those guys to be good against the smaller teams. I think it hurts having Zach
out for them obviously. We tried to do what Dayton tried to beat us yesterday,
and that was attack the paint all game.  
  
Q. I asked Jim Crews this earlier, and he said part of the reason why he
thinks this league will have so much success in the tournament, in the NCAA
Tournament, is because there's so many different styles that this league
plays. Do you kind of feel the same way, that there are so many different
teams that do different things that it almost prepares you for getting random
opponents in the NCAAs?  
COACH STEVENS: Yeah, I don't think there's any doubt about it. We're better
two months later because we played LaSalle twice because of the way that they
play. We're better from having getting beaten like a drum at VCU, and we're
better from having played St. Louis twice.  
And the styles, that's probably the most unique thing to our conference. When
we were in Horizon, it was very much a midwest style with some teams.
Everybody's got their own tweaks. But here it's all over the map how people
play, zone, man, switching man, whatever the case may be. So it challenges you
as a coach. It challenges your team. And it certainly, hopefully, adds to what
you're able to accomplish at the end of the season, I hope.  
  
Q. You face St. Louis for the third time tomorrow. What do you expect out of
the matchup tomorrow?  
COACH STEVENS: Unfortunately, I don't believe that statement at all. I'm not
one of the guys that buys into that. There's a reason they've beaten us twice,
and we're going to have to play better than we did each of the first two
times. We played better the second time but just not long enough..  
But credit to St. Louis. As you're sitting in my shoes right now, we've gotten
beaten twice, and there's really only been one common denominator in both of
those losses from the defensive side of the ball for us, and that's Evans hurt
us both times. The first time we did a pretty good job on the guards, and the
second time the guards blitzed us.  
It's one of those things, how do you best prepare for them, and what do they
try to take away because they've got so many things they do well. I said all
year, and I'll say it again. I think St. Louis is one of the best teams in the
country. I don't care where they're ranked or where they'll be seeded.
Somebody who hasn't played against them next week, they're going to say uh‑oh.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach Stevens? Okay, thank you.

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Chris Braswell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24984)

### [Alan Major](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24982)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

Saint Louis  72  
Charlotte  55

  
THE MODERATOR: Charlotte, and Head Coach Alan Major, Chris Braswell.  
COACH MAJOR: First, I said it the other day, I think yesterday, I don't think
people realize how difficult it is to do what he's done at St. Louis this
year. Hopefully for his part, he'll be rewarded. It's a very difficult
situation, and what he's done this year has been tremendous. So credit to
those guys. I thought they came out and did a good job of just disrupting us.  
We're a team that, when we defend and score with our defense executing in the
half‑court, and I thought the best thing St. Louis did was disrupt us a bit
and got us out of character, especially with taking care of the basketball.
Just want to give those guys a lot of credit and wish them the best moving
forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chris Braswell.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the turnovers, what they were doing to disrupt
you guys. Every time they made a run or something, they started to knock it
out and making another run.  
CHRIS BRASWELL: We were just rushing, trying to get it. They beat us up.  
  
Q. Chris, can you talk about the play and the entry passes, what trouble
they gave you?  
CHRIS BRASWELL: There was easy passes, but at times they disrupted us. With
everything they had, we were able to get it.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Chris?  
  
Q. I think you cut it to 19 ‑16, you were right there, and then in a short
span you were down. Did it just feel like a blur at that point?  
CHRIS BRASWELL: I was just trying to help my team and get my team ready to
play the game. Keep everybody together as a team and keep pushing. We can't
stay away from that. Like coach said, we have to play as a team, and we kind
of fell away from that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for Coach Major?  
  
Q. Coach, do you have an update on Pierria, how he's doing? Do you have an
update?  
COACH MAJOR: I haven't learned anything yet. They're very concerned, to be
quite honest with you. When a guy has a tough time breathing, I'm not quite
sure what that means. So we're trying to organize the guys, the whole team is
going to go to the hospital where he's at, as a team. They said in the locker
room they want to be with him.  
So hopefully he's okay, but once this wraps up, we'll go find out. They just‑‑
when they went to the monitor, they said it wasn't anything flagrant. It was
almost like an incidental thing. So hopefully it will be fine. I guess I'm a
little bit more pleased that you have the type of team that wants to go be
with a teammate together.  
  
Q. [Inaudible.]  
COACH MAJOR: They already went during the game. We're hoping the whole team's
in the locker room, and we can get the bus to take us to visit him.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, maybe you can't answer any questions on exactly his
status or what his injury status is.  
  
Q. Coach, in North Carolina and also coming here to Brooklyn, how important
is it from a recruiting standpoint and exposure for your team?  
COACH MAJOR: After yesterday, we got more exposure than we've had based on the
way the team ended. With us changing leagues, we'll probably recruit more up
here. It would make more sense to recruit up on the East Coast, New York, New
Jersey, and so forth. We'll be a little farther south in Conference USA next
year.  
But I'm sure there's some kids that like the warm weather. I wouldn't count us
out as far as coming up here in the future and trying to recruit some kids.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the decision early in the game about switching
to the three ‑two zone and what it did for you and what it didn't do for you.
  
COACH MAJOR: They're a very, very heavy pick‑and‑roll team. When you're at
halftime, it's 29‑28\. The first half 12‑7\. They finished 5 for 23 from the
field, from the three rather, makes you feel like, if you could do that, you
lower the team to 38 percent field goal percentage and get them on the boards.  
But Bras made a good point. Got it a little bit out of character about
decision making. And that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about your guys for the next three years that you have
to build around.  
COACH MAJOR: We're excited. Bras is the guy that plays impactful minutes.
Everybody else is a freshman and sophomore. So to have two guys like that, you
got two guys there that will be future leaders or captains as well as the type
of leaders they are. Actually, terrific players. Both of them were All
Conference guys and deserve some honors.  
But if you're around Pierria every single day, you would love him all the
more.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Nickerson getting shots. Early in the game,
he went 1 for 5. Do you think he had a mismatch?  
COACH MAJOR: I think St. Louis is very good, like they can create with their
defense. Feels like he's got it, and then here comes two linebackers that get
you in the gap. It looks to your eyes pretty good, and once they get there,
they close you down pretty well. That's what the top teams in the country do
defensively.  
So I'm not blaming Nick at all for anything. I thought he showed some
aggression. So I think that's just part of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about turnovers, where they came from, some were forced,
some weren't so forced.  
COACH MAJOR: Yeah, that's probably the best way to put it. I think the ones
that aren't forced, there are ones where you think you may see something there
that's not quite there. A lot of it just comes from maybe testing their
defense for two or three more passes. So I thought early on, especially when
the team gets off to the start they did, it makes you feel like you got to do
something quicker than you need to.  
And they did a great job. They sit on a lot of things. They deny a lot. When
you got seven guys back from a Sweet 16 team, they'reout‑tested.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about not just being able to put
together consecutive offensive possessions. Through the first and second half,
you guys had chances. Can you just talk about what it's like not being able to
convert. Some of the ones that should have went in just didn't go in. Can you
talk about that?  
COACH MAJOR: I don't know. I guess you are frustrated. You're never mad at
kids about it. They don't mean to do this. It's just part of the game. I was
happy we had the opportunities we did. I think it gets back to the questions
about Nick's pull‑ups. You knock in two or three of those, knock in a couple
of those putbacks early in the half, and it sets a different tone.  
So for the team in the position we're in when you're down, it could frustrate
you a little because you could just as easily see that lead cut from 11 to 9
to 7 or 5. So when you get stuck at 11 after that first four minutes, you
don't quite feel like you impacted that first four minutes like you want to.  
  
Q. Coach, you called a time ‑out in the first half very early, similar to
yesterday's game where you called one about two minutes in. Do you think it
was more of a trend that was starting with the team, or was it because of the
emotional way you guys won, maybe a little bit of a drain after the chaos that
happened yesterday?   
COACH MAJOR: Yeah, we're always concerned with that. That was a seriously
emotional deal yesterday. And you always get concerned about hangover. It was
on ESPN nonstop for 24 hours.  
So as a coach sometimes, you compete against the opponent, but sometimes you
compete against that, and that's not a bad thing. That's just kids being kids,
just emotionally trying to turn the page.  
That time‑out was more just to try to break the flow. You feel guys slipping a
little bit. They scored a few buckets off of turnovers in that stretch. So it
was really just trying to stop the tide there and get them back up, get them
refocused a little bit.  
  
Q. Would you talk about any postseason invitations that you might accept or
not. And also talk about Evans and what he did today.  
COACH MAJOR: Evans is very good. He's their best post player, and you wouldn't
say that for a 6'6" guy on most teams. He's the guy that, when they need a
basket to throw the ball inside to, he's the best guy they have.  
He's kind of an unsung hero on that team. A lot of their other guys probably
get a bit more attention. As far as the postseason stuff goes, I honestly‑‑ my
focus has been Richmond first and then today St. Louis. I don't have any iPad
on every few minutes checking the brackets or whatever it is, all that stuff.
I'll let you guys handle all that. I really have no clue. Hopefully, we'll get
a chance to keep playing. That's all I want.  
  
Q. [Inaudible.]  
COACH MAJOR: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Honestly, my boss can talk about that,
but that would be a no‑brainer, I think, especially for the type of team we
have. Any experience we get past this point is a positive build for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Langston Galloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21965)

### [Halil Kanacevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25004)

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS  58  
XAVIER - 57

  
COACH MARTELLI: The players deserve a lot of credit here. They worked their
tails off on Tuesday and Wednesday to be ready. They said all the appropriate
things to each other during time‑outs in the last segment. Being down eight, I
guess it was a 12‑0 run, I thought our halfcourt defense was really well done
by our team. And yet we were still left wanting. I mean, there's more, but the
biggest thing we talked about before the game was we had to get a walk‑‑ we
haven't had a walk all year. We've looked not scared, not intimidated, but in
that area of like confused. We've talked to them about it.  
And then I asked them to do one thing: To empty their tanks so when they put
their head on the pillow tonight, they can say, I gave it everything that I
had, and if we are not good enough, we are not good enough.  
But by an act of God, the ball doesn't go in. I do think that everybody should
know this. I left a ticket for the Pope, he's a Jesuit, there's three Jesuit
schools, but I did leave a ticket for Pope Francis. I wish him well.  
  
Q. Langston, can you take us through the last play?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Well, the play was just to come up from the bottom of the
screen, try to come to the top of the key and try to make a play for the team
and that's what I did. Tried to make a play and they called a foul.  
  
Q. When you started, seemed like you put your hand out almost, were you
trying to get contact?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I knew I could get to the basket and just trying to draw
the foul. But they called a foul and that's why I went to the line.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts, game on the line, two shots? What were your
thoughts at that time?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Just take my time‑‑ you talking about the free throw? Just
take my time and relax and shoot the free throw like I've been practicing all
week.  
  
Q. You had a good view on the bench, but what was more excruciating, the
first free throw or the in ‑bounds pass that Xavier had?   
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Definitely the in‑bounds pass(inaudible) he's a great
shooter, I wasn't scared about that. When those plays have not gone our way‑‑
it's finally gone our way, which is great, so that definitely was one of the
things where I was a little timid on when the ball went up in the air.  
  
Q. Langston, not much time to celebrate, you have to turn the page and focus
on VCU tomorrow. Just wondering your thoughts on the rematch.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: It was definitely going to be big for us. We left 14
seconds out there, so we have something to prove. We just have to take 40
minutes with the ball tomorrow.  
  
Q. In your experience, have you ever seen an in ‑bounds pass off the
backboard possibly rebounding by the other team possibly for a winning basket?
  
COACH MARTELLI: Yeah, you're in my age bracket, I saw one time where a team
threw a sideline out‑of‑bounds‑‑ okay. This goes way back, this is N.C.
State‑Maryland in '73 or '74. They did an in‑bounds play off the backboard,
had David Thompson catch it and it worked because of David Thompson.  
But I have seen the ball go off the backboard. You don't think the kid was
throwing it off the backboard, do you? I don't know. I'm not trying to be
smart. I have seen the ball go off the backboard.  
  
Q. Did you think that was ‑‑  
COACH MARTELLI: I don't know. I really don't know. I don't really know.  
  
Q. Halil, when you were down eight, things were not looking so good, and
then like Phil was talking about, emptying your tank, it seemed like at that
point you in particular ‑‑ I don't know whether you're playing harder or what,
but can you talk about that and scoring seven points?   
HALIL KANACEVIC: I'm not sure how much we were down at the half, they came out
in the half against us at home and then we made a comeback at home. I mean, I
scored but Ron made two great passes to me. I got a good swing, I'm not sure
who it was on the wing for a 3‑point shot. I was in the post at the right
time‑‑ I took a shot that was there. I was confident in myself and I made it.  
To go what Coach said, it's a big coincidence, he left a ticket for the Pope
but I got a pass for my local‑‑ and (Inaudible)?  
  
Q. Could you just talk about like what it feels like to keep this thing
going? You've had some tough games; have you ever experienced a game like
this?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: We definitely don't want the season to end, so hey, bring
on tomorrow, that's all I can say.  
  
Q. Seems like in the first half there were no prolonged runs by either team.
What changed in the second half?  
COACH MARTELLI: I thought the defense on both teams, they had a number of
deflected balls and they were able to run out. We had stops and we were able
to play at a more brisk pace, and I thought that that was the difference in
the two halves really.  
You're absolutely right. I didn't think that there would be runs in this game.
I thought this was going to be a possession game. And at halftime I brought up
a couple of possessions that we gave away. In the second half, I was more
concerned about‑‑ you know, they deflected three balls in a row right in front
of our bench; two of them led to breakaways.  
But we stayed with it. We had a big basket down eight, got Halil on an inside
play, and everybody caught their breath. I think Langston hit a three in that
little run; because, we're fragile, we're very, very fragile.  
  
Q. How do you get ready for VCU with just under 24 hours to prepare for
them? You had a terrific game in Richmond, if you can speak on the last game
and how you prepare for them for tomorrow?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, to prepare for them, we are going down to Times Square
and we are going to have them run around and try not to get hit by a car.
(Laughter) I don't know any other way to put it to you. You know, like that's
what it's going to be like. It's going to be like crossing the street in Times
Square, and we just have to hope that we don't get hit by a car.  
The game at VCU, there were a number of things that jump out to me. One was
their unbelievable fan support. I assume it will be the same here tomorrow
night. The pressure was more intense than I saw on tape, and we had some
fortunate bounces in that game. We banked in the three; we took a couple shots
late.  
But my biggest takeaway from the last game is we couldn't guard them. We
couldn't keep anybody in front of us. We did a much better job tonight. We've
done a pretty good job all year long. I think our defense has been somewhat
undervalued.  
And we have to really, really avoid the knockout punch. Their style, their
swagger, is that they are going to come for our throat right now, and as soon
as we get back to the hotel and they have eaten and they go back to their
rooms, this one's over, and we do the best we can to prepare.  
You know, we are going to recall the situation that we had in the Barclays
earlier this year, Notre Dame in overtime, same kind of gut‑wrenching game and
next night we didn't have anything and we lost to Florida State.  
So we came to win one game to get another game, and now we are going to try to
win another game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Given the outside expectations set by people in the program, have you
said that this is a chance to wipe the slate clean and go forward?  
COACH MARTELLI: I think that's cheap coach talk. You know, we are all 0‑0\.
But I got a very interesting text‑‑ e‑mail, very, very late last Saturday
night. And the e‑mail said: Current circumstance does not determine your
future. It only determines your starting point. That's a little bit of a
paraphrase.  
But basically, where we are, is only the starting point. So we went in Sunday
night, we looked at the film from the last game, the last Xavier game, and we
went forward. So you know, the expectations and my own expectations, their own
expectations, we didn't meet those over 29 games, but we had a chance tonight
to play a game, and we're fortunate enough to win.  
So our current circumstance did not determine our future results.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Halil in the second half, and the difficulty of when
to put him in with four fouls?  
COACH MARTELLI: Fortunately he fouls a lot so we have had a lot of
opportunity. But I relied on the assistant coaches a lot to talk about
offense, defense. And it's a little tricky, because Halil reads everything
that is said about him.  
He was 0‑for‑5 in the first half on basically layups. So, yeah, he allows us
to run offense. But to be honest with you, he would expect himself to be
better than 3‑for‑10 and I would expect him to be better than 3‑for‑10,
particularly with the ball where he got it.  
But he gave us a force in and around the basket, particularly defensive
rebounding, and he has a really good idea of‑‑ he's very knowledgeable. He's
got the highest basketball IQ on the team, so that‑‑ six assists, seven
rebounds, 11 points, banged in a couple of those layups, and then you're
really talking about a good game.  
  
Q. I know your season is not over or anything, but after what these guys
have been through this year, how good do you feel for them or how do you feel
for them after that kind of win?  
COACH MARTELLI: It's their win. And I mean this, it's their win.  
As you well know, I believe this: I believe that the wins go to the players. I
think the losses go to the coaches.  
These guys, you know, they worked hard‑‑ yeah, but understand, they didn't
work as hard on Saturday. So they own that, too. So I'm happy for them. I'm
happy that they are going to get an opportunity to play on a Friday night in a
great building against a nationally‑ranked team. I'm happy for them but I'm
not satisfied. We are not done.  
Thank you very much.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

MASSACHUSETTS  77  
GEORGE WASHINGTON - 72

  
COACH KELLOGG: With the luck of the draw we were able to pull off the win and
now we have to go against a very tough Temple team tomorrow night. We got
out‑rebounded by 18.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
TREY DAVIS: It's just a blessing, I told Chaz in the huddle, I'm going to
knock it down and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Chaz, can you talk about the final seconds, and how much this game and
the win meant to you, being from Brooklyn?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: You know, nobody wants to come in and lose on the first night,
so, you know, going to do everything in our power to come out with this
victory.  
Whatever my team needed me to do, I wasn't making shots early on‑‑ I needed to
pick up‑‑  
  
Q. And what it meant.  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: It means a lot, my daughter was in the stands, my grandmother,
that means a lot for me, finally get to see my family.  
  
Q. When it opens up like that, does everything kind of slow down for you in
the moment, or does it blur by when you're just banging on shots?  
TREY DAVIS: It was regular. I didn't feel no different way, I just wanted to
win the game so we could play tomorrow really. That's about it.  
  
Q. Trey, two years ago, you were going to go to GW, did that factor into
your mind?  
TREY DAVIS: No, actually I just wanted to win the game, because I want to go
to the NCAA Tournament and I just want to keep winning so I can go.  
  
Q. After TV and Cady fouled out, there was a huddle, what did you say to
rally around? That's when you really sparked the comeback.  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Both our big guys is out right now, we just do it as a team‑‑
we understood that and if we win tonight, we play again and we really wanted
to play again. We just really pulled together with each other and that's how
it's going to be.  
  
Q. What was your reaction when you got the ball ‑‑  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: You know, I believe in the kid a lot so when I saw him open, I
knew he was going to make the shot. Just had to get him in the right spot. I
have a lot of trust in Trey.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys are getting caught staring at the rim when the
shot goes up?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: You know, we have athletic guys, so you know, we try to use our
athleticism to go to the rebounds instead of boxing out. Coach talked all week
in practice about boxing out‑‑ we knew we had to hit some more bodies tonight.  
  
Q. How crucial is that going to be tomorrow?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: It's going to be real crucial. Temple has big guys, they can
rebound like us, so just have to go in there and just rebound and do what we
have to do.  
  
Q. You've had some success against those guys, if I remember you had a
really big game against them, and then they got you by one this year; what do
you remember about the last two meetings and what are you guys going to have
to do against Temple tomorrow?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: You knowIsaiah (ph) he's an awesome player; we just have to
stop them and once you cut the head off the train, everything starts moving.
So just have to come out with the victory.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything from the first time, having to guard him?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, without a doubt. You watch film, you learn from that
and Coach giving inputs and just watch game film tonight and just learn more.  
  
Q. Being that you're from Brooklyn, was there pressure being in your own
backyard and performing here?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: No added pressure. Just wanted to go out there and play
basketball and help my team win. I guess I was a little too anxious with my
beginning, I don't know where my head was in the beginning. I felt like I was
there, but tomorrow hopefully I'm settled down and all the jitters and
everything is out and ready to play.  
  
Q. Can you talk aboutthe ‑‑ (Inaudible).  
COACH KELLOGG: That's a good word; I probably can't use it. He's showed a lot
of character this year, and it shows coming down the stretch here. He has not
really complained about playing time where a lot of freshmen think they should
play more, and he's come in and worked hard every day and he's been able to go
against Chaz and really play against him and that's made him a better player.  
I think his character as a person, as a kid who has persevered some and even
last year going to prep school is kind of starting to come through. He's more
confident than maybe he is good as a player, if that makes any sense. He just
feels like he's really good and he feels like he's as good as anybody in the
league, and at times he plays that way, which is a good trait to have.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the last 2:30?  
COACH KELLOGG: The game got moving, which we really tried to do all game long
was get it moving where it wasn't stopped for one reason or another, or I
thought our guys did a better job in the press.  
We had a lot more energy and we made some shots. We had to make some shots,
because we were not rebounding the ball quite as well as I would have liked or
anticipated after our week of practice.  
That was actually UMASS basketball at our finest when we are making some 3s
and getting our press. They took a couple quicker shots, and I think Coach
might have wanted them to do and now the game was put on the floor more in the
players' hands than from the sidelines.  
  
Q. Was there anything tactically that led to their rebounding advantage, or
was it just size or athleticism?  
COACH KELLOGG: The way they play, they are going to be a good offensive
rebounding team. They play a little more old school basketball where they have
three or four guys around the rim every time they run, and that lends them to
be a good offensive rebounding team.  
And I assume they practice that quite frequently, because they have
out‑rebounded their previous opponent by 24 and out‑rebounded us with 24
offensive rebounds. We talked on it, we worked on it and didn't execute. We
probably have to go back and try some different things next time if we are
playing a rebounding team like them.  
  
Q. The last three match ‑ups have been tough and come down to the wire; what
is it with Temple that causes matchup problems?   
COACH KELLOGG: The game last year I thought was one of best college basketball
games I've been a part of, it was awesome even though we lost in overtime.
They have really good players. Their support staff is very good and mature.
They are older and they know what they are doing.  
The one thing I think Coach has gotten them to do maybe better than any team
in our league is he has them playing their roles. Nobody is complaining and
they all do their job and they all have a good feel for what they are trying
to accomplish. It seems like winning to them is the most important thing, and
that's the sign of a good team.  
  
Q. Talk about Chaz, how he improved himself from the beginning of the
season?  
COACH KELLOGG: He's just matured. He controls the game better now. I last year
he was just been, boom, boom, boom, there he goes; there's Chaz. This year
he's picking hits spots more and he has better control and command of the
contest. I'll call it what it's, adding him to our program, we have had a
couple 20‑win seasons, which is attributed a lot to him, but also the other
guys maturing and getting better.  
  
Q. Based off the rebounding and foul trouble, do you feel fortunate?  
COACH KELLOGG: Very fortunate, yeah, I feel great. I thought we played to be
close and we were fortunate enough to come away with a victory. One of the
good things is that Vincent and Cady didn't play very much. If we have two
guys that should have a lot of energy tomorrow night it should be Cady and TV.
I thought getting out‑rebounded by 18, it was nice to come away with a
victory. That shows a team that's maturing or has matured.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Rotnei Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19418)

### [Andrew Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22171)

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

BUTLER  73  
DAYTON - 67

  
COACH STEVENS: I thought it was a good game. I knew it was going to be a good
game.  
Dayton had been playing their best basketball as of late, and if you look at
them statistically, they are one of the more deceiving teams in our league
because of the fact that they have been in the Top‑30 offensively, which is
actually a 40‑spot jump since we played them last.  
I thought it was going to be a tough game to win and I was proud of the fact
that we were able to win it.  
  
Q. Did you feel like it was a matter of time before you guys started to take
care of the shooting, get over the jitters early on?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: You know, we just came out and we were probably a little
passive at first. We didn't play aggressive enough. We didn't play hard
enough, either, but we got in the flow a little bit and shots started to fall.  
  
Q. Andrew, this is kind of the same question I guess, but Dayton is up
three, looked like 13 minutes left, was there something different from that
point on that you felt you were playing better or just a matter of the shots
started going?  
ANDREW SMITH: I think pretty much what Rotnei said, we weren't really playing
hard enough. We were taking plays off and we were letting them score too
easily on the inside. You see they outscored us 48‑28\. You are not going to
win a whole lot of games doing that, so we were pretty fortunate and we ended
up playing pretty hard, pretty well the last 15 minutes but we definitely need
to improve on the first 25.  
  
Q. You guys won three in a row since the loss to t cu, since then you're
scoring a lot more, can you talk about what you've done to step it up since
that loss?  
ROTNEI CLARKE: I think we just got together and we communicated as a team and
sat down. We discussed our roles, from the top to the bottom. Just tried to
figure out what we weren't doing and what we had to do. Obviously something's
going right here. You know, we are communicating a lot, and our chemistry off
the floor leads to it on, and we have done a good job of getting together off
the floor and it's carried over.  
  
Q. You didn't have the opportunity to play against La Salle last time but I
believe you were at the game. Can you talk about what you observed and what
kind of challenge those guys are going to present for you, and Andrew, if you
want to chime in, too.  
ROTNEI CLARKE: La Salle is a great team. You know, we definitely have a big
challenge ahead. They have got a lot of guards that can really drive the ball
well, and so we are going to have to be able to guard. They obviously did a
lot to get the bye and they have played well in conference play. So it's
definitely going to be a challenge.  
ANDREW SMITH: Like he said, they got a bye in the first round and that alone
says they are a good team, and they are good from their bigs to their guard.
Yeah, it's going to be a team effort and we are going to have to play well.  
  
Q. Just how are you able to get open, you took 12 threes, that's a pretty
good number.  
ROTNEI CLARKE: Yeah, my teammates, Coach, drew up good plays and it's a
tribute to the guys on the team, Andrew, Khyle, Kam, Rose, they set great
screens for me especially off the ball. In transition, I got a couple looks
and it's all from these guys, they look for me when I'm open and it's a really
unselfish team.  
  
Q. What have you learned ‑‑  
ROTNEI CLARKE: I've learned that throwing it back, like coming off ball
screens, getting it to other guys and letting them work first and trying to
share the ball more has led to taking a little bit of focus off me and me
being aggressive at certain points in the game, I can be able to pick my spots
in different situations and I've tried to do that better.  
  
Q. What about the fact that La Salle had the bye ‑‑ is there a problem with
that‑‑  
COACH STEVENS: I think that's part of it. Guys can't play 80 minutes of
basketball in two days, probably signed up for the wrong thing.  
So I don't see it being a problem. I see certainly it's going to be a
challenge, and it will have nothing to do with our legs, and just the fact
that we are playing a good team.  
  
Q. This is the first time in this conference tournament, is there any
adjustment period, or is it just another business trip, especially Andrew
having played in the horizon league the last couple years?  
ANDREW SMITH: It's a little bit unique because we have four games in four
days. But other than that, we have played in arenas like this and we have
played these teams before. It's our first year in the A‑10, but it's not
really anything different for us. We are just trying to approach it one game
at a time.  
  
Q. They were up early in the second half and then you go three, three, three
and took control again.  
COACH STEVENS: That got us stabilized‑‑ is that the right word for that? Gave
us a little bit of belief heading into the final ten minutes.  
I thought, you know, the series of plays where Fromm was in the middle of them
on the three he hit, a couple of effort play points that he had, kind of
separated the game.  
So I thought we started scoring in the paint a little bit more. And I think,
you know, the neat part about it was the guys through that stretch‑‑ it was
our bench picks.  
  
Q. All those guards and the matchup problems ‑‑  
COACH STEVENS: I think the biggest thing is that they are unique. They are
small on the perimeter, per se, but because they play four point guards at a
time, it just is really unique.  
I saw Kam (ph) play a lot in the summer when he was in high school and he
played with Khyle Marshall, and he played the point the whole time, and here,
he doesn't play the point much, but he's a point guard on the floor.  
So they have four great decision makers on the floor, they have four great
drivers, four very good shooters. And then around those bigs, I think those
bigs are really undervalued when you consider their team. And John does a good
job, so I think Rotnei hit the nail on the head; it's about --they are a
unique team to have to play.  
But it's about being a little bit better defensively and then we weren't very
good offensively up there. So hopefully we can be a little bit better
tomorrow.  
  
Q. First year in the A ‑10, what are your thoughts and what do you expect?
  
COACH STEVENS: Well, you treat it like any other tournament we've ever been
in. You know, the difference between this and an NCAA Tournament is you
doesn't don't have that extra day of preparation. But this is why you play in
Maui. This is why you play the year before wherever we played, just keep going
in those preseason tournaments.  
Everything you do in the non‑conference from a scheduling standpoint is to
prepare you for now. I think that's the best benefit of those preseason exempt
tournaments.  
  
Q. What was going on for Dayton at the end, the first half, beginning of the
second half, where they kind of had a nice little run there?  
COACH STEVENS: First of all, they made good plays. Those guys are good
players. Benson played like a senior. He played like he didn't want to lose
his last game. Dillard made a couple the great plays on the drive. Sanford
just lowered his head and drove it. They only took four 3s the whole game, and
two of them in the last two minutes.  
So I think that that says enough of what their game plan was, and they really
had it rolling some ways early on with that, and then I think we adjusted well
to the last ten minutes of the game.  
But, they ran some good action that basically where we call it a clip stream
where they just run and basically fly by a guy and really don't set it and you
don't know whether it switch or go. We didn't handle it well a couple of
times.  
  
Q. Talk about your ball movement, 17 assists; how much does a game like this
help you out for tomorrow?  
COACH STEVENS: I don't think it has any impact on tomorrow, but I think that
hopefully you can continue to value the things that lead to winning. So you
know, each game is its own entity and each 40 minutes is its own deal and
that's the way you have to approach it.  
But at the same time, I think clearly we are better in the last two weeks. We
have had unbelievable practices the last ten days, more of what I've been used
to at this time of the year. So that's kind of got me excited for the future
here.

### [Darien Brothers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24985)

### [Cedrick Lindsay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24986)

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

Charlotte  68  
Richmond  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Chris Mooney, players Cedrick Lindsay and Darien
Brothers. Questions for the players, please.  
COACH MOONEY: I'm disappointed, obviously, how the game turned out. Certainly
wish the ending hadn't been the way it was for me personally. I apologize to
the Richmond fans and wish Charlotte luck in the next round.  
  
Q. How did it feel going in and throughout?  
DARIEN BROTHERS: I made shots. I just tried not to let it affect me. I played
pretty well with it.  
  
Q. Darien, Cedrick (No Microphone)?  
DARIEN BROTHERS: It hurts a lot. The game was there for us to win. You know,
it was a silly foul at the end that caused them to win the game. So it
definitely hurts.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see on the free throw play, and what did the
officials describe to you as what happened, why it was a technical?  
COACH MOONEY: You know, I didn't necessarily see it. I know they explained to
me that Derrick had shoved their player and that's why they called the dead
ball technical foul.  
  
Q. Cedrick, second half they got you inside a little bit scoringwise. Got
some easy baskets. Why did that happen in the second half? Didn't seem to be
much of a problem in the first half.  
CEDRICK LINDSAY: It's a big game, and that is kind of the MO is to throw the
ball inside and score. They came out and did a better job than us in the
second half.  
  
Q. Darien, can you talk about Charlotte on the rebounding today? They just
really had their way with you guys. What was different this time than the last
game you got against them?  
DARIEN BROTHERS: They just came out in the second half more aggressive to go
after the ball. We got a little mixed up on defense with our communication,
and they continued to pound the ball inside, so they definitely took advantage
of that.  
  
Q. Have either of you guys spoken to Derrick? What's he like in the locker
room right now?  
DARIEN BROTHERS: Can't say I have spoken to him yet. It's a tough play. I
think everybody's hurt, so I don't know.  
CEDRICK LINDSAY: Same thing.  
  
Q. Darien, did you do anything different to shut down the threes in the
second half because you didn't have as many as a team than you did in the
first half?  
DARIEN BROTHERS: Not at all. We could offensively get whatever we wanted, but
we tried to get it inside as much as possible, and we did that. But it
definitely we couldn't get wherever we wanted, like I said.  
  
Q. Cedrick, can you tell us what you saw on that technical foul there at the
end?  
CEDRICK LINDSAY: I'm not really sure yet. I was more concentrated on getting
us ready to get the inbounds. I saw the ball go in, and I just saw Clayton
called, and I looked at the ref, and he called the technical. It was like
automatic.  
  
Q. Cedrick, I can't remember if the foul call was called on you. I think
they called it a shooting foul from half court. Were you surprised at that
call?  
CEDRICK LINDSAY: Well, I think they called the foul on Greg, and I fouled him
when he first got the ball inbounds. He took a dribble and ran into Greg, and
they called the foul on Greg. We were definitely more surprised. They called a
shooting foul for three shots right after that call.  
  
Q. Is it your understanding it was called a technical as opposed to a
regular or flagrant one because it was a dead ball? Is that why it's a
technical in that situation?  
COACH MOONEY: I don't really know. I don't know what the rule is.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like the officials had the game in control up to that
moment? When it all happened, it seemed like the entire arena was confused and
this was all happening at once, and no one was really quite sure what was
happening and why it was, and that was obviously punctuated by your
confusion.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, I think so. At that point in the game we wanted to foul so
they couldn't make a game‑time three. We thought we executed that well, and we
wanted to see what was going to happen in the second shot. I think the game
was officiated ‑‑ they're a good offensive rebounding team, a physical team.
But we certainly had opportunities and should have closed out the game.  
  
Q. That last foul on Henry that was called a shooting foul, was that what
was so frustrating and caused the bench to ‑‑ what happened there?   
COACH MOONEY: The bench meaning me? Yeah, I was confused by that call. I
thought we had fouled them and the ball was on the ground.  
  
Q. Does Richmond have any recourse here? Is there any action the University
takes in protest?  
COACH MOONEY: I don't think so. I don't know if that's the case.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just kind of put into words your shock value right now?
Because it's not something you see every day on the basketball court.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, I am shocked. I don't think we played great, but I
certainly think we did some good things. We had three turnovers in the whole
game. I felt, while we didn't rebound well, we defended okay. It put us in a
chance to win the game up three with 4 seconds to go.  
So it's a pretty devastating way to lose the game, and I feel bad for our
players and for our fans because I really thought we put ourselves in position
to win the game.  
  
Q. Chris, can you ever recall being as upset or as angry in your career as
you were in those last 4.7 seconds? And also, was this a game that sort of
could have been a nice victory to use as a learning experience? Because, as
you said, you did some good things, but there were some things that seemed
uncharacteristic of your play.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, I'll answer the second one first. I thought it would have
been a really nice win. I thought Charlotte had a great win on this past
Saturday where we felt they needed to win and they did. I thought they came
out with a lot of energy. I thought we played well enough to win.  
It would have been great to advance and be able to play Saint Louis. I was
upset and probably too upset. So, again, I apologize. I wish it wouldn't have
happened like that. I can't take it back right now, but I certainly wish I
could, and I wish the whole last four and a half seconds would have been a
little bit different.  
  
Q. Coach, for clarification, they told you what was the technical foul on
Derrick?  
COACH MOONEY: Because it was the push that Derrick‑‑ when Derrick pushed their
player, I guess it was a dead ball because the free throw hadn't gone in, so
that's why it was ruled a dead‑ball technical. I don't know enough about‑‑
sometimes now they shoot the technical and resume play with the live foul
shot. I don't know if because it's a dead ball, you don't do that.  
  
Q. Chris, as you look ahead, do you think this is a team that wants to keep
on playing in a postseason tournament of some sort?  
COACH MOONEY: Absolutely, yes.  
  
Q. Because of the youth of the team or because of other reasons?  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, I think partly because of the youth, partly because we
have good energy and good basketball left. But I think we owe it to Darien and
Greg to go somewhere and try to advance.  
  
Q. Speak to Terry's performance today. It was a really breakout game for a
freshman.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, Terry was great. The last games he's been terrific. I
think he's going to be a great player. He's our best rebounder, which doesn't
say a whole lot, but he's our best rebounder and a physical player that can do
a lot of things. He's very versatile, and I think he's going to be a great
player.  
  
Q. I know it's probably difficult to talk to Derrick about what happened,
but have you spoken to him? And if you haven't, will you, and what will you
say?  
COACH MOONEY: I'll definitely talk to him. I think that it's tough.
Basketball's a hard game. It's very physical. There is a lot of positioning
and things that happen during the course of the game, and you kind of have to
make sure that recognizing the time and score of the game that we can't have
anything happen like that.  
He's a great young player for us. He's a really good kid who has done a lot of
good things for us. It's disappointing. I'm sure, it's most disappointing for
him that this would happen and kind of the game to turn out that way because
of what happened.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

Charlotte  68  
Richmond  63

  
THE MODERATOR: From Charlotte, Pierria Henry, Chris Braswell and Coach Major.
Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH MAJOR: Well, we're very thankful for a hard‑fought victory. We told our
guys, this is our third season, and, you know, you have your non‑conference
play, and you have your conference play, which is a grind in itself.  
Now we are kind of in a conference tournament play, 0‑0\. We kind of wipe the
slate clean, and try to come back today. This is one of the hardest fought
wins I've ever been a part of. I don't know about these two, between their
high school careers, but this was an absolute war.  
You feel bad someone had to lose, but I'm just really proud of the way the
guys stayed with it, just being down in the first half. We literally came out
guns blazing. I didn't think they'd miss a shot all day the way they started
the game.  
But we responded and cut it in in the second half in a decent fashion and
responded down the stretch. Very proud of this team.  
  
Q. Pierria, can you talk about the free throws at the end? What did you see
on the technical when the guy took down Willie?  
PIERRIA HENRY: Honestly, I didn't see what was going on. I was just trying to
focus on my free throw. Then I see Willie go flying, and I just tried to be a
great teammate and go pick him up. I let the refs handle the rest, and Coach
Major called me‑‑ to shoot the whatever, you know, the rift raft that was
going on, and just knock down the free throws.  
  
Q. Alan, how were you able to rough them up inside a little bit in the
second half? You seemed to take much better advantage.  
COACH MAJOR: That's what we tried to do. That's going to be the focus all
season. We stayed with that. We don't always have the success we like, but we
have a good chance. And our guys did a pretty good chance on the offensive
boards, getting some second chance opportunities as well.  
That is a big part of our game plan. This guy sitting next to me is a big part
of that. So fortunately we were able to have some success going into that.  
  
Q. Pierria, how long did it feel like you were at the free ‑throw line for?
  
PIERRIA HENRY: 30 minutes.  
  
Q. Is that the craziest, the wildest, maybe the most unlikely ending to a
basketball game considering what transpired in the final seconds?  
COACH MAJOR: Yeah, I would agree. You couldn't make that up if you want to
make a movie out of that one. But, you know, we just talked to our guys about
always making sure you keep your poise. I don't know. I didn't see the contact
in terms of the free throw, blockout technical situations.  
So I don't know, right, wrong, that's not our place. That's why you have
tremendous officials out there working. We talk to our guys about maintaining
your poise and not getting rattled no matter what circumstance you face. This
game through a lot of different circumstances at us, and fortunately our guys
hung in there.  
  
Q. Chris, you had a pretty tough first half. No points, no rebounds, 7
minutes. It seemed like they were targeting you on defense. Second half you
rebounded 12 points and five big offensive boards. What changed for you?  
CHRIS BRASWELL: Just my coach turned to me and told me to stay in the game,
just move on. We need you. It's a team. I'm proud of everybody. It's just a
good team win. So I stayed with that, and I did better in the second half.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the composure that you had at the line, and before
everybody fouling out and not falling apart mentality?  
PIERRIA HENRY: Man, this team has been through so much this year. It's like
the fight that we had, the chemistry, the family bond. It's amazing that no
matter what we know that we're going to stick with each other through thick
and thin. When one person falls, the next player is picking them up. We just
keep on encouraging each other no matter who it is, what's going on.  
When I was at the free‑throw line and huddling up, my teammates told me, man,
we're going to make this. We're going to win the game, and move on and take
care of business for the next day.  
So I just thank God for giving me the opportunity. And I've got to thank my
teammates for just believing in me.  
  
Q. Coach, is that a game that the way you won that can spark a team to get
confidence going forward, given the unlikeliness at the end?  
COACH MAJOR: I hope so. Any time you win a game, an old coach told me one
time, it was a great quote, he said, "You're a success at the moment you do a
successful act. But once that act is over, you've got to do what you have to
do to repeat that so you can be a success the next time you have that
successful act."  
So this doesn't guarantee us anything. To answer your question, hope it starts
the ball rolling a little bit. And it's a good win, and this is great and a
good time in the year to have three in a row.  
But you're facing a top 15 team in the country tomorrow in Saint Louis, a top
10 defensive team. Coach Crews, the Head Coach of the Year award because it's
very difficult to take over a situation that he did and losing a coach
mid‑year and keep it steady the way he did all season, he deserves a ton of
credit.  
But getting back to us, hopefully it creates some momentum that we can carry
into tomorrow.  
  
Q. Did you get an explanation from the officials on what occurred in the
second?  
COACH MAJOR: Yeah, best I could get is the ball coming off the rim, it was
just an illegal contact. I think that's been one of the things they've tried
to watch from a point of emphasis standpoint. I don't know exactly how it
happened. I thought it was on the floor, but I'm not sure. That was the
explanation that I got.  
  
Q. Coach, early in the game, Richmond went up 8 ‑2\. Cedrick Lindsay went in
for pretty much an uncontested lay‑up. You called a 30‑second timeout. You're
usually pretty calm, but you lit into your team in that huddle. What was the
most upsetting part about that to to you? What did you say to them in the
huddle?   
COACH MAJOR: Just I felt like we were starting to be (Indiscernible). They're
probably one of the best two guard combos in this league, and they can beat
you inside and beat them at their place earlier in the year. I just wanted to
attack the game a little bit. I felt like we were on our heels.
(Indiscernible).  
We needed defensive traction, and we're at our best when we get defensive
traction, two, three stops in a row, three stops out of four, four stops out
of six possessions that type of thing.  
  
Q. Was that the case again in the second half? You fall, you get down by
ten, and then you get a come back again? That is the second time in three
games that you've come back from double digits in the second half. What
brought you back?  
COACH MAJOR: Just putting the stops together. You know, I'd love to have a
bottle of the same thing defensively and carry that for the rest of however
many games we have left. But sometimes with our age, and I catch myself, I
look out there and we've got some guys that the first time they've gone
through this deal.  
It's a new experience for them. But maintaining the focus for the entire 40
minutes can be difficult. But that's where we come in as coaches, and try to
help them.  
But you have to have that type of difference that we had against Saint
Joseph's last Saturday tomorrow, because Saint Louis is a tremendous team.  
  
Q. What did you think the chances were of throwing this out at that point?  
COACH MAJOR: We as coaches have to stay in striking distance. What we tried to
do is we tried to keep pressing and see if we could stir them up. It seemed
unlikely at times when you're down three in that situation to come back. But I
knew as a coach that you always want to let your team have the feeling that
you can, no matter what, until that final buzzer goes off.  
Like I said, that is probably the thick I'm most proud of. But that had
nothing to do with it. Our kids have learned to fight all year through various
situations, and this was one of them.  
  
Q. What have you learned from the previous meeting with Richmond, and game
‑plan‑wise, did you change anything for this match‑up?   
COACH MAJOR: Well, not really. I think the big thing out there is Brothers
just got going early so well and went up to 39 points. Thankfully, we held
them to 29 points less than that today. That was a big part of it, because he
literally can beat us by himself up there, not that the other guys can't make
plays.  
So for him today to go 2 for 9 and to try to get(Indiscernible) as opposed to
having them beat you. Fortunately, he missed a few today, and we were able to
pull this out.  
  
Q. Coach, the Barclays Center is a new center, just your thoughts on playing
here in Brooklyn?  
COACH MAJOR: Yeah, it's great. Last night we took a walk down the streets and
just try to take it in. It's just the history of the ball that's been played
in this city and being in this situation for the first time. Hopefully we can
finish on a high note, but it's been great. I think our kids enjoy it too.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

BUTLER  73  
DAYTON - 67

  
COACH MILLER: To open it up No.1, I would like to give these two guys sitting
to the right of me, a great deal of credit.  
I have a lot of admiration for the guys that have been here for my two years
because none of them signed up for me. It's kind of one of those things where
when you walk into a situation, you really never know what you're going to
get.  
You know, from the start, it's been all the way until today, these two guys
right here have really, No.1, they have embraced what we have tried to do, and
they have dealt with a lot of change. I think they have done really a very,
very good job with it. Not only are they both really good players and have
bright futures; they are good guys and I would like to thank them.  
Secondly, give Butler a great deal of credit. Tournament tough, that's just
kind of the word you have to use when you deal with those guys. The game is
never over when you play them. And they are so well coached and they execute
so well; you almost feel like on every possession they are able to pick you
apart.  
For a good portion of the game, felt like our game plan was really locked in,
and then right around probably like six‑minute mark, I thought they did a
really good job capitalizing, not only on offense, but capitalized off a
couple turnovers that we had to change the momentum of the game.  
Give them credit, they are not only going to have a chance to win this
tournament, but don't be surprised if they don't have a chance to win the big
tournament.  
  
Q. Looked like you got hammered on the inside rebounding, did it get away
from you?  
JOSH BENSON: You know, we just at times, we had mental lapses, some little
minor breakdowns on defense, playing against a tough team like Butler, they
are a very systematic team and they are very well coached. You know, they
capitalized like Coach said.  
But I think we fought hard. You know, minus our mistakes, and a couple
turnovers, but I think guys fought hard and we just came up short.  
  
Q. Josh, you went on a little spurt there for four or six points, what was
the last two minutes for you, facing a team like Butler ‑‑ to go out the way
Josh Benson would like to go out.   
JOSH BENSON: Like you said, it was do‑or‑die. I've been coached well and I try
to do anything to help my teammates out in any way possible; and if it's
scoring the ball or rebounding or diving on the floor, I'm going to do that.  
Got in a good rhythm, my teammates, they found me, and team just moved the
ball well and unfortunately 18 points, you know, the end of the day we didn't
get the win.  
  
Q. Kevin, there was a point where Butler called the time ‑out‑‑ did that do
anything to get you out of your rhythm and make the flow?   
KEVIN DILLARD: No, I thought it was a good time‑out. I still felt like I was
still able to have a good rhythm, but you know, that's when they came out and
they hit three 3‑pointers and that kind of changed the rhythm of the game. I
think their ability to hit from behind the arch is what changed the momentum
of the game.  
  
Q. You had two points at halftime and then you had 13, I think, in the
second half; maybe what was the difference for you in the two halves?  
KEVIN DILLARD: They did a good job of keeping‑‑ behind me, but the second half
I just wanted to be a little more aggressive and try to get in the lane and
penetrate for others and for myself. But the points are good, but I would of
rather take the win.  
  
Q. Talk about trying to guard Rotnei Clarke, he gets open, just the
difficulty.  
KEVIN DILLARD: Rotnei, he's a good three‑point shooter, and they do a good job
of screening for him. He does a good job of using screens.  
For the most part, we just tried to be there on the catch, put our hands up
and make him make tough shots, but to his credit, he was able to do that
today.  
  
Q. Like Archie said, you didn't sign up for him, and you had to go through a
lot of change. What is some of the change you've gone through the last couple
of years?  
KEVIN DILLARD: The only change we got to adjust to is the terminology and the
way the game is played, the offensive and defensive part of it. But I wouldn't
trade the chance for anything.  
I felt like when he came, he gave us the opportunity to get better and he got
us better over the two years that we spent with him. Coached us well and
coached the team well and he put us in position to win every game. We just
came up short tonight.  
  
Q. Played well for today's outcome ‑‑ inaudible.   
COACH MILLER: No, I thought both Butler and Dayton played extremely hard. I
thought both teams were prepared from the first game to the second game. I
don't think the officiating had anything to do with the game really.  
  
Q. You're up three early the second half and then they go three, three,
three; did that really turn it?  
COACH MILLER: That's two majors runs in the game that hurt us. In the first
half, if you remember, I think they got about three in a row from behind the
line in the first half, which gave them control.  
And then once we had control, they took it right back from us with three more
3s. So those 3s were really, really hard to come by. The game was basically
decided behind the 3‑point line today, and you know, I thought we did a nice
job on Kellen Dunham.  
Rotnei is just one of those rare guys that sometimes you can even be there and
it really doesn't matter. It's unconscious in terms of how many times he
misses it. Almost like watching a guy like J.J. Redick in college, that's the
type of guy he is. It's irrelevant whether you're there or whether he's
missing. You know, he hit some big ones.  
I thought their front court players, we tried to play it by the numbers, but
they have got three big 3s from their center spot. And it's kind of the way
the ball's bounced for us, so to speak, this season; in terms of when you're
relying on percentages and numbers and game planning and who is going to beat
you.  
I thought their five‑man did a really nice job. At the end of the day, their
two senior players got the job done today when they needed it most. When we
needed some stops, when we had some control, they went right inside.  
Then when you start talking about the three‑point line a little bit, it has
hard for us to overcome, even shooting the percentages we were able to shoot
against good team.  
  
Q. Behind the three ‑point line, only four attempts, two times at the end‑‑
since you dominated the paint so well, was the three something that you were
not really worrying about from a coaching standpoint?  
COACH MILLER: I have talked to our team all year about the three‑point ‑‑ this
team is all about efficiency. And that's why our team has improved from the
beginning of the season all the way until the end, in particular, on offense.  
You know, our team doesn't need to shoot a lot of threes. We need to shoot
open threes and when they are open they know those are good shots.  
But the mere fact we only took four 3s in the game, No.1, you can tell
Butler's game plan. They don't leave good shooters at the end of the day. They
played the numbers a little bit in making guys beat you. But we were able to
get the ball point‑blank as many times as we tried, whether we posted it,
whether we drove it and whether we had the ability to rebound it.  
I wish our free three throw percentage was better, but if you look at our
percentages over the course of the season, there's a reason the field goal
percentage and the efficiency and what we have been able to accomplish with a
pretty new team; and in some cases, three freshmen on the floor at one time,
we have been able to do that. But the three‑point line, that wasn't going to
be a determining factor winning or losing for us offensively.

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Brad Bedford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25005)

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Travis Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25006)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS  58  
XAVIER - 57

  
COACH MACK: It was a tough way to lose. I give St. Joe's credit, they made two
more free throws than we did. I think we look at the stat sheet, the game is
pretty identical in almost every statistical category. They made two free
throws at the end, the difference in the game.  
I've really enjoyed coaching this group. I don't know if our work is complete
yet in terms of postseason tournaments. But it's a bitter pill to swallow when
you bow out early in a conference tournament, especially in the manner that we
did.  
  
Q. Brad, you were kind of kneeling there at the end with your head down at
the final buzzer, kind of what was drawn up there in the last play and what
was going through your mind after the last shot popped out?  
BRAD REDFORD: I was just supposed to set a back screen for Trav and J‑Mar. The
pass went on a little bit too high, kind of hit the backboard. We were kind of
lucky to be in that position and get that shot. It's disappointing when you
lose at the end of the year. I've enjoyed being around this group of guys, and
playing with them, and you know, I wish we had the chance to keep playing and
go on tomorrow. So just disappointed.  
  
Q. Travis, you said one of the keys was attacking more; can you talk about
how you did in that capacity and for yourself coming off the Butler game?  
TRAVIS TAYLOR: Just attacking the rim, being more physical in the
paint(inaudible) they have a lot of athletes, so it's easy to get shot
blocks‑‑ (audio distortion).  
  
Q. Can you talk about the toughness of walking off the court?  
TRAVIS TAYLOR: It's very tough, especially losing it like that, like Coach
said, bowing out early in a conference tournament. Just especially off a
missed shot like that. Of course that's not the total play, of course a lot of
plays throughout the whole game could have won us the game, but a shot like
that that barely miss.  
  
Q. How did you feel after that last shot?  
TRAVIS TAYLOR: It's just tough‑‑ I'll talk to them about it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Brad did in the last play and what you had drawn
up and what you wanted to do?  
COACH MACK: You're not quite sure, especially when you have no time‑outs left.
You're never quite sure if they are going to come out and resume the floor or
go man‑to‑man.  
But in either case, we wanted to throw the ball to the rim. Brad being such a
phenomenal shooter, we felt like they would be glued to him, he's a good
backswing‑‑ as Brad talked about the pass from Justin got a little bit too
much air under it and hit the backboard.  
You know, that's one of the advantages, when you throw the length of the
floor, that you have an opportunity, almost like a fumble in football, whoever
can come up with it. We knew we had some guys that could make the play based
on the spacing we put them on the floor, but just an unlucky bounce. It's a
tough play but it certainly isn't the reason we lost.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the foul with 24 seconds left?  
COACH MACK: They got the switch they wanted to. They isolated Justin at the
top of the key, with some of their better players in Galloway. It was a
legitimate foul, don't have any complaints. You know, it's the right call. I
wish we had the toughness to step in and take a charge.  
But you can't get fouled‑‑ we tried to isolate him after the first‑‑ and came
back and came with the second one. Good players do that and he's a good
player.  
I thought the previous play was a little interesting. We had a shot clock
violation and I want to see that again. Looked like it hit the rim. Those
officials worked their tails off, did a great job, but I don't know if I agree
with that one. I'm going to have to see it. And if I don't, if it's the right
call, I'll swallow it. But I felt like it hit the rim and I knew we were
getting the offensive rebound because we were getting it in our hands.  
  
Q. How do you feel done this year compared to the expectations you've had?  
COACH MACK: Depends on the position. I think our own expectations, those are
the only ones that count. We had our own expectations in the locker room
preseason. And so there are people out there that felt like we wouldn't make
the conference tournament, felt like we wouldn't be in it till the end.  
We had a very tough stretch, our last five conference games‑‑ we played four
Top‑25 teams. We beat two of them. We were completely flat against(inaudible)
up until that point we felt like we were playing for the conference
championship. To do that 12, 13 games into the conference season with a group
that lost all five starters, I'm proud of our kids. Disappointed that we
couldn't finish a little bit stronger tonight. I don't know if that answers
your question.  
  
Q. The last time you played them, they had a 12 ‑0 run to finish the game,
and tonight when you went on a 12‑0 run you were able to come back. I know
that speaks to the resilience of the team, but can you just address that again
and how they were able to come back and getting around to the final seconds?
  
COACH MACK: They are good players. We have all‑conference type players on our
team. Good players are going to make runs.  
You know, we talked a lot in the last huddle about having been there before.
It's pretty ironic, because going into the final TV time‑out, we were up two
and we didn't score the rest of the game. And coming into this TV time‑out, we
were down two, and we talked about in the huddle, hey, how much has our group
grown since the last time we played them. I thought we made some winning plays
down the stretch. Just needed a little more.

### [Isaiah Armwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25020)

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

MASSACHUSETTS  77  
GEORGE WASHINGTON - 72

  
COACH LONERGAN: Proud of our effort. Feel bad for our guys. Thought they did a
really good job. The effort was there tonight and we had a four‑point lead the
last few minutes.  
Thought we were doing a good job on Williams, first‑team all conference guy
and he sort of took over with his speed. I think we had some tired legs and
just didn't get back on defense. Then made some mistakes and left Trey Davis
for some wide open shots.  
So those were key plays for us, but want to give UMASS a lot of credit, first
kid is all‑team conference guard for a reason, and he made terrific plays to
beat us.  
  
Q. Isaiah, ninth double ‑double tonight, were you playing with a chip on
your shoulder?   
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: Just played like that because we wanted to win and advance to
the next round. I didn't want to come up here to say we came to Brooklyn for
fun. We came here to win.  
  
Q. Joe, the team's best shooting night to night but you were able to have
the lead late in the game because you're rebounding and your defense; can you
talk about those men ‑‑ 18 turnovers, some at critical times.   
JOE McDONALD: Yeah, I think with the rebounding, we got the lead late. But
towards the end, made some big plays, starting bringing the pressure and we
made some costly turnovers. Got to give them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Joe, I know last time you faced UMASS, a big part of the game was drawing
fouls and tonight two players fouled out in the last five minutes; how happy
were you with that?  
JOE McDONALD: We played really hard and that's what I loved this team, we
always fight, we just came up a little short this time.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you were in pretty good shape after Cady and TV both
fouled out in those last few minutes?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, but I thought Chaz was getting by us a lot, and you
know, I knew he had mixed our defenses up and playing 1‑3‑1, we made some
mistakes and we sunk in with a time‑out, too, staying out on shooters. And
like I said, the 3 was big by Trey Davis.  
So even with a four‑ or five‑point lead, we have to score more, and the first
half we shot 26 percent, and the second half we shot better.  
You know, our free throw shooting is much better, and so we have to keep that
lead and we can't get down because it's hard for us to really score. So like I
said, I give him credit, we didn't get stops when we needed to. We had crucial
travel‑‑ our best ball handler pressed, we pass it back to them and he has not
traveled all year. We planned to use the time‑out if we get in trouble and we
had the ball‑‑ that was a big walk there.  
Yeah, maybe that's some youth and inexperience but a lot of that is Chaz and
them turned the heat up.  
  
Q. In the big picture, do you look at this ‑‑ I know it's hard after a loss,
but what you had to go through this year to get to this point; you have to be
a positive looking back on the season?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, we were so happy to get here. But I thought our guys had
a good mentality coming in, and I think we were just not going to come in to
show up. They need a couple wins to get to the big dance, and those guys
really wanted to win tonight.  
We needed a lot out of a lot of guys and some guys really brought it. Some
guys didn't have their best games but all year we have had these kind of
losses and a lot of it has been‑‑ (Inaudible). We have some weaknesses we have
to really work in the off‑season and get our guys to shoot better.  
I'm thankful our free throw shooting was much better tonight and hopefully we
can recruit some shooters, too, because Kevin and Isaiah have been terrific,
but it's hard to get them the ball because they are backing off our guards.  
And then our shooters did not really have good shooting years, the couple
shooters we have. We are going to really work this off‑season and build on it
and take the next step. But it was good seeing a lot of GW people here and
hopefully we can keep the program moving forward.  
  
Q. You did a good job of keeping Vincent from doing much, Riley wasn't
shooting well; does it kill you when a guy like Trey Davis, just makes a
couple big shots, because you probably nailed your game plan to that point.  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, killing‑‑ you give him credit, he makes shot, he was
wide open but he wasn't supposed to be wide open. We really just‑‑ when a guy
goes to the foul line with a ball, we want to stay out on their shooters and
we had pretty good size in there with Isaiah. So a guy has the foul line and
drives it or something, that's fine with us.  
But man when they threw it out there, especially off the time‑out, we talked
about it once, it happened again, and it was disappointing. He made the shots
and like I said, hey, he was wide open, but that's what you're supposed to do.
So I give him credit. Disappointing when looking at the stat sheet he has 14
points from the three.  
  
Q. Talk about how important it is to come play in the biggest media market
in the country for exposure purposes.  
COACH LONERGAN: I think it's good. We had a big recruit here at the game
tonight, I saw in the stands, and hopefully him and some other people know
that we are just a couple players away from being a pretty good team.  
And if we can address the scoring and the shooting, we still kind of need it a
go‑to player, like Isaiah is terrific, but you need a guard who can just do
it. Like I said, Chaz the first game5‑for‑17 and here he wasn't struggling‑‑ I
won't say struggling but he wasn't shooting well.  
Man, that game was on the line the last few minutes though, and I really
thought he took over. We didn't get our defense set. When it was set we did a
pretty good job on him but he's so fast and I looked up and hear the crowd
yelling, but some guys had no idea he was racing up the court.  
But I want to give him credit because he's a terrific guard and we just have
to find a guy like that.  
  
Q. Bouncing off the last question, considering the free throw shooting
tonight, the team's performance, you have to feel good about the future.  
COACH LONERGAN: I do. I do. I'm not a good loser. It's hard. I finish the
season 13‑17, 10‑21 last year and our schedule is going to be really tough
next year and hopefully we can make that next step. And you're not going to do
that just because you have most of the guys returning.  
It's going to be what we do in the off‑season. I think we have a good nucleus
now, and hopefully we'll bring in some more recruits and hopefully we have to
work really hard to keep improving and it's a great league and it's terrific.
This year was unbelievable how good it was, and we played some of the best
teams really, really tough.  
But like I said, we are taking it one game at a time but we were really hoping
to advance tonight.

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami: 87  
North Carolina: 77

  
COACH LARRANAGA: While we're waiting for Durand Scott, I will make an opening
statement about the game. I thought the first half was about as high a level
of basketball as I've seen all year long. I thought we played great, I thought
Carolina was great.  
That's what I told the team at halftime, I said we're playing great, they're
playing great, it's a great game. We got to keep playing great. The guys did.
We had to make some adjustments because Carolina is so good at shooting the
three we went to a small lineup and between Durand, Shane, Trey and Rion Brown
we were able to match up a little bit better and do some switching. That
didn't seem to really cause them many problems but it ended up we were scoring
so effectively at our end as well. We were shooting the three about as well as
they were, so just a tremendous college basketball game and we're thrilled to
be the ACC Tournament Champions for 2013.  
  
Q. Durand and Trey, it's your fourth year, two years with the previous
regime, your second year with Coach Jim Larranaga, what is it about him that
brought this out of you guys?  
TREY McKINNEY JONES: He's an extremely good coach, by far the best coach that
I have ever played for. He knows how to get to us. If we're down he knows
house to pick us up, very good X's and O's and I couldn't ask for a better
coach.  
DURAND SCOTT: I agree with Trey. He just is afantastic person before he's a
fantastic coach. He knows how to talk to us. He just knows how to be a friend
first and that's the best way to get so somebody, I believe. It just makes it
so much easier for us on the court.  
It makes you want to do anything for him because he's, like, a part of your
family. He created a bond between us teammates that just can't be broken. I
think that's helped us down the stretch and that's created the team that you
see today.  
  
Q. Jim, talked to you Wednesday about the team losing a little focus in the
last week or so of the season. You talked about wanting to put the "foot" back
on the accelerator. Do you think you accomplished that in the tournament here?
  
COACH LARRANAGA: I thought I saw that in the second half of the Clemson game
where we quit playing conservatively and picked up our aggressiveness at both
ends of the floor. Our defense was very good we held them to 49 points, we
scored the ball well.  
Against Boston College, they're a tough match‑up because of how they can
spread your defense out, they share the ball very well and our guys I thought
rose to the occasion. It was tied with five minutes to go in the game, and we
were able to come away with an 11‑point win. Yesterday, playing against a high
octane offensive team like N.C. State, we put the pedal to the metal in both
halves. I think we had 41 in the first half and 40‑something in the second.
44, maybe? And today, again, very high‑level of play at both ends of the
court. Against teams like Carolina and N.C. State and Duke, those teams in
particular score the ball so well you have to be a good‑scoring team. You
can't go through seriousdroughts against them because they're likely to go on
runs of 10 and 12 points in just a two‑minute period of time, so I thought the
guys played great for three days.  
  
Q. Durand and Shane, how important is this win for you guys, what does it do
for y'all going you into the NCAA Tournament?  
SHANE LARKIN: It was a very important win, gave us a lot of momentum going
into the NCAA Tournament. A lot of people are saying we peeked early in the
year when we won 14 games in a row and we dropped three out of our last five
so a lot of people said we peaked too early, we weren't going to have any
chance in the tournament. But we stayed together as a group and stayed
together and believed in ourselves and came out here and got three wins in a
row against three very tough teams and it gave us a lot of momentum so it was
a big win for us.  
DURAND SCOTT: I agree, it was very big for us. I think it gives us a lot of
confidence and a lot of belief in ourselves but at the same time we know we
got to prepare for the teams in this tournament because everybody is going to
come ready to go and everybody is going to be‑‑ everybody is a great team. So
we just got to be led by this guy next to me, Coach Jim Larranaga and I think
we will be fine.  
  
Q. Durand, was it your back that you hurt? Would you discuss your injury and
how it might have affected your performance today?  
DURAND SCOTT: Um, when I tried to go for the rebound I couldn't see who did it
but I got elbowed in my back, and it was like a sharp pain in my lower back. I
already had back problems in previous games so once I tried to take a step, it
tightened up even more and got a shock to me so I dropped to the floor and I
knew I had to take a seat. When I got to the locker room, my trainer, he took
care of me, did whatever he did, so I don't know what he put on it. He gave me
some pills and stuff and all of that, but, um, I think I would have overcame
the injury without those pills or whatever. (Laughter).  
I just‑‑ what really made me come back for my team was when I got to the
locker room I thought about North Carolina and P.J. Hairston. The moment when
he got hurt and his finger was bleeding and he came back ‑‑ and it was just an
outstanding play. He came back and shot lights out today as well, and in my
mind I was like, if he can do that I can do it. I think my team really needs
me, just to be a leader out there and get everybody on the right track, and
that's what I tried my best to do.  
And I think that was part of our win tonight. It was kind of hard for me to
run as fast and move as fast as I wanted, but I just‑‑ I just let my
motivation take over, you know, I didn't really think about it too much. Just
tried to talk to my teammates and make things easier on defense and tried to
pick my times of offense, put down a few shots and I forget how much we won
by, by 6 points, I think that was very important to my team.  
  
Q. For a long time now the perception of the ACC is that it's Duke, Carolina
and everybody else. The last two years now Florida State won the title and now
you have won the title. How important is it for the perception of the ACC of
others that teams like Florida State and Miami have now come out and showed
that they can win championships?  
COACH LARRANAGA: First of all you got to give North Carolina and Duke an awful
lot of credit. That reputation is we will deserved; they've earned it. They
have won more championships than any other school in the league. What we're
trying to do is emulate them. They're the teams that are kind of the role
model for other college basketball programs across the country. In fact, my
first meeting at George Mason in 1997, I asked our players who were the best
teams, best programs in the country and who should be our role model and they
mentioned Duke and Carolina.  
When I got to Miami I asked the players who are the best teams in the league
and they said Duke and North Carolina, so what we have tried to do is use them
as a shining example of how things can be done. Through the recruiting
process, through the community, in trying to draw fans and get support for our
program, and I think Florida State has done a great job with that, and I think
we've got a lot of very, very good teams who haven't won as many
championships, but they're also very, very competitive in the league.  
There is a lot of great, young players in this conference right now, and it
could be any of those teams sitting here next year at this time.  
DURAND SCOTT: I'm excited to be with coach. Coach, I'll second that answer.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Did you want to repeat the question?  
  
Q. He did a good job answering it.  
DURAND SCOTT: Okay.  
  
Q. Shane, you said earlier that people were telling you guys you peeked too
early. What kind of incentive was that today and leading into the
tournament?  
SHANE LARKIN: Um, I don't know about the other guys on the team, but I do a
lot of research online, seeing what people are saying about us, individual
players on our team, saying, and I just kept seeing that everywhere, "They
peeked too early. They're not going to do anything. They're finished." And
that motivated me to go out there and play as hard as I could, and usually I'm
the first person to bring the ball up on offense, or the first person on
defense, and everybody accuse me because I'm in front of the team, so I just
try to play with a lot of energy and just try to lead by example.  
Durand is the heart and soul of the team, he's the vocal leader, and I just
try to lead by example. People saying that just gave me a lot of motivation to
go out there and play hard. We did a great job all week of everybody playing
hard and that got us a victory.  
  
Q. I'm curious which each of you will do with your piece of the net,
including you, Coach.  
TREY McKINNEY JONES: I haven't thought about it actually, probably give it to
my mom. I gave her my plaque already. She has been here supporting me through
it all so I will probably give it to her.  
SHANE LARKIN: I'm going to sleep with it for the next two weeks.  
DURAND SCOTT: I think I'm going to bring it home, add it to a few of my
collections.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Yeah, before the tournament began‑‑ I played high school
basketball in New York City at Archbishop Molloy High School, and my high
school coach, Jack Kern was my inspiration for wanting to get into coaching.
He coached at Molloy for, like, 56 years. He's the winningest coach in both
basketball and baseball in the history of the state of NewYork. And just kind
of quietly in my own way and in my prayers, I dedicated this tournament to
him.  
Now that we've won it, I know that he's looking down on us and happy that we
were able to accomplish what we did this weekend. I'm going to put that net in
my office on display like we have some other nets, but that one would be very,
very special to me.  
  
Q. Shane, North Carolina had so many neat things going in their favor today
in that they had the big crowd, they had the tradition, they're used to being
here. They had the motivation of how you guys beat them down in Miami, they
said they were fired up about that, and they got to play against you without
Durand Scott at 100% most of the game. Is that something you recognized they
had in their favor and how were you able to overcome that as a team?  
SHANE LARKIN: They had a lot of things in their favor but we had a lot of
things in our favor. We had a lot of fans here, too, we could hear our fans as
loud as their fans and we just stayed together. It doesn't matter where we
play, Coach always says it doesn't matter where we play, who we play, we just
got to do what we do, and we could have played them at Carolina. And we have
to stick together and stay poised and not get down on each other and stay as
close together as a group as we can.  
I think we did that tonight, and they did a great job of shooting the ball. We
could have got on each other and started yelling at each other and had bad
vibes on the court but we stayed together, and it's just a big thing with us,
we always stay together. "Together" is the last word we say when we break
every huddle, and we're just a family. We're a family on the court. We have
great chemistry and we have a lot of momentum right now so we're playing
great.  
  
Q. Trey, in the second half after P.J. Hairston hit one of his threes, I
swear it looked like you were laughing to yourself when you were running down
the court. Is that right?  
TREY McKINNEY JONES: Yeah, I was, just the way both teams were shooting at
that time was lights out, it was crazy, so, yeah, all I could do is laugh at
that point, nobody was really missing.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TREY McKINNEY JONES: That's what he has been doing this whole tournament and
so we just had tried our best to get a hand in his face, and at times it
didn't really matter, and he was still knocking 'em down, but we just had to
do it on both ends.  
  
Q. When Bobby Cremins won the championship in 1985 he talked about how he
felt somewhat responsible for South Carolina losing in 1970 and it was his
chance to finally get even. You were part of two teams that got to the finals
at Virginia 30 years ago. Do you have any sense of completing something that
was incomplete before?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I'm glad you brought that up, Barry. (Laughter.) So what
you're trying to say is I'm 1 for 9 in the ACC Tournaments? You know, it's
what I tell these guys all the time. You got to live in the moment. I don't
live in the past very much, I don't live in the future. I try to live in the
moment and the present, and help these guys as much as I can.  
When a team wins it's really the players that executed. Shane makes the shots,
Trey makes the shots, Durand gets the defensive stops and steals. It's Julian
Gamble dunking the ball, it's not me. This is all about these guys dedicating
themselves and having a very clear focus of what they want to accomplish and
making all the necessity sacrifices. We have guys on the bench who were dying
to play, Tonye Jekiri who is 6‑11 said to me at one of the timeouts, "Put me
in. I can stop P.J. Hairston" and I was like, "Okay, Tonye. Thanks for the
suggestion."  
They all want to contribute. But whatever suggestions I've made, I think
Durand said this earlier, they try to make the decisions work. So what we did
at Virginia was great when I was there, and what we have done at Miami this
season is great for these guys as well, and I'm just enjoying it I'm along for
the ride.  
  
Q. Shane, obviously a long list of quality and big ‑time ACC guards. What's
it like to add your name to that list and are there any particular players
that you have tried to pattern or model your game after?   
SHANE LARKIN: It means a lot! My coaches have done a great job in helping me
to become the player I am from last year to this season. If I had to say one
player I try to model my game after it would be Chris Paul. He doesn't always
look to score the ball, he just knows when to pick his spots. He's always
trying to get others involved early in the game, trying to get his teammates
going and seeing if somebody can get hot and keep feeding them, like Trey did
early today, he got hot so I was trying to find him everywhere.  
And Chris Paul is the best point guard in the league in my eyes, and I tried
to model my game as closely as I can to his.  
  
Q. Durand, I know Shane mentioned you could hear y'all's fans as well as the
others, but last two games were more or less road ‑type atmospheres with N.C.
State and UNC having more fans. What does that do to prepare this team for
wherever you go in this tournament where you might have to be in a situation
where you go into an environment and they have a lot more fans than you do on
what is a "neutral" court?   
DURAND SCOTT: Well, Coach always told us before these game, these are the
types of games you want to play in. It will prepare us for the tournament,
test our toughness, mentally and physically, and I think we succeeded in that
test. Um, as you can see, we won the ACC Championship, which I'm so proud of
my guys. The main thing, like Shane said, we just stay together. There is
nothing that can beat us‑‑ that will beat that if we just stay together, and
that's what we did tonight and came up with a victory and we will continue
doing that.  
  
Q. Coach referenced earlier going to a small lineup. I wanted to ask the
players how comfortable are you guys playing that style of basketball and what
does that say about your versatility?  
SHANE LARKIN: We couldn't much have a four‑guard rotation. Only one guard
really comes off the bench for us, and we always play together at practice, so
it's comfortable playing with each other. We all know who we're capable of. We
all believe in each other. We never get down on each other. We go against each
other every day in practice, so we know what type of competitors we are. We
just believe in each other. Going small, it's fun out there. It gives us more
opportunity to spread the court out, spread people out, get easier drives and
kicks. When Trey is shooting the way he's shooting tonight, even though Durand
was hurt a little bit, he still had great drives to the basket that opened up
open shots for other people. Whether it's the first pass or second pass out of
that drive, his drives, were key, late in the game, driving to the basket,
getting other people open.  
Rion Brown hit several big shots tonight, he's always up for the big shot and
just‑‑ they just spread the court and everybody did a great job tonight. We
went small, we had to, because they played small. We answered the bell, so
this was a great game for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MIAMI  87  
NORTH CAROLINA - 77

  
COACH WILLIAMS: Congratulations to Miami, it will continue to be a phenomenal
year for them. They won the regular season, and then validated it by winning a
conference tournament as well and it's just a ‑‑ a great, great year. But down
there they have four guys in double figures. They're really a big‑time
basketball team. Shane Larkin is hard to handle out top, he's phenomenal, he
really is. He's probably the most effective player in our league. He just does
so much to help their team and puts pressure on the other team. He plays hard
defensively. Everybody knows their roles, they take what role they have and
they do a great job with it. Trey McKinney Jones and Rion Brown gettin' 32
between them, it's guys you talk about, it's Miami's guys you talk about, you
talk about Larkin and then you talk about Durand Scott, and you should. And
you talk about Kadji and Gamble and you should, and those guys stepped up for
them big today and 12 for 22 from 3‑point line it's just hard to handle, but
again congratulations to them. It's a phenomenal year and I thought the way
Larkin played today he was the best player in the league.  
Everybody on their team did when they were supposed to do. And guys I got no
problem with my team, I got nothing to complain about with my team today. I'm
really proud of my team. I'm not talking about the entire year, I'm talking
about today. Unbelievably proud of what they have accomplished and how far
they have come when everybody was abandoning ship earlier. I'm really proud of
my team, and the way they played today. We had a mix‑up on an out‑of‑bounds
defense and they don't have to make the three from the corner, but they made
the three from the corner and we came down and the next possession, P.J. shot,
came all the way down and all the way back out. My team was aggressive,
attentive, and yes we made a couple of mistakes, but that's the fame of
basketball. I feel very lucky to be the coach of my team.  
  
Q. P.J., what change, if any, did you see in the Miami defense, because
coming down the stretch you found your shot a little harder to get.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: They adjusted and went smaller to match up with us, they put
Rion Brown at the 4 I think, and gamble in at the 5. They were basically
switching everything, trying to keep a smaller defender on me and stay under
me and try to make it hard for me to get a shot.  
  
Q. I would like to ask the players to analyze the difficulty of getting
consistent stops one after the other, particularly the second half.  
REGGIE BULLOCK: It was a veteran group, they made some big time shots. I felt
we would make some great defensive stops at times but you know it was just all
of two minutes, just lack of focus, getting to those players to be able to
capitalize on those shots. On our mistakes they were just capitalizing. So
they ‑‑ they basically just did a great job at capitalizing on our mistakes.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think they tried toinvolve our defense with their screen on
ball, which is difficult to defend. You know Larkin usually draws two or three
guys, and when you have shooters that are making shots it's just a tough team
to defend. And then you know, long shot, long rebound, sometimes it's hard to
chase down those rebounds. They do a good job of spreading you out, and, you
know, they're a veteran group, they know how to run the spread offense with a
high‑ball screen. I mean, it's tough to defend.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: Basically what Reggie said, they made great plays down the
stretch. Trey and Rion hit some big shots. Like Coach said we had a
miscommunication on the inbound play and left J.P. with two people and that
left one person wide open. He had to play two people and he made the shot in
the corner. He didn't have to, but he made it, and that's just the main thing,
they had some great stuff toward the end of the game.  
  
Q. P.J., your hand, can you give us an update on how it feels today and how
it felt throughout the game?  
P.J. HAIRSTON: It felt fine, didn't bother me at all. Just the thought of me
having 10 stitches in my left hand stopped me from trying to reach or trying
to do certain things but other than that I still played through it,
regardless.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys are disappointed right now but considering the way the
game went the last time you played these guys down there, is there any sense
of ‑‑ not satisfaction but pride that you progressed as much as you did
between then and now?   
MARCUS PAIGE: No doubt in my mind. I know that my team ‑‑ we wanted to win
this game we came out and tried to give it our hardest, we made some great
plays as a team. We were showing pride, they disrespected us. When we went to
their place and we just came out, we want passion, in this game we just try to
give them a run for their money, you know we had the game, but you know like I
said it was a couple of mistakes that they capitalized on, but overall I felt
like my team wanted to win this game and we came out and played the hardest.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: I think it started last night when we were watching film. Last
time we played 'em, I'm not going to say this, but it frustrated us to see
them‑‑ they were having fun against us, so we wanted to come out today and
play with the intensity that we haven't played with against Miami, that Miami
hadn't seen, and kinda surprise them. We came out and played for forty minutes
and they just made‑‑ like I said, they just made big plays toward the end and
converted off our mistake.  
REGGIE BULLOCK: I agree with what P.J. said watching the film last night on
the game at Miami really probably helped our mind set, because you watch that
and you take it personal when you see them throwing the ball at the backboard
and dunking it and getting wild with shots and high‑fiving during the game.  
So we just wanted to come out with the mind‑set that we're a better team than
we showed last time, and we had a really great opportunity to earn a ring and
win an ACC Tournament Championship. And they probably outplayed us for the
last 5 or 6 minutes of the game, but other than that, it was a dog fight.  
  
Q. Marcus, most guys you have top defend might be a great passer or a great
penetrator or a great shooter. Larkin seems to be all of those things. Is that
one of the toughest defends that you've ever had?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, definitely, you don't realize how quick he is‑‑ well, some
of you think you realize how quick he is, but until you're out there defending
him it's just a different level of quickness. He's really a complete guard,
he's not selfish, he attacks, he finds the open man, he's had as good a year
as any guard in the country. He's a great player. I know it was probably the
toughest match‑up for me all year and we had to have multiple guys help defend
and a lot of teams struggled defending him and we did tonight, too, but that's
a tribute to him. He's a great player.  
  
Q. Attention turns so quickly to the brackets but you seemed emotional about
this today, am I right? That it seems like it's an emotional thing for you?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, it is, there is no question about that. 90% of the
people in this room abandoned ship, 95% of our fans did. Nobody knows how hard
these kids have worked and you get right here and you would like them to be
rewarded even more.  
Un, it is a weird day. I told my guys I didn't ever want to walk in there and
say okay, guys, it's over with, we'll see the selection show on TV at 6:00
because I want guys to hurt and learn from it. So if we get an opportunity
again it will be even more important to them.  
But it's always important to me, you don't get that many chances to be a
tournament champion of the ACC. As each game goes by it's closer and closer to
the season being over with and that's hard to do, too.  
  
Q. Coach, the way your team played in the last month, wasn't it deeper than
just the lineup change?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think the lineup change is something that just happened.
Talks too much about coaching. Every one of my players got better and that was
the biggest deal. Each individual got better in what we were trying to get 'em
to do and that was the bigger story to me than the lineup change. Yes, we did
that because we thought it would give us a better chance to win but, Marcus is
better now than he was in December, James Michael is better than he was in
December, Reggie, Dexter, you can go on down the line, P.J., and the credit
should be given to those kids who really worked extremely hard to get better.  
  
Q. They don't give trophies for it but do you feel a sense of satisfaction?
They were right there at the end.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I get satisfaction in my team improving, and it was anybody's
ballgame. I don't watch the score that much but it was anybody's ballgame with
five minutes to play. Again, you have to congratulate them. Dan's question was
a good question but it's not just what did North Carolina fail to do. That
other team has a say in the game, too and you have to congratulate them. Shane
Larkin is a pro. Whenever he decides to do it and that's not a sly way of me
trying to get him to leave by any means, I wish he would catch a 24‑hour cold
when they play us, but he's a phenomenal player, you got to give him credit.
You gotta give gamble ‑‑ gamble, the first half of the game he kept setting
screens, setting screens, and then all the sudden the second half he found
some openings in the slit, and they got the ball to them, and got offensive
rebounds for baskets, so you have to congratulate their team but I'm proud of
how my team got better, I'm proud of those kids.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Larranaga three decades going was an assistant in this
league, on the losing end of a couple of title games, you've known him for a
long time, but he's taken a different course to get to this day. What can you
tell us about him that is different and unique what's interesting about his
story of his age, coming into this league and winning a title in his second
year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Jimmy has done a fantastic job. Those kids have bought into
what Jimmy wanted to do, and they're experienced and they're talented. They
could have resisted but they bought into what he wants to do, and I think
that's the true sign of a coach that can get players to buy in for a common
goal.  
That's the most significant thread, you know. Whether a different path to get
here or not, you know, I'm sure Jimmy had some opportunities from Western
Kentucky, George Mason. He might have been able to leave earlier, but he was
happy where he was. When he was an assistant, I was a calendar salesman at
that time. They let me come and sit on the bench and practice every day, but I
was a dog‑gone calendar salesman. I don't think anybody went the same path I
did. You have to congratulate him. He's a very intelligent man. He cares about
the kids, it's not just about the number of points and the rebounds. He's the
kind of coach that you would want your son to play for, and that's a big of a
complement as another coach can give.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the people who, as you put it, "abandoned ship" or
gave up on this team. Was there a moment or a day or a week that you saw
something or had a message that got this ship, in your sense, "righted"?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Not really. You know, being a basketball player at North
Carolina is wonderful, but it's also very tough because the expectations never
change. We had four guys drafted in the top 17 picks and everybody thought we
were supposed to be better this year than we were last year, so that's a good
thing but it's a tough thing.  
I don't know that I would say‑‑ I'll give you two times, okay, and I don't
know which one is more important or even if they are. We're 0‑2 and we play at
Florida State and we competed our rear ends off and all of the sudden we made
a couple of plays down the stretch and we win. That was huge for us, told us
we had a chance. Then I think the other time was after the game when we played
Miami and Duke back‑to‑back and everybody is going to say it was the lineup
but it was the kids. It really was.  
They accepted when we were trying to get them to do and tried to play more
intelligence and with a greater sense of urgency and we go on a streak there
but I would say both of those times would be the ones that I would pick.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami: 81  
NC State: 71

  
COACH LARRANAGA: Before the game I said to the players this is exactly the
kind of game we needed to play, an opponent like NC State, a weapon at every
position and a real challenge for our defense, and I said to the guys, this is
the time we need to play great at both ends of the floor, and I told them at
halftime, I thought we played a great first half and they needed to continue
to do that in the second half and we did that and came away with a great
victory.  
  
Q. Coach, you have an extensive active background in the ACC, how great
would it be to win the tournament? And can you talk about the defensive plays
on the boards and the rim today?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I thought our defense overall was very good. The tough
part about guarding N.C. State is when they get into the open court, and
you've got their big guys who run, C.J. Leslie, T.J. Warren, Richard Howell,
they get out in front of you, and you got Scott Wood, who is a threat the
moment he crosses mid court. So it's hard to key on any one player.  
You rely heavily on your team defense and the individuals to rise up and guard
their own man. We did a good job of helping each other on several occasions
and prevented baskets, but it's a team defensive effort.  
I think for these guys, they have earned the right to play in the championship
tomorrow by how well they have played in this tournament. The tournament is a
separate entity. We did a terrific job last night of moving on to the
semifinals and did a great job today in moving to the finals.  
  
Q. Coach, you bragged on your backcourt yesterday and I'm going to give you
a chance to do so again, Coach. For the players, do you guys take pride in
being the best backcourt in the ACC?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Let me answer that this way. There are a lot of terrific back
courts in this conference. And you can't take away anything from any of those
teams and their programs, because those guys are really, really good.  
I think what makes our players so special is they love that challenge of
proving themselves every single night. They're both so competitive. We do
drills back home, if we're not keeping score, they're bored. But the moment we
say, okay, we're playing to 5 or the first one to eleven, all of the sudden
they light up the room and they want to win. They did everything they have to
do to win the game. That's really what it's all about, the tremendous effort
they put into helping their team. Whether it's scoring or defending or
rebounding, they do it all.  
DURAND SCOTT: Yeah, most definitely I'm grateful to have a teammate like Shane
Larkin next to me, who makes the game easier for me. I just feed off him and
hopefully he feeds off me and going to the game every night we don't try to
worry about everything, I just put everything on my teammates and they allow
me to play the way I do. Like Coach said, give credit to all the other back
courts in our conference.  
We just try to prove ourselves every night and go out there and be the best we
can be and that's the only thing we can control.  
SHANE LARKIN: Like Durand said we try to be the best backcourt every night and
I feed off his energy and he feeds off me. We play well with each other and I
know if he's driving he's going to have his head up and if I'm open he's going
to find me and hopefully he thinks the same of me. We challenge each other in
practice, most of the time we are going against each other and we try to make
each other better in practice. I'm just grateful that he's on my team.  
  
Q. Coach, defense stopped an explosive N.C. State team, couple of steals,
couple of charges. Did your strategy change from what you normally go into a
game with? For the players, what got you going on defense and got you into the
groove?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, we have been emphasizing defense all year long.
Probably the greatest emphasis tonight was to be sure we didn't let Scott Wood
go off for another seven 3s. We held him to six. He is who he is, he's a
phenomenal 3‑point shooter. Sometimes the thing about him is you're playing
great defense, and he still makes the shot. Doesn't need any space, he doesn't
need anytime so he's like Star Trek, right? Space and time?  
He's just really, really good. The thing about the defense is, we were trying
to play team defense so whoever was guarding Scott was responsible for him but
the other guys have to guard outstanding offensive players, too. The thing we
emphasized and we're going to have to put points on the board. No matter how
good our defense is, we need points.  
They shot 50% for the game, and that's not normally what our defense is and
43% from 3. We want to hold an opponent to 40% overall and 30% from 3 so as
good as our defense was we knew we had to put points on the board and Durand
and Shane they put a ton of points on the board.  
  
Q. Durand, you had a career high in points and threes made tonight. Can you
talk about the groove you were feeling?  
DURAND SCOTT: I picked my opportunities and tried to take advantage of it. My
teammates found me and got me open, and once I got a couple of baskets I got
confident in myself and especially from the 3‑point line, I think I missed my
first two but after that I told myself, when I'm open shoot it. That's what
Shane tells me every time, and when I don't shoot it he gets upset at me. So
there were two I shot and made and once they went in I said, I got to shoot it
every time before he gets upset.  
COACH LARRANAGA: He's not the only one!  
DURAND SCOTT: My teammates stress to me and so does my coaching staff, and I
tried to make the best of it tonight.  
  
Q. Shane and Coach, can you talk about Durand and his leadership? He
sometimes doesn't get media attention but everyone on the team says he's the
heart and soul and I heard yesterday during halftime it was his tough talk
that helped motivate the guys for the second half.  
COACH LARRANAGA: In actuality, I think it was on the court during the second
half that he pulled everybody together and ripped them saying, "Hey, pick it
up."  
I didn't hear it, I don't know if his vocabulary was inappropriate, in an
audience like this, but maybe he can share with you exactly what he told his
teammates, because they responded as a unit. They didn't pull apart, which
happens sometimes. Guys become defensive, they didn't. They pulled together,
and that's important at this stage of the season.  
SHANE LARKIN: I don't think Durand gets the media attention he should get.
He's one of the best guards in the country not just the ACC. He's proven that
over his four years here and with the amount of points he has, the steals,
rebounds, he's the leader, heart and soul of the team definitely and what he
said on the court wasn't bad at all, he just let out a roar, he was upset and
he said "I can hear myself out here!" And he was the only one talking on the
court and he wanted everybody to talk, and he wanted to hear others talking
with him.  
He got on us and that's what a leader does and he led and you say that's what
picked our defense up in the second half yesterday and that's pretty much what
got us to this point today to be able to play in this game. Because if we
didn't play defense yesterday we wouldn't have been able to play today. He's a
leader, heart and soul of the team, and does a great job in every single way.  
DURAND SCOTT: The gym was quiet at that moment in the second half, and over
the years the best thing in defense is communication. When you communicate
everybody knows what they are doing, where they're supposed to be, how they're
supposed to do it.  
Sometimes you don't notice it, especially me, and I was talking out there but
then it came to a point, I noticed nobody else was talking. So it revved me up
and I was screaming at the top of my lungs, like I can hear myself talking and
I could hear myself talking, which sparked Kenny, which sparked Shane, which
sparked Julian and Trey and from there we picked it up on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Durand, there was one three you hit in the second half that ended a spurt
by N.C. State where you kept your form there for a second or two. Were you
admiring the shot or just kinda feeling it then? Did that mean anything?  
DURAND SCOTT: No, it was just a shot. I knew I had to get myself into position
to shoot and my coach was telling me to hold my follow‑through and that's
probably the longest I've ever held my follow‑through.  
  
Q. Durand did you think back to the other ACC performance you had as a
freshman?  
DURAND SCOTT: No, when I walked into the building a lot of people remembered
me and they were like "Do you remember this building and how you did your
freshman year?" And they reminded me of my performance, but that was the past,
that game can't win us the game today, yesterday, or tomorrow.  
So I had to go out there and do what I had to do for my team to win and that's
what I did tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, Durand had a great night statistically but he also helped you with
ball handling and Scott Wood actually made threes every time Durand was not
guarding him. Like his eyes lit up as Durand had to go to the sideline is this
the best you've ever seen him play?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I see him play great every day. There are different forms of
being "great." Tonight he was on fire offensively, but he plays great defense
every night, that's why he's the defensive player of the year. He rebounds,
one of the best rebounding guards in the league. He shares the ball, he leads
us on and off the court. In my estimation this game just symbolizes the kind
of player he's been for four years.  
  
Q. Shane, talk about your ability to answer, it seems like State was able to
get it down top 9 or 10 a couple of times and you guys were able to come back
at them and keep the lead where it was.  
SHANE LARKIN: We are a poised team and after we get out of the huddle after
every timeout, Coach always says "Stay poised down the stretch," and they had
a lot of fans there so the arena was loud and we could have easily broken down
and started yelling and not stay poised, but we stayed together as a team and
we pulled it out.  
We have confidence in ourselves and in each other and we're a great offensive
team so there is no reason why we shouldn't have answered and we just had to
answer and we did. We got it done.  
  
Q. For the players, after winning the regular season what kind of maybe
sense of completeness or something like that do you get from getting to the
final here and showing that you can always run through it in a handful of
days?  
SHANE LARKIN: This is a totally new season, the postseason is the postseason,
the regular season is the regular season. When we came here we were 0‑0 just
like everybody else in the ACC, records didn't count, we were playing on a
neutral court with no home crowd and two teams going at it.  
We just came in with confidence in ourselves and a lot of confidence in our
coaches and our game plan and we executed each night that we played. Like I
said before, we're a hungry team, and we want more and more. We're not
satisfied with winning the regular season, we want the ACC Championship and
then eventually we want to make the national championship game. We're hungry
and we're not going to settle for anything less, and hopefully we can get out
there and get it done.  
DURAND SCOTT: I agree with Shane. We came here 0‑0 which means every team
believes they can win this championship. Every game you're going to get the
opponent's best. I've been watching Florida State and seeing Shane come out
and help his team, and North Carolina, P.J. shooting the ball well, so
everybody is going to play their hardest, trying to win the game, especially
teams on the bubble and things like that. It should be a great opportunity to
take this up to the NCAA Tournament, so we had to come out here more excited,
more hungry, more thirsty to win a basketball game and we have to do the same
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [P.J. Hairston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24419)

### [Marcus Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25071)

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina: 79  
Maryland: 76

  
COACH WILLIAMS: We feel very fortunate, I didn't think we played exceptionally
well in the second half, I was pleased with what we did in the first half and
the thing that killed us was points off of rebounds, they had 12 points each
half off of offensive rebounds and that was big for them down stretch.  
I thought we would get the initial stop and they would get the rebound and put
it back in. They played harder at times, smarter at times, had a better coach
on the floor at times and we did some nice things at the end that let us win,
I think it was at the end, Marcus made the jumper and I think it was a 3‑point
game when he made another little tear drop, whatever you wanna call it,
floater, and P.J. played 36 minutes, he was one tough sucker today, he's been
a pansy most of the time I've known him but today he was one tough sucker.  
I think his hand bothered him a little bit, he played 36 minutes and is three
for ten. He had some good looks, but at the same time I think that what he
helped us do out there on the court was extremely important and I do believe
that was a tough performance for him. The toughness that he showed today ‑‑
it's not fun playing with Marcus and James Michael setting on the sideline in
foul trouble, but it's what it was. James Michael made two big free‑throws for
us, and then we had Marcus and P.J. on the line, and I have a great deal of
confidence in them, they made some, didn't make all of 'em by any means. Then
we got fortunate the last play, if they had attacked immediately, we were not
going to foul but if we had a chance around the 5‑second mark we were going to
foul and try to take the 3‑point away from them but it didn't get to that and
it was Reggie that got the rebound then, did a nice job of getting it to P.J.
and P.J. kept it away from them and that was basically it.  
We are pleased with the "W" and know we can play a heck of a lot better, and
we have to play a lot better. We're gettin' ready to play somebody who has
beaten us twice by about eight million points ‑‑  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
COACH WILLIAMS: ‑‑ or close.  
  
Q. Coach, Maryland kept fight and go fighting, but you guys were able to
hang on at the end of the game. Talk about the resilience that your team had
late in the second half.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We had two or three stretches. After we had a 12 or 13 point
lead and made a huge mistake on an out‑of‑bounds underneath where Marcus
decided he would guard Alex Len and letJames Michael guard Dez Wells and
that's not a good match‑up and so they make three. And then we come down, kick
it away a couple times, but then we made some plays. But they also made a huge
run at us, and Leslie made a big three in the corner across from our bench and
I think Reggie made a big three on the wing over there, there were two or
three times they made big runs at us and we had enough in the tank to come
back at them and it was huge for us and, again, James Michael's free‑throws
and Marcus's little baskets and we had enough at the end left to get it done.  
  
Q. P.J., could you kinda go through the timeline a little bit from last
night when you got stitched up, to this morning, to today, to when you
started? Think you might be able to play and how it felt?  
Coach, I know it may be apples and oranges, what is the difference between him
playing with the injury this year and maybe John last year, any correlation to
maybe the chances of winning this tournament, as opposed to the next one?
Anything like that?  
P.J. HAIRSTON: First, Coach has never called me a tough sucker.  
COACH WILLIAMS: But he was today.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: Last night I thought I was going to die. I was in the training
room with my mom holding my hand. They told me okay, we're going to clean it
out and stitch on it, okay, and as soon as the alcohol and the soap hit my
hand I kind of screamed for my life‑‑  
COACH WILLIAMS: See, I told ya.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: And after it was stitched up, it was sore last night. I got
medicine from the trainer and the team doctor, and they asked me how I felt
this morning, and everything felt fine and‑‑ well, it was sore, but come to
the gym and Coach said, "Okay, I'm going to talk to you at warm‑ups, get out
your warm‑ups, and I was catching the ball ‑‑ before we came out for warm‑ups,
I was in the locker room throwing passes, me and Dexter, back and forth, and
coming out in warm ups, it felt fine, I was catching the ball fine, my shot
was going in fine, everything felt fine, no difference.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I have no idea what the question was‑‑  
  
Q. ‑‑ has the makeup of your team given you a better chance in the next
tournament. The make‑up of this team maybe be a little bit less cautious?   
COACH WILLIAMS: John's injury didn't allow him to play. P.J.'s injury did
allow him to play. John was never the same John Henson, regardless of the fact
that he came back and played two rounds in the NCAA Tournament, he was not
John Henson. P.J. today wasn't what we have seen from P.J., but he was still
able to play. So John's injury was a lot longer lasting, and a bigger affect
on our team because he couldn't play, and when he did come back in he was much
more limited even than P.J. was today, I think. P.J., a couple of his shots
didn't go in. He had two great ones right in front of our bench, and I liked
the toughness there because he missed the first one, it came back to him and
he shot it again, because you need to have that confidence. To me they're
really, really different, both of 'em.  
  
Q. P.J., toward the end of the game you seemed to stop shooting, had you
ever done that before in your life?  
P.J. HAIRSTON: Uh...no, the shot wasn't falling and we wanted to have a great
shot offense toward the end and Maryland brought it closer. We didn't want to
force anything, we just wanted to keep the ball moving and try to run some
clock off and try to get a great shot.  
  
Q. Marcus, you hit two big shots there down the stretch after sitting out 6
minutes with foul trouble. Did you feel the need to come in and reinsert
yourself offensively?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I didn't feel the need to but we were trying to get a good shot
and a couple of things broke down so I felt like I needed to make a play and
get aggressive and they didn't send another defender and our guys were covered
so I tried to take advantage of that opportunity. I was on the bench for a
while but I didn't feel the need to force the issue I just kinda let the game
come to me and a couple of opportunities presented themselves.  
  
Q. P.J., about 5 seconds left there might have been an opportunity for one
of your signature dunks. Did you feel your coach's voice in your head to pull
up instead and pass to Marcus?  
P.J. HAIRSTON: Are you talking about the very last second when I dribbled
down‑‑  
  
Q. The very end of the game you looked like you could have dunked, but you
wisely pulled up.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: I was thinking about my hand so I was trying to stop. I figure
we didn't need another point, I just wanted to pull it out. I figured I would
do what the coach would have told me.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's gettin' brighter.  
  
Q. Given the way this season started, what would being able to cut down the
nets tomorrow mean to you guys?  
MARCUS PAIGE: It would mean a lot. We've had some ups and downs this year and
we went through a period where we struggled, and a lot of people kinda doubted
us, but the great thing about that is we stuck together as a team, and we
finally started getting things clicking. So to get a chance to play Miami
tomorrow, who has beaten us, like Coach said, pretty badly and have a chance
to cut down the nets and be ACC Tournament Championship ‑‑ to win an ACC
Tournament Championship would just be ‑‑ it would be awesome to see the season
come full circle like that, going into the NCAA Tournament.  
P.J. HAIRSTON: He took the words right out of my mouth. Like he said, everyone
had their doubts. At the beginning of the season, we started 0‑2, then went
down to Florida State and had a big win, tough win for us and went out and
played hard, and seemed like from there we started clicking. We lost a couple
of games to Miami, but we didn't let that‑‑ well, we let it affect us but it
didn't affect us on the court.  
Once we started clicking together and playing as a team and just playing North
Carolina basketball that's when everything came together and we started
playing with different intensity and a sense of urgency.  
  
Q. What can you do differently against Miami after losing to them already?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Play better. (Chuckles.) Make some shots. Hopefully not give
them open shots. They kicked us pretty hard down at their place so hopefully
we will get some fresh legs underneath us between now and whatever time we're
supposed to play tomorrow. Tomorrow we won't start forty minutes late like we
have every game in the afternoon session. Game will probably be on time
tomorrow. I guess we'll have to make plans to do that. We just have to play
better, I mean, they're a heck of a basketball team.  
They deserve everything, all the special things that have been said about
them. They have scorers at every position, Kadji is a tremendously difficult
match‑up, Julian Gamble and Big Reggie Johnson inside are a load on the
backboards. Shane Larkin has had a good a year as any point guard in college
basketball. Durand Scott today was off the charts. Trey gives them another
shooter, Rion Brown comes off the bench, gives them another shooter. They're a
big‑time team and they've shown it all year long.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you assess the way that Dexter and Leslie handled the
offense when Marcus was out with foul trouble.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I will answer that but anymore questions for the guys? They
smell bad. They need to get to the showers.  
  
Q. Marcus, I want to ask you about Dexter. Tell me about how he played today
and the leadership he has brought to the team this season.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's been great. He's our senior leader; he's been around for
a while. He understands what Coach wants and he's understood that since day
one, which has kinda helped me especially coming in and trying to learn the
system. And even today he did a great job, because he's able to play both
guard spots, which has helped me tremendously, and in times when I was
struggling, you know, we could go to somebody as sure‑handed as Dexter. He's
done a great job of leading this team. If I have to sit out in foul trouble or
something goes wrong like that, Dexter does a great job of sliding over to the
1 and running the offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Questions for Coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: What was the question back there about Dexter and Leslie while
Marcus was out? Is that the question? I think they did a really nice job. We
had one turnover and Dexter tried to stop the fast break high and that added
another mistake to the turnover that he made, but other than that, I think we
did a good job handling the ball. Leslie only made one field goal, but it was
a big field goal, but he goes to the free‑throw line for us and makes 6 out of
6 free‑throws.  
Those were the big plays for us. Dexter missed two shots in a row when we ran
the shot clock down but other than that he shot the ball well. So I think both
of them really did a good job for us. We need Leslie to do more than 1 for 7
from the floor, there's no question about that, but he busted his tail
defensively and goes 6 for 6 from the line, and as I said, Dexter, 7 for 12,
which means he was 7 for 10 before the last two shots, but I thought both of
'em were crucial for us.  
  
Q. I know you and Mark are close. What have you seen out of the development
of his team in the three times you have played them this year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, guys, you know, it's strange because they had almost a
new team last year, new coach, and a couple of guys, and it's almost a
completely new team this year. I just think he's done an outstanding job.  
It's a hard job, coaching in the ACC; is not easy. You have ‑‑ everybody is an
expert and the criticisms and the whole bit, but he's one of the toughest
individuals I've ever been around. I honestly thought he did a better job
second half with his club than I did with mine, and I have a great deal of
respect and care and love for the guy, and he's one of the toughest
competitors I've ever seen many my life. And he's going to do a wonderful job
at Maryland and has this year.  
  
Q. You talked about the loss at Miami by, your words, about "400 points"
preceding the line‑up switch. Does this group match up any better? What are
the challenges?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Seems like it was so long ago, except my memory of looking at
that clock and seeing the score as I walked off the court and the way I felt
during the game is that we had no control over anything. Smaller lineup has
helped us. We're a better basketball team. Is it a world beater, is it the
newest thing that ever happened, the best thing that ever happened, no. Today,
24‑4 on offensive rebounds, so we've got some deficiencies there but it was
the best thing for this team.  
Whether it presents any different problems for them, we'll have to wait and
see what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. Roy, on that last Maryland 3 ‑point attempt were you expecting Logan to
get the ball? Did you look for something like that?   
COACH WILLIAMS: No, we talked about two scenarios. We hoped we would get them
to throw it toward the center line and not toward the baseline. If when they
got the ball originally, especially if we made 'em throw it in the back we
were not going to foul, but if we got them to take 3 or 4 seconds before they
shot it, then we were going to try and foul, as I said, when it got to the 5
second mark. They ran that play‑‑ I think he was the third guy coming around
and I think he rushed it probably, too. I don't think our defense made him
take that rushed shot, but if they had gotten it down to 5 seconds or so we
were going to try it foul and make them shoot from the free‑throw line and not
take the 3, but I didn't know that specific play they were going to run.  
When they started running the play, it looked like that's what was going to
happen and we were yelling at the guys then but that was after the play had
already started.  
  
Q. Coach, coming in to today, Dez Wells has been as dominant and as
aggressive as any player in this tournament and by my count Reggie Bullock
kept him without a point for the first 14 minutes of the game. How do you
quantify the importance of that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it was important, but Dez almost carried them all the
way back at the end, too. I grabbed him and told him he had a phenomenal
performance for three days here, build on that. We couldn't get him ‑‑ we were
trying to slow him down, and we couldn't get guys back fast enough to help
Reggie, and it's hard to guard Dez when he's in the open court coming at you
full speed. But you look at Reggie's line, he is 6 for 10, 3 for 6 from the
three‑point line, 15 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists and 0 turnovers. That's a
big‑time line. Reggie Bullock did some great things for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you, Coach.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami: 81  
NC State: 71

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, let me start off and say I thought Miami was terrific
today. We had a day that‑‑ we haven't had a lot of these days but we had a day
where offensively we seemed to struggle. It was an uphill climb in the first
half, and we couldn't seem to take advantage of an opportunity, whether it was
a fast break, somehow we would not execute or getting to the foul line we
would miss the foul shots.  
We had open shots and bobbled the ball and it was one of those days where we
could not get‑goin'.  
I thought in the first half Miami, you know, played pretty good and I thought
we turned it around the second half, shooting percentage goes up to 57%, I
think, we got the ball around the rim, we were better, we were just in too big
of a hole and they were pretty good as far as holding us off. I thought Durand
Scott was unbelievable today, he played well, he and Shane Larkin together and
Miami today played like a No. 1 seed. Congratulations to them.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you take from this weekend as a positive? I know you
didn't pull it out but in terms of the NCAA Tournament, sir?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think we have a lot of basketball left, I think we have
great basketball in front of us. I think we're an awfully good basketball
team. Today, even the first half, it just was not us. We'll go home, we will
take a day and get some rest, and hopefully we will get selected to play in
the NCAA Tournament, and if that's the case we're going to, I think, play with
a lot of energy.  
We did some good things here, we just didn't do enough.  
  
Q. For Coach and Scott, what were the challenges with guarding Durand Scott
today?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think he is such a strong, bigger guard, and he's great off
the dribble. Today he had a jump shot going, so if you play off him and give
him a one‑arm length gap he would step up there and drill a three on you,
which hasn't been the case with him, got up on him and he beat us off the
dribble. He was tough today, very good.  
SCOTT WOOD: I think at the start, I didn't do a good enough job of pressuring
him, we let him get into his comfort zone and after a couple of shots go down
they're tough to guard. I have to do a better job of pressuring him and
getting him out of his comfort zone so he didn't get that comfort he needed.  
  
Q. Coach, you had the 6 fast break points and you were saying you couldn't
quite convert. Seemed like Miami might have gotten back to slow you down. Did
they do something, was it your energy that caught you guys a little bit on
that?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: It was probably a little bit of both, but we're a pretty
efficient team in the break and we had a couple where we ran the ball down the
floor and mishandled it. We had a couple where we made wrong decisions. We had
some where we took it to the rim and got fouled and missed the foul shots. One
thing after another, we couldn't capitalize on the fast break opportunities
like we normally do. We were outrunning and we wanted to run and it was a
little bit like trying to put a square peg in a round hole, just wouldn't work
today.  
  
Q. To the players, do you feel like fatigue had any factor in the lack of
energy and either way, do you feel like maybe the way you played the first two
games you left an opportunity out there on the table today?  
C.J. LESLIE: Um, it was one of those nights, like Coach said, that we couldn't
get it going. It could have been a factor‑‑ a number of things, but we just
couldn't get it going. We got it going late. It was just one of those things
where we had one of those games that we normally don't have.  
SCOTT WOOD: I can only speak for myself but I'm going to say the fatigue
wasn't a factor considering we get pretty catered to, afterwards, so once you
get into the game no one is caring if you're tired or not, everybody is tired
at the end of the season.  
Obviously we wanted to get the win and we felt like we could have played
better in the first half but at the same time, they're the No. 1 seed, they
played well all year and if you don't play well for part of the game they're
going to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. C.J., what did you see as the impact of their 14 offensive rebounds and
18 second ‑chance points?   
C.J. LESLIE: What are you asking me?  
  
Q. What did you see as the impact of their 14 offensive rebounds and 18
second ‑chance points?   
C.J. LESLIE: I think you said it. 14 offensive rebounds, we didn't get those,
they had second chances, we just didn't get 'em. I don't know what I'm
supposed to say to that.  
  
Q. Coach, is Rich okay and what do you think of his effort today?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought Rich gave us great effort. To your comment, first
of all, I thought we had good energy. Sometimes we don't play well‑‑ we don't
make shots, it's not about energy or playing hard, our guys played extremely
hard. We just couldn't get the ball to go in the basket. Richard was like he
always is, he fought through it, I thought he was hampered a little bit.  
Like I said before, you get to this time of the year and everybody is banged
up a little bit and you fight through it. I thought Richard gave us great
effort and these guys gave us great effort and our guys kept playing hard.  
Again, lost to a good team.  
  
Q. Talk about having to play the quality of guards that you guys had to
match up with the last few nights and how stuff that is on a nightly basis.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Let me say this, because I was part of the media and I worked
for ESPN and I hear about how leagues are deep and I look at Boston College, I
look at Virginia Tech and Erick Green, who pounded Iowa, Virginia who beat
Wisconsin on the road and look at Maryland and what they're doing and I never
hear anybody talk about our league and how deep the players are top to bottom.
Sounds like there is 100 teams in the Big 10 and the Big East and we played
against them, we played against Burke and Smart who are highly rated guards
you put Shane Larkin and Durand Scott right in the group, that's why they're
sitting here with 17, 18 ACC wins today. Those guys are awfully good and we
played against them today and didn't do a good enough job containing them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2013

  

### [Nick Faust](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25082)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina: 79  
Maryland: 76

  
COACH TURGEON: Needless to say, I'm really proud of my group. We were dead at
the start of the game, we had no energy whatsoever. Emotional win last night
beatin' the No. 2 team in the country in Duke, and we all tried to sleep last
night but none of us slept very much. We missed a ton of layups, balls bounced
out of our hands and led to layups for them and we never quit. We had a shot
at the buzzer to tie it, against a team that's won 7 out of 8, or 8 out of 9,
and really playing well.  
I can't be more proud‑‑ I'm really proud of this guy next to me. His growth in
the last three weeks, I've been on Nick so hard about growing up and becoming
a basketball player. He's just had a great two weeks, and I couldn't be more
proud. Came up a little bit short, but sometimes you don't win on the
scoreboard but you win, and we won today as a program. Our program got better.  
  
Q. Mark, on the last play, was it your hope to get that shot in that
situation immediately trying to get ‑‑ trying to avoid a situation where they
would foul and Logan was the first option?   
COACH TURGEON: Absolutely, yeah, Logan is a pretty good shooter and they all
have a lot of confidence in him, he was 48% from the three a couple of weeks
ago, hasn't shot as well of late. Alex had a great screen, it's hard to get an
open three late in the game and we actually got one, and, you know, execution
was tremendous. The amazing thing is that we put ourselves in that position to
be there, to have a chance to do that. I think we all thought Logan was going
to make it. We were talking about after he made it, make sure we got our men
going back on defense, cut the ball and don't let 'em score so we can get it
into overtime, that's how confident we were, we were talking about what we
were going to do after he made it, didn't make it but the execution was good.
That's what you ask for as a coach.  
  
Q. Mark, do you feel like your team has hit a new level here in Greensboro
and if you do believe that does it make it frustrating if you don't make the
NCAA Tournament to show what you can do?  
COACH TURGEON: Unfortunately, in today's world you get judged on whether you
make that tournament or not, but I'm judging us on where our program was when
I took the job and where it is today. Where we were two months ago, where we
were a month ago and where we are today. That's really how I'm going to judge
it.  
A month ago, I'm not sure I wanted this season to keep going, these guys were
tough to coach. Now I'm having a blast coaching them. I'm having so much fun
because they're listening. Jeff, you're with us, what this group has done in
the last three weeks, pretty amazing, pretty amazing!  
  
Q. Nick, you were the in ‑bounds passer on the last shot. It looked like Dez
came around first and Seth Allen followed him. Can you go through that and
explain what they did to prevent you from getting the ball to them and made
you throw it to the other player?   
NICK FAUST: Well that was just the way Coach drew it up. There were just
distractions to get Logan a wide open shot. We thought that Logan's a good
shooter, so him taking the shot was the best thing for the team.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Dezmine Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23451)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Maryland: 83  
Duke: 74

  
COACH TURGEON: Obviously I'm really happy. We had a lot of guys play well. You
know, I thought the difference was we came out of the gate and Duke wasn't
themselves at the start.  
We got up 12, 10 or 12 points, and our guys kept fightin', we got confidence
from that. I thought our defense was phenomenal. We wanted Mason Plumlee to
beat us and they missed some shots for us, too, you have to be good and to be
lucky to beat a great team. We're a little bit of both. Just really proud of
my kids. I've been saying since Georgia Tech, we're getting better, getting
better, wasn't showing up in the win and losses, now in the last couple of
days it's showed up. So I'm really happy for my guys.  
Watching them play tonight I think they fully expected to win that game and
that's a good feeling when you have such a young basketball team to play on
such a big stage in such a big game and to play with the poise that they
played tonight.  
  
Q. Mark, you got Dez eligible for the start of the season, and he's helped
you a lot over the last couple of games and how much has he grown and how much
has that meant to this team get to go a point where it could do some damage
here?  
COACH TURGEON: I had to learn how to coach Dez, didn't have him all summer.
Last year Dez had two guards that did everything and he stood there and got it
or they threw a lob to him.  
Now he's had to take a different role and as a coach you're trying to figure
out your team and Dez has stepped up and Nick Faust has stepped up. I've been
ridin' Nick all year, been on him, playing better as a defender and playing
with poise. Happy for Dez, tonight was a big‑time performance and I'm happy
for him. Two weeks ago he was 1 for 5 at the foul line, tonight he was 10 for
10, I didn't forget that and I know he didn't either, but we've been shootin'
free‑throws and dialed in. Pretty focused tonight.  
  
Q. Dez, you said you grew up watching Jason Williams among other guys, how
hard did Duke recruit you out of college and how does it feel to beat them?  
DEZ WELLS: I never heard from them, no recruitment letter or anything from
Duke. That could be because there were a lot of players that were better than
me in high school. A lot of people would consider me a "late bloomer," coach
is a great coach, they have a great program, that tradition is huge, but I was
going to do my best and give my best effort to whatever school I went to, and
where David Mayer is, is where I'm at.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it mean for this huge rivalry for you guys to take the
rubber game against Duke. There have been comments about David Mayer going to
the Big 10 and for you guys to win on this stage?  
COACH TURGEON: This has nothing to do with a rivalry or not a rivalry, it's
about building a program, okay?  
We came here two years ago and six guys, first day on the job, I didn't
envision this to be honest at the end of the my second year. Dez didn't go
through all the stuff I had to go through last year but for us to be such a
great program, first time they've lost with Kelly, figured out how to do it,
means a lot to my program. Whether it was Duke or whoever it was, it means a
lot, it's great. It helps me with my fans, I know that.  
  
Q. Duke cut it to 1, you hit a free ‑throw and then it was a 2‑point game
and Mason Plumlee got called for the charge and you immediately went on a 17‑6
run. What's your memory of that run, what you did well?   
COACH TURGEON: Well, we defended well during that stretch. I just thought we
kept guarding. The thing that we have had a hard time with is playing with any
type of poise. You look at our first possession of the second half, after they
scored, we came down, used the clock, got Jake a wide‑open three in the
corner, we couldn't have done that three weeks ago. Guys would have dribbled
off a knee or shot it or something. The guys executed a great game plan, guys
kept making plays, we kept gettin' to the rim and we felt that was the only
chance we had tonight, getting to the rim and of course we got to the foul
line and made a lot of free‑throws.  
  
Q. Coach, you just said a minute ago "It was neat to figure out a way to
beat Duke with Kelly that nobody else had done it." What did you figure out
that you haven't seen others do?   
COACH TURGEON: Well, you know, maybe I'm trying to give myself too much
credit. I'm not trying to do that, I apologize for that. My guys just played.
Coach Spinelli, it was his scout, he said we got to switch 1 through 4 and I
said I don't know if we can do that the whole game, but we stayed small and
our small lineup worked. We've gotten better at our small lineup, we have
added more offense and gotten better. Right now it's a good lineup for us. We
switched, they missed some shots for us, I think our press kinda confused them
early. Used 9, 10, 11, 12 seconds before they could get into their offense.
Our guys played smart, they knew when to stay in the press, when to get out of
it, when to switch, every adjustment we made in the game they did it right
away. It's been a battle with this group so for them to do it is a good
feeling.  
  
Q. Dez, you mentioned Duke's tradition, one of them is the floor slap where
you're feeling frisky, where you do the floor slapped! How do you feel about
your defense on them?  
DEZ WELLS: I was trying to energize my guys, and at that moment I was thinking
we have to get a stop. I do whatever I have to do to get my guys pumped. No
shots at Duke or anything like that, I just wanted to get my guys energized.  
  
Q. Mark, you have talked about different lineups for different match ‑ups,
it seemed this time with Jake Layman in there matching up with them, did it
seem like you dictated things more than usually, that kind of stuff?   
COACH TURGEON: Whenever you're playing well you can dictate, when you're not
playing well you can't dictate, it's easy to sit there and dictate when things
are going well.  
We kept telling our guys we were built for Marchand a tournament run, Shaq'
hardly played last night, tonight he had huge minutes and he guarded Mason
Plumlee, tomorrow might be a whole different deal but we have practiced enough
lineups where we feel comfortable playing any lineup that we have to play. It
was a tough process, it was tough on these guys and we felt like we had to do
it and we've gotten better at it. We're happy with the win, halfway home,
though.  
  
Q. Mark, you guys seemed to be particularly animated and energetic on
defense right away, and I saw your defenders were kinda clapping their hands,
was that a way for you to come out and assert yourself defensively?  
COACH TURGEON: We played ‑‑ they missed some layups, kinda got us going and
they make those layups might be a different outcome, they miss those, we're up
12‑2, they made a couple of runs at us, we may have folded a couple of weeks
ago, we didn't fold today, we're growing up.  
  
Q. Mark, how have you walked the line with this team in wanting them to be
confident in what they're doing and trying to draw them back away from some of
the overaggressive turnovers and shots.  
COACH TURGEON: It's hard, it's really hard and Nick is tired of me saying be
disciplined, under control, don't go crazy on me, Nick. I don't know how many
times he's heard that but with that said, Nick is growing up. It's hard.  
It's hard, but you know what, they're figuring it out. The thing is, take me
out of it, they're gaining confidence in each other and how they need to play
to win. I'm just over there putting guys in but they're figuring it out as a
group. They have respect for each other as people and now they're getting
respect for each other as players and they're playing that way as a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Shane Larkin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25048)

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Durand Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25049)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami: 69  
Boston College: 58

  
COACH LARRANAGA: This was a terrific win for us. Boston College is a difficult
team for us to match up with. We're big with Kenny Julian, and they're kind of
smaller and skilled and they spread you out and share the ball about as good
as any team in the country. We knew we would be in for a dog fight. We had a
hard time guarding it even in practice yesterday.  
Thank goodness we were able to go small in the last five minutes. We don't
have a lot of perimeter subs so we couldn't have done it earlier, even though
we know that's probably the best way to guard them. We were able to do that in
the last five minutes and pull away and get a nice win and move on to the
semifinals.  
  
Q. Coach, the last three minutes, you outscored them and limited them to one
field goal. Talk about the defense in the last three minutes and what you were
able to do to negate what they wanted to do, and as you said, use your
perimeter defense and make plays and get baskets.  
COACH LARRANAGA: The whole key in guarding Boston College, they do such a
great job with ball screens and hitting the role man and hitting or finding
another open man. When you're bigger you're slower in your rotation so the
last 5 minutes we went to the small lineup and we switched most of them so
there is no open man and we trapped with our big guy to be the aggressor at
the end of the floor, both ends of the floor and both of those things worked
at that time in the game.  
  
Q. Shane, if your team is going to play eight good minute of basketball how
important is it for five of those to be the start of the game and three of
them to be the finish?  
SHANE LARKIN: We wanted to play 40 good minutes of basketball but you always
want to close a game good and tonight we did a good job, beat 'em 14‑3 in the
end of the game and we have seniors and experience so we didn't wilt, we
stayed together, Coach brought us in, it was like pull together now, three
minutes, and we did and they only had one field goal the rest of the game.  
Defense is going to win us a championship and if we lock in I think we have a
good chance.  
  
Q. What specifically did you guys do to hold Olivier Hanlan to only five
baskets?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I would say the first thing is we have two of the best
perimeter defenders in the league, Durand Scott was the defensive player of
the year and Shane was second in the vote getting. They take great pride in
their defense. They're grit competitors, they love the challenge. They
obviously watched the game yesterday and saw Olivier Hanlan set an ACC record
for a freshman with 41 points and that motivates them. They like those
challenges, but you can't do it by yourself because he gets a lot of screens
so you need your team mates to help you and the guys did a good job of that
tonight.  
  
Q. Shane, was there any point during the game where you thought, "Oh no,
this could be it? This could be a short run?" What kept you going when the
momentum shifted?  
SHANE LARKIN: My teammates were encouraging. We just stayed together. We
never‑‑ when something goes bad we don't get down on ourselves, we're always
positive I go trying to encourage each other and it's easy to get down, we
were up 13 points, 21‑8 and they tied it up 23‑23\. We could have easily got
down on ourselves and fussed between each other but we stuck together and
that's something I think we have been taught over the year is to stay
together, and Coach has preached that all year and "together" is the last
thing we say to each other in the huddle, so if we do something wrong we don't
let it get us down. We just stay together.  
  
Q. Shane, the last three minutes there in that stretch you had a couple of
big plays with the big three and a steal, do you feel some responsibility to
take over and show leadership and make plays to get that separation?  
SHANE LARKIN: I wanted to make a big play for the team and it actually wasn't
just me that got the steal ‑‑ jumped in the air. I jumped, put my hands on the
ball, we do a drill everyday in practice of saving the ball with great effort.
We trapped. Rion Brown came out of nowhere and saved the ball to Kenny, and we
came down and got another basket so that was a huge play. Kenny and Ryan had a
big part in that so it wasn't just me, it was me and my teammates, and Trey
cut hard off the play and we ran. It was pretty much all of us that had a big
part in that, so I had to get to the spot, so everybody was doing a great job
of working together.  
  
Q. I would like to ask Durand Scott and Shane the challenge of taking on
Olivier Halan and the motivation there, both of you, please?  
DURAND SCOTT: Well, like Coach said he did a great job yesterday scoring 41
points so we put a bit more focus on him than anybody else because we knew we
couldn't let him come in and get a good start and get his team going. Like
Coach said it was a teach effort and I think Shane did a great job
individually and we helped as much as we could to hold him so as few points as
we could.  
SHANE LARKIN: It was a team effort, they set a lot of ball screens for him and
in the scouting report he likes to refuse the ball screens and we liked to
make him take those. He did a good job of hedging and trapping on those. So it
was a great team effort, 14 today, and I'm glad we held him to what we did
today.  
  
Q. Durand, you have had good performances in this tournament but always in
an underdog role. How is it different going forward as a favorite?  
DURAND SCOTT: It's not a one‑man sport, so I don't look to try to match
anything, I'm just trying to win the tournament. We need to do what it takes
to win the tournament. Right now I know one thing I can definitely do 100% of,
and that's play defense, and that's what I'm going to put my heart on the line
for and help my teammates as much as I can in the defensive end. I will try to
motivate them to play better and I think I did that to my best ability tonight
and that's part of us getting a "W."  
  
Q.Coach, looked like they went to a match‑up zone at the end of the first half
that threw you out of your rhythm and what was the key to getting back into
the rhythm in the second half?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Halftime. What happened is they started out man‑to‑man and we
were playing well and sharing the ball, getting it inside, outside, running on
fast breaks and doing a great job defensively. I think they had two or four
points in that first few minutes and we got a lead, up to 13, they switched to
the three‑quarter press and the 2‑3 zone and we got passive. We didn't push ‑‑
turn the ball over, which was good, but we didn't attack like we wanted to,
and at halftime we put Kenny in the high post and telling Shane and Durand to
get it quicker into the offensive set and attack more off the dribble. Both
guys did that, Shane was able to get threes that way and Durand was able to
get to the basket as well. They found Julian in early, Kenny got a basket and
then Trey hit an opportunity 3, it was not like a play or anything but the
ball bounced loose to him. We shot well in the second half, almost 70%.  
  
Q. Coach, not to be redundant but I wanted to get your take, it was a 2
‑point game with a couple of minutes to go. Talk about those back‑to‑back
steals and how huge that was.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, one of the problems with (Phone ringing.) I'm sorry,
that was one of my players! One of the problems you have defensively when you
have guys who are very quick is they will often look for steals and miss,
gamble and compromise your defense and you end up giving easy baskets. We did
that a couple of games ago and it hurt us.  
Tonight we stuck with fundamental defense and we got the steals off of the
traps when we are organized to look for steals. Shane and Kenny did a great
job of double teaming the ball and making it hard on Olivier Halan.  
When you do a good job of handling the ball and you have two or three men in
the trap who are active and anticipating what the next pass might be, it works
much better and that's part of our scramble defense and we work on it
regularly.  
  
Q. Durand, just wondering the second half, they go up 4, answer everything
and you guys keep ‑‑ how frustrating it was out there when they keep answering
everything?  
DURAND SCOTT: It was definitely frustrating because I knew my team wanted the
game really bad but I was trying to preach to them it's not going to come to
us, we have to do it. They're not going to miss shots and layups and things
like that, we have to play as hard as we can and make stops on the defensive
end. We needed to push the ball and get good shots at the offensive end and I
think my team did a good job of that. There was one point I tried to motivate
them, have everybody talking on the defensive end and that sparked a trigger
on everybody and that got us rolling and we didn't look back.  
  
Q. Coach, Shane had 10 points in the first 10 minutes of the second half.
Back ‑to‑back driving layups and the 3‑pointer. Can you talk about how
important he is to this time and in moments like that where the game is close
and he always seems to do something to put the team ahead and get 'em fired
up?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think everybody knows we have five seniors, they're
basically like five starters and they do a fantastic job together, but by
adding Shane to that group, he added an element that allows all of them to
play better. He's so good at what he does. A lot of times you'll see him in
the first half try to get the ball to Kenny or Durand or Trey or Ryan and then
in the second half he starts to pick his spots to attack and score or find the
open man. We absolutely needed that because I thought in the first half we
were settling for basically perimeter shots and we needed more balance. So we
told both Shane and Durand to attack more off the dribble and get to the
basket and he did that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Michael Snaer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22143)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina: 83  
Florida State: 62

  
COACH HAMILTON: North Carolina was a tough match‑up, we could not keep up with
Reggie Bullock and P.J. Hairston. Our game plan was to not allow them to get
out in transition and get those open looks. They got such great range and they
get it off so quick if you're not there on the catch contesting hard.  
Obviously we had‑‑ I think we had nine turnovers the first half, gave them 14
points. But even with all that, we had that period in the first half where I
think we might have been down two and we missed two layups or three, turned
the ball over, four free‑throws. They hit two three's, made a lineup on our
turnover and that's the 10‑point game and we dug that hole for ourselves and
couldn't ever get back out of it. Once they got their momentum they played
freer.  
We still had a difficult time locating the shooters. I thought Marcus Paige
did a good job of getting the ball to their shooters, 10 assists, our Achilles
heel was we had 17, 18 turnovers, but I thought North Carolina had a lot to do
with that.  
Once we got behind I thought they played with more confidence and we were
somewhat anxious and not quite as efficient as they were. The best team
tonight won. They outplayed us and I think getting off‑‑ having two guys that
we couldn't seem to keep up with. When I play that back over in my mind, we
got 'em in half‑court we were fairly solid but we couldn't find 'em in
transition and that, I thought, did us in.  
  
Q. I don't know if you noticed Michael but when you fouled out a lot of
people stood up and applauded, basketball fans in general, not just Florida
State fans. Could you sum up your ACC career?  
MICHAEL SNAER: I noticed it a little bit but at the time I was frustrated
about the game and the loss and just the way the game went in general. This is
the sum of my career in the ACC has been a long one, fun one, at times it's
been where we had up's and down's but just being a part of the Seminoles,
there is a level of pride that comes with that and a level of toughness and
the young guys on our team, they're getting a taste of what that feels like
now and getting a taste of what it means to be a part of the Florida State
basketball program and to play under Coach Leonard Hamilton. I think they're
going to be good, they're a young team, they're talented and now they know
what it's like to play in the ACC. I couldn't have picked a better place to
come to.  
We got a chance to make history a lot and I've been fortunate enough to be a
big part of us making history at this school. That's one of the main reasons
why I came to Florida State and one of my main goals and I'm proud I
accomplished one of my main goals.  
  
Q. P.J. Hairston is a good shooter but he's not that good of a shooter this
year against you guys. Is that just something, some guys play well against
teams? He was 13 of 21 from the three against you guys.  
COACH HAMILTON: Sometimes that's the way it goes. And we have been known to be
a pretty good defensive team. It's not like we have been poor defensively over
the year. I think he's a good shooter, P.J. Hairston might be a little more of
a rhythm shooter but you look at his statistics and his percentages, they are
pretty good. He's capable of doing what he did tonight.  
Against Duke those jump shots didn't fall, they had the same looks tonight
that they did then. That's the way the ACC is. You might have a guy that's
streaky because they are developing and growing and maturing, but there is
something about when that first one goes in it gives you a certain level of
confidence and I thought that's what happened to us tonight. Those guys made a
couple and we had turnovers that gave them transition baskets, and you make a
couple and get your confidence and you get going, that's what good shooters
do. I don't think it was a lack of effort on our part, I think those guys got
pro range and they have quick releases and they're both athletic and they have
a guy like Marcus Paige who is lookin' for them and moving the ball. Their
system works for the type of team that they're putting on the floor now and if
they shoot that way, the way they shot against us tonight they're going to be
a hard "out" for a lot of people.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think your postseason will be now?  
COACH HAMILTON: I have no idea. I don't get caught up in the‑‑ it's become a
sport within itself trying to figure out who is on the bubble, who is not on
the bubble, who is going to the NCAA Tournament, who is going to the NIT, the
CB‑‑ whatever. As I approached this year's team I knew we would be very young,
somewhat inexperienced and we would have to learn and grow up kinda by fire.  
I didn't expect to be void of our leaders. Terrance probably played the most
minutes in the last couple of games since Jan and it's March. We've had to
play our freshmen, who have gotten very valuable experience and I think it's
going to pay dividends as we move forward. So I am more focused on just trying
to develop‑‑ like Michael said the mentality it takes to compete at this level
with these guys. I think we're talented tonight. Our two big guys didn't play
tonight but before they leave they're going to be the best two big guys
league. The match‑ups tonight just didn't give us an opportunity to play them
because McAdoo is such a mobile guy. He is a power forward with small forward
skills. We didn't feel it was to our advantage to play with our centers
tonight, because we tried to match up with them, but our focus is developing
this team, playing as well as we can and trying to teach and develop know is
that the future is bright and any opportunity we have to play that we are
invited to, I'm sure it will be a tremendous opportunity for our guys to
continue to play more games and get better. We are going on a European tour
this year so we have those 10 days of practice and we will play against some
people and it will give us an opportunity to get better as we approach the
next year's season.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Mike has meant to the program over the last
four years and his impact going forward?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, Mike brought a work ethic and a mentally tough spirit
that I think has been helpful to our team. Fortunately for him, in his first
three years he always had some mature guys around him that kind of fit his
focus and mentality.  
This year I think has been his best year even though maybe we have not had as
good of a team and we have not accomplished as much as we had in the past. I
thought his role changing from being a guy that was a finisher, kind of a
defender, a stopper, a guy who made shots for us, but now he had to accept the
role of being a leader, a mentor, a guy who is trying to not only finish, make
plays, now he's a leader and facilitator, trying to create for others, when up
until this point he has had guys creating for him and I think he's accepted
that role and he's done a fine job communicating with youngsters.  
Sometimes it's hard to lead when the guys who are supposed to be following
don't know exactly what they're supposed to be doing. It's a challenge.
Sometimes you lose patience and sometimes you have to challenge them and after
all the things that he has gone through this year and he has maintained effort
and attitude and he's done a great job representing the University and his
family, and our basketball team.  
So he is going to be missed because he's going‑‑ when he came it was
different. He decided that if I'm going to get into the lineup and I'm going
to play I need to learn how to guard somebody. He didn't start the first few
games as a freshman but his defense was so good we had to put him on the floor
and not very many High School All‑Americans will do that, they want to shoot,
have an offensive mind but he turned it around and said I know I can score but
let me make my mark and give the team what they need, a defensive stopper.
That's going to be something he carries with him into the future, and he will
always be a representative of the type of mentality that he brought to the
program and he's leaving with a lot of accomplishments.  
When we recruited him he knew he could go to a well‑established program and he
could be part of making a difference. We needed somebody that had the
mentality, I don't want to be like everybody else, I want to do something
different and make a contribution. So that type of individual is rare. A lot
of guys want to go where it's easy, he went where he would have the
opportunity to contribute, and I think he will be better as a result of it and
we have been better as a result of his participation in our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [C.J. Leslie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23535)

### [Scott Wood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23626)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina State: 75  
Virginia: 56

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Let me start off saying I think it was a good win for our
team. I think our team is beginning to find, you know, that "groove", I like
to use that word. I think we're gettin' in a good spot. Defensively, I think
we're improving, getting better and I thought today, you know, Virginia missed
some shots but I thought our defense had a lot to do with it, I thought we
defended them well, Scott did a good job on Joe Harris, not letting him get
free looks, our help was better and defense was better and offensively we
moved and shared the ball really, really well. Good, good team win for us, now
we got to get ready to play a really good team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, C.J. and Lorenzo combined 8 for 27 against a team like Virginia
that doesn't really do the recipe for getting a big win. What do you think
helped you get this big win with those guys struggling at the offensive end.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: First thing, even though we struggled to score at times we
did a good job, shot the ball well and we thought there was a couple of
stretches where Scott took the game over. You know, it was a week or so ago or
few days, whenever it was, when the voting came out for Owl‑ACC Selection, I
was shocked that Scott Wood wasn't on somebody's first, second, third,
honorable mention, to me that's amazing.  
When you play our team one of the first thing you have to do is figure out how
you're going to guard Scott Wood. He stepped up today and not only was he
working hard defensively but he changed the game, changed the game, period.
He's been doing it all year for us, he's won games for us at the end and today
I thought he had a couple of stretches where he was outstanding.  
  
Q. Scott, following what Coach said earlier about getting in a groove, how
do you think this team is confidencewise right now? Looks like you're playing
with a lot of confidence.  
SCOTT WOOD: I think we're doing a good job so far, the main thing is on the
defensive end. We know we have a bunch of people that can score the ball, and
anytime we're in our stance, guarding our scouts like we know we should, that
makes us a dangerous team.  
  
Q. Coach, you were talk about finding a groove, why do you think you're
playing that way now?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I don't know if I know the answer to that. I think every
coach, if you knew how to get your team playing really well at the end, we
would do it automatically. It sometimes happens that way. I think putting T.J.
in the lineup there six or eight or ten games ago, I think it took time but I
think it's beginning to help our chemistry. We had a stretch there where
Lorenzo was hurt, missed three games and a couple of games he was probably not
even 75%. Now I think he's much healthier, that's helping us some and veteran
players that when you get down to the end of the year, you got some seniors
and upper classmen, they want to play differently. I think all those things
contribute to that.  
  
Q. Scott, when you got it going there, especially in the second half when
you made those three straight, what did it feel like? Did you feel like you
can't miss at that point and do you ask the guys to get you the ball or do
they look for you?  
SCOTT WOOD: I'm not one to go into the huddle and say "give me the ball" but
it feels good when you're knocking down your shots and gives you the
confidence to know the next one is going in. They did a great job finding me
to get me easy ones and C.J. and T.J. and Richard did a good job of settin'
good screens to get it to me, open.  
  
Q. Scott, follow ‑up to that question. You had 17 in the second half. Was
your mind‑set any different when you came out from halftime?  
SCOTT WOOD: Not really, any time I get an opportunity to get a good look I'm
going to take advantage of it, my teammates did a good job of setting screens
and gave me a couple of good looks and once I started knocking them down it
gave me confidence.  
  
Q. Coach, Richard got kneed in the leg and he said it was painful, have you
ever seen him grimace so much?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Not really but he's a tough, tough guy and he plays through
about everything and I asked him a couple of times if he was okay and I knew
he wasn't but he didn't want to come out of the game and he battles like that.  
I thought it was interesting because, you know, I think Calvin is usually good
for us and I think there were stretches where Richard was hunting for Calvin
because he was hurting a little bit and they did a nice job of passing the
ball to one another in there and they kept battling all night.  
  
Q. C.J., it looked like you were trying to set the tone offensively and
defensively, did you feel the pressure to set the tone, or is that how the
offense worked early?  
C.J. LESLIE: I knew if I got going and got the energy started early, my team
would follow behind me and we would do a good job of picking each other up.  
On any given night it could be a different person, whether it's Rich, Scott,
or whoever, we piggy back off each other.  
  
Q. How can you specifically prepare for Miami?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: We played 'em once at home and they beat us, so first of all,
we remember that. They have proven from start to finish that they have been
the best team in the league so far, their record was that. We have a lot of
respect for them, they're big inside. With the three big guys in there,
they're not just tall, they're thick. Larkin had a phenomenal year, and he's
dangerous to guard at the top of the key, or wherever he may be. They have
guys that can make shots and they have guys that are built to win, very few
teams end up with that many veteran players at one time who are that good and
Jim has done a great job with them. We got our hands full, we know it, we
respect them and they beat us at home and our guys will be excited about
playing them.  
  
Q. C.J., in the game against Miami, there at the end of the game, and I
can't remember if you were on the court, but were you ‑‑what do you remember
about that tip‑in and frankly are you glad to have another shot?   
C.J. LESLIE: Yeah, of course I am. That was a one of a kind game for us and we
felt like we had that game under control and they got us at the end.  
One of the things is that we know we have to‑‑ it's a tough team. We have a
tough match‑up with the big guys. We're going to come out and be prepared.  
  
Q. Coach, as a guy who hit 48% of your 3 ‑pointers yourself, when you see
great shooters, like Scott, hot today, Joe Harris cold today, did you see just
hot and cold or did you see more than that to explain those?   
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought‑‑ I think Joe Harris is really, really good and
he's proven it, but Scott guarded him for a lot of the game and Lorenzo had
him for some of the game and we made it hard for him, even when he curled off
the screens on the wings we did a nice job of not allowing him to dribble
drive to the basket, which he does well, he's strong enough to get to the rim,
we eliminated some of that and Scott had the hot hand offensively. We kept
goin' to him and he kept delivering.  
When he gets goin' like that I'm not sure there is a better shooter in the
country, I've said that many times. I told him he's the second best shooter in
the gym behind me but he's gettin' close. He is as good as anybody in the
country, there is no doubt in my mind and he was awfully good today.  
  
Q. Coach, early in the season, Brown got injured and you lost three
straight, including the last ‑second loss to Miami, can you talk about his
impact on and off the court?   
COACH GOTTFRIED: You can see his impact now. I'm not sure what our record is
from what he came back, but it's pretty good and it's good before he got hurt.
He affects the game defensively, he settles our team down, we have great
confidence in him, he finds guys with his passing, he can score when he needs
to. He affects the game in so many ways and obviously we're a different team
when he's healthy and hopefully he's getting close to 100% now.  
  
Q. You played five starters 30 minutes, you didn't have the bye, are you
worried about fatigue or not an issue?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: No, that's a rule we have, you're not allowed to get tired.
Our guys will be fine. That's the rule we have. They will be anxious to play
tomorrow and ready to go and we will find strategic ways throughout the game
to rest our guys, which we have and they will be ready to go.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Maryland: 83  
Duke: 74

  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Congratulations to Maryland. You know, they were a hungry
team. I didn't think we were hungry tonight. The hungry team‑‑ they were
playing‑‑ they're trying to survive, and they played like it. A lot of teams
in that position sometimes get nervous or they make a lot of mistakes and
instead, Maryland rose to the occasion.  
A lot about tonight is not us, about what we didn't do, it's about Maryland. I
thought they were terrific and Dez Wells built on his performance from last
night. A lot of times in tournaments, when one player elevates his game‑‑ he's
had a good year and he's a really good player. But in these two games he's
elevated himself to really a high level. You can bring everybody with you. You
start playing with a guy who is doing that, and with that sense of urgency,
again, they were deserving of winning.  
For us, we were not hungry tonight. Whether we're pacing ourselves or thought
we could‑‑ we weren't the Duke team that's played most of this season.
Especially the last couple of weeks. I'm disappointed in our performance, but
I'm also very impressed with the performance of Maryland.  
  
Q. Coach, there is a stretch probably six to eight minutes in the game Ryan
Kelly was out. What was that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Did you see they had four guards in? We couldn't play
defense. If you saw that, that answers the question. Ryan is not‑‑ he's not‑‑
look, he's back, but he's not in the shape that he would be normally and so we
had to try to match them and‑‑ we were playing catch‑up the whole time. We got
it down to 2 and Mason got inside and we got that charge call, and that was a
pivotal time because we had a chance and then they exploded again to a
double‑figure lead.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the 3 ‑point shooting on both sides. Over the
season you have been the best 3‑point shooting team in the league and the best
at defend it go. They shot well from three and you guys didn't, was that them
or you?   
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's a hell of a thing, it's a phenomenon, you witnessed an
amazing thing. I just wish we were the thing that was amazing. That's what
happens in the game. It's why stats and all that are‑‑ those are things that
people like to play around with. When people are put in a position where they
have to win, a lot of times they elevate, Maryland was stupendous tonight. I
can say all the things we did wrong, but to me they did their things right
better than we did our things wrong. They were a terrific basketball team
tonight.  
  
Q. As disappointing as this is, now that it's done, could you turn this into
a positive with, A, the rest and B, the practice time between now and when you
play next?  
SETH CURRY: I don't see any positive right now, we wanted to come in and play,
get better and today we took a step back. We learned some things we need to do
better but it's going to be a good week of practice for us and we wanted to
use this tournament to build and get better, and we didn't do that today.  
MASON PLUMLEE: We have to have a good week of practice. There is no time to
start questioning things, but at the same time we have to right the ship going
forward. This happens next week, we're done.  
  
Q. Seth, you said you learned some things that you need to do better what
did you learn from this game?  
SETH CURRY: We need to be sharper, play harder from the start. Things like
that. We got to share the ball and we just‑‑ we didn't come out to the game
matching their energy and I mean, we do that next week, it's over, like Mason
says. It's tournament format, we got to get off to better starts and things
like that.  
  
Q. Mason, it seemed like you established some offensive momentum in the
second half and every time you guys did, they had an answer. How deflating was
that?  
MASON PLUMLEE: To put a run together you got to get stops. I thought the three
they hit in the corner off our initial‑‑ we came right out of the half and
scored, they seemed to always have an answer. That's how they kept us from
getting back in the game.  
  
Q. Seth, did you guys feel like you were getting good looks from beyond the
arc tonight or what goes into you not shooting as well as you do regularly?  
SETH CURRY: We got a lot of good looks but our offense wasn't sharp from the
start, we weren't cutting hard, things like that, screening hard, things like
that, so that kinda‑‑ that always plays into how you're shooting. Like I said
we didn't match the energy from the start.  
  
Q. Mike, what will be your regimen as you prepare for the next tournament?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We will try to figure that out, the press conference and
talking with the staff and how we use these days to get better. We're either
going to play Thursday or Friday, so we don't know where or the dates so we'll
just have to get together as a staff right now, trying to respond to you all
for the game and we haven't had time to set any plans yet.  
  
Q. Mike, they have played you well at home, is there something they do that
presents a difficult match ‑up for you guys?   
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: They're very athletic and they're deep. He plays a lot of
guys, and if those guys‑‑ offensively them contributed tonight, Shaquille
Cleare, he had two big buckets when it was a 4‑point game and when that
happens you get some life. One of the main consistent things is I didn't think
we were ready to play up there and I didn't think we were ready to play here.  
We're not going to beat a lot‑‑ a lot of people would win these two games
against us if we don't show up to compete at the level that we need to. They
sensed that. You sense that when you're competing, that the other team is not
as sharp as the team you just saw on tape. Our team over the last ten days has
played great, but we weren't that team tonight. That's why it's not a video
game.  
  
Q. Coach, you called a time ‑out just 90 seconds in. Is that a reaction to
that entire 90 seconds or did you see a lot of warning signs leading into the
game?   
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, no, I just saw it right then in the first 90 seconds. We
called two sets that we never ran and we didn't play‑‑ we were not there.
Look, I do this, this is what I do. I know when you do your radio show you do
a great job, after that first commercial if you weren't doing it you would
have to give yourself a motivational talk because you would sense it wasn't
going‑‑ really, you do it long enough, hey, this just isn't right. And you try
to "right" the ship right away. We weren't able to do that to the extent that
we needed.  
  
Q. Coach, were you happy with the way Rasheed responded coming off the bench
today?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He did a good job. It's not about one guy. This was not a
good night for us. The‑‑ one of the things‑‑ during this time of the year‑‑
and this is what Maryland feels right now, is that if you lose it's final, and
our team did not feel that. Now we have to understand that that's the way it
is. If you don't do it, it's done. If you lose you're one and done sometimes
and we didn't play like one and done and they did and they won. Going into
this next tournament everybody is in the same boat and the team that can feel
that the most has an advantage. I would hope that that's something we could
feel going into the NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina: 83  
Florida State: 62

  
COACH WILIAMS: We're excited to still be playing, there is no question about
that. It was a nice effort for us offensively particularly in the second half
to shoot 61%, problem is we let them shoot 54%, put 'em on the free throw line
way too many times with ticky‑tac fouls, because they were laying it up, but
to get through with James Michael, it was a weird play.  
You got to play without fouling, you got to work all the time to not foul but
James Michael only play 14 minutes was big for us and P.J. was big early
because he was all of our offense. We're extremely concerned right now, his
hand is torn up and they're stitching it up in the training room right now, I
have no idea, won't have any idea.  
I told you everything I know, it doesn't look good and they're stitching it up
and I wouldn't watch it. It was split in the webbing between his fingers but
he and I agreed we weren't going to watch while they stitched it up but
Reggie, Marcus, Dexter, their ratios were great and Reggie's baskets in the
second half were big. We would have made 100% of our free‑throws if Marcus
hadn't missed one.  
  
Q. Did any of the players see what happened and how the injury occurred?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: He was the only one on the end of the court and going down to
the other end so none of us seen it.  
COACH WILIAMS: The guy was trying to steal the ball and when you see that
blood you're a little delirious. I couldn't say and he had the ball and
slammed between the ball and he felt like the ball jammed between his fingers
and that's what he said.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel that you're at your best when you guys are running?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Definitely, when you get transitions and get stops it helps you,
whenever you can be in transition you can shoot a higher percentage and we
pride ourselves getting out on the break and we weren't able to do that much
the first part of the game but second half we started getting out on the break
and putting more pressure on them.  
REGGIE BULLOCK: He took the words out of my mouth but every day in practice we
have the wings get out and run wide and we had to turn it up on the defensive
end of the floor and turn it into transition easy buckets.  
  
Q. Marcus, can you talk about what happened from your perspective when you
guys generated the 17 ‑5 run right after James Michael went out?   
MARCUS PAIGE: Our defense fuels our offense and we didn't play great
defensively in the first half until the last six or eight minutes of the half
and then after James Michael went out we were able to step it up another level
and that led to easy baskets and we knocked down some shots, which always
helps.  
  
Q. Marcus, you had 13 turnovers in the previous two games. What was the key
today to bounce back?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think when I stay aggressive I tend to turn the ball over
less. When you're passive on the court you let the defense get to you and
dictate what you do so I tried to be aggressive and make smarter decisions
with the ball. Two games in a row when I was sloppy with the ball, so I made a
big effort to make sure I knew where my passes were going today.  
  
Q. Coach, and Reggie, you guys with this new lineup, new offense for about
eight or nine games, what do you like the most about it, and what has it
allowed your team to do that maybe it wasn't able to do before?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: For me the things I like about it, Coach probably like it too,
but he tells me to go to the board all the time, I have to live on the boards.
I think the advantages that we have is we can set traps, we can get out in
transition, we spread the floor with adding P.J. in the four, so we have four
ball handlers on the floor and those are the advantages. The things I like
about it is, I live on the board and try to make other plays.  
COACH WILIAMS: I think that's part of it, but I do believe we're able to
create turnovers, which helps us get out on the break as well. We don't
rebound the ball as well but it balances out, we don't have a shot blocker.
They shot 54% the second half but they had 18 turnovers, that we turned into
27 points so smaller is quicker and it hurts us on the board but we can spread
the floor.  
When we were doing it like we were and we outscored them 17‑5 we had great
space and go moved it and moved it and we got great shots.  
  
Q. Reggie, you had 4 points in the first half, 13 in the second. What
changed for you in the second half? What was your mentality in the second
half?  
REGGIE BULLOCK: I tried to be more aggressive and I was getting shots that I
was wide open in and I wasn't connecting. My teammates were finding me, they
told me to continue to shoot the ball and that's what they expected me to, is
shoot, and I decided to become aggressive and get to the boards and make plays
for other teammates.  
COACH WILIAMS: I did some great coaching at the half and told him to make the
shots.  
  
Q. If P.J. can't go tomorrow have you thought ‑‑ he's been such a big part
of this lineup have you thought about how you might address that?   
COACH WILIAMS: I really haven't. We could play Marcus at power forward,
possibly, but the conventional wisdom would say you have to go big because you
can't teach Reggie the out‑of‑bounds plays from the four spot between now and
tomorrow at 3:00, it's already so ridiculous that it's midnight and we have to
be back at 3. The nine o'clock game started at 9:40 again.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.  
  
Q. What did you tell Michael after the game?  
COACH WILIAMS: I told him he was a heck of a player, I enjoyed watching him
play, and I told him that maybe that doesn't make him feel good right now but
maybe he could appreciate it later because I'm a huge fan of his. They were
8‑0 on games decided by four or less and he was directly responsible for
winning four of those and he's a security blanket on the other ones. But I
just think he's a heck of a player.  
  
Q. James Michael was playing in foul trouble, how were you able to
compensate for that?  
COACH WILIAMS: During that time period he was out, Jackson, Desmond, Brice,
those guys had to fill in for him but we had movement and got some easy shots
and the problem is on the defensive end we gave them easy shots but during
that time period we had some great shots.  
  
Q. Give us a sense of how tricky it is, you come out at halftime, whatever
you talked about, you blink your eye, James Michael gets his third, Snaer gets
a three, that was dramatic.  
COACH WILIAMS: I was upset because we didn't close out on Michael Snaer, and
he made three or four shots and we weren't challenging him. And in that
time‑out I said I thought we were going to guard people. I liked our
composure, P.J. makes the 3 right after that time‑out, Reggie made a tough 3
from the far corner so we just kept playin' but it wasn't a very comfortable
feeling to say the least.  
  
Q. Six days ago you're playing Duke and for Carolina, that was a
disappointing outcome. Was there anything in particular that you worked on
after that or focused on this week that led to what we saw today? This is a 20
‑point win against a strong Florida State team. What was the difference?   
COACH WILIAMS: We worked on everything. The biggest problem was Duke was
great. The Carolina fans think it was just about us, Curry made a three with
Reggie all over him. His hands were spaced apart wide enough for the ball to
go through and Seth made one as he was falling down on his rear end. You have
to give them credit. We panicked and took quick shots and talked about that,
but basically we tried to work on everything the week of practice, tried to
work on better spacing in our offense, better poise, doing a better job on the
defensive end of the floor, too, so it really was everything.  
I told them I want us to learn from that game, hurt from that game, never
forget how bad it was but we've got to move on, next play, next game.  
  
Q. Maryland has all of the size that they theoretically could challenge your
small lineup and yet they used four guards to beat Duke today at times. Does
that make it more complicated for a quick turn around?  
COACH WILIAMS: It does and the most complicated thing we have right now is
what is going to happen to P.J. and I have no idea. Other than that still
North Carolina is going to play Maryland and we've got to figure out a way to
play. Last year we got John Henson hurt in the first game the tournament and
Kendall getting hurt later got all the attention in the NCAA Tournament, but
we were harmed by Henson getting hurt in the ACC Tournament, and we never
could come back from that. And last year James Michael stepped up for John and
played great in the ACC Tournament so if we can't have P.J. we've got to have
somebody step up and play great.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

offensive glass. When Wood gets it going they become so dangerous. I think
they're the most offensively talented team in our league with the five on the
floor at most times and for us to have a chance in this game, we talked about
it, there were a couple of areas that we had to be at least an "A" or "A‑" and
it was to limit transition ability and as few of rebounds as possible.  
They used their toughness, got offensive rebounds and got transition buckets
and we didn't play very well. That's the result against a talented team like
that.  
  
Q. Joe, what made it a tough shooting day for you today?  
JOE HARRIS: I thought they did a good job of overplaying, they made shots
tough and contested and had a hand in the face.  
  
Q. Joe, some of those 3s that Wood was knocking down, did you feel like you
contested ed those, did you feel like he was in the zone, did you feel you
closed out nicely on them?  
JOE HARRIS: I felt like you gotta rush for a moment and he allows a little bit
of space and that's all he needs to knock down a shot.  
  
Q. Tony, this is another slow start not unlike the Maryland game. Any
explanation for why the team has been so slow out of the gate last couple of
games?  
COACH BENNETT: We talked about‑‑ obviously you always talk about trying to
start the right way. We were sluggish, mixed a few easy ones, couple of
turnovers, they got good looks and every time we tried to make a "mini" run,
if you want to call it that, they would answer with a 3 or we would have a
breakdown. That was discouraging, you can't have breakdowns like that against
a team like this.  
  
Q. Akil, talk about the lack of success for this team since you came into
this tournament.  
AKIL MITCHELL: We struggled in the first round, we played N.C. State last year
and last year we had a couple guys banged up and there is no excuse. We have
struggled to find our way in here, but I have faith in our team and hopefully
we've got some basketball left.  
  
Q. Coach, N.C. State, you scouted them closely, obviously, did they look
more confident than you saw in Charlottesville?  
COACH BENNETT: Wood had a terrific game against us, he wasn't as hot there and
they're a different team with Lorenzo Brown. He makes them go. He played 10
minutes against us and rolled his ankle and that changes the complex of the
game when he's on the floor.  
The play of Richard Howell and certainly C.J. Leslie on the glass, even if
they can make plays individually whether you trap you have issues, if you try
to play 'em one‑on‑one you have issues, but those two guys were playing, I
thought, at a high level of class. I know Richard Howell banged his foot and
C.J. Leslie's stat line, 6 of 17 but I think Browne makes all the difference
and Wood with his shooting. He hit some special shots and as Joe said it was
both, some we did a poor job on and some we were right there and he got it
rollin'.  
  
Q. Tony what does this do to your NCAA chances and did you feel the pressure
like you were playing for an NCAA spot today?  
COACH BENNETT: What will be, will be. We have some quality wins, we have some
bad losses and who knows what will happen. I'm sure people won't give us much
of a chance, the Committee will make their decision, this would have helped
and I thought we had the right mind‑set going in, we prepared hard and knew
the keys but if you're off against an offensive team like this you won't have
much of a chance and we have a fine line.  
  
Q. Coach, you were a great shooter yourself, you probably had nights like
Joe had as a great shooter, not so good tonight and also great nights like
Scott Wood had tonight. What did you see in terms of spacing and defense that
made that happen between two great shooters?  
COACH BENNETT: They probably keyed in on Joe, guarded him better than we
guarded Scott Wood, but as I said, if he earns them and they're tough shots we
live with 'em, but it's when we lose vision or relax and he gets a clean look
those are the breakdowns that you can't have and it was a combination of both.
He had it going and they tagged, Joe got good looks, he was off today that
happens. And we always say don't let your shot affect the rest of your game
and you try to be as sound as possible in other areas and impact the game.  
Wood has some nice pieces and if you just guard him they're going to hurt you
in other ways.  
  
Q. Tony, the first start for Tobey since November, talk about that decision.
It looked like he was "off."  
  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think we finished the second half of the Maryland game,
in overtime. I thought we were playing good basketball in terms of going
inside. He gives us a scoring threat and some size, I was hoping on the glass.
We were worried about the match‑up, certainly, if it was Richard Howell, who
we had to match up on and it was obviously a big stage against high‑level guys
and he was a little off, but the reason is I thought we finished the Maryland
game and we thought we needed to be a little more traditional to battle them.  
  
Q. I know it was a tough night but what are some positives you took ought of
the game?  
COACH BENNETT: This game, right now, it's hard to find some. Our effort was
good. It was, but our execution‑‑ effort without execution or soundness
doesn't get you a whole lot. These guys are a group‑‑ and I sound like a
broken record but you certainly can win with 'em and you can lose with them,
and you know they're going to fight for the next practice and they're about
the right stuff.  
On the floor I'm struggling a little bit, the stat sheet will show some good
things that happened but I'll have to get back to you on that one, how's that?  
  
Q. Joe, seemed like they were getting into you, being physical, how does
that compare with how they placed you last time and compared to other teams
you have faced this season?  
JOE HARRIS: They did a good job of making cuts hard, they weren't making
anything easy, if I had a down screen they were trailing the cut and they were
playing tight. It was a little bit different.  
I thought at home we did a good job, we were in more of a rhythm offensively
and it seemed like things were click and go guys were able to get good shots
and tonight it was different. Akil played well tonight for us but other than
that it was hard to find rhythm.  
  
Q. Tony you trailed by 19 early in the second half and you cut it to 11
after Warren's technical. Back ‑to‑back possessions they had three, maybe as
much as five shots. Was that the last straw there?   
COACH BENNETT: You never want to say that but that was probably our chance to
get it into a single‑digit lead, fortunate to hit that shot and then you're
right, Akil looked like he was fighting his butt off in there trying to get a
rebound and we needed to come up with one and those are the plays that you
gotta get.  
We weren't able to do that against them, the perimeter, we didn't have size,
there were match‑up problems all over out there but getting back, there was an
easy transition layup that we lost sight of a guy and that hurt us and those
offensive rebounds were the nail in the coffin, so to speak.  
  
Q. Your team and its body of work has become a litmus test for an unusual
combination of a great record against good opponents, but too many bad losses.
You're a fair guy, how much weight do you put on those things?  
COACH BENNETT: I don't know, I think I told you before, said we're the "Dos
Eqis" bubble team, we're the most interesting bubble team in the world, we
gotta stay thirsty, right? Was that you? Who was it? It was‑‑ someone, I'm
sure, will claim it.  
We do have some quality wins, absolutely. Have some bad losses, have the
injuries, they'll have to make those decisions. It is a unique situation and
that's where it's at.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel pressure today playing like you were playing for an
NCAA bid?  
JOE HARRIS: No, I thought our coaching staff and everybody around us, we did a
good job of being prepared and focusing in on just the game at hand. Coach
always talks about how that stuff will take care of itself if we have to focus
on playing good basketball.  
AKIL MITCHELL: Just like Joe said, I felt like our team was focused on this
game at hand. We all had ACC Tournament Title was our goal. Whatever happens,
happens, you can't worry about that and you have to get yourself ready to
play.  
COACH BENNETT: And in the Maryland game I thought‑‑ we dropped those two games
and I thought we played with a little pressure. I didn't sense that from them,
I knew we were going to have to play great basketball for the Maryland game
but I didn't sense that with these guys that much today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami: 69  
Boston College: 58

  
COACH DONAHUE: I thought we played a really good basketball game, I was proud
of our guys, we hung tough. We had a couple of injuries, with Eddie going down
I thought that hurt our defense but you give Miami credit we couldn't stop 'em
in the second half for the most part and that was the difference in the game.
They got what they wanted and I was proud of what we did and how hard we
worked and competed really hard and played smart. Fortunately, to beat a team
like Miami you got to play great, we didn't make foul shots and turned the
ball over in key spots but besides that I was proud of our effort.  
  
Q. The way your team ended the season and especially the regular season,
overcoming the deficit today to play with Miami and be tied with three minutes
to go. How do you feel about that?  
COACH DONAHUE: I think when I take a step back I will be extremely pleased and
proud of our players. These guys have done a tremendous job of working through
a lot of things our scholarship players and our freshmen and sophomores. I
felt we did an incredible job starting to play and believe and compete and
it's ‑‑ to be honest, I'm pleased with the development of our program.  
  
Q. Coach, your kids played nose ‑to‑nose with the number one seed. How did
it get away from you in the end?   
COACH DONAHUE: I think the last three minutes is basically a three‑minute
game. One of the things we pride ourselves on is being at the line taking the
two points, and that didn't happen. But I thought in that game we didn't
execute. We did a poor job. I said to these guys, "Winners want the truth.
That's the truth. You wanna win that badly you have to execute," and we
didn't.  
  
Q. Another step or a next step in the proceeding is the ability to finish
games. Miami is a team that's matured and I think they have finished 13 ‑3;
that's how it works sometimes.   
COACH DONAHUE: Unfortunately‑‑ and I said this to the guys in the locker
room‑‑ to get where you want to get to you're going to have to do
excruciating, frustrating failures to figure out how to get better.  
We've done an incredible job in tight games, we had so many this year more
than my 13 years combined in my coaching career just in this year so they had
a ton of that. I don't think it was necessarily inexperience, I give Miami
credit. I think they guarded well and we didn't do a great job for a stretch
there and honestly I didn't feel good going down the stretch because we played
well for about 20 minutes there and over the last seven or eight just didn't
seem like we had that same execution going.  
  
Q. I would like to ask the players, Ryan and Olivier what do you think were
the determining factors in the last three minutes?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I think we had mental breakdowns, I had a breakdown in defense
I was supposed to switch out on Shane Larkin and I messed up on that. Like I
said, it's the little things that make us‑‑ or hurt us.  
RYAN ANDERSON: I think it was the mental breakdown at the end of the game. I
don't know if it was metal fatigue but we messed up on rotations and finishing
things and making free‑throws, so a lot of the things they beat us on at the
end.  
  
Q. Ryan, it looked on your face like you knew the game was that close and
things weren't going your way.  
RYAN ANDERSON: I thought I made two key plays at the end, and I didn't get the
ball and go up strong. I just didn't do that on those last two plays and those
are key points and the momentum turned down the stretch.  
  
Q. Even today, do you feel like there was an emphasis on the performance you
had yesterday?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I was out there trying to make plays. Miami did a terrific job
on me, and I had a hard time. I could have done more today, but I had a bad
game.  
COACH DONAHUE: I don't think you had a bad game, I think it's pretty great
play on his part. He got his average, shot a high percentage, did a terrific
job and the play he was referring to, no one in this room knew his
responsibility to get out of the screen. He didn't have to mention that. I
thought he handled his playing well and we played off things well. The last
few minutes of execution is why they're really good and why we're trying to
get there. And I didn't mention Eddie's ankle. Eddie has been a real
difference to us over the last month and a half particularly over the
defensive end. He gives us easy buckets on the offensive end but, he's someone
we can switch out easily and that's why we're switching Larkin's ball screens
because Eddie is the one doing it. When we don't have him, I think it's
difficult. We lost in transition with having our two bigs out there and
obviously small at times, and we would have loved to have had him healthy the
whole game.  
  
Q. When it was 57 ‑55 you called time‑out, what did you set up? And Olivier,
what did happen at mid court when they trapped?   
COACH DONAHUE: We knew they were going to trap and we did what we call pocket
passes, they were taking that away, beg your pardon doing what we call a
Butler action, quick reversal out of the trap and I think Shane and the other
defender did a better job and got in to "O" at that point and that's what
we're talking about.  
We wanted that trap to get it out of there and then we have four shooters
around and we spread it out and get a good look.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: We were trying to get the Butler, and I was not strong enough
with the ball so I turned it over. That was the play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Pe'Shon Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25009)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Dezmine Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23451)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Maryland: 75  
Wake Forest: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Maryland.  
COACH TURGEON: First of all it was a good win for us, I thought Coach Jeff
Bzdelik had his team ready, they came ready to play, they executed well, they
had some new plays and did a great job. I got off our guys at halftime, talked
about energy.  
We came out with energy, started the second half, got our offense goin',
weren't quite as good defensively until the end. We did something tonight we
don't do a lot, we got to the foul line and made free‑throws. That was the
difference, but really proud of my guys, we had to play some funny lineups to
do some things and the guys responded well, good win for us.  
  
Q. Dez, talk about the defense on C.J. here in the second half, you hold him
without a field goal and I think only 6 points. How key was that to take him
out of Wake Forest's offense and allow you guys to build momentum to translate
to the offense?  
DEZ WELLS: Pe'Shon did a great job on him. We dug down and took his lanes away
from him and just tried to make him make passes to the teammates that didn't
beat us. I'm sure he will play after college. We did a good job of team
defense on him in the second half.  
  
Q. Pe'Shon, that second half was probably as loose as I think a lot of folks
have seen you play over the last couple months or so. This was almost like a
fresh start for you, this tournament and was that as good as you have felt
over the last couple of months?  
PE'SHON HOWARD: Definitely I felt loose. The coaches said at halftime to go
out and have fun, it's a new season, take one possession at a time and
concentrate on that and have fun and be together. We have fun together on the
court.  
  
Q. Dez, when you first made a college decision there was a chance you would
never play in an ACC Tournament, now not only did you play in one, you're in
your home state, your team won and you're the star player, is that an
exaggeration or a dream come true?  
DEZ WELLS: I wouldn't say I'm the star player, but ya know I grew up watching
guys like Jason Lane, Mike Denvy, Juan Dixon and Steve Bleakley, so a great
feeling to be close to home and playing in the greatest conference in college
basketball, and I'm just excited to be here and excited to play and compete.  
  
Q. Coach, will you talk about the success that you had in the second half
and what y'all did?  
COACH TURGEON: I think it was a combination, I think we were pretty good and
they had a lot of shots go in and out. If you're a Wake Forest fan you saw a
lot of them bounce out, limiting them to one shot, I said guys we got to make
'em shoot jump shots, they're getting to the rim and that was when Travis
McKie drove baseline, they had to shoot jump shots to beat and you say we
played smarter that way. They got some open shots and they didn't fall but we
were locked in, scouting report was pretty good in the second half, our guys
were locked in, did a much better job on Harris. First half they got a ball
screen, didn't show, ran a double screen and we didn't show, and after that we
were pretty locked in.  
  
Q. Dez, last time you played Duke, Ryan Kelly didn't play against y'all, how
does that change that game tomorrow to have him on the floor?  
DEZ WELLS: Ryan changes the dynamic of the team. We're going to have him ready
and be ready for him and the rest of the players, Coach K is a great coach but
I believe in my defense and my team and my coaches.  
  
Q. Pe'Shon, about Duke, you have a quick turn around and not a lot of time,
what are your thoughts about playing them for the third time this year?  
PE'SHON HOWARD: It's going to be a grind, they're a great team, great coaches,
I trust our coaches to have us prepared. They know everybody in and out of the
conference, you have to play every team twice and we're going to have to come
out be ready, lock in and grind it out.  
  
Q. Dez, how much of a motivation was it knowing you guys need probably a
couple of wins here to try to get into the NCAA Tournament?  
DEZ WELLS: We were going out and competing every night, we play to win every
game so whether we were a lock in or whether we, you know, had no chance of
being in the NCAA Tournament we were going to come out here and play our
hearts out for each other and for our coaches because in the end that's all we
have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Michael Snaer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22143)

### [Okaro White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22135)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State: 73  
Clemson: 69

  
THE MODERATOR: If we have any questions for Michael or Okaro, we can begin
with those.  
  
Q. Michael, how does it feel to win a game in the final seconds without
hitting a buzzer beater?  
MICHAEL SNAER: I guess it feels good that we could have a big enough lead that
we didn't need an amazing shot just to win the game. I didn't want that to
come to that, if it did I would be ready but I didn't want it to come to that.  
  
Q. This is the first time that both you two and Ian Miller and Terrance
Shannon have all been on the court at the same time. How did it feel to have
the "big four" back together again and the flow you had on the court?   
OKARO WHITE: Before the season we had a couple of meetings that that's what we
were trying to do, have the "Big Four" and have the productivity come out of
us four but it got halted by injuries and stuff so it was good having guys we
have been with for years out on the floor and trying to win the game for each
other.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, you can head back.  
COACH HAMILTON: First half I thought that we were overly anxious, I thought we
didn't execute well the first half. Our game plan was to move the ball and see
whether or not we could let their defense make a mistake and take advantage of
it. We had a hard time. We were all hyped up, trying to thread the needle,
took quicker shots and I attribute that to the guys, having so many guys who
had not been in this situation before, but we were fortunate to only be down 5
at the half.  
The second half I thought we executed much better, I thought our defense got
the stops we needed, the rebounds we had, I thought we played excellent
basketball there until the last 2 minutes of the game. Then it was almost like
the fouling of the 3‑point jump shooters, missing dunks, going long when
you're supposed to be cutting toward the basketball, it's like we were trying
to invent ways to give the game back to Clemson, just thank goodness they
didn't take it. I thought up to that point our guys had played a very good
second half. Unfortunately, we will be talking about the last couple of
minutes and it will probably overshadow how well Carl played and Terrence
giving us a lift and Devin gave us good leadership on the floor but
defensively we played as well there in stretches as well as we played all
year.  
  
Q. Coach, how big is it having Terrence back as far as the toughness of your
front line? Teams like, a couple times this year some of the physicality in
the league got to you but tonight ‑‑ Clemson is a physical team but it felt
like it was different, especially in the second half.   
COACH HAMILTON: There is no doubt that we have been void of the experience
that Terrence brings to our team. I think that's going to help us where the
future is concerned because our youngsters got some valuable experience and
this will accelerate their progress.  
Having Terrence back in gave us a guy who has been in the wars, been in the
system, understood‑‑ has a better understanding of the way you have to play in
the ACC in order to be successful, so I was glad to get his contribution
tonight.  
  
Q. That was the first time that you had your big four guys returning this
season together, was that the team that you envisioned heading into the
season?  
COACH HAMILTON: I didn't know exactly what to expect for the upcoming season,
when you have seven first‑year players you have to give those guys an
opportunity to earn their rightful place in the rotation. I did feel, though,
that that core of guys would be able to give us the leadership, set the
example in practice, just the conversation that upper classmen normally give
to the incoming‑‑ the new players, newcomers just to set the tone and we have
been void of that because Terrence was injured and Ian has been riding a
bicycle and shooting free‑throws in practice and it's hard to be a leader when
you're not actively participating.  
So it's been somewhat of a challenge but I do believe through all of that,
though, the fact that we have had to go through the season without the most
experienced guys being an integral part of the system has given Michael Ojo
and our three freshman guards valuable minutes. We would will have to have
been more successful this year but we still have opportunities. We can't cry
over that. Every once in a while you have those things‑‑ I call 'em basketball
demons, that raise their ugly heads and you got to fight through it.  
I think we've grown up and I think we're going to be better as a result of it
but it is nice that we were able to put experienced guys out there on the
floor. Didn't look like it the last two minutes, but before that, we were
playing smart and this is not the way we have been accustomed to playing.  
  
Q. Looking to North Carolina how did you want to play this team, run or slow
the game down?  
COACH HAMILTON: We going to play the way we always play, play within ourselves
and if you have an opportunity to run you run, if it's not there, half‑court
offense. That's the way we always play, we're not going to change, North
Carolina is not going to change, they're who they are, they have a system that
they are comfortable with, we are Florida State and we run when we have an
opportunity and try to execute if we don't have a break, run the offense. Play
good defense and take care of the ball. One thing's for sure, we need to play
a whole lot smarter than we played the last two minutes tonight. That's a
given.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Erick Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22874)

### [James Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19678)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina State: 80  
Virginia Tech: 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Virginia Tech.  
COACH JOHNSON: Tough game tonight for us. We came out‑‑ I thought we came out
ready to play. First half, six‑point game at the half. We weren't able to do
much or get much goin' in the second half, but they did a good job of going
inside, C.J. Leslie and Richard Howell. I thought the first game we had 20
offensive rebounds, they did a good job of keeping us off the glass and
limiting our second chance opportunities tonight. Gotta give them a lot of
credit. They played well.  
We didn't play well, we played well in spots but not enough.  
  
Q. Tough shooting day, Erick and you had the turn overs in the first half,
what about their defense made it tough for you and were you playing hurt
today?  
ERICK GREEN: No, I wasn't playing hurt, I'm not going to use that excuse. They
did a great job, and defense, and first half caught me off guard, I saw a lot
of double teams, staying with me off the pick‑and‑rolls, you got to give
credit to NC State, they played well and we just didn't put forty minutes
together.  
  
Q. Coach, you had the whole year to kind of self ‑evaluate. Can you talk
about the season for you personally?  
COACH JOHNSON: No, I can't self‑evaluate right now, we just lost a ballgame. I
was concerned about the team during the season, the team, the next day, the
next practice, I wasn't going to self‑evaluate during the season. We will take
time, get with the staff, talk about our program, about the team, who we have
coming back, what we need to change to get better, but we were trying to
practice and play it game by game and trying to get better.  
  
Q. Erick, did they do as good as anybody trying to keep you out of the
lane?  
ERICK GREEN: Everybody was in the gaps, when I penetrated they were right
there, even in transition I was seeing two or three players back there waiting
for me. But I knew that going in, that they were going to key on me and I
should have tried to make plays but the ball wasn't falling for me and it
happens, nights like that.  
  
Q. The dunk at the end of the game did you discuss that with the coach? Did
that bother you?  
COACH JOHNSON: No, I didn't discuss that with Coach Mark Gottfried. If that's
the way he wants his guys to play‑‑ I've never concentrated on coaching the
other guy's team, I concentrate on getting my guys to play the best basketball
they can and if that's the way he wants his team to play I got no problem with
that.  
  
Q. Erick, after the season you had, what were your expectations for today
and were you disappointed with the way you played?  
ERICK GREEN: My expectations were to come in here and make a run at it, I
didn't come in here and think about losing the first game and going home, I'm
a winner.  
Like I said in the first half‑‑ in the whole game out in transition their bigs
ran, they killed us on the glass and my expectation every game is to win, I
don't look at it the‑‑ I don't care who we play, I don't expect to lose to
anyone.  
  
Q. Late in the first half you had that 1 ‑point lead and then they made a
run on you and you had some turnovers in that run, can you talk about how
their defense got them going?   
COACH JOHNSON: We turned the basketball over during that stretch and we
weren't attacking as much as we needed to be and we were loose with the
basketball and that led to their transition baskets and that's one of the
things we talked about, not letting them get out in transition.  
They're a high octane team on offense and part of it is getting out in
transition and we wanted to not turn the ball over and we thought if we could
have them play against our set defense all night that we would be fine. The
turnovers led to transition baskets.  
  
Q. Erick, what will you take away from all this? What will you remember this
season?  
ERICK GREEN: I know it was a losing season, but I've learned a lot. I learned
how much hard work pays off, I had a great group of guys to be with, a great
coach, I wouldn't want to end my career with anybody but this guy who has been
with me since junior year in high school and it doesn't get any better than
that. Sucks it has to end and I'm going to miss college basketball, miss being
in college, hanging out with Coach and laughing and joking with these guys and
there is a lot of memories I'm going to have, I'm going to miss playing in the
Coliseum in front of the Hokie fans, I'm going to miss that a lot.  
  
Q. Erick, most of the guys who have been ACC player of the year were, All
‑American then ACC Player of the Year and then onto the NBA. More guys are in
your shoes, where Coach was criticized for bringing you on and "wasting a
scholarship." How do you look at that?   
ERICK GREEN: College is a fresh start, all of that All‑American stuff doesn't
really matter. Honestly everybody is good when you come into college. My
message to everybody is to work hard. I mean, no one ever thought I would be
where I'm at, today, and, man, it can take you a long way. Hard work and
dedication, this guy right here beside me, it can take a long way. And
definitely focus on school and ball, man, and I think ‑‑ like I say, doesn't
matter all the hype you get, it's all about hard work and dedication.  
  
Q.Coach, the game didn't reflect his entire season and the guys in the locker
room were saying they wanted him to go out on a high note. Were you
disappointed it didn't go to plan? How do you feel about the way it went down
today for Erick?  
COACH JOHNSON: He has had a great year but going into the game‑‑ we're
disappointed we lost today, the entire team, the entire coaching staff we put
too much hard work in. We worked too hard to go out like this, but we just
didn't play well tonight and N.C. State played well but as far as not having
Erick go out on top, we wanted to win the game and Erick is a winner. He's a
winner and he wanted to go out along with the rest of those guys. We didn't
come in here to have Erick play great and go home and we didn't come in here
to have Erick not play great and go home. We came here to win and try to
survive and win no matter how we had to do it, that was the plan.  
  
Q. You talked about wanting to do a good job in the paint on Richard Howell,
seemed like he was doing whatever he wanted to do. Can you talk about the
problems he posed and how tough it was to defend him?  
COACH JOHNSON: He started the first possession going inside on us and that's
been a blueprint the last few games, teams trying to go inside and they know
how much range means to this team and they know how well C.J. Barksdale has
been playing so going inside whether it's to pick up a foul on those guys or
trying get a basket. Howell he has been a load for everybody all year and he
was a great player tonight and he gave up the ball and when we forced him out
he hit the jump shot, he did it all tonight, we had no answer for him tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, Erick said you have been with him since he was a junior in high
school, how do you summarize his story as one of the greatest players in
Virginia Tech history?  
COACH JOHNSON: Summarize‑‑ first of all, he's a much better kid than he is a
basketball player. Having had a chance to coach him as the head coach and
assistant coach for three of these seasons, that's what I'm most proud of, the
type of young man he is. That carried over to our team this year and the guys
looked up to him. With the rocky season we had, those guys could have folded,
Erick could have folded and he didn't and we didn't.  
I think the guys looked to him to see how he was going to be and they looked
to me to see how I was going to be and Erick hung in there with the team and
with me and that says a lot about him. The hard work he put in, he's always
played with a chip on his shoulder. He won two state championships, and he
comes into college and no one thinks he should be a player in the ACC and he
worked his tail off‑‑ it means so much to Erick and I remember his freshman
year and looking at him on the bench and he didn't play as much as he wanted
to play and didn't play as well as he wanted to play and I remember seeing
tears in his eyes. That means that it means something to the young man. He
didn't put his head down he kept working on his game and kept working on his
game and achieved Second Team All‑League player and that wasn't good enough,
he continued to work hard and the work he put in in the off‑season and in the
summer and then all year long.  
The young man is going to graduate in May, on time, in May, and I know that's
important to Erick and that's important to his family. For me to have an
opportunity as a first‑year head coach to coach a young man like this, a
well‑rounded kid a, a great student who is going to graduate on time in Mayand
player of the year in the toughest conference in the country, I can't say
anything else about him. It's been an amazing year for him and there is no one
more deserving than him.  
  
Q. Coach, you've just lost, but thinking about next year defensively how
much did you want to change the look of this program? You talked about wanting
to extend the floor and press, is that the direction you're trying to do?  
COACH JOHNSON: It's tough to talk about that right now and coming off a loss.
But there are going to be some changes. We will have a deeper bench, some
recruits coming in, we will have a deeper bench so the program will be
evaluated, offensively and defensively and haven't had a chance to do that
yet.  
There are certain things that we want to change and we definitely need to get
better at everything.  
  
Q. Erick, can you talk about that moment when you're getting sub'd for the
very last time when it hits you, this is it, your college career is over? Talk
about going to the bench and getting hugs and cheers.  
ERICK GREEN: It was emotional, it's come to an end. I'm going to miss Coach
Johnson and this team and Hokie Nation and tears came to my eyes and it's
coming to an end and they told me four years would fly by and I didn't believe
it. It really did fly by. It hurt, walking off with a loss because like he
said I'm a winner and I've always been a winner and I was looking forward to
holding the trophy up and ending my college career as ACC Championships, but I
got the hugs from my teammates and walked off with Coach, it sucked, man,
because I didn't want my college career to end like this.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of lost in the discussion today, it was a terrific game that
Jarell Eddie had today and talk about that.  
COACH JOHNSON: I think Jarell, he made shots today. This is a game that he
didn't play a lot of minutes the last time we played him and all year long he
has been up and down, but he came out today ready to play and he had some
shots in the first half and into the second half, so definitely encouraging
for Jarell Eddie and for the team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Marcus Georges-Hunt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24992)

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Boston College: 84  
Georgia Tech: 64

  
THE MODEATOR: Pleased to welcome to the podium Georgia Tech head coach Brian
Gregory as well as student athlete Marcus Georges‑Hunt. Coach?  
COACH GREGORY: Give Boston College a lot of credit. They're a team that in our
league in the 18 games have played nine close games, one or two‑possession
games, 3 points or less and they won three of them out of the nine so won
total of seven games in the league and the record could be different.  
Both teams rely on freshmen not just to help the team but in sometimes carry
it. Today their freshmen was probably the freshmen of the year in the league
and well deserving of that and he played extremely well.  
I think they're a team over the last four or five weeks has played as well as
maybe just about anybody in the league and so we just didn't play well in the
last 24, 25 minutes of the game which is unfortunate. Something we got to keep
growing from and learning from because that's been a challenge for us is to be
able to compete at the level in this league for forty minutes. We have made
strides, but obviously we're not there yet and we did a lot of good things
this year. The next step from going to‑‑ being competitive and good to the‑‑
the next step is a hard one. We have a lot of work to do.  
  
Q. Brian, BC did a good job of moving the ball, having you chase the ball
and that got Olivier Halan going by getting that open shot.  
COACH GREGORY: Well, you know, we had done a really good job on him, that
steal he got on the outlet and the "and one" got him going a little bit and we
lost him a couple of times. One of the things they make you do is they make
you concentrate and focus defensively the entire possession.  
We can't relax, you can't lose sight of your man you can't get too deep in
your help and we did that a couple of times. They didn't shoot the ball well,
I thought our defense in the first twelve minutes was as good as it's been all
year long and unfortunately one of the challenges we have is the ability to
maintain and sustain that effort.  
I thought we got away a little bit from what we needed to do when we got that
lead, and I think young players have a tendency when you get a lead like that
to think that everything is going to be easy.  
We took some quick shots, questionable shots, we had some questionable
possessions, which led to some easy baskets for them. And when you're playing
in an elimination game those things come back to get and you that's what
happened this afternoon.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at this particular contest, the way that it started
out and the way that it finished, what are some positives you take out of this
game that will help you, should there be postseason for you?  
COACH GREGORY: Well, again, I always‑‑ the biggest thing right now and where
we are in the program is the effort and the energy that you're given. Are you
making progress in some other tangible areas? We had 24 offensive rebounds,
you know, so, again, we had guys that were playing with dead feet. That number
ticks me off because that's the highest number we had all year on the
offensive glass and we should be a good offensive rebounding team. We're not
consistent in that, today all of the sudden we had guys that were challenged a
little bit to get to the glass and Marcus did a great job with seven offensive
rebounds, I said he could be one of the best offensive rebounders in the
league from that perimeter spot.  
So that is a scenario that hopefully down the road we will be known more and
we showed we can do that today so for me out of everything that's the
brightest spot. I like the way we came out and our focus early but
unfortunately one of our Achilles heel's this entire year and sometimes it
happens when you have younger guys or older guys that vent had a lot of
success is the ability to maintain the focus and the level of concentration
and the competitiveness that you need to be successful.  
  
Q. Brian, you made your first three three's, and Robert Carter took one and
Solomon Poole, Junior took one and you're back in the game. Is that what you
mean ‑‑  
COACH GREGORY: I thought the shots Robert took were within the offensive flow
and he's done a good job and that's one of the things we have taken advantage
of on some teams is being able to stretch with Robert.  
The one by Solomon Poole was an atrocious shot and he's too young to
understand that yet, and he will. Our guys know that they have the freedom to
be aggressive and make shots, Marcus took six three‑pointers, I thought every
single one of them was good. There is a time and a flow of the offense that
you need to understand and I think after that first half went buy‑‑ it wasn't
always the three, it was sometimes shots inside the three. We, at times, lack
a great moxy of understanding what is needed at that particular time. We got
to get better at that.  
  
Q. Marcus, do you feel like you guys started pressing in the second half
offensively and felt like you had to keep up with momentum and that took you
out of your game? Seems like the offensive rhythm wasn't there and you guys
couldn't get clean shots.  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: I felt that, yeah, we tried to keep up with them, a lot
of rushed shots, couldn't crash the boards and they were running.  
I feel like, you know, we tried to play to their potential and keep up running
with them and I think that's where we, you know, bumped heads.  
  
Q. You talked about wanting the team to be more aggressive on the offensive
end and it seemed like in the beginning of the game some of the guys like
Chris and Mfon were aggressive going to the hole and that got you started.  
COACH GREGORY: Well, yeah, aggressive in that they're going to rally, and we
were able to kick the ball out, got a couple of baskets inside off that as
well.  
That goes with the last question. That's when you need that steady influence
on the offensive end, so you don't panic and so forth. That has to be done on
the court a lot of times. It can become‑‑ again, it can come from different
positions and different guys. It comes from a freshmen from Boston College in
Rahon. Those guys are in their stuff every single time against pressure, no
pressure, whatever the case might be.  
He's a good enough player to make open shots and do different things, not an
imposing kid. He's in control and everybody knows that out there, and give him
credit as a freshman to be able to do that. As we take another step, we need
to‑‑ guys are going to have to step up into that role.  
  
Q. Marcus, your Coach was talk about what happened after I got to 15 ‑0 and
I'm curious what it felt like on the court, focus, intensity, those things?   
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: Felt like the game is not over, we need to keep doing
what we were doing, talking defense, rebounding, running, but they started
hitting shots. I guess, you know, we were losing it. We lost a little when we
started to speed up our game and get out of our game.  
  
Q. Tell me what it was like watching Olivier Halan make everything he was
taking. Seemed like you guys were doing well defending him but he was making
whatever he took.  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: He's a great player. On defense we were scrambling a lot
and he had a lot of open shots and he knocked 'em down. He's a great player,
he's a great shooter, too.  
I wasn't surprised for him to hit the shot because I know what his potential‑‑
I knew he could knock down open shots, we just needed to find him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very  
much.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

### [Olivier Hanlan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24978)

### [Joe Rahon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24977)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Boston College: 84  
Georgia Tech: 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Boston College head coach, Steve
Donahue as well as student athletes, Olivier's Hanlan and Joe Rahon, Coach?  
COACH DONAHUE: Thanks. I thought it was an interesting game to say the least.
I don't think I have had too many of those where you fall down by 15 before
the first time‑out. I think the good thing is it happened to quickly, I think
it woke us up understanding getting through the nerves of the tournament, we
got rid of that in the first four minutes.  
We have been through a great deal this year with a lot of adversity, times
where we didn't play well and we came back and I think that's what we relied
on at that point.  
  
Q. Olivier Hanlan, are you aware, coach or players during the course of the
game of any of those types of records, are you aware of it at all? He broke
the freshman scoring record.  
COACH DONAHUE: I had no idea.  
OLIVER HANLAN: I had no idea at all.  
COACH DONAHUE: With all due respect to the scoring record it's not anything we
care about. It's nothing I talk about. These two have had an incredible season
and it's all about our team and I would never want to take something like a
record that an individual does is more important than what we do and I would
never put it ahead of the team, I'm sure Joe and Olivier feel the same.  
  
Q. Olivier's Hanlan, can you talk about the steal on the in bounds, and how
that got you going, and how big was that?  
OLIVER HANLAN: Before that play Coach told me to play aggressive on that
president because I got the same steal last time at home and I got it and
finished and it gave us more energy to get another stop after that.  
COACH DONAHUE: I thought the press was good to us today and I thought we were
tentative at first and one of my assistants actually mentioned that they're
beating it by getting it out quick and "O" and I spoke about getting up there
and making him back dribble and it was bang‑bang, we score, we steal, we
score, and all of the sudden the momentum is going our way.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the first time the team has advanced since 2007 into the
quarter ‑finals, talk about what it means to the program, biggest winning
streak, a lot of momentum and good things happen.   
COACH DONAHUE: Well, I don't want to call on you that but we came to the
quarters my first year here, too. I know you do your home work.  
  
Q. I try my best!  
COACH DONAHUE: I know! It's a big deal, both these guys know. We have had our
times where we questioned how good we were with the incredible amount of
youth. I don't think there is a team in the country that starts and plays by
rotating freshmen and sophomores, we have no juniors or seniors, necessarily
in the rotation and I give these guys credit because to play 35, 36 minutes a
game in this league as freshmen without senior and junior leadership just
speaks volumes of how far they've come, so to be advanced and one of the eight
teams left it's a big deal in a quality league like this, no doubt.  
  
Q. Coach, based on your last answer I guess I can guess the answer to this
but the record for scoring in a game was 45 and it was set 56 years ago, do
you have any temptations to leave Olivier's Hanlan in any longer?  
COACH DONAHUE: Who was that?  
  
Q. Lennie Rosenbluth.  
COACH DONAHUE: I had no idea‑‑ we were just locked in, I had no idea if one
guy was making 'em or what, but the funny part about 8 for 10, I think he
missed his first two and I think I said something like "you gotta take that,"
and both of these guys I've harped on them all year about taking the three.
That's gotta be a weapon that we use and both of them over the last month have
utilized that and I think they sense if he's not making shots we can keep him
out of the lane and he made him pay for that.  
  
Q. Olivier's Hanlan you start 2 for 6 and make your last 12. What were you
thinking on that last shot that went around the rim off the backboard and
found its way in which gave you the 41?  
OLIVER HANLAN: It was a lucky shot, I was lucky enough to have Ryan give me a
beautiful pass. My last 12 shots were not really tough but my teammates were
finding me in spots and I was trying to move around the wing because they were
guarding me well so I was trying to spot up and get my feet and not miss the
shots.  
  
Q. Joe, even if you're not aware of the exact numbers you got to have a feel
that Olivier is making everything he fires up there, when you have way guy
doing that do you try to get him the ball?  
JOE RAHON: Absolutely. Olivier has done a great job, second leading scorer
behind Ryan and today he was putting on a show. As a player on the court you
try not to get caught up in it and you try to keep playing and doing your best
but there is no doubt whenever you're penetrating you're looking at wherever
his defender is at, and he has it going, it's going to more than likely go in.  
There was no doubt I was trying to get him the ball and he was doing a great
job of moving without the ball and he put 'em in, it was a great performance.  
  
Q. "O" you get another shot at Miami, especially after that first game at
home with the free‑throws, do you take the excitement into the fact that you
get another opportunity to beat them?   
OLIVER HANLAN: It's another challenge for me, and we could have got the win
but we will rest up tonight and bounce back tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys have been in situations and it's different falling down 15
points given a 5 ‑minute head start, where were you at that point and how did
you dig yourselves out of that?   
OLIVER HANLAN: We have been in so many unique situations this year, recently
we played and we were down 10 with 10 to go and we came in after a time‑out
and Coach gave us confidence to get going because we knew we could come back
and we said being down 15 with 35 minutes to go is much easier than being down
10 with 10 to go so that loosened us up a little bit and it made us get going
and you have no choice but to start playing basketball when you're down 15 in
an ACC Tournament so it helped us turn it on and we will be ready tomorrow.  
  
Q. Having played Miami twice already what is there to do to prepare for them
tomorrow?  
COACH DONAHUE: Obviously it's not anything physically that you can do. They
present so many issues on the offensive end and defense, just their age and
experience. I think the physicality is the first thing, they have big bodies,
we've talked about it all the time, most of the times in this league have
physical attributes over us so we've got to be playing the way we play, move
the basketball, make them chase you, utilize the three. Pushing the
transition, all those things still apply. On the defense we have gotten better
at that, there is no way you can guard and we're buying into it more and more
but that's a team that‑‑ Shane is running the team and everybody else playing
off of him so it's a heck of a test, there is no doubt.  
  
Q. Steve, for a lot of ACC fans this is their first realization of the
player that Olivier's Hanlan is. Can you talk about what you saw in him on the
recruiting trail and whether you thought he could be this good this early?  
COACH DONAHUE: We have known "O" for quite a few years through a guy named
Dave Smart a guy at Carlton University who just won his ninth national
championship in Canada, and he ran a great program. I think he's probably the
first guy we looked at from Canada. I think he got underrecruited a little
bit. He did get offers when it went down, but I think he's not a freaky‑type
athlete, necessarily but he's a good athlete, and he's extremely smart and I
think those are the things that drew us toward him.  
I had no idea‑‑ and I say this to a lot of recruits now, I don't know when you
get guys like these two on campus, are they going to be hard workers, everyone
says they are but are they going to be dedicated to the game? Both of these
guys from day one in the gym watching film, understand it. Two, are they
coachable, willing to hear criticism? Willing to say, you know what? We've got
to share it better there, both of these guys are selfless in that manner and I
think Olivier obviously with all the work he's put in it's coming to the top
at this point.  
  
Q. Steve, Georgia Tech plays better defense, you must have been satisfied
with the way your offense was functioning getting shots against them?  
COACH DONAHUE: Extremely. I think Brian is as good of a coach as there is in
the league. I think the two of us are playing the best basketball in this
league right now. Over the last 10 games and the way they played and we
played. I thought it was a hard match‑up because we beat 'em and I think
they're good. These young players are good, his veterans played well and I
think we did some things offensively moving the basketball that you have to
do. A guy like Ryan Anderson is not up here but to be honest we go through him
and a lot of times it's a hockey assist, it leads to something else but if we
don't have a kid like him sharing it I don't think these guys get shots and no
one gets shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very  
much.

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Devin Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25010)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Maryland: 75  
Wake Forest: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Wake Forest and Coach Jeff Bzdelik.  
JEFF BZDELIK: I'm extremely proud of my basketball team and their effort, it
was 54‑54 with 9 minutes and whatever seconds left and what we did in the
first half to have a lead we didn't do in the second half. Second half we
turned the ball over, I believe, nine times and they were bad turnovers,
unlike the first half, where we turned the ball over five times and we were
more efficient in the first half, giving ourselves a chance. We coupled that
with missing free‑throws and the game got away from us there. Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, curious, just to get your thoughts on what Maryland did in the
second half defensively especially in that 8.5 minute drought without a field
goal.  
JEFF BZDELIK: They were up and into us, we knew they would be. I thought we
were just a little careless and just not real sharp offensively. Nothing
special. Some of those turnovers were self‑inflicted, just being careless with
the ball, loose with the ball, not running through passes.  
I thought we tried to force a little bit too much on the break, we got stops
defensively and then we turned it over unnecessarily on the break, not making
good decisions, trying to just force the action too much, instead of just
pulling it out and playing off two feet and making short passes, and we wasted
some valuable possessions there. When we had opportunity on the break, that's
where their defense was set up.  
  
Q. Jeff, C.J. Harris, your scholarship senior, he leaves without having an
ACC Tournament victory, how disappointing is it to have a guy who has been
here so long and not able to come away with an ACC Tournament win?  
JEFF BZDELIK: We're disappointed for him. He's a terrific young man. He has
really just been a great role model for our young players. He represents Wake
Forest the way we want it to be represented. And we were disappointed for him.  
  
Q. How much did Maryland's defense and taking away C.J. disrupt the flow of
the offense in the second half? He didn't hit a field goal and how much does
that disrupt what you guys wanted to do on the offensive end and allow
Maryland to transition from their defense to their offense?  
DEVIN THOMAS: I think we got C.J. where we wanted him to get the ball, we were
careless with the passes and the fast break and we turned the ball over nine
times and those led to fast breaks and when you do that you can't really win
the game.  
  
Q. Devin can you talk about the disappointment in your first ACC
Tournament?  
JEFF BZDELIK: It's disappointing, it's sad for us and for the Wake Forest, for
C.J. not to get a win in tournament play, and for us freshmen that were
experiencing it for the first time.  
We need to stay humble and hungry in the off season.  
  
Q. Coach, as the game wound down there were two Wake fans behind you, one
screaming at you and the other defending you. What is your message right now
to a frustrated fan base?  
JEFF BZDELIK: That this foundation that we've built is rock solid, with
terrific young men and terrific young players and that there is a bright
future. You know, we have beaten four out of the top six teams in this league.
We've lost in numerous close games. As these young men grow up, get bigger and
stronger, they're going to turn those close losses into great wins. They
really are.  
We played well for a good portion of today, but the game got away from us,
especially in those final nine minutes. It's a learning experience. There is a
great majority of the fans that we hear from that are very, very supportive,
it's been reflected in the attendance at our home games and they're behind
these young men. These young men are committed to Wake Forest, they're
committed to working hard and there is a bright future, the right way.  
  
Q. Devin, I think it was a 1 ‑point game or so when Alex Len went out and
that's where they took control. What happened there?   
DEVIN THOMAS: Like I said before, fast break points, off of rebounds,
free‑throw shot rebound, outlet pass. We did a great job stopping Dez Wells in
the first half, in transition, and most of his points were all jump shots. We
would live with that because he isn't a good jump shooter, except for today,
but normally he likes going to the rack, and we weren't going to allow him to
go 11 for 12 from the rack again.  
I think we did a great job on the rebounding and I think we lost by 4 but they
didn't get a lot of offensive rebounds. So what it comes down to is missed
free‑throws and turnovers in the second half because we were controlling the
game in the first half.  
  
Q. You guys talked about careless turnovers, nine of them in the second
half. What can realistically ‑‑ what can you guys do in games when they're
starting to put a stop to that and prevent them from continue and go it having
a snowball affect?   
JEFF BZDELIK: You have to be strong with the basketball. We were in the first
half, we have been at times throughout the course of this year, so much of
this came is from the neck up. There were many times on the break that we just
simply left our feet and tried to make a circus pass instead of a solid pass.
Just have to be rock solid in your fundamentals, catching, passing, playing
off 2 feet. Just hitting guys, throwing the ball to someone who is wearing a
Wake Forest Jersey, it's that simple.  
It might sound corny to you but it's interesting in a conversation with Coach
Bob Knight one time he said "I tell my guys to throw it to the guy wearing the
same Jersey as you are" and it's that simple. We were leaving our feet, trying
to make circus plays.  
  
Q. Coach, there was an article about ‑‑ (Away from mic.)  
JEFF BZDELIK: First of all, I don't read the newspapers or the internet and
that's the truth, and I don't watch sports on TV except for games that I need
to watch so I've never seen anything, have no clue about what's being said, I
don't worry about things I don't have any control over. I just do my job and
what I know is this: We have built a really strong foundation without
compromising any values or integrity at Wake Forest University and there is a
very bright future.  
  
Q. Jeff, would you discuss your reasons for starting Codi after mentioning
that you were going to start someone else?  
JEFF BZDELIK: Just that Codi has been starting games and he had strep throat
and couldn't make the trip and Virginia Tech game he hadn't practiced much and
I started Madison. They both played extremely well. Again, we have such a
great group of young guys that they understood and I'm not going to have a
young man lose his starting position just because he got sick. It's about
playing well when you're in there. They have all bought into that.  
  
Q. We've seen this team play very well at times in the season, beat No. 2 in
the country, N.C. State in a big game and then we have seen this team play
games where they didn't perform so well so when you get down to stats it's
like splitting hairs in this conference. What can you do between now and next
year to close out games and get the victories that were so close to getting
throughout the season and grow into the team with the foundation that you say
you've built?  
DEVIN THOMAS: Like Coach says, just from the neck up it's the mind‑set, half
of it's in your mind. When we are at home we have a different mind‑set than
when we are on the road.  
I think next year we will be more comfortable getting to play everywhere, get
to go experience every gym in the ACC and understanding Coach's offense a lot
better and we will be a lot better understanding the game more and it will
slow down for us.  
JEFF BZDELIK: Just to echo what Devin said, yes, we have been inconsistent, no
doubt about it. We need to get stronger, physically, we need to, as Devin said
so well, the game will slow down for them and understanding defensive
positioning, understanding how to defend offensive situations better.  
We have to understand the importance of blocking out on every play, being ball
strong. We need to get in the gym and really get up lots and lots of shots to
be a better shooting team, be a better passing team, and we're going to get to
work on that.  
We'll have a meeting Monday and plan the spring and summer and fall and we're
going to go to work and next Octoberis about seven months away. They will be
bigger, stronger, wiser, grittier, tougher and they will be more together.
That's the process when you have a young basketball team like we have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State: 73  
Clemson: 69

  
COACH BROWNELL: Same situation the last month of the season, we play well for
a good period of the game and then the game gets away from us.  
Proud of the way our guys fought back, we seem to do that to give the guys a
chance but credit Florida state they made the free‑throws they need to do make
and advanced.  
  
Q. Coach, how frustrating was it for you playing so many games and it's not
like you guys were getting blowin out. You're fighting night in and night out
‑‑  
COACH BROWNELL: It's difficult. You know, it's very difficult. Obviously the
fact that our guys are competing helps because we're going to practice every
day and working at it and really trying. We have some deficiencies that we
have to improve. Until we do that this is going to be the outcome. Felt bad
for our seniors, but we've seen this so many times this year if you followed
our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Brad, you were down is 71 ‑69 you had a time out left, you chose not to
use it after that basket. Could you talk about your thinking there?   
COACH BROWNELL: I wanted to save it for later.  
  
Q. Talk about moving forward from this point. Where do you go with
recruiting and how do you try to rebound from this season?  
COACH BROWNELL: We have a scholarship left, we're going to get out on the road
as quick as possible and try and fill that and the guys we have coming back
we've got to work to get 'em better, simple as that. We need to get in the gym
and improve our offensive skills so we can make more plays, finish plays,
become a better offensive team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Lorenzo Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23533)

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [C.J. Leslie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23535)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina State: 80  
Virginia Tech: 63

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think the first thought that comes to my mind is
defensively I thought we did a good job today, we did a good job on Erick
Green and I thought Lorenzo was terrific in his one‑on‑one defense with Green,
I thought we did a much better job of helping him than we did the first time
we played Virginia Tech, but Lorenzo Brown made up his mind he was going to do
a good job and I thought he did and I thought our team's defense was better.
We were active, quick, rotated better, so I thought that was probably the key
to the game.  
  
Q. Lorenzo could you talk about your defense on Green and what helped you
hold hip down and Coach, Richard Howell's performance, what helped him do well
today?  
LORENZO BROWN: I basically fed off the energy of my teammates, they did a
great job of helping me on the screen and driving, they did a good job, just a
good job tonight.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought Richard was, as he always is for us, he's
Mr.Reliable, dependable, he's there every night, he rebounds, he scored well
in the first half, continued that in the second half.  
I thought his rebound and go defense, he just one of them guys, the same every
day. He's a big key for what we were able to do today.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, seemed like your goal was to keep Erick out of the lane. Was
that the key today?  
LORENZO BROWN: Most definitely he's the go to guy and he makes the decisions
on their team and C.J. and Richard, we played as a team.  
  
Q. Beginning of the season and playing on the first day here, is this a
fresh start in the postseason, kinda just getting all that other stuff out?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think everybody in our camp wishes we would have won more
in the regular season, no question, sitting here with 23 win and 11 league
wins now 12 if you count this and that's good but for us it wasn't good
enough. It's all about how you finish. We need to finish well and our guys
want to finish well. That's important to them. So whether it's a fresh start
or not I don't know that we look at it like that, we talk about it all year
long, being at your best at the end of the year and that's what we need to be
is at our best now.  
  
Q. C.J., in the last Virginia game, from looking at the numbers you had a
good game up there in Charlottesville. What do you remember about that game
and what are you expecting for tomorrow?  
C.J. LESLIE: I don't remember too much, I was kinda sick, but one of the
things I do is that we didn't play great defense you know for forty minutes,
we didn't get it done defensively‑‑  
  
COACH GOTTFRIED: We were at Virginia, Calvin didn't practice the day before,
he didn't come to shootaround, I wasn't sure he was going to play, but he
fought through it and played and he was under the weather and Lorenzo sprained
his ankle about the 9‑minute mark so that was a tough day for us.  
  
Q. Given what you guys hope to accomplish this week, how important was it to
come out here and take care of business and have a game that you didn't have
to get pressed to the end?  
LORENZO BROWN: I felt like this was going to be our toughest game, they sent
us to overtime at our place and we did pretty well at home this year and just
trying to stop Erick would be the main thing and he's a great player. We did a
good job on that.  
C.J. LESLIE: I'm looking at it that game is in the past, we're no longer
focused on that game ear on to the next one, so we have to do what we need to
do against Virginia.  
  
Q. Mark, Lorenzo didn't score a ton but defense and passing, is that as good
as he's been this year?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: He's been good on a lot of nights but playing against a guy
like Erick Green, the nation's leading scorer, that's going to take energy and
he spent energy doing that defensively. He ended up with 12 assists and I
think Lorenzo is the kind of player that if he felt he needed to score or our
team needs that he can do that more, but today his focus was defensively and I
thought he had a heck of a game, I don't know if it was his best but great
defensively and distributed the ball well, 12 assists, pretty good afternoon.  
  
Q. Coach, they hung with you for a good part of the first half, second half
you were able to finish them off. What did you do well in the second half?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought our pressure defensively initiated our
opportunities in the break. When we got our pressure up and we were deflecting
passes and we were disrupting them, it enabled us to run our fast break more
which I thought was the key.  
Once we got out into the open floor we were able to separate from them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We have North Carolina basketball Coach Roy Williams.  
Roy, how has the off‑season been for you?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It was a wild summer, there's no question about that. I didn't
enjoy most of it. But also there were times with my family, with my grandsons
that I did love. Times I was with my team I did love. The other stuff has
gotten all the attention, though.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Last year you played an extremely young team. You went through some
growing pains. What did that group learn that is going to help you this
year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think they understand now much better how to handle
adversity. You start losing guys, I think we lost 12 guys early to the NBA
draft in the last eight or nine years, but I think those kids understand that
part of it. They kept practicing and working every day. Things got better at
the end. Hopefully they'll have it stick‑to‑itiveness. Hopefully they'll have
that, if that's that word.  
  
Q. Your thoughts about adding Jim Boeheim to the mix. Is he the most or
least popular guy here?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I like having Jimmy here. He's one of the few guys in college
basketball coaching older than me.  
Jimmy and I played a lot of golf together, been on a lot of committees
together. A really good friend. Unfortunately for me, I was one of his biggest
moments in 2003 when they beat our Kansas team to win his national
championship.  
I love having him in the league. I think North Carolina playing Syracuse the
first day is going to be a big game, a big rivalry. We're not going to have to
wait 10 or 15 years to build anything up.  
I think Jimmy is well‑liked right now. 20 years ago it was a whole different
thing. He's mellowed so much, he's doing a lot better right now. I've been
with him on the golf course and really enjoy him.  
  
Q. What is status of P.J. Hairston? Do you expect him to miss games?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm not a huge NFL fan, but I love Bill Belichick's comment.
He's inactive. He's inactive. He's inactive. One of the coolest press
conferences I've ever seen.  
P.J. is going to miss some games. I'm not going to go into the locker room and
say, P.J. you're not playing tonight. We'll let people know about it before.  
There's several things he's going through at this time, has completed some and
has not completed some of the others. He's done enough to come back to
practice. He's been sensational in practice. He was sensational in the running
program, the most difficult conditioning thing I've ever done with any player.
Hopefully he'll continue that as we play.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What is the timeframe for making a decision?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Like I said, he's still doing things. When he gets through
taking care of his business.  
  
Q. Reggie did so many things so well for you last year. How do you replace
what you lost with him?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It is really hard. Not only was he a shooter, he had a
tremendous assist‑to‑error ratio. He was a great rebounder from his position.
He was a very good defensive player. You don't just replace that guy with that
many good qualities with somebody who has never played at the collegiate
level.  
Leslie has to be a better defender. J.P. has to not turn the ball over. We're
going to get guys to play to their strengths, stay away from their weaknesses.  
Losing Reggie Bullock was a tremendous loss for us. Last year at this time I
would not have thought he was going to leave. At the end of the season I
didn't think he was going to leave. He was on the borderline between being a
number one pick or second‑round pick.  
But it worked out great for him. He worked his tail off in the workouts. He
was the 26th selection for the Clippers. Happy for him, but big shoes left for
us to fill.  
  
Q. With the addition of Syracuse and Pitt and Notre Dame, Louisville next
year, some of the previous coaches here today have said this has the potential
to be the best conference from a basketball perspective ever created. Your
thoughts on what this conference can be.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I agree. I think not only can be, I think it will be the
greatest basketball conference ever. Look at the depth of the league. We can't
call it Tobacco Road anymore unless we include South Bend, Syracuse and
Pittsburgh. The road got longer and tougher.  
Every game night, oh man, oh man, you better strap it on.  
  
Q. You mentioned how many players you lost early. Would you like there to be
a rule change similar to baseball where players had to stay two, three years,
whatever?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I honestly believe this. There is no rule that's perfect for
everybody. I think LeBron, Kobe, Kevin Garnett, they made great decisions.
Some made decisions that was not great for them. I don't think there's any one
rule that's perfect for everybody.  
I would like to figure out myself what that rule would be, then try to get
everybody to go along with it.  
We have lost guys early. I don't think the baseball rule is perfect. You can
ask the baseball coaches, they would tell you, Oh, my gosh, you don't want
that.  
The one‑and‑done is what we have now. If they change it to two years, I'd
probably like that a little bit better. We'll have to work with that. I don't
think there's any rule that's perfect for everybody.  
  
Q. Could you see Marcus Paige and Nate Britt on the court together?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yes. We've done that in practice already. Luke Davis would be
in that mix. I don't think you would see Luke, Marc and Nate, all three at the
same time. It would be like a team of jockeys out there running around on the
court we'd be so small. I do believe we'll see two of them at a time.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We had Brice Johnson in here earlier talking about how he's
eating.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't care how much he eats, I just want him to be stronger.
It's difficult for Brice to gain weight. Difficult for Marcus Paige. Difficult
for Kennedy to lose the weight. You have to put them all together.  
Both those guys that I mentioned there, it's really helped Kennedy. Kennedy
has dropped quite a few pounds, from 317 to 285 since he came to see us this
summer. Brice has gotten up a little bit. That's helped him on the post area,
rebounding. Marcus played last year at 154. This year he's gotten up to 170.
No doubt the strength has helped him, too.  
  
Q. Kennedy Meeks, you talked about how he's lost the weight. What kind of
player do you think you see him becoming? Is there a player that was there
before that he resembles?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I hope it is. I hope it's Sean May, he was pretty good.  
Kennedy was too heavy, has worked really hard, has done a nice job, has great
feet, maybe as good a passing big man as I ever coached. Just got to get him
to build his stamina up, explosiveness. It's going to be a marathon.  
With Joel James, Kennedy, I gave them the same saying, Rome wasn't built in a
day. They tell me back, But it was worked on every day.  
Really nice man from right here in Charlotte.  
  
Q. Having Coach Boeheim, what can you say about having him in the
conference?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I did say it. One of the lines I like, I'll give it to
you, too, it's one guy in the league older than I am.  
Jimmy and I have played a lot of golf together, been on committees together,
coached against each other. We worked with USA Basketball on select teams.
He's a guy I really enjoy. Hall of Fame coach. Tremendous, tremendous job on
the bench. Very long, long career. Won over 900 games. I think we're fortunate
to have him in the league.  
I made a $5 bet with somebody two years ago that he would never coach a game
in the ACC. It's been so long ago I can't remember who the bet was with. I owe
somebody $5. I know it wasn't one of you rascals.  
  
Q. Who are you counting on to step up and be leaders?  
COACH WILLIAMS: This summer I made decisions, I told them who the leaders
were. It's easy to be a great leader if you don't make mistakes. That's James
Michael and Marcus Paige don't make the kind of mistakes that were made. If
they make a mistake, it's a mistake, it won't happen very often with either
one of those kids. I declared them as the leaders of our team.  
But on the court, the players do it themselves. The respect they have for each
other trumps everything that a coach can say.  
Marcus and James are going to decide whether we eat at Wendy's or Burger Chef.
On the court, your play does it. Marcus Paige is a point guard, that's a
leadership role because of the position. James Michael has been important to
us for three years.  
The other guys have to understand that.  
  
Q. Commissioner Swofford said that the ACC tournament should end up in New
York at some point. Would you be in favor of that? Would it improve the status
of the ACC?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we've done a pretty doggone good job of moving it
around. North Carolina has been the foundation of the ACC for a long time, the
state, whether it's Charlotte or Greensboro for the tournament. Those people
have done a marvelous job.  
In Greensboro, for example, it's the biggest thing going. The whole town knows
about it. I love that.  
Also we've been in Washington, D.C., Tampa, Greensboro, Charlotte, Atlanta.
We've moved it around a little bit. I hope we keep doing that. I think New
York will be a fantastic place for it, but I also hope people don't forget
about the foundation we have here.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck to the Tar Heels this season.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Maryland head Coach Mark Turgeon.  
I have a question from Twitter. Is it true you made Jake Layman cut his hair?
If so, why?  
COACH TURGEON: It's not true. He does have a haircut. I think his mom and dad
made him cut it. That's the second question I've had on his hair today.  
JEFF FISCHEL: It had its own Twitter handle last year.  
COACH TURGEON: He told me when he came back with his haircut that it was the
new Jake. He's trying to do more things right on and off the floor.  
I like his haircut. Makes him look like a kid again.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I've heard a total transformation as a player as well.  
COACH TURGEON: He's playing well. He has his confidence. Transformation as a
student, too. He's doing better in the classroom, which is important to me and
his parents.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's talk about this season and what your expectations are big
picture.  
COACH TURGEON: Our expectations are pretty high. First year it was new to me,
only had a few players. Last year we had a bunch of new players, trying to
teach them the system. This year kind of feels like the way it's supposed to
feel. We have a lot of good players. We can go big, small. We have added some
good pieces.  
We're much further along than we've been. We were able to go on a tour this
summer, that really helped us. The maturity level is at a different level from
last year. I think we lost a lot of games because we were so young and
immature. That's changed.  
Our leadership is better. We're going to miss the big fella, Alex, in the
middle. He did a lot for us, defensively especially. But we have a lot of good
players.  
Across the board, the pieces fit. We're excited about this team.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I know Dez last year, you had to figure out how to make him fit
into the puzzle. He was starting to take leadership for this team.  
COACH TURGEON: That's where he's really improved. He's really worked hard on
the leadership part. He's become a phenomenal leader for our team. Him and
Nick Faust and even Smotrycz feed off each other, three juniors. Don't have a
senior I recruited. John Auslander is a senior for us. We're still somewhat
young.  
Those three guys fit off each other. Dez Wells has been more of a vocal leader
in practice we Evan. Dez works, he's hungry, wants to be part of something
special.  
He had a great spring, a great summer. He's had a great fall so far. Hopefully
he'll have a great winter.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. Being the last year in the league this year, any extra motivation to want
to go out with a bang?  
COACH TURGEON: We haven't talked about that a lot yet because we're just
trying to get through practice. We have non‑conference.  
But there's no doubt in our mind that the success we've had in the ACC over
the last 60 years, we've had a lot of individual players that have gone on and
had great careers, great careers at Maryland. I've had some really good
coaches in Lefty and Gary. We've had some really good teams, ACC league
champions, tournament champions, national champions.  
We know we have a responsibility our last year to represent Maryland in the
ACC. Means a lot to us, to our players. I'm hoping it gives us extra
motivation. I hope it allows us to win a couple more games knowing this is the
last time we're going to play at this building, play this team in the ACC.
Hopefully that will give us motivation and hopefully sneak out a few more wins
because of it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Talking to the guys this morning, they had the sense that
wherever you traveled, the crowd was going to be extra fired up about playing
Maryland. It's not a focus for you. It becomes part of the reality you are
dealing with.  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah. The road's never easy. I think the best way to handle the
road is just play well. If we lost, we usually heard ACC chants last year. If
we won, you didn't hear 'em.  
They didn't make the decision, but our kids know what lies ahead. But the road
is tough. The better team we are, the more hostile the road crowd is going to
be.  
That's fun. There's nothing better than being on the road and playing in front
of hostile crowds. We look forward to that.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How pumped are you and the players to do Maryland Madness?  
COACH TURGEON: Not as pumped as the fans are, but we're pumped. It was a great
idea. Our players will be excited when they see a full house. To me it was a
no‑brainer. I hope this leads to us doing some more things down the road in
Cole Arena. It's going to be a fun night, there's no doubt about it. I just
hope it's filled to the rafters.  
I've heard from a lot of former students and players how excited they are
about it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: No doubt Maryland fans get fired up in a tent. That has to be
fun. Wherever you're playing, Friday night or home games, that crowd is always
there.  
COACH TURGEON: They are. Our student body has been great. We have to do a
better job filling the seats most nights. In the ACC we have great crowds.
Hopefully we can have better crowds this year because our team is better.  
We scheduled better this year. Our home games are much better non‑conference.
Hopefully that will put more people in the stands.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Are turnovers still a concern with this team?  
COACH TURGEON: Turnovers and decision making, shot selection is a main
concern. We've gotten better. We've worked hard at it. Actually stole a drill
from Jim Larranaga that I think has helped with our turnovers in practice.
Can't do the same drill in the game. It's helped us. Our guys have been more
conscious of taking care of the basketball.  
Another concern of mine would be defensively without the big fella Alex there.
He covered up a lot of our mistakes. Individually we have to get better.  
Our two best defenders are gone, Pe'Shon Howard and Alex Len, so guys have to
step up.  
JEFF FISCHEL: When you had a ball handler you could trust, it was Pe'Shon. Who
will step up?  
COACH TURGEON: Seth Allen got better as the year went on. Roddy Peters will be
in at the point guard, too. They're both good players. They're both very good
on the break. They both need to get better in the halfcourt as far as running
our team.  
But we had turnovers. Nick Faust had turnovers. Dez Wells led us in turnovers
at the three spot. Jake Layman turned the ball over. Charles Mitchell turned
the ball over. Individually they all have to get better at taking care of the
basketball.  
I have a better feel for this team than I did last year's team. We're much
further along. I think the things we're doing offensively will help us take
care of the basketball.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Who was your favorite college player growing up?  
COACH TURGEON: Growing up was Darnell Valentine at the University of Kansas.
He was a guy I really looked up to.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Then you followed in those footsteps.  
COACH TURGEON: He was a guy from Wichita, Kansas, that was part of my life,
formative years, 8 through probably 12. Good player at the University of
Kansas. At the University of Kansas basketball player is a guy I looked up to.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Game of horse amongst the ACC coaches, who wins?  
COACH TURGEON: Probably Tony Bennett. I don't know.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You're more of a point guard.  
COACH TURGEON: I'm a better shooter now that it doesn't matter. I played for a
guy that wouldn't let me shoot either, Coach Brown. So I blame him.  
I think Tony probably if I'm quickly going through would probably be the best
shooter.  
JEFF FISCHEL: If you could make one rule change, what would it be?  
COACH TURGEON: One rule change? I like the rule changes we made this year. I
think the blocked charge is a tough call. I think freedom of movement is
something that I really like. I try to teach the game that way. You get
penalized sometimes that way.  
That's really about it. I'm one of the guys, whatever the rules are going to
be, I'm going to try to play that way.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The one‑and‑done rule, would you like to see that changed?  
COACH TURGEON: I think that would be tremendous for college basketball.
Probably what everybody else has said, you know, treat it like baseball,
football. I guess football can't do it. Baseball, if you want to go out in
high school, let them go. If you want to go to college, you have to stay three
years.  
I don't know if we'll get to three years, but if we get to two years,
sometimes kids get to two, they realize they need to stay three or four. A
little bit more mature at that time. Halfway through with their education. I
think it would help our game if we could get that rule changed.  
There's kids that are good enough to go pro out of high school.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You recently said you see a new Nick Faust this year. What did
you mean by that?  
COACH TURGEON: He's concentrating on the things we need him to concentrate on.
One is being the best defender. He needs to guard the best perimeter player
every night. He has the ability to do that. He's been dialed in in practice,
making the right decision, do what's best for our team.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Great to be in Charlotte as we look ahead to our 61st season,
and first as a 15‑member league, and look forward with a great deal of
anticipation.  
As I've said before, the composition of the long‑term membership of the ACC
has never been stronger. Geographically, we are moving forward as a true
Atlantic Coast Conference with membership spanning the entire Eastern seaboard
and even intoed Midwest with the addition of NotreDame and soon Louisville.  
Just within our footprint, the ACC will have the most television households
and the highest population of any conference nationally. And it is also
projected that by 2030, 55 percent of the U.S. population will lie within the
northeast and southern states, prime ACC territory.  
The combination of our marketplace opportunities, along with the population
numbers both current and projected, give this league enormous potential in
both the near and the distant future.  
As it relates to an ACC channel, we continue to work through the process of
strategically evaluating whether a channel makes sense for our league and for
our television partner. The discussions with ESPN are ongoing, and our focus
of making sure ACC content continues to be available any time, any place, and
anywhere remains a priority.  
Now, let's talk about ACC basketball and the season ahead.  
This year we welcome coaches Mike Bray of NotreDame, Jamie Dixon of Pitt and
Jim Boeheim of Syracuse. Obviously none of them are strangers to college
basketball success. And when you combine the accomplishments of all 15 league
coaches, the accolades are staggering. And more than any other collection of
conference coaches.  
Here are just a few: Over 5,600 career wins, combined winning percentage of 67
percent; seven national titles; 23 Final Four appearances, and 15 National
Championship game appearances. This group is also recording a winning
percentage of 65 percent in NCAA Tournament play, 66 Sweet 16 appearances, 33
regional final appearances; 11 have made at least one Sweet 16 appearance, and
six have appeared in a regional final. When you look at the
winningest‑programs in NCAA history, three of the top 5, four of the Top‑10,
and five of the Top‑25, are now ACC members.  
I'd also like to take the opportunity that acknowledge that three of the five
active Division I coaches in the Naismith Hall of Fame are at the helm of ACC
programs, and Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, North Carolina's Rory Williams and
Syracuse's Jim Boeheim.  
As many of you and our coaches have indicated, this may be the strongest
collection of basketball programs ever assembled in one conference. And that
is exciting. As I have said, the competition within the league will be brutal,
and obviously I mean that in a very positive sense.  
I know that I'm looking forward to it and it should be a lot of fun for fans,
players, and those of you that are covering ACC basketball alike.  
From a television perspective, the 2013‑14 schedule features all‑time highs in
the number of televised games and national appearances for our league. As has
been the case in recent years, every ACC‑controlled basketball game will be
available to our fans nationwide on one platform or another.  
Through our relationship with ESPN, we have the ability to maximize the
platforms for every fan to see ACC basketball. From traditional television to
progressive digital and mobile platforms like ESPN3 and WatchESPN, ACC content
is truly available everywhere.  
In addition to ESPN, the ACC Network through RACOM continues to be broader
than ever before, with a reach of over 68 million households and no geographic
parameters on the distribution. The ACC Network is now in 16 of the top 20
major markets, including New York, L.A., Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle,
Phoenix, Minneapolis, Denver, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis Kansas City
and Salt Lake City.  
The ACC app and ACC Vault continue to flourish, while the ACC Digital Network
has made monumental strides since launching in October of 2011 and is
currently the most successful conference digital network. In the last two
years, the ACCDN has experienced exponential growth distributing programming
and highlights to millions of digital consumers.  
The ACC Digital Network distribution portfolio includes industry leaders in
Yahoo!, USA Today Media Group, YouTube, row could he, MOGO TV, Synacor, Sony
Bravia, and hundreds of blogs and local media web sites.  
Following the regular season, the 2014 ACC basketball tournament will be
televised nationally by ESPN, as well as on all of our syndicated ACC Network
channels. And once again, this year, there will be no blackouts on either
platform.  
The upcoming regular season obviously will provide our fans with ACC
basketball appointment viewing, as well. For a third year in a row, ten of
ESPN used broadcasts will be aired exclusively on the ACC Sunday night
basketball package, which is preceded by a half‑hour ACC Sunday night pregame
show. This year's ACC Sunday night package tips off on Sunday, January 5th,
with the North Carolina at Wake Forest game.  
In addition to Sunday nights, ACC basketball is making its debut as part of
ESPN's Big Monday, which will feature weekly Monday night league games from
January 13 to March 3 starting at 7:00 PM each Monday evening.  
The ever‑popular college game day will also make two stops on ACC campuses
during its eight‑week run. The first will be on Saturday, February 1, for the
Duke at Syracuse game, and the second will take place on Saturday, March 8,
when North Carolina and Duke play in Cameron on the final weekend of the
season.  
And last year, we watched the University of Miami under Jim Larranaga win that
program's first‑ever ACC title. This March, all of our teams will again travel
to Greensboro for the 61st annual tournament. It will be the 25th time the
event has been held at the Greensboro Coliseum, which has hosted the
tournament more than any other venue.  
Our tournament format will continue to feature all league members, and we'll
begin with three games on Wednesday, followed by four on Thursday and Friday,
two on Saturday, and the Championship Game on Sunday afternoon. The Top 4
seeds will continue to receive byes into Friday's quarterfinal round.  
Now, let me stop with that. I know there may be a number of issues that I did
not address that you may have on your mind in terms of questions. So let's go
to the question and answers.  
But let me again tell you how much I appreciate your being here, being a part
of the largest turnout that we've had for this event, and for the coverage
that you give Atlantic Coast Conference basketball throughout the year.  
  
Q. Since you were just talking about the ACC tournament, when you go to
Greensboro this year and you do expand to three games and Wednesday like you
talked about, and the new teams, how do you expect that's going to impact that
tournament as far as interest, fan interest, people coming? What are you
looking for this coming year?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, obviously this will be the first time that we've done
that. And we've looked at some other conferences that have put on tournaments
of this size and what they have learned from what they are doing and have
done.  
We are in the process of deciding exactly how Wednesday will be handled. And
it may be, we haven't finalized that yet, and we will in the reasonably near
future come out with how we are going to ticket that particular day and how we
are going to address that particular day, because it is different than
anything we've had before.  
But with the depth of the tournament and the depth that we have with the 15
teams we have in this league right now, that will be some good basketball on
Wednesday. But we've got to make some decisions as to how we ticket it and so
forth, and we are in the process of addressing that now.  
Carl Hicks is coordinating that, and we have actually put together a
sub‑committee of representatives from our schools to take a look at that in
terms of the best way to go about that additional day of the tournament.  
You know, hopefully it will just be more of a good thing.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier about how people are talking about this collection
of teams as the best ever. After the way the national kind of agenda has gone
the last couple years, the ACC is down; it's slipping. How gratifying is it to
have people look at the ACC basketball in that way again?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, it's very gratifying. I mean, that's‑‑ you know, our
history has been a very proud one from a basketball standpoint, and I think
over the years, this league has arguably year‑in and year‑out been as good as
anybody on a consistent basis. The schools we have added most recently and
going back a few years and with Louisville coming next year, they are coming
from a great conference, as well, from a basketball standpoint.  
So we are bringing some terrific programs with great history and tradition
from an excellent conference and adding that to the great history and
tradition and programs that are already a part of the Atlantic Coast
Conference. I think that's what's brought us to this point of strength.  
  
Q. How likely is it that the ACC men's basketball tournament will eventually
move to New York City, and if it does, do you still envision a scenario where
it rotates back to Greensboro?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I wouldn't want to handicap that, but I think you have to
consider that with our footprint now, that New York City is a prominent part
of our footprint. And while I don't know that any college particularly owns
New York City, I think there's great interest there in college basketball.  
I think there's great interest in and respect for the Atlantic Coast
Conference and the basketball programs that are in our conference. It's the
media capital of the world. It's a great college basketball city.  
So there's certainly some logic to the tournament potentially being in the New
York market at some point in time. Some of that, if we were to be in New York,
is based on venue availability and timing of that venue availability.  
The tournament really was built in the State of North Carolina in the early
years and has enjoyed great success there every time that it's been played
there, whether it's in Greensboro or whether it's in Charlotte or even in the
days when it was in Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh when it started. So certainly
our league, former older members and newer members have great respect for
that, as well.  
And I think the question you're asking really leads to this fact: With our
footprint, and the quality of institutions and programs that we have, it just
gives us opportunities in front of us that we haven't had in the past. And
that includes potentially being in some markets with a tournament that we've
never been in before.  
  
Q. D.C. has long been considered ACC territory, and with Maryland leaving
next year, what priority is that market going forward?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, it's still a priority. It's basically still in our
footprint. It hasn't moved, and we are all around D.C. and Virginia and
Virginia Tech closest by and Pitt not very far away.  
It's the nation's capitol. Our schools obviously do a lot of business, if you
will, in Washington, D.C., whether it's related to legislative issues on
higher education, or whether it's related to fund‑raising.  
All that considered, we would still look at Washington, D.C. as a part of the
ACC footprint, and an important part of it. A lot of alums from our schools
live in dc.  
  
Q. With conference realignment at warp speed like it's been here recently
and with ACC adding three teams, losing one, do you see that slowing down, or
are you worried about more teams leaving?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I'm not worried about more teams leaving. I do see it slowing
down. I think that our grant of rights from last spring was really good for
the ACC; and I think it was really good for the national landscape because I
think at least that at the level of the five power conferences, equity
conferences, if you will, I think we are all settled by opinion.  
But I do think we'll see a much calmer period at our level, anyway. And it's
touched every level. I mean, there are domino effects, obviously. And it's
been a very challenging time for all of us, really, in college athletics with
the changes that have come.  
And historically, it's happened before and I don't know, some point down the
road, it will probably happen again. But I think we are in a period now with
the terms of our television contracts and so forth that would mean that
there's going to be a time of stability here for a good while.  
  
Q. Since the summer there's been buzz that there's going to be changes next
year within the NCAA. What kind of changes are you hoping for and what are you
expecting to happen next year?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, I think several things, starting with the things that
affect the student athletes the most; and how are we going to define amateur
dynamism, and in today's world, does that need to be adjusted in a sense.  
And what personally I would hope comes with that is an upward adjustment in
the scholarship itself. I think whatever we do needs to be education based.
Personally I'm not for paying players, but I'm for enhancing fundamentally the
concept of the athletic grant made that we have now.  
I think there are also some things that we can do, without defining exactly
what they are, but to enhance sort of the education, if you will, and the
decision‑making of the elite athletes that obviously have professional
potential in front of them. And I think we need to take a step back and see if
we are handcuffing them rules‑wise too much. Should we be a little more
liberal with an athlete's opportunity to evaluate where he or she is at this
given point in time as it relates to professional career in sports.  
But I think we also have to on the other stand‑‑ that's still a relatively
small percentage of athletes that come through our programs at the highest
levels that are going to have a career playing their sport, and if they do,
the length of that career is not terribly long. That brings us back to the
educational side of all of this, and is the reason that I feel like whatever
we do needs to have an education base to it.  
Now, maybe that's a supplement, a stipend to the scholarship itself; maybe
it's the full cost of attendance, which conceptually sounds really good, but
practically has some issues with it because of the Pell Grant dollars and so
forth.  
I guess I'm somewhere in the middle on some of this, because I'm not for
paying players. I think that is a disaster waiting to happen if you ever went
down that road and I don't think we ever will go down that road. But I do feel
like that there are ways that are tied to education that can enhance the
scholarship itself, if we can find the right mix.  
We've done‑‑ we, our industry, if you will, we've done a really poor job I
think of talking about the other funds that are available for needy student
athletes that are not part of the scholarship, that are over and above the
scholarship. We need to do a better job of that.  
I still think that the opportunity to get a free education at the quality of
schools‑‑ just taking our league as an example, in our league, and play a
sport that you love, is a pretty good deal.  
But at the same time, we can't live with our heads stuck in the sand. And
that's why I need to really look at that, try to find the sweet spot if you
will that enhances the experience for the athletes and their cost of education
without losing track of the fact that it's college athletics. And I'm a big
believer the collegiate model, understanding that it's not perfect by any
means. But this is an opportunity to do that.  
Secondly, it's an opportunity to restructure the NCAA. And that is‑‑ we better
take advantage of that opportunity, or we're going to continue to have
problems as we move down the road. And it's a challenge, because of the size
of the organization, because of the diverse institutions that are part of the
membership; the differences in School A and School B and what they want out of
their athletic program.  
But we've got to find a way to restructure, and I think we can. I'm confident
that we can. And when‑‑ you know, things are not good right now from that
standpoint. And what that tells me is that's an opportunity. When things
aren't good, it's an opportunity to step back and be honest with ourselves and
really try to make some changes that are significant and meaningful, and I
think we can do that. I think we can do it under what I would call the 'big
tent.'  
I don't know that we necessarily need to have another division to do that, but
I do think that, you know, the equity conferences need a certain amount of
autonomy in certain areas to deal with the issues that we deal with. And I'm
confident we can get there over the next six to 12 months.  
But I think that we need to‑‑ our system now is really, it's complicated. It's
massive. People have a hard time keeping up with what the legislative process
is and where a piece of legislation is in that process.  
We've taken, not by design, but unintended consequences of what we are doing
now, has taken the best practitioners out of the process in large measure and
that's the athletic directors. They are the pros. They are the ones who deal
with this every day, 24/7. They are the ones who understand the subtleties,
and we need to get them back involved in the process while also keeping the
presidents ultimately in charge.  
I think that's entirely appropriate, and I think our presidents need to be
dealing with the real concepts and global issues of college athletics without
being pulled into the weeds, so to speak, with legislative issues that our
athletic directors and other staff on campus should be dealing with.  
I also think we need to‑‑ not need to; we have to find a better way to handle
enforcement. You know, obviously that's not working well on a lot of different
fronts. And again, this is a window of opportunity to deal with that, as well.  
So there are plenty of challenges there to make change, and I think we can do
it without, you know, undermining some of the basic concepts, such as, we are
here to talk basketball particularly. I don't think we need to change the
revenue distribution from the NCAA in terms of the basketball tournament. I
don't think we need to change the access to the basketball tournament. I don't
think we need to change access to the Olympic sport championships.  
And if you leave those pretty much alone and you don't really change the
divisions as they exist right now, that means that there's schools that are in
the current divisions, maintain not only the access to championships, the
access to the revenue from the basketball tournament. They also maintain their
branding and that's important to those schools particularly.  
So I know, if we are under the big tent, if we can give the equity conferences
more autonomy where we feel like we really need that autonomy and can address
the structure itself and get the right people doing the right things, we can
make a lot of progress. If we don't, then it becomes a whole different
ballgame so to speak.  
And there are those who think another division might‑‑ maybe it comes to that,
but I think it can be addressed probably within the divisions we have.  
  
Q. And when you ‑‑  
JOHN SWOFFORD: The five power conferences.  
  
Q. I think for the first time since the conference's inception, Duke will
not go play at Maryland, and I was curious how things have changed scheduling
‑wise with the three new schools on board and how something like that with
Duke and neither North Carolina state nor Maryland, how something like that
would come about.   
JOHN SWOFFORD: Through the regular scheduling process. There are different
schools that don't go different places in any one year to play. That's not
particularly unusual.  
The great thing that we have in this league right now, when you look at the
quality of programs, you can't have a bad home schedule in this league. I
mean, you're going to have quality teams and quality brands coming in to
wherever you are. And with the‑‑ obviously one of the things you lose when you
get bigger is some people don't play each other as much. So that's part of the
growth.  
  
Q. You mentioned stability of expansion and you seem happy at 15. Does that
mean you are not going to actively seek a 16th member, and if so, are you
worried that you can get left behind if other conferences don't share your
view of expansion?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I can't speak for any other conferences. But in the
conversations I have with my colleagues in the commissioner's room, I think
everybody's pretty comfortable where they are and happy to be where we are at
this point.  
In terms of a 16th member, that just complicates our lives quite honestly.
With NotreDame's setup with our league, as our 15th member, they don't
participate in football in the sense that the other schools do. They do
participate in terms of five games per year against our teams, but that
doesn't effect the divisional set up.  
And if we went to a 16th member, that member would play football in all
likelihood, and then you've got in‑balanced divisions, which is not‑‑ it's
doable, but is not ideal.  
So I think we are‑‑ the conversations I've had with our presidents and our
athletic directors, certainly indicate to me that we are very comfortable with
the 15 that we are.  
  
Q. Inaudible ‑‑ expand again.  
JOHN SWOFFORD: No, I'm not worried that we'd get left behind. With our media
rights agreements, no, I'm not. I think we are as solid as we can be for years
to come.  
  
Q. If I can ask a football/NCAA question. Do you know where the Miami
situation is right now, and does the league have a Plan B if something would
come down that would affect their post ‑season situation?   
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, we always have a Plan B if something affects the
post‑season. I do not‑‑ I do not know where that is. I'm as perplexed as
anybody else why that has not been brought to conclusion at this point in
time. And, you know, hopefully it will in the very near future, and I'm
confident that it will in the very near future.  
But, you know, from a practical standpoint, it needs to be. You know, the
thing that happens with the longevity of something like that, whether it's
Miami or somebody else, is the pure length of time that it takes to bring to
conclusion, becomes problematic for the institution in itself. So hopefully
that will be over with very soon.  
Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Lamar Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24439)

### [Talib Zanna](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25958)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Glad to be welcoming in another new school to the ACC, Pitt.  
Guys, there are going to be questions about joining the new conference. Lamar,
what is it like joining the ACC?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: It's great. Looking forward to a great year. This conference
is shaping up to be one of the best ever. We're hoping to make sure we perform
in it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Talib?  
TALIB ZANNA: It's great playing a lot of good schools in this conference. It's
going to be a fun year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: It's a new conference. How do you set goals? How do you know how
you're going to fit into the conference?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Our goals are high. That's where we're going to set them.
That's where they've always been set at. We just have to, I guess, adjust our
style a little bit, tweak it, just go out there and play basketball. That's
what you have to do at the end of the day.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What does that mean, to tweak your style, Talib?  
TALIB ZANNA: Play an up‑tempo game. ACC is up‑and‑down. It's going to be fun.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Pitt is known for grinding. You want to get up‑tempo?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: If we have to. We'll grind. We'll get up‑tempo. At the end of
the game we'll grind, wear people out. That's what we're used to doing. That's
what we have to keep doing.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. Talk about joining the new conference with Syracuse and Notre Dame. Do
you feel a little bit you can't get away from Syracuse?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: It's great to come with familiar faces. Those are two teams
we're used to playing. Nothing will change there. We'll go back to a Big East
style when we play them.  
It's good to have also new faces to go along with the old faces. Change is
good. I'm looking forward to a great year.  
TALIB ZANNA: I think the change is good. Probably we'll try new things. New
conference, playing schools like North Carolina, Maryland, NC State. It's
going to be fun.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Lamar, you started 66 straight games. A lot of knowledge
acquired over all that time. Give me a sense of how you've grown as a player.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: I've grown as soon as I stepped on campus watching guys ahead
of me, like Brad Wannamaker, Gil Brown, guys like those to look after. They
showed me the way pretty much.  
Once I got out there playing my own minutes, I just learned as the game went
on. Like you said, 66 is a lot, but it's just something that happened over the
course of time I was there.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Talib, you averaged 10 points a game, leading rebounder. What
are goals for you this season?  
TALIB ZANNA: Win a lot of games. Just go far in the ACC tournament, win the
ACC. Just have a wonderful year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Obviously coach has talked about that as well. For people that
don't know, describe Jamie Dixon for us.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Coach is a hard worker. He wants everything to be perfect. He
won't have it any other way. He's going to make sure that we know what is
expected out of us. He's going to get it, I tell you that. He's going to get
it.  
He built this program around toughness, defense, unselfishness. That trend
will continue no matter what.  
JEFF FISCHEL: He's been averaging 26 wins a year. He's kept it going and built
on the program.  
Talib, what is coach like?  
TALIB ZANNA: He's positive about what he do. He's serious. He get his job
done. He make sure once you step on the court, it's business time.  
He just push you hard every day, just get the best out of you.  
  
Q. For years depending on who you would ask, there would be some debate
about whether the Big East or the ACC was the premiere conference in college
basketball. In your opinion, is there any doubt now with the influx of you
three that the ACC is the premiere league?  
TALIB ZANNA: I think Big East is better, just how physical it is, the fans,
the teams.  
I know ACC has a lot of schools that win a lot of games, make a lot of history
and championships.  
Being in the ACC, we have been looking up to since they announced we was in
the ACC. They announced about it in July. We happy about it. As basketball, we
just have to go in and play the game.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: It's definitely the ACC. With us coming in, Syracuse, Notre
Dame, Louisville next year, it's kind of hard not to say it's the best
conference when you add to the teams that are already there.  
Now we just have to live up to it as a whole, get as many teams in the
tournament as possible, just win as many games.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How is the team different without Trey and Steve?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: He was a leader. Me and Talib have to fill that void. Steve
was a big, big body in the paint. He was huge, a hard worker. Whenever he was
on the court, you know you had to work hard. You knew if he didn't, he was
going to kick your butt because he was working hard.  
I'm definitely going to miss those guys. That's college. Guys come and go.
Just want to finish this year out and then it will be my time to go.  
TALIB ZANNA: We miss Trey and Steve. You forgot about Dante, too. We came in
together with Dante. Trey being there, he's a good leader. He led us every
day. Being a senior, fifth‑year, he have a lot of experience. He tell us what
we have to do just because he's been there for a long time.  
Steve is just somebody who was tall, strong. I bothered Steve every day in
practice. It was really tough for me. We really miss those guys, so...  
  
Q. I was struck by the fact that you both said you need to change the way
Pitt plays basketball coming into a new league rather than making the teams
adjust to you guys. Is that what coach is saying?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: I didn't necessarily say change completely. Tweak it a little
bit, getting up and down. That's what we've been working on.  
Like you said, teams will have to adjust to us also. I'm sure our team is not
going to want to be being pushed around. When we do our block‑out drills,
that's all we do, push each other around. It's good to go out there and play
against other people for once.  
Like you said, they're going to have to adjust to us also. But we're going to
have to do a little bit of adjusting, get up‑tempo a little bit so we're not
getting out‑ran, stuff like that.  
  
Q. What is the one thing about Pitt basketball that ACC fans don't know
yet?  
TALIB ZANNA: Just being physical. We don't take stuff for granted. We come in,
take care of business. Just how physical and tough we are.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Just being able to grind stuff out. When it comes to the end
of the game, you think there's no fight left, we've been a team that has
consistently shown we have a little bit of fight. We're going to fight until
the horn sounds. Like Talib said, just the toughness and physicality of the
game. That's something that Dixon instills in us from day one.  
  
Q. Duke and Carolina have been the powerhouses of the ACC for so many years.
Do you think you guys, Syracuse, Louisville next year, can come in and hang
with the big boys of the ACC?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Yeah, definitely, definitely. I think that's what the move
was about. I think it was make the league as competitive as it can be.  
I think moving us, Syracuse, Louisville, Notre Dame, all them schools, it's
definitely going to give those two schools, the powerhouses, a run for their
money for years now to come.  
I think the ACC is definitely going to be a special conference.  
TALIB ZANNA: Don't get me wrong, I think we big boys, too (smiling). I think
they should worry about us coming into the conference, too.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: You learn we're pretty much all the same people, like the
same things. We all just are competitors and like to win.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Ian Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25966)

### [Okaro White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22135)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: It is time to talk Florida State.  
Guys, NIT run last year. What is the feeling heading into this season? What
are the goals? What do you expect of yourselves this season?  
IAN MILLER: Quite disappointed in the season we had last year. We had some
injuries, had some young guys that really didn't understand the system.  
But I think we're back to that dog mentality. I think we've worked hard and
achieved our goals this summer. We broke down the summer. You can't just make
a jump like that without having a productive summer. I think we had one of the
best summers since I've been at FSU.  
Losing and going to the NIT, I think it helped us. It helped us to mature.
Helped our younger guys to grow up faster than they usually would if you're
winning because they understand how hard it is, what it's going to take to get
back to hold up that ring, win a ring. It's good for us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: ACC championship one year, last year the NIT. The off‑season, a
lot of focus and dedication?  
OKARO WHITE: Definitely a lot of focus in the off‑season. I think we're
getting back to our defensive aggressiveness, how we've been in the past. The
trip we took to Greece, I think all of us kind of grew as brothers and as a
team. I think we've grown up as an overall team.  
I think our summer will set us up for a path of success this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You talked about increasing the defensive pressure. Leonard
Hamilton, all about defense. What did he see last year, what has he been
talking to you this year about playing defense?  
IAN MILLER: Coach Ham is one of the most understanding coaches you can have in
college basketball. He puts pressure on you to succeed, but he doesn't overdo
it because he knows it's a process. He understands building a tradition at
FSU, but he understands he has seven freshmen that didn't grasp how hard it
was, what it was going to take.  
Now that they understand it, it's a cut‑throat circuit, cut‑throat system. He
pushes us. He's going to get that maximum energy from you every day. We're
going to get back to that top five in the country like we're used to being
every year that gives us a chance to win the games at the end of the game.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Okaro, have you seen more defensive aggressiveness from the
team?  
OKARO WHITE: Yeah. Coach Ham isn't giving anybody any slack this year. That's
great because we're growing as a team and we have to understand Coach Ham has
been doing this for multiple years, and Stan Jones also. We're all paying
attention to them.  
If we get back to defense, we'll be all right. In the past, when we had these
great teams, there have been a lot of nights our offense didn't look good at
all, but our defense is what kept us in the game, kept the games close. If we
get back to our defensive ways, the ways we used to be, I think we'll be
pretty good.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The big piece of the puzzle you lose from last year is Michael
Snaer. Ian, who takes the game‑winning shot now for Florida State?  
IAN MILLER: To be honest, of course I want to take those shots. I'm so
confident in my teammates to where if I create an open shot, anybody's going
to knock it down. It started with me working out at 5:30, the next person was
coming in at 7:00, the next morning at 8:00. You see those guys getting
repetition after repetition.  
When you drive yourself to make those shots, it's great because then you have
that confidence. Once you have that confidence, you're going to knock it down
every time.  
It really doesn't matter who takes the shot at the end of the day.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Okaro, you're the team's leading scorer returning. Big
expectations of yourself this season?  
OKARO WHITE: I definitely have big expectations. At least 99% of every college
player's dream is to make it to the big league. But I understand my team's
goals come before my individual goals. For me to get to my individual goals,
our team has to have success first. That's what matters first and foremost.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What has Coach Hamilton said about the fact you have four
returning starters? I assume he thinks you now have the experience to be ready
to battle against the ACC.  
IAN MILLER: Like I said before, he's not letting us slack up. He's keeping our
energy high. He's letting it be known that he's not going to accept anything
but your best.  
Everybody understands that and every day in practice we're pushing each other
to hold each other accountable, to keep that drive, to have a great summer, to
keep having a good pre‑season like we're having, put ourselves in great
position to be where we want to be at the end of the year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Okaro, when Coach Ham relaxes, what is he like?  
OKARO WHITE: He's actually a fun guy when he's relaxed. A lot of people see
him on TV, don't really know him. They see what they call the 'death stare'
that he has on his face. They think he's a mean guy.  
He's actually a pretty fun guy, caring guy. He puts his players first, which I
love about him. He's just a great guy in general. He challenges us to be the
best we can be. He wants to see all of his players be successful.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You get the death stare once in a while?  
IAN MILLER: Oh, yeah, if I come down and take a crazy shot. I might give it
back to him. No, I'm kidding (laughter).  
He's a caring guy, like Okaro says. It's up to us whether we're going to be
successful or not. He can only just give us the path. We have to drive the car
down the road. We're going to do those things we need to do.  
JEFF FISCHEL: When you get him away from the court, he's talking about music.  
IAN MILLER: He is always trying to sing. He can't sing. Okaro, you know this
song? Ian, you know this song? No, that was back in the civil rights movement.
We wasn't alive.  
You know Coach Ham, he's an easygoing guy. Like Okaro says, he puts his
players first. It's up to us to give it all back.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Okaro, he's not listening to the same music you are?  
OKARO WHITE: Not at all. He has his Al Green, Patti Labelle, Elvis going. He's
an old school guy. When we was in Greece, we sat down and talked. He kind of
told me why he keeps the collection of music he has. Nowadays, these singers,
they get in the studio, they got so many different electronic instruments to
enhance their voice. Back in the day, you have those pure singers. They get in
the studio and record, they have a live band in there. He appreciates that.  
JEFF FISCHEL: He's told me all about the man cave.  
You talked about the trip to Greece. What was your favorite part of going to
Greece?  
OKARO WHITE: Definitely the food. The food was amazing, especially when we
first got there, trying out the new food. The last couple days we got a little
homesick. We found a burger spot right across the street from the hotel. We
went there for about four or five days straight.  
The experience of playing with the national Greek team, we took a lot of
punches when we first started playing them, but they helped us and we got
better playing against them.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Your favorite memory, Ian?  
IAN MILLER: Had to be seeing all the historic monuments and stuff like that.
Was breathtaking. To be able to go to the ocean and stuff like that, see the
different things, man, it was amazing and breathtaking.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck this season, guys.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Travis McKie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25956)

### [Codi Miller-McIntyre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27803)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Time to talk to Wake Forest. The important first question,
Travis, you're running for homecoming king, trying to get votes. Here is your
platform.  
TRAVIS McKIE: All students that are probably not watching, please vote for me.
I need to win. Appreciate it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Codi, have you voted yet?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: No.  
TRAVIS McKIE: It was yesterday. It's too late (laughter).  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's start with general talk about this season. Travis, senior
year. Give me a sense of what you want to accomplish this year at Wake Forest.  
TRAVIS McKIE: This is my last year. I want to help the young guys take that
next step. We can be more consistent throughout the season. Last year we made
a lot of great strides. They came at a lot of different times. We had one big
win, wait a month or so to have another big win.  
We need to put a string of games together.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What are your goals, Codi?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: I believe just to show our true talents. Last year were
flashes of what we could do. I think that showed why we were so good at Wake
Forest, what would happen when we would get on the road.  
JEFF FISCHEL: There were moments at home when we saw how good this team could
be.  
TRAVIS McKIE: We were 8‑1 at home last year. The young guys are more
comfortable at home. We weren't very good on the road. I think this year
they're a lot more experienced. I think we all are a lot more experienced. We
learned a lot from last year. We're trying to make that next push.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Codi, why is it tougher playing on the road?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Last year we didn't expect it. We thought away games
would definitely be like high school. It's definitely not. Bigger stage,
crazier environment.  
I think that comes from us being confident, being sure of the players we are.
We have that confidence this year that we developed from last year, that those
road games will be different.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. Travis, last year the Sensational Seven, the freshmen class, a year
older, wiser, more experience. How much have those guys grown in your eyes?  
TRAVIS McKIE: It's night and day. I think it's more mental than anything. I
think last year with seven freshmen, they don't know anything. You have to
assume they know nothing.  
I think last year on and off the court you had to worry about them at all
time. Hopefully they was making the right decisions.  
This year they've grown not only as athletes, but students. They have more
confidence about themselves. I think it's definitely going to show when the
season starts.  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: It's grown a lot. I have noticed in my teammates how
mature we've become in terms of on the court and off. I can tell everybody's
confidence level has shot through the roof in terms of knowing their abilities
on the court. I think that's going to help so much.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You've been with Jeff Bzdelik. What kind of impact has he had on
you as a player?  
TRAVIS McKIE: This year he's a lot more relaxed. Last year he was new to the
East Coast, I was new to college. We had our transition points, ups and downs.
He's more excited to get this year started.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Codi, give me a sense of coach.  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Last year it was definitely tough for him. Seven of us
that didn't know a lot. It was frustrating for him to tell us something and we
wouldn't do it because we didn't know any better. Definitely this year he's
more relaxed as a coach. We can see that up close in person.  
  
Q. Is 'relaxed' a relative term for coach? Last year he seemed rather grumpy
most of the season. You're saying he's relaxed now. How is he showing that?  
TRAVIS McKIE: Seven freshmen make you grumpy. It made me grumpy. When coach
came down on them, he was also yelling at me and C.J. because we didn't tell
them what to do.  
They've grown up. They know where to go now, what to do. A lot more is
expected of them. I think coach is more relaxed because he has a comfort level
and confidence level.  
I think going into their sophomore year, he know what to expect out of them.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You brought up C.J. First time without your tag team partner.
Weird, right?  
TRAVIS McKIE: It's definitely weird. But I wish him nothing but the best. He's
gone. I wish him the best in Germany. Talked to him last week. He's doing
well.  
The whole community loved him. He did a lot for this program. One person can't
replace that; the whole team has to.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What is it like trying to step up and fill that void?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: It's a lot. At the same time myself and my other
teammates knew what we were getting ourselves into. We decided to play for the
ACC when we decided to play for Wake Forest. Something we have to do. We have
to work to get that.  
  
Q. Travis, is the time now? Is it time to blast through the door with this
program and get them back into the tournament, do all the things you want to
do?  
TRAVIS McKIE: Yeah. It's been a long three years. I think we made small steps
in these three years. Last year we had a lot of good things happen. Those two
big wins at home against Miami, NC State.  
This year is the year we take that next step, make the push for post‑season
play. We try to focus on each day getting better as a team, weights, whatever
we're doing to get better as a team. If we take it one day at a time, but
definitely this year is the year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Codi, do you feel this is the year?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Most definitely.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You talked about the goals for this year, what you're trying to
accomplish. What has the off‑season been like?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: The off‑season for me personally has been a grind. I
knew what I had to work on. A lot of that was dealing with mental aspects of
my life, being able to time management, balance things. That, I couldn't do
last year. I reached a point with a lot of practice over the summer I could
balance everything I couldn't.  
TRAVIS McKIE: Also more mental than anything. I workout all the time. That's
nothing. But just being a leader, knowing how to talk to these guys. In
practice it can get heated. People respond in different ways.  
I learned a lot from last year in dealing with seven freshmen, knowing how to
talk to people. I think this year will be a lot better for all of us, myself
included.  
  
Q. What would you say to some of the fans that are upset with Bzdelik?  
TRAVIS McKIE: Come out to the game this year, support. We don't focus on the
negative energy out there. We focus on each guy in the locker room just
constantly getting better. We're focused on the season.  
When we win, everything is all good. I think winning is the result that
everybody wants to have. We have to put in the work to get those wins. We're
doing that right now.  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Basically the same thing. Just support us as a team, as
a program. That will help us extremely during the game, so...  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thank you, guys, for joining us here.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [K.J. McDaniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25962)

### [Jordan Roper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25963)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Time to talk Clemson Tigers.  
Guys, let's talk about where you start this year. K.J., 13‑18 last year. What
are the goals for this team?  
K.J. McDANIELS: We have a few goals. We have to be a tough team and be there
for each other, be more defensive‑minded. I feel like our defense will lead to
our offense.  
We want to be one of those teams to make it to the NCAA tournament.  
JORDAN ROPER: Like he said, be a tough‑minded team, be mentally tough, just
playing in March with a chance to advance.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Talk about turning defense into offense. Is that a focus of
coach?  
K.J. McDANIELS: He's a strict coach. We go out for 35 seconds, try to get out
on a break and score.  
JORDAN ROPER: Coach wants to instill in us defensive‑minded presence, have
that part of our identity as a team. Like K.J. said, it translates into
offense, just to be able to get out and run in transition.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. We saw your football team up at the dome a few weeks ago. Can you draw
anything off of what they're doing, any inspiration from the season they're
having this fall?  
JORDAN ROPER: Yeah, definitely. Just knowing those guys personally, knowing
Tajh and Sammy, knowing the dedication and hard work they've put themselves in
this position, to see their success.  
Drawing from that, we can put ourselves in that position also by working hard,
believing we can be there. That's where it started, they believed they could
be there.  
K.J. McDANIELS: I agree with Jordan. The football team, they work extremely
hard. I feel like that helps us carry over onto the basketball court. We try
to put ourselves behind them, just feed off what they've been doing. I believe
it will help us out in the future.  
  
Q. Life without seniors, what has it been like in the early practices?
Strange situation?  
K.J. McDANIELS: Life without seniors has been a challenge for us because us as
younger guys, we have no one really to look up to. We go to each other for
advice. We all just help each other out, try to be there for each other.  
We have different leaders on the team, I believe. I believe it will help us as
a team and build more chemistry.  
JORDAN ROPER: Like K.J. said, we don't have, per se, someone to look up to
that's been in situations before. We have a lot of guys on the team that have
some experience, like myself and K.J. and Rod Hall. Everybody has a steak in
leadership.  
Just the trip to Italy, us building a closer bond, that will help us all
together through tough times.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You have Devin Booker, Milton Jennings. That can be tough to
replace.  
JORDAN ROPER: Yeah, it can be tough to replace. We have a new focus. We have a
renewed focus. We're not worried about last year. We have to take last year's
experiences and learn from them, have it translate on the court this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: K.J., what is it like knowing you have to step up more down low?  
K.J. McDANIELS: It's a motivation for me. People say it's pressure, but I
don't see any pressure at all. I have extreme confidence in my teammates. I
believe, like, we'll all put in great work and be able to do great things.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You led the ACC in blocked shots last year. Not bad for a guy
who is 6'6".  
K.J. McDANIELS: It was an honor to do that. I think that just shows how hard I
like to go out there and play, just have my teammates' back. Being there for
them is the most important part. Leading the team by example, that's a great
way to start it.  
  
Q. K.J., the inside guys are untested. How much of a rebounding burden do
you think you'll feel early on?  
K.J. McDANIELS: I feel like our new guys there, they're learning. We just tell
them to go out there and play as hard as they can, do what they're good at.  
I feel like they take that and they learn. They do it every day consistently.
I think it will carry over into the game. It won't be as much of a burden.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys are growing. The ACC brings in Syracuse, Pitt, Notre
Dame. Do they just want to pile on more hardship? What challenge do these new
faces present to your team?  
JEFF FISCHEL: K.J., start talking about how much tougher the ACC is.  
K.J. McDANIELS: I feel like those teams are going to bring a great toughness
to the ACC. It's an honor to have them in there. We're excited to play all of
them.  
JORDAN ROPER: It brings a new challenge to the season. Just those different
styles of team, different styles of play, it will be a new challenge. We have
a renewed focus. We're looking to gain experience from what we learned last
year in the games this year.  
We're ready to compete. We don't believe we can't compete. We don't show up
not to compete. We're ready to come play. We're not afraid to play against
those teams.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You could be traveling to Syracuse, Pitt, Notre Dame. Is there a
particular place you'd like to check out?  
JORDAN ROPER: I think it would be cool to go to Syracuse, the Carrier Dome.
History with Carmelo Anthony.  
K.J. McDANIELS: I'm looking forward to going to Syracuse, it will be fun to go
there.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Has coach given you a specific goal with wins?  
K.J. McDANIELS: We just have to go out there and play for each other, be there
for each other. I feel like our Italy trip helped us out a lot.  
He hasn't given us a particular how many wins. We just know we're going to go
out there and play as hard as we can and do what we have to do for each other,
just go timeout there and play our hearts out.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Jordan, what was your favorite part of going to Italy?  
JORDAN ROPER: I loved Rome. Rome had several sites. The site I loved the most
was the Vatican, all the art inside.  
K.J. McDANIELS: I liked Rome. I liked the Coliseum, seeing different movies,
300, Gladiator. It was amazing to be in that stadium.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck this season. Thank you.

### [Tyler Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25965)

### [T.J. Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25964)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: I'm glad to be joined by North Carolina State.  
You were the two guys that saw significant minutes that are back. Tyler, talk
about how much the team has changed.  
TYLER LEWIS: Well, this season the team has changed a ton because we lost five
people that played a lot last year. Just knowing that me and T.J. played some
good minutes last year, we have to step up and be leaders and lead by example
throughout the season.  
T.J. WARREN: With the new faces to the program, we got a good group of guys
that want to get better and improve every day. Me and Tyler have been doing a
good job of leading them on through this process.  
I can't wait to get out there with them guys.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. How much do you think you need to score this year for your team to be
successful?  
T.J. WARREN: Whatever my team needs me to do, I'm going to do it. I got their
back, they got mine.  
With the coaching support, anything can happen for this team this season.  
  
Q. Are there other guys on the team that can fill it?  
T.J. WARREN: We have Rolston, Billy, Des Lee comes from a strong background,
Tyler Lewis. We got a good group of guys, everybody is going to get a good
feel for this season.  
JEFF FISCHEL: T.J., you were incredibly efficient. The pressure of putting up
more points might hurt some of the ways you were dangerous because you were so
efficient last year. Do you have to be careful about when you attack?  
T.J. WARREN: I'm not focused on that. I just want to go out there and focus on
winning and playing hard.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Tyler, how do you look to this guy? You're going to be relying
on him a lot.  
TYLER LEWIS: A lot. T.J. is such a great scorer. I have to put him in
positions where he likes the ball. He's one of the best scorers in the ACC, if
not the country.  
  
Q. I know last year in the NCAA tournament that early exit to Temple, how
much does that motivate you coming into this year knowing you have some
unfinished business?  
TYLER LEWIS: That loss definitely played a big toll on me and T.J. just
because as soon as we got back, the four returning players that we had coming
in, we gave everybody a week off, the next week we got back to workouts
knowing we want to become better this year. We have to play our best
basketball at the end of the season, too.  
Now that we have so many great incoming freshmen, as T.J. comes along, just
knowing we're going to struggle a little bit probably at the beginning with
the newcomers, just pick it up throughout the whole season, hopefully play our
best towards the end.  
T.J. WARREN: We just want to build off of last year. The early exit really
hurt. We moved on from that with the new players. They know what we want to
do, how successful we want to be. Just all going to start in the gym working.  
  
Q. Every team loses players. You lose four players. How do you possibly have
the same expectations this year as you did last?  
T.J. WARREN: The expectations are a little bit different. With this new team,
there's a lot of question marks for the media. We know what this team is
capable of. In games, we'll show you guys.  
TYLER LEWIS: It's going to be hard to replace the four thousand‑point scorers.
At the same time we have a great group of guys who can obviously step up and
get their roles, do their roles very well. People that we rely on, we have a
lot of confidence in them.  
  
Q. Is this an opportunity for you guys as a unit to under ‑promise and
over‑deliver for this coming season?   
JEFF FISCHEL: Do you feel like people are underestimating you and you can do
more than that?  
TYLER LEWIS: Yes, I certainly agree. People are underestimating us a lot. I
feel like we have a lot of people with weapons that people haven't heard of.
Des, Cat, knowing they're going to be great for our team, along with T.J.
right here.  
Hopefully we're going to surprise a lot of people. I think we will.  
T.J. WARREN: Being the underdog throughout this conference, being picked low
to win, we just want to go out there and show people.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You have new faces coming in. You mentioned Cat. How do you
expect the new guys to contribute?  
TYLER LEWIS: They're going to contribute a ton to our team. I mean, they still
have a long ways to go, as long as everybody else on the team, because they're
all freshmen. I have a lot of things I have to improve on, as well.  
Just knowing they're really good freshmen, they're going to come in and make a
big impact.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What do you feel you have to improve on?  
TYLER LEWIS: I mean, certainly I still got to become a better leader to this
team. Also I got to be able to, when things aren't going well, be able to take
over the team as the point guard, as the leader, hopefully calm everybody
down.  
JEFF FISCHEL: T.J.?  
T.J. WARREN: Definitely on the defensive end, staying consistent. Definitely
rebounding on both ends of the floor, staying consistent on that, too.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What has coach been saying to you about the season?  
T.J. WARREN: He's been telling us it's going to be a little struggle. When we
face adversity, we have to pull everybody together and just fight through it.  
TYLER LEWIS: Coach Gott is telling me in my ear every day I have to become the
leader of this team, bring intensity. If I bring intensity, everybody else
will bring intensity.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck this season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We're joined by Professor Larranaga. You've been named a
professor at Miami.  
COACH LARRANAGA: An adjunct professor. I'm not going to be teaching a full
class. I'm going to be a guest lecturer, talking to the students about
teamwork, leadership, what life is like after college.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We've talked before about how you consider yourself a teacher
first.  
COACH LARRANAGA: I've always thought of myself as an educator, someone who
works with players, teaches them not just the game of basketball, but the game
of life, trying to prepare them for when their basketball days are over, and
still want to be highly successful.  
We want our players to be both happy and successful long after their college
basketball days are over at Miami.  
JEFF FISCHEL: A quote I saw recently, you talked about how you were with this
team, you started with addition and subtraction, heading to multiplication and
division, not sure you're going to get to calculus.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Last year we had a veteran team with only one freshman, a
group of guys who had laid a very strong foundation the year before when they
were juniors. Then we had an outstanding sophomore leader in Shane Larkin to
go along with those five seniors. They were able to accomplish things that had
never been done before in Miami basketball history.  
We won the regular‑season tournament outright, tournament championship, went
to the Sweet 16. We were ranked No. 2 in the country at one point. We earned
the No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament.  
We also had sell‑out crowds night in and night out. We defeated both Duke and
North Carolina in the same season by more than 25 points for the first time in
ACC history.  
There was a lot of things that the team was able to accomplish. We really
enjoyed that journey.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Give me a sense of what you're seeing on the court in practice.  
COACH LARRANAGA: I'm seeing a lot of new faces. A lot of young guys with
energy and enthusiasm. All very, very tough competitors. They love to compete
in practice. They push each other in the weight room. They'll push each other
on the court. Every game we play, whether it's to 5, 11, 21, a full scrimmage,
they're at each other from start to finish. I love that energy and enthusiasm.  
They are listening very well. They're learning. But because we have so much to
learn, we've got to go slowly because everybody learns at a different rate. We
need to be sure we don't leave anybody behind. We only have 10 scholarship
players available. We have three freshmen new to the program. We have a junior
college player new to the program. We have a fifth‑year player, Donnavan Kirk,
who was at Miami years ago, but came back after graduating from DePaul. He's
going to be a fifth‑year senior to us. Then we have five veteran players and a
couple of walk‑ons.  
We've got a lot of work to do in terms of implementing our style. Our players
have a lot of work to do in learning that. Once you've learned it, perfect it.
It's not just learning the offense, it's learning how to execute it under
tremendous duress from an opponent.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. You lost a lot of outstanding players. Who are you looking for this year
to step up?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I would say we have three players right now who have some
experience and are going to be counted on, especially early in the season, to
lead us.  
Garrius Adams who redshirted last year, enjoying a fine career up until the
injury. We're counting on him.  
Rion Brown, our leading returning scorer for last season, who had a great NCAA
tournament, especially our game against Illinois.  
Then Tonye Jekiri, who came in off the bench last year, will move into the
starting lineup as our starting center. He was 215 pounds, now he's 241. Much
stronger and improved player.  
We're counting on those three guys to handle their positions, and then we're
trying to find the complementary players to them so that we can be competitive
in the ACC.  
  
Q. You talked about all the success you had last season. With bringing in
Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Syracuse, how much more difficult does it make
repeating something like that?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I think for all the teams in the ACC, ourselves
included obviously, the challenge to win the ACC regular season and tournament
championship is far more difficult. Those three teams, they've competed in the
Big East, have competed for championships every year.  
Syracuse, they went to the Final Four last year. Notre Dame has a veteran team
returning. Jamie Dixon has had Pittsburgh, regular‑season champion, a number
of times. All those teams are loaded.  
When you add those rosters to the ACC perennial champions in Duke, Carolina,
you have Florida State, Maryland, Virginia, all who have veteran squads
returning, our job has gotten very, very difficult.  
JEFF FISCHEL: If there's a change you could make to the game of basketball, on
or off the floor, what would you like to see changed?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I guess the answer to that is I love the way the game of
college basketball is being played. I don't want to see a lot of changes
because I think every time we make a change, we really don't know what the
transition is going to be with that change.  
I like the stability of our game. If we could reduce the shot clock from 35
seconds down to 30 seconds, I think that would be good. I think if we could
implement this new block charge rule, officiate it correctly, I think that can
be very promising.  
The thing I love about the game is it's pretty darn entertaining right now. I
don't want to see a lot of changes.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Talk about new metrics, how you use that as a coach.  
COACH LARRANAGA: I don't think the metrics are very new. I think they've been
around for a long time. Dean Smith had a system of what he called OER, DER,
offensive efficiency rating, defensive efficiency rating. It was based on the
number one.  
The Kenpom stats help us to identify strengths and weaknesses in our program.
Before my staff and I arrived at Miami, Miami's turnover rate was ranked 218th
out of 345 schools. They were turning the ball over an awful lot. This last
season we were ranked 16th in that category.  
What helps us, helps motivate the players, is knowing that they're improving
in a certain category, whether it's in field goal percentage, defensive field
goal percentage, or defensive turnover percentage. If you can turn the ball
over fewer and fewer times, you're going to be more successful at the
offensive end. By having those Kenpom stats, it helps us to give a clear
vision to our players, a picture of what we want to accomplish, where we stand
in relationship to the rest of the country.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Professor Larranaga, thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: I'm joined by Mike Krzyzewski, head coach of Duke.  
Start with the fact that you lose a lot of production from last year, but you
should be very comfortable with the people coming in to replace those guys.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I was more comfortable with the guys we had last year
because I knew what to expect. You had a base of three guys who you knew were
going to do really good jobs in Mason, Ryan and Seth.  
In saying that, I'm excited about the group that we have. It's going to be a
whole new system. The two most talented players we have are guys that have not
played a second for our program yet. There's going to have to be a period of
adjustment.  
I think starting practice early has been good for us, the change. We can
evaluate as this thing goes along a little bit. We're all healthy right now.
We're trying to work on a new system.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. What is the process of getting the complementary players to buy into two
guys that haven't played a minute being the focal point of the team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Probably 'complementary', like a newscast, it's not a
complementary part of the 30‑minute program. I think it's the best part of the
program.  
The fact that you have these two guys, and they're very versatile, there's
undefined roles out there for guys. In other words, how do I complement, to
use that word, these two guys, and sometimes in doing that I become one of the
really key players on the team?  
Our guys have been really good about it because they recognize the talents of
these two kids, in Jabari and Rodney, but they also like them as guys. So it's
not like you're just competing against one of them for a position. They're
there, and we're going to have three other guys with them. How do you fit into
that? How do you adapt?  
Like Amile Jefferson has adapted really well. He's actually probably better in
that than he would be if we said, You're our center. We won't say that. You're
just playing with them. So then he goes to his set of skills instead of trying
to be a center, that type of thing.  
Quinn Cook has to adapt, Rasheed and these guys, they get along well. We just
have to try to figure it out.  
  
Q. Mike Brey, he said you're well ‑known for your policy of eating your
young when it comes to former assistants.   
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I've never subscribed to that philosophy, unless they're
really cooked well (smiling).  
You know, Mike obviously is a great friend, part of our family. To see what
he's done at Notre Dame makes me feel very proud of him and our program, that
we were part of that. A small part. He's been the main part. We were a
complementary part to that.  
I'd rather not play against Mike, just like Jim Boeheim. But our conference
puts us in a position where Notre Dame and Duke are going to play. Wow.
Syracuse and Duke are going to play. Those are instant rivalries, instant
great games. I think that's going to be good for our conference.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The ACC pre‑season poll just came out. Duke with 51 of the 54
first‑place votes. Rodney and Jabari both first team ACC pre‑season. It speaks
to how much respect you've gotten for these two before they have been on the
floor for Duke.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I think it speaks to a high expectation level. One
thing for us this year, it's not based on what you've seen before, it's what
you think you're going to see. Whereas some of these things over the years,
when you are picked high, you have a lot of guys coming back.  
I hope we're able to come close to meeting some of these high expectations. I
know our guys want to be able to do that. We'll see.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Jabari, the pre‑season pick for Rookie of the Year in the ACC,
as well.  
More questions.  
  
Q. You've had a great reputation of having great leaders at Duke over the
years. Who are you looking for to be your leaders this year? What do you look
for in your leaders?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, leadership, even if you name a leader, doesn't mean
guys are leaders. You hope they become.  
I think in Tyler, he is a leader. He's a guy that fits in perfectly, is a
senior, has the respect of everyone else.  
I think for Rodney, he has the potential to be a leader. The guys really
respect him. But he's never been placed in that role before.  
So I think the combination of the two of them can really help us. We're going
to need Rodney to emerge even more because he'll be on the court a lot more
than Tyler will. There's leadership off the court, there's leadership on the
court. Both are really important. We need Rodney to fulfill that leadership on
the court. That doesn't mean Tyler won't be there, but he won't be on the
court as much as Rodney would be.  
  
Q. You mentioned Coach Boeheim, not wanting to coach against him. Were you
hoping maybe he'd call it quits before now? In some way are you looking
forward to showing him who is number one?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Both of those are no's. I'm not interested in showing
anybody I'm number one over him. I don't coach for that. I'd like to show our
team we'll finish number one, so that's a goal.  
No, I hope Jim coaches for 20 more years. I know his wife Julie wants him to
coach that long because I know Julie. I know she would like that.  
We're best friends. We've known each other for decades. The last eight years
we've done together some really neat things for USA Basketball.  
Whatever happens on the court, we know that every time we coach against each
other right now it will be an historic event with the two winningest coaches
going at it at the same time.  
I'm sure that we will handle that in a way that will be good for the game,
which he's done and I think I've done. At least we've done it most of the
time.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The fans are excited. It's already a sell‑out at the Carrier
Dome.  
  
Q. You talked about a new system, new players with Rodney and Jabari being
the focal point, guys having to adapt to them. For you as a coach, is that a
bit of a departure for you?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's really what I've done every year. It's just that my
team doesn't necessarily need it as drastically as it does this year. I mean,
it's really a big change.  
But we adapt every year to our personnel. So over the years, the 34 years I've
been at Duke, our teams have been different. The last few years, actually
number of years, we haven't had the depth of athletic ability that we have on
this team. Hopefully this team will develop the skill level that some of the
teams we've had that will go along with their athletic ability. If we do, I
think we'll be very good.  
  
Q. We were just handed the Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year. Hoping to
get a comment on C.J. Fair from you. Talk about his game a little bit, how he
helps make Syracuse what it is this season.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I end up watching Syracuse a lot because Jim coaches and you
cheer for him. So Fair is different. I don't think he has a position. He
always comes up big in big games. Looks to me like a guy that the tougher the
situation, the better he is.  
I was disappointed that he was not able to play for the United States this
summer because I thought he'd be a great addition to one of our U.S. teams.  
It doesn't surprise me that he's rated that high by everyone. He's one of the
better players in the United States. Talking to Jim, I know he feels that he's
one of the key components for their success this year.  
  
Q. Talk about all three of the newcomers. Is it exciting from a competition
standpoint to get three high ‑level programs joining you in the ACC now?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's great for our conference. I'm always excited. I didn't
need any new additions or anything. I'm excited to coach at Duke no matter how
many people we have in the conference.  
The fact is that I think it's great for the conference. I think right now we
are the best conference. We need to do what we should be doing to make sure we
feel that way in January and in April and two years from now. Instead of just
saying it, I think we now need to do it. It will be interesting to see how
that all develops.  
But the potential is here for some greatness. The instant rivalries that are
being created as a result of that expansion for basketball in the ACC is
remarkable.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what the addition with Coach Brey, Dixon and Boeheim
to a league already loaded with great coaches, what does that bring to the
league now?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It just means three more good coaches. I mean, I think when
you have great competition, it makes you better. It will make everybody
better. We didn't add three programs that are trying to emerge; we've added
three programs ‑ and Louisville next year ‑ that they're there. They have
been. They have a tradition of excellence. It's not just about coaching, it's
about the program. They expect excellence. It's not somebody joining the
conference hoping to succeed. They know how to succeed.  
Game in, game out, the conference is going to be tougher. I think it will
produce more really good teams and more NCAA teams than we've ever had in the
ACC.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Coach, thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [James Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19678)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

THE MODERATOR: My pleasure to introduce a veteran coach in the league,
Virginia Tech\'s James Johnson.

You\'ve been asked this all day. What is it like welcoming three new teams
into a conference?

COACH JOHNSON: It just made my job a little tougher. I\'ve known those guys
throughout the business. Very good programs. National power programs. We\'re
looking forward to it. More excitement. Definitely makes the league stronger.

THE MODERATOR: Let\'s take questions.

Q. You were a rookie this time last year. You have a season under your belt.
What did you learn season one that\'s going to help you?

COACH JOHNSON: I don\'t know if it will help me, but I learned this is a tough
league. A lot of good players, a lot of good coaches.

I think with my team, we had a tale of two seasons. We started out really
good, then we kind of struggled during ACC play.

I think maintaining a positive attitude, maintaining the same work ethic
coming in with my young men, those guys look at me, they see what type of mood
I\'m in, where I\'m at, they kind of feed off me.

Q. Has it been real difficult finding how you\'re going to replace Erick
Green?

COACH JOHNSON: Obviously Erick Green was big for us. He did a lot of different
things for us. Leading the nation in scoring, ACC Player of the Year. We\'re
not really trying to replace him. I don\'t know if we have a guy that\'s going
to lead the nation in scoring. I don\'t know if anybody in this league will.
We didn\'t know that sitting here last year either.

But we do have some guys that I think could help fill the scoring board and
put the basketball in the hole. I think we\'ll be a much more balanced team
this year. One of the things we\'re trying to do is we\'re trying to be a
better defensive team. Hopefully that will lead to a better offense.

Q. You have two seniors on the team this year. How are they stepping up and
taking over as far as leadership goes?

COACH JOHNSON: I think with those two seniors, with me being a first‑year
coach last year, them playing under me for the first time, they were like
newer guys last year also.

They\'re leading by example. They know what I like, how I am. They\'re kind of
leading by example. We\'ve had some younger guys step up and take more of a
leadership role, which is something that is pleasant to see as a head coach.
That\'s a good thing to have. I think our team becomes stronger that way.

Q. You think pretty highly of Ben Emelogu to bring him here. Named him one of
the leaders on the team. What has he done that\'s impressed you so much? Were
you surprised he was able to come in and be as successful as he has been?

COACH JOHNSON: He\'s just done everything right. He\'s a natural leader.
Coming in, I didn\'t have to put anything on him. He came in, natural
leadership qualities, leadership abilities. He earned the respect of the guys
right away from day one with his play, with his talking.

He plays both ends of the floor. He does everything right on and off the
floor. Just a pleasant surprise to have.

His coach in the recruiting process spoke very highly of him, his leadership
abilities. When you come in as a freshman, you have a couple seniors, juniors
that have been in the program, college atmosphere, it takes a special
individual to step right in and kind of have the team be his, and Ben has done
that.

Q. You finished up the bottom of the ACC last season with the nation\'s
leading scorer. Where have you set the goals for your team this season?

COACH JOHNSON: Well, I think we talk about it every day. We just want to get
better every day. We want to take a step forward every day.

You\'re either getting better or getting worse, you\'re never staying the
same. I don\'t know if that\'s a goal or not, but that\'s something that we
talk to the guys about every day. How good we can be, we\'re not sure yet. We
have some uncertainties, who is going to step up and do what. But we do want
to get better every single day in practice, every day in film session, every
day in the weight room. We just want to get better. Hopefully as the season
goes on, we\'ll become a much better team.

THE MODERATOR: When you talk about a guy like Erick Green, the other four guys
on the court will watch him make plays. When you return seven of your nine
leading scorers, does it give you an opportunity to grow your offense?

COACH JOHNSON: I don\'t know if it gives us a chance to grow it, but it gives
us a lot of balance. There are certain nights out there, Erick Green did what
he was able to do, then we had guys, like you said, standing around watching
where I wanted them to get involved in the game.

I think we\'ve got some guys that will get themselves involved in the game,
whether it\'s on the offensive glass, making plays for themselves. That will
be hopefully something that we don\'t have to worry about.

THE MODERATOR: The commissioner was standing here talking about the length of
the ACC tournament. When you look at the season as a whole, do you break it
down to the non‑conference portion and then look ahead to the deeper parts of
the schedule? How do you dedicate all your energies to prepping those games
but keeping your eye on the long season ahead?

COACH JOHNSON: We take it one game at a time. We take each game as a separate
entity. We want to treat upstate like we do Duke or any other team. Our team
preparation is the same in practice. We don\'t look ahead too much. That\'s
one of the things that we were able to get off to a good start last season. We
didn\'t look too far ahead. We took one game at a time.

I think we want to continue to do that, one day at a time, even in practice.

THE MODERATOR: Do the student‑athletes do that? How do you tell the guys not
to look ahead, but focus on some of the non‑conference teams? Do they really
do that?

COACH JOHNSON: I think with a freshmen group, they don\'t know any better.
They\'re out there with stars in their eyes trying to do exactly what they\'re
told to do when they\'re told to do it. A lot of times they\'re late doing
that.

The upperclassmen, they know the grind of the season. They know how you have
take it, day to day, step by step. They\'ve been through it. I don\'t think
they\'re looking forward too much. We\'re concentrating on our first game.

Q. Bringing in a team like Syracuse, Jim Boeheim, what can you say about what
you know about coach, going up against him this season?

COACH JOHNSON: Well, I mean, his career speaks for itself. We just brought in
one of the best coaches in the history of college basketball into the league.
We\'re fortunate to have them in our league, fortunate to be coaching in the
ACC, have a chance to coach against him. We\'re looking forward to them coming
into Blacksburg this year.

All the new teams in the league, well‑respected coaches, great programs.
They\'re going to be trying to do the same thing that we\'re going to try to
do. They\'re working hard getting ready for the season. They\'re going to try
to beat us when we play them and we\'re going to try to work hard and beat
them.

THE MODERATOR: Going into your second season, what is the one thing you take
away?

COACH JOHNSON: With hard work, that\'s something I\'ve done all of my career.
I think if we keep our nose to the grind, keep working hard, I think things
will fall in place.

THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much. Best of luck to you this season.

COACH JOHNSON: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Brice Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25959)

### [Marcus Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25071)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Talking Tar Heels. Brice, I hear you've been eating a lot.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Yes, I've been trying to.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Give me a sense of the diet now.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, the plan that they have me on is supposed to be six meals
a day. I get four meals and a couple snacks maybe a day. Not the full six
meals.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What is the goal weight‑wise?  
BRICE JOHNSON: The goal right now is 210. I'm at 207.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You want to keep growing for next season?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Yes.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Tough to put on the pounds?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Yeah, it's been pretty tough.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Marcus, I heard you were singing in the digital network booth.  
MARCUS PAIGE: They told us to have fun. Miley Cyrus song jumped into my head.
I thought it would be fun.  
JEFF FISCHEL: That's what you listen to before the game?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Definitely. It gets me going (smiling).  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how well this team is handling all the distractions
that have gone on with this off ‑season with P.J. and all that?   
BRICE JOHNSON: We just been preparing like it's a regular day, moving forward.
We're putting that behind us, just moving forward.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think we understand that people are going to ask about it.  
As a team, we're ready to move past it. We've moved past it. We're working
hard in practice every day trying to be the best team we can be day in and day
out. So when we get him back, we're going to hit stride and continue playing
the way we were playing before the games he's sitting out.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about coming to the dome this season in Syracuse.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I'm really excited. That place has had some huge crowds. Great
basketball program that plays in front of those huge crowds. I'm excited to go
up there and play.  
Adding them to the league is going to make our league more deep and
competitive than it already is. Great to have Syracuse in our league. I'm
excited to go up to New York.  
BRICE JOHNSON: I'd have to say the same thing. Just knowing the great
tradition of the Syracuse basketball program, I'm looking forward to playing
them in the Carrier Dome.  
  
Q. We're used to seeing Duke and North Carolina compete for the No.1 spot in
the ACC. With the influx of other teams, talk about the challenge this year.  
BRICE JOHNSON: It's going to be great. Just knowing there's a lot more
competition, it's going to be a lot tougher for somebody to get that No.1
spot, knowing every night you have to go out there and compete, you can't take
a night off.  
MARCUS PAIGE: You have to be completely better than anyone else, any other
league in the top. You're going to have some parity in the top, have teams go
on runs. Then another team that's just as good can go on a run and claim that
top spot.  
Teams that are used to winning regular‑season titles are going to be
disappointed, so I'm excited for it.  
  
Q. Last year it seems like you played your best basketball late in the
season. You were a young team. How does that help you moving forward this
year?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think it helps a lot. We were a young team. We were
inexperienced, too. The guys returning didn't play a whole lot. Our guy that
we featured last year, James Michael, was playing behind John Henson the year
before. He got thrown into a spot where we expected him to be a big‑time star
for us. He handled that well.  
As a team we took some bumps throughout the way. That experience will help us
this year. We're more of a veteran group. We know what to expect. Hopefully we
can advance past what we did last year.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Like Marcus said, just the experience part will help us a lot.
Going into the second round of the tournament, we know what's expected of us,
what we need to do to get farther, what we need to do, to work on as a team.
Me and Marcus working on getting bigger and stronger as a team, me and him
personally.  
Just the experience of playing in the tournament helped us a lot.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Marcus, who is going to be the most improved player for UNC this
year?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Oh, man. I'd like to say everything. I think Joel James is going
to show great improvement. Last year whenever he was in the game, he would
struggle with foul trouble. The system didn't quite click for him in terms of
running our secondary break, things like that. He shaped up his body even
more. He has a year under his belt. He knows what to expect.  
I think we're going to see a huge improvement out of him. That's going to help
us establishing a big presence inside. I'm excited for what he's going to
bring to the table this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Brice, how do you feel you need to improve individually this
season?  
BRICE JOHNSON: My goal is to get back to playing a lot more defense like I was
in high school than last year. Marcus could probably tell you this, I probably
didn't play as much defense as I should. It's part of me learning the college
system.  
Just getting down in the stance was tough for me because I was used to
standing in the lane, blocking shots in high school. It was tougher to come in
and face somebody that played like me, go by you.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Marcus, was it an adjustment for you as well?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Definitely. The strength and physicality was a big adjustment.
In high school you can get away with taking plays off on defense, just relying
on your ability to stay in front of guys, save your energy for scoring on
offense.  
In college, you can't take any possessions off. Guys are bigger, stronger.
They make you pay every time.  
That's definitely an adjustment. It's hard for a lot of freshmen, not just us.
Now that we're not freshmen anymore, we can hopefully eliminate some of those
mistakes and be more solid on the defensive end.  
  
Q. When the media poll comes out, I'm sure you'll be up at the top. Can you
talk about playing from that frontrunner position?  
MARCUS PAIGE: A lot of the programs that are considered elite get thrown up in
the top 10 regardless of who they have coming back or whatnot.  
I think we have a lot of pieces come back that can help us make a run that far
or get deep into being one of the top five, top‑10 teams in the country. Until
we start playing games, those rankings don't mean anything.  
It shows we have a lot of pieces, if we come together, hit or stride, can make
a lot of noise come March or April.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Rankings‑wise, I don't really think they mean anything at the
beginning of the season. When the games start, it depends on what your
schedule is like, how you're playing progressively during the season. I mean,
basically where they think you're going to be during the season, basically
like where they think you're going to be, but at the end of the day you have
to back it up in your playing instead of like relying on, We're top five,
we're top 10, we can take nights off and we're still going to win.  
You have to compete and be able to back up that ranking that you have.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Brice, you and P.J. surprised Marcus, jumping out of the locker.
Talk about why you did that. Had people laughing a little bit.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Me and P.J. were sitting there. We just wanted like a good,
quick laugh, something a little funny. We was going to videotape it to have a
little fun.  
It so happened it was Marcus. His locker was open. We decided P.J. would sit
in his locker and wait for him to come in. When he jumped out, Marcus fell. At
the beginning we didn't think it was going to blow up like it did. We thought
it was going to be a couple laughs in the locker room. But it blew up like
wildfire.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I don't know what you're talking about (laughter).  
Honestly, that's just P.J.'s personality. He's great to have around. I
consider him a good friend. He always jokes around with me and picks on me a
lot. The fact that it was him didn't surprise me, but the fact he was in my
locker surprised me. They caught me off guard. That's okay, it's a long year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Great talking to you guys. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Rodney Hood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25967)

### [Tyler Thornton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22872)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Time to talk about Duke basketball.  
Rodney, now that you've settled into the starts lineup for Duke, give me your
impressions of what it's like playing for Duke basketball.  
RODNEY HOOD: It's a tremendous honor to be able to put that uniform on. The
tradition has been laid down for the program. Just to be able to help keep
that going is a tremendous honor.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Tyler, what have the years been like for you at Duke?  
TYLER THORNTON: Like he said, it's been a tremendous honor, like the best
feeling in the world to be able to wake up in the morning and say, I play for
CoachK. To see the history, trying to write your own history at the same time.
It's like living a dream day in, day out.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Rodney, you're a team captain without having played a minute for Duke.
That is a position that is revered. What does that say about what you
accomplished during your year on the sidelines?  
RODNEY HOOD: It was a great feeling to be named team captain. It just goes to
the respect that the teammates and the coaching staff have for me.  
It's a big responsibility, especially at Duke. I'm looking forward to that
challenge.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Tyler, what has it been like seeing Rodney get in the lineup?  
TYLER THORNTON: Last year in practice, on the scout team, whatever, he was by
far the best player on the scouting team. He really helped us get ready for
our opponents.  
He set his foundation. He earned his respect at that moment.  
When the season finished last year, he just cranked it up when we were in open
gym and workouts. The guys just respect him. The game speaks for itself.  
  
Q. Syracuse coming into the conference. Obviously you know your coach is
number one on the wins list, Syracuse is number two. They never like to play
each other. Now they have to. Talk about the excitement of that game.  
TYLER THORNTON: Those are two of the best college coaches of all time. It's
going to be a historical moment. Definitely looking forward to playing the
newcomers into the ACC, to have a fresh feeling.  
But you would have never thought that we would have a home and away with
Syracuse in a million years. For it to happen is going to be amazing.  
RODNEY HOOD: Like Tyler said, it's going to be an amazing feeling. Of course,
they got Coach Boeheim, who is very respected, one of the best coaches of all
times. Two historical gyms. I think they're trying to set a record when we go
there, which is going to be great.  
Them coming to us, see what the tradition is like, we can't wait for it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Rodney, what do you think of playing in front of who knows how
many people at the Carrier Dome?  
RODNEY HOOD: It will be the most I ever played in front of in my short
basketball career. It's going to be exciting. That's why you come to big
schools like Duke. You want to play in front of those type of crowds, Final
Four‑type atmosphere. I'm looking forward to it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Tyler, dealing with your intimate setting as well.  
TYLER THORNTON: Big games are always the most fun no matter where you're
playing. Their home gym, be that size, the atmosphere, I couldn't ask for
anything better.  
Then on the flipside, for them coming to us, they'll feel when the game gets
really hyped, the gym actually starts shaking, it's going to be a different
feeling than what they're used to.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Jabari Parker is adding to the equation for you
guys? I know a lot of is expected out of him this year.  
TYLER THORNTON: He's definitely a very versatile player. There's a mental
adjustment for all freshmen they all have to make. He's in the process of
doing that. He's doing a great job with accepting that.  
But his skill set is something you can't teach. His quickness, his
athleticism, he has a great feel for the game. He really understands the
things we're trying to do. He's going to get better every day.  
RODNEY HOOD: Like Tyler said, he has a great skill set, very talented, very
mobile for a guy his side. Long wingspan. Can really play versatile, unselfish
guy.  
Like Tyler said, he's going through a learning curve right now which is good.
Rather him go through it right now than once the season is going to be cranked
up. I think he's ready to make a big impact this year.  
  
Q. We're used to seeing Duke and North Carolina in this conference every
year. With the newcomers coming in, Syracuse, Notre Dame, discuss the
challenge of trying to stay at the top of the conference and the extra
motivation to show these newcomers that this is our conference.  
RODNEY HOOD: Like I said, it's going to be fun just from a competitive
standpoint. Syracuse, UConn are rivals, them coming here, we want to create
the same type of game, legendary games. Hopefully we going to win.  
It's going to be fun playing against those guys. It's going to be a challenge
for both teams, for all teams coming into the ACC, and teams that have already
been here.  
TYLER THORNTON: ACC, regardless of the new teams, all those games have a
bigger impact and bigger importance. Those games are always amped up way more
than the non‑conference schedule.  
But it's going to be fun having those teams. Each win is going to be that much
sweeter and that much more important to add to your résumé in trying to win a
regular‑season ACC championship, then turn around and try to put it together
for three or four big games to win the ACC tournament championship.  
  
Q. I read where guys that graduated spent their entire careers in the top 10
on the national rankings. Talk about that remarkable consistency, any kind of
pressure it puts on the next class to make sure you don't slip out.  
TYLER THORNTON: No, I don't think there's any pressure. The coaches do a great
job of keeping us in the moment. We thrive in situations where it's a big
game, a big matchup. Coach has won so many of those games, he knows how to
prepare his teams for those games.  
Because of that history, because of his knowledge for the game, we're able to
win in those big situations. Ultimately it keeps us in the top‑10 ranking.  
RODNEY HOOD: Like Tyler says, it keeps us in the moment. That's the biggest
thing coach preaches for us. Different kind of teams have arisen from Duke,
the '91, '92 teams, the 2010 national championship team, they're all
different. We're a different team. We got to stay in our moment and do the
best we can to hold the Duke tradition up.  
  
Q. Coach has made it clear that Rodney and Jabari are the two guys that you
and the rest of the team need to mold yourselves around. What does that mean
to you as a guy that's been there for a while? Why is he so confident in guys
we have yet to see play?  
TYLER THORNTON: The feeling in our locker room, we only go as far as those two
take us. We have 12 guys that can really play, but those two are by far our
best.  
They set the ceiling. Once they push through that ceiling, it allows everybody
else just to follow up and bring what they can to the table. It just makes us
that much better of a team.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Rodney, you got to go to New York. What was that experience
like?  
RODNEY HOOD: It was easily one of the best experiences of my life. Especially
me being from down south where you only see the World Trade Center, the Empire
State Building from the television set. To be able to go to the 105th floor,
looking down at NewYork City, I was a little scared, but at the same time it
was a great experience.  
Going to Motown, Broadway, Rutgers Park, one of the most historical basketball
courts ever made, it was just an eye‑opening experience. It was a great
team‑bonding experience.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good look to Duke this season. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Kammeon Holsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25955)

### [Daniel Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25954)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Time to talk Georgia Tech, the upcoming season.  
Give me a season where Georgia Tech picks up this season.  
DANIEL MILLER: We had an okay season. We got a little better from the year
before. We lost a couple games by about two or three points that really could
have turned our season around. Thinking we can just build from where we were.
We've added some key guys, some new players that can score and really play
ball. Hopefully that will put us over the edge.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You improved five wins last year. How many this year?  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: It's going to be more than five. I feel we can improve a whole
lot more. With the addition of Trae Golden, brings a lot of depth and
experience to our team. A great guard.  
I feel like we're going to surprise a lot of people this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. What kind of impact will Trae have on the team?  
DANIEL MILLER: He has a lot of experience. He knows game plays. He knows what
play to make, where to be. He's a real good basketball player.  
He can really push the ball up the floor. He can get us easy buckets in
transition, things like that. He's just a tough guard. He'll be really
valuable to us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You have Trae coming in. There's a lot of scoring and rebounding
on this team. You must be confident about the fact there's a lot of experience
on this team.  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: No doubt about that, sir. There's a lot of experience. The
addition of Trae, he brings a lot to the program, to the team. He has a great
scoring ability, awareness of the court, hard worker. It's going to be
exciting to see us play this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's talk about Brian Gregory. What is he like a coach?  
DANIEL MILLER: He's tough. He means what he says, but he's a really good
coach. He wants to get to know us, get to know who we are, coach us according
to that. He's not just business. He loves us. He wants the best for us.  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: I would say he's a guy with a lot of swagger (smiling). He
cares about the team a lot. He cares about what we're doing in the classroom
first.  
He always said, You take care of what you do in the classroom, off the court,
it will transfer back over to the court. It's true. You treat people right, do
what you're supposed to do in the classroom...  
  
Q. Can you talk about the youth of this team. Can a young team have success
in this league?  
DANIEL MILLER: Yes, sir. They helped us out a lot last year. We put a lot on
them really for them stepping up like that. Those are the kind of players they
are. They're scorers. We expect more out of them this year to really help us.
We'll have to score from other places as well, not just from them.  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: I agree with Daniel. I mean, they're a great group of guys.
Coach put a lot on them, wanting them to do a lot more. This year I feel they
have the experience to do it and the confidence to do it. I agree with
everything Daniel said.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's talk about individually your games. Daniel, you can score,
rebound. Most fun part of your job blocking shots?  
DANIEL MILLER: I'd say so. I'm getting up there among the tech leaders. I
don't think I'll ever pass number one, Alvin Jones. I take a lot of pride in
that. I've always been good at that.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Describe your game for me, Kammeon.  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: Bring a lot of energy, a lot of aggressiveness. Be a
game‑changer. Just playing hard and doing the little things on the floor,
rebounding. Also, when I get a chance, one‑on‑one, go to work on the inside.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What does coach think of going one‑on‑one?  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: He wants to attack. No one can stop you one‑on‑one. I love it,
one‑on‑one.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How about working down low, Daniel?  
DANIEL MILLER: If you're in the post, he definitely wants you going one‑on‑one
when it's appropriate. He want us to have a guy doing one‑on‑one the whole
game. When he sees it needs to be done, he wants you to do it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Would he be cool with you firing off a three?  
DANIEL MILLER: Oh, yeah. He says if I'm open, to shoot. I got the green light.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Twitter, what does coach think of you being on Twitter? Does he
allow it?  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: He don't think very highly of it. Actually, I don't tweet. I'm
not a Twitter person. That's a good thing.  
No, we're not allowed to tweet during the season anytime.  
DANIEL MILLER: He tells us we're not allowed to have one. He met with us to
make sure he had one to promote the program.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Were you okay with that?  
DANIEL MILLER: Yeah, he tweeted a picture of us at the airport yesterday. He's
actually enjoying it.  
He's telling us about his followers, things like that (smiling).  
JEFF FISCHEL: I asked a bit earlier about what it's going through a day like
this. I realize you have to answer a lot of questions. Is it a fun day,
though?  
DANIEL MILLER: Yeah, I came last year. I was excited to come this year. It is
a long day, but we get to come and have a good time with all the other
players, get to talk to some people, things like that.  
It's also practice, getting ready for giving a speech in your class, things
like that.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You have a speech class?  
DANIEL MILLER: We're always giving presentations, so...  
JEFF FISCHEL: What is the last one you gave in your class?  
DANIEL MILLER: I had to present a game show about three weeks ago. It was
exciting (smiling).  
  
Q. Talk about the influx, the new blood coming into the conference with the
additions of Syracuse, the like.  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: It means a lot to the program. I always thought the ACC was
the best conference. Bringing along Syracuse, Pitt, Notre Dame, all the great
schools that have achieved great things in the past. I feel like it's a great
boost for the league.  
DANIEL MILLER: You're adding some of the best teams in the country to our
division. It's definitely exciting. Those games, we have to play just as hard
every night. You can't take a night off.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Give me the three things Coach Gregory is setting out for you
guys this season.  
DANIEL MILLER: We want to win the ACC. That's one.  
KAMMEON HOLSEY: NCAA tournament, at least winning 20‑plus games, not setting
any limits.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Last thing. When we talk about goals for the team, do you have
input with them or is something coach is saying, This is what we need to do?
Is it a group thing?  
DANIEL MILLER: I guess we were all sitting in the theater room when we were
talking about it. He was saying what should be some goals for us. You're not
going to really get those goals unless we all believe in it. We won't even
have a chance.  
Everybody is getting on the same page and we have to do it together.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thanks for joining us here.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Joe Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25059)

### [Akil Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25060)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We're joined by Virginia.  
What did you do in the ACC photo booth?  
JOE HARRIS: I don't know if we can reveal what we were doing in the photo
booth (laughter).  
AKIL MITCHELL: Private information (laughter).  
JEFF FISCHEL: 'Hashtag Swoon,' talk about what that is on Twitter?  
JOE HARRIS: I'm not that familiar with it. It's been embraced by a lot of our
fans, the Swoon Movement.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Swooning over you?  
JOE HARRIS: Everybody.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The team?  
JOE HARRIS: Yeah (smiling).  
JEFF FISCHEL: Akil, they're swooning over him, right?  
AKIL MITCHELL: Yeah. I'm the biggest swooner there is.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Going to have to follow those tweets (laughter).  
We'll start with questions.  
  
Q. Do you guys notice bigger expectations around the team this year? If you
do, how do you balance that with you guys as the senior leaders?  
AKIL MITCHELL: We can really kind of sense an excitement level around the fan
base, around grounds. I mean, I don't think it's impacted us as much. We
understand what we have to do to be successful is the same things we've had to
do in the past.  
It's pretty cliché, but we're going to take it one game at a time, work as
hard as we can every practice, to be the best team we possibly can be.  
JOE HARRIS: Going off what Akil said, there are those expectations, but we're
just worrying about what we can control, and that's trying to improve every
day, be the best team we can be, worry about the now rather than the
expectations that might be put on us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: It strikes me when I look at this team, the big difference,
depth and experience, you've built that up. Joe, how does that make a
difference for this team?  
JOE HARRIS: It's huge. Last year going into the season, I don't think we had a
true point guard at all. Now we have four. It's a good problem to have that
depth.  
I think there will be a much more balanced attack offensively. We have a
number of guys that can contribute and score in different ways.  
It's exciting going into the season with added depth and talent on the team.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Akil, how have you noticed it?  
AKIL MITCHELL: I think the big thing is with that added depth, guys are buying
into their roles and positions on the team. Like Joe just said, we have four
guys competing for the point guard spot, multiple bigs that can play.  
It's really going to force us all to compete against each other, but we know
we have each other's back. It's a team mentality. I think that's the biggest
difference between this year and last year, the maturity, understanding of
what we have to do to be successful.  
  
Q. We saw a lot of the younger guys getting reps last year. How have Nolte,
Tobey, Anderson improved since last season?  
AKIL MITCHELL: Yeah, I think it's something that Joe and I also had to go
through when we were first and second year, baptized by the fire. Evan and
Mike and Justin, all those guys have had to kind of learn on the fly.  
I think it's helped them a lot. I talked to them multiple times since we
started practice. They're saying the game has slowed down so much more since
playing last year. They've understood the defense. Mike looks a lot better.
Defensively he still has a lot of room to grow. Evan has gained 15 pounds of
muscle. He looks a lot stronger. Justin's decision making has improved.  
They've all taken strives and it's impressive to see.  
JOE HARRIS: Going off of what Akil said, same thing. They've all improved a
considerable amount. I'm just excited to get going with them, see what they
can contribute on the floor this year.  
From a physical standpoint, I think Tobey and Nolte had both put on a lot of
weight, particularly muscle. Then Justin has improved in his decision making
areas. I'm just excited to get going with them, see how they can contribute
this season.  
  
Q. The teams that are coming in this season, from a player's perspective,
are they being viewed as the new kids on the block, the bullies?  
JOE HARRIS: I would say it's exciting for the players. I know I'm excited to
play against some different teams, new faces, go to different venues. I think
it's great for the league. The ACC was a powerhouse beforehand from a
basketball standpoint. Adding these three teams to the league makes it that
much better. I think it's definitely one of the best basketball conferences in
America.  
AKIL MITCHELL: Yeah, I don't know if we perceive them as bullies or anything
like that. It's kind of weird to look around, not really recognize some of the
faces here and there.  
It's exciting, like Joe said, to get a chance to play in some new places.
They're three really good teams. Whenever you add that type of competition, it
should get any competitive player fired up.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Back‑to‑back games you traveled to Notre Dame and Pitt. Are you
excited about one or the other?  
AKIL MITCHELL: It would have been fun to go to the Carrier Dome. We don't get
that opportunity this year. Getting the opportunity to play at Notre Dame, at
Pitt, it's something different. It will be a lot of fun.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Joe?  
JOE HARRIS: I think it's going to be exciting. I'm excited to go and play in a
different venue, see what their fans are like, what the atmosphere is like.
I'm sure it will be great.  
  
Q. You have improved in win totals the past four seasons. Do you see that
trend continuing and do you see this team this year being even better than
last year's team?  
JOE HARRIS: To me that's the goal every year. Our goal is to make it to the
post‑season, to improve off of what we built last year. So far, as Akil and I
have been in this program, it's improved every year.  
It's not any different for our goals this coming year. I think we have a
chance to be a special team with some of the depth and talent we have this
year.  
AKIL MITCHELL: Four years ago that was the goal when coach recruited us. That
was the goal to really turning around that program. Every year I think we've
built steadily towards doing it. This year I think it's another opportunity to
continue to build.  
We should be a good team. After you continue to build after four or five years
of being better every year, at some point you come to a point in the road
where you have to get better. I think we have an opportunity to do that this
year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck this season. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We're joined by Florida State head coach Leonard Hamilton.  
(Question concerning Sylvia Hatchell.)  
COACH HAMILTON: It means an awful lot to me because I've had several
scenarios, battles with these types of dreaded diseases in my family. I lost
my grandmother to cancer, my father to cancer, my youngest brother Barry, my
brother Willie, my mother this past April.  
When a friend of mine is in one of those situations, my heart goes out to
them. I know the stress it puts on their families and friends and loved ones
because I've lived it for a number of years.  
My heart goes out to Sylvia. She's loved by anyone. One of the best coaches in
the history of women's basketball. We wish her well in this battle. We lift
her up in prayers. I'm sure that I along with the Florida State family, people
who know here, wish her a very speedy recovery.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. When you have someone that you care about that's going through a tough go
with a disease, how does that bring everything front and center to you to go
off the court and see the bigger picture about life, what truly matters to
you?  
COACH HAMILTON: I probably live my life all the time and try to teach our
players that things are much more important sometimes than just the game of
basketball. It's the game of life that is so much more important. The game
allows you to be exposed and it teaches you. You have to be aware of that.  
Not a whole lot we can do except raise the consciousness of our peers and
young people. I think Sylvia was detected as a result of going to get a health
checkup, which is positive from the standpoint that it didn't get a chance to
grow a whole lot more because at least it was detected at some earlier stage.
We have to encourage that.  
We also have to keep working hard to raise money for research so that
hopefully in the future we have a cure for it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: She is as tough and feisty as any coach, man or woman, in the
ACC, that is for sure.  
Let's talk about the team this year. Give me your sense of what you've seen
after a couple weeks of practicing with the guys. They need to fill a big void
left by Michael Snaer.  
COACH HAMILTON: The biggest void we have to fill now is the gap where we have
been on the defensive end and where we were last year. We did a difficult time
with our guys understanding defensive principles that we put in place and have
been successful with over the last 15 or 20 years. It was having seven
first‑year players accepting the fundamentals that go along with playing the
kind of defense that we played was more challenging than we expected.  
On the offensive end, I think we've improved in our potential offensively
because the ability of these guys, attack the basket off the dribble. They've
all improved the perimeter game. My three big guys have improved tremendously.  
I'm encouraged by the skill development of our team. I think the success of
this team as I look toward the year will have a lot to do with our maturing,
maturation process coming full circle with them being consistent with our
defensive principles. They're going to give us tremendous effort, they've
shown they're capable of doing that. I think we're going to be much better
offensively.  
I'm encouraged. It's whether or not we can win it with a sophomore‑dominated
team. A lot has to do with the maturity and how much progress they make from
the mental and emotional standpoint. Physical, we came light‑years from where
we were last year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Do you think they need to get they have to play defense?  
COACH HAMILTON: When you take over programs like I have over the number of
years, rebuilding projects, I think we've done a good job at Florida State
over the last eight years doing that. You don't always get the elite offensive
players or elite players, but you have to find a way, something that everybody
can do that doesn't necessarily require the quickness, speed or athleticism.  
We've tried to develop a defensive scheme that allows us to be successful
while we're developing our offensive skills or improving our talent level.
Maybe because you're not as talented as someone else doesn't give you an
excuse not to be successful.  
Now that we're getting better players, we still maintain that same level of
defense. It's just that sometimes it's more difficult for a freshman and
first‑year players to learn that defensive system than it is more experienced
players. I think that's what we went through. Hopefully we'll be further along
this year and the learning curve won't be the same.  
  
Q. With the newcomers, Syracuse, Pitt, Notre Dame making the transition, can
you talk about the identity of ACC basketball, the kind of transition those
teams will have to make in order to fit into what this conference is all
about?  
COACH HAMILTON: In the first place, I don't think there will be much of a
transition challenge for those teams. They're well‑coached, all have talent.
From a basketball standpoint, there are so many more similarities than there
are differences.  
I think the main thing as I see, what's getting ready to happen, when I say
'we,' I mean me, the coaches, the media, to really understand what has been
happening in the ACC.  
There has never been a conference of consistent, competitive programs
assembled in one conference. North Carolina is the third winningest program in
the history, Duke is fourth, Syracuse is five, Louisville is 14, North
Carolina State I believe is 25, Pittsburgh might be 49. Along with that,
Georgia Tech has played in the Final Four, Wake Forest has played in the Final
Four, Virginia has been to the Final Four. Now you're talking about a
collection of basketball programs now where every night is going to be
exciting.  
You're going to have Final Four‑type atmospheres in a competitive nature
unlike what you've seen. It's going to be elevated to what we've seen in the
past because of the nature of those four, with Louisville, coming to our
league.  
What has happened over the years, I think sometimes the two consistent
flagship programs in our league, Duke and Carolina, when they have stumbled
against some of the other programs who have been inconsistent, that has been
conceived as a negative.  
Now it's going to create a competitive scenario. Now the success gets spread
around, it's going to elevate the status similar to what happened in the Big
East. I think they got more teams in because of the image protected by so many
of their programs being rich, traditional programs, some of them basketball
only.  
I think the new teams bring that aura to our league that is going to make a
great conference amazing.  
JEFF FISCHEL: When we had the guys in here earlier, they talked about the trip
to Greece. You had a little smirk there. What were you laughing about?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think it was a tremendous educational experience for us from
a cultural standpoint, seeing the birthplace of civilization, all the things
that happened. It was worthwhile from that standpoint, evaluating their
culture, eating their food, adjusting.  
But we had an eye‑opening experience playing against the Greece national team
every day. That was unlike any experience I've ever had. Normally when you go
out of the country, you play against some lower‑division club teams that
you're successful against. That was not the case here. This is their Olympic
team. This is their EuroCup team. High level of competitiveness. Obviously it
being their national team, preparing for the EuroCup, they didn't want a
college team to come in and overshadow them.  
The first encounter, we were kind of close because of our athleticism, size.
The second encounter, they put us in our place. They showed us how European
basketball is played.  
Our guys learned from that. They were making six, seven, eight passes in a
24‑second shot clock. The third encounter we adjusted. We practiced. We only
played one public scrimmage, but had five or six competitive practice sessions
that I really thought helped our players learn how to play, which I really
felt was extremely beneficial.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You talked about how you exposed them to the culture. They said
they resorted to burgers the last few days.  
COACH HAMILTON: They enjoyed the food. Those were the kids hamming it up
again. I have never eaten such good food in my life. If you take a trip to
Greece, you won't starve. Their culture has the most tasty food I've tasted in
a while.  
JEFF FISCHEL: They also brought up you don't agree on your taste in music.  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, see, the only hobby I have is I collect old‑school DVDs,
a lot of the music that their parents used to listen to. I have a collection
of about 500 of them that I can go all the way back to Frankie Valli in 1964
with The Four Seasons, to some of the most modern people you know. Sometimes I
think our players, they want to hear all the hip hop and the rap music. I
don't have that in my collection (smiling).  
JEFF FISCHEL: Florida State head coach, appreciate it. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia Tech head coach Brian Gregory.  
Let's set where with this team is right now. How do you feel about heading
into the season?  
COACH GREGORY: I like the progress we've made. I said sometimes you go into
the second year of a rebuilding job, rebuilding phase, you're worried you're
going to have to take a step backwards in order to take two or three steps
forward later. You have your first recruiting class. Those freshmen are going
to play. We started three freshmen.  
But I felt good starting those three freshmen, then having some guys play
different roles than they've ever played before. I thought they took a step
forward before. I thought we were able to become more solid on the defensive
end, rebounding‑wise, did some good things.  
Our inconsistency was a big key. I think we lost five games in the league in
the last minute and a half of the game. We were able to put forth a challenge
to the guys and say, These things are working, these are things we need to
improve on. I think our guys really embraced that.  
THE MODERATOR: Four returning starters. That puts you in a good position.  
COACH GREGORY: It really does. When you look at it, the three freshmen that
are now sophomores, they need to make a big jump in their game. Daniel Miller
as a senior was asked and challenged last year to move away from being kind of
a complementary player and be a main focus of both our defensive game plan and
some offensive stuff. He's All‑ACC on the defensive end. I thought he did a
great job.  
We benefit from the fact of having Kam Holsey, who is start of a sixth
starter. He has starter production a lot of times. I do like the fact that
nucleus is back and poised to continue to move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: A couple fans have asked about Trae Golden.  
COACH GREGORY: No news yet. All the paperwork is in. We wanted to make sure
that everything was done to its utmost in terms of the information and so
forth. The NCAA is just waiting to kind of go through it.  
I would hope probably within another week or two before our last exhibition
game. But someone asked, Has it been a challenge in practice? It really hasn't
been because those first two weeks that we've just completed, all we've been
doing is competing against each other as opposed to who is in a starting
lineup. It was more we got 13 scholarship guys, six on one team, seven on the
other, let's get after it. I think he's helped that.  
We'll just have to wait and see.  
THE MODERATOR: Obviously you develop a bond with these guys over time. Who do
think Coach Gregory is?  
COACH GREGORY: Hopefully a really good guy (smiling).  
I think now you look at someone like Daniel or Kam, this is their third year
of playing for me, I think they understand I'm a demanding coach, that I want
the best for them, will give them every resource and tool needed to become the
very best. But with that, their responsibility is to meet us halfway and give
great effort.  
I think they do understand that I believe that the excellence I want them to
achieve is more of a daily habit. Those two guys in particular have really
grown in terms of their daily approach to becoming not only a great player,
but both those guys are going to graduate this year. All three of our seniors
are going to graduate.  
I know they know there's an attention to detail that I want them to live their
life by.  
THE MODERATOR: Last year, our set had every school's name on the back. As you
were walking up, you were looking specifically to see where Georgia Tech was
up there.  
COACH GREGORY: It was in the corner.  
THE MODERATOR: We realized you were looking to make sure Georgia Tech was
prominently placed.  
COACH GREGORY: The other thing we really try to stress, there's a great pride
in putting on a Georgia Tech uniform, when you look at the guys that have worn
those uniforms in the past. There's a great pride in playing in this league.
This is the best basketball league in the country by far. To play in this
league, you have to make sure that every single day you're striving to become
a little bit better and you're ready to go. If not, this league is going to
eat you up.  
That's the way it should be. Our guys have a great pride in wearing that
uniform. They take great pride in playing in this league.  
THE MODERATOR: You talked about how tough this conference is. It's gotten
tougher. 1 through 15, this is a battle for you every night.  
COACH GREGORY: Every single night. I think as a program, we're in the same
position with other programs like Wake Forest, Boston College, Clemson,
Maryland, Florida State, Virginia, schools fighting to take another step along
the process, knowing that three tremendous premiere, elite programs in the
country have just joined the league.  
As we've moved forward, it's going to be interesting to see how far and in
comparison, because right now from top to bottom, the markings of a great
league is not only to be strong up top, but also for the emerging teams to
continue to improve and not only be successful in the league, but also have
post‑season success. I think this league is poised to do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Last year you were talking about the renovation of your arena, the
emphasis on bringing back a lot of the former players, getting them involved
with the tradition of the program. Can you update us on how that's going?  
COACH GREGORY: The arena is wonderful. We get compliments on it every single
day. Every opposing coach has enjoyed playing there in terms of just the new
facility. I know they enjoy the new locker rooms that they have. They don't
have to walk a mile‑and‑a‑half to get from the locker room to the court.  
Our attempt to get our history and our former players back involved over the
last two years I think has been met with tremendous success. I appreciate them
because they've had to take some steps, too. We can reach out. Unless they
want to be part of the program, want to continue to help us rebuild the
program, then it's not going to work.  
They're passionate about Georgia Tech. I saw a tweet last week from Kenny
Anderson. He said, There's only one school for me, Georgia Tech took care of
me. That's what you want to see. We're starting to build that.  
One of the most important things is for our current guys to understand that,
that they're part of something special, to see the special guys that have been
here in the past.  
THE MODERATOR: Are you putting a number on wins? How do you recognize success
for the season?  
COACH GREGORY: Again, the question mark is the change in those 18 games you're
playing. In addition, what we've done, because I felt we were going to be a
better team, and there's no question we're a better team right now, better
than at any point than last year. What does that end up being in terms of wins
and losses? How does that translate? That's going to be the question.  
But I think everybody in our program is excited about us taking another step
forward. With that comes hopefully more wins.  
THE MODERATOR: You're in a big city that has a lot of great basketball at the
high school level. Seems like you've focused on making Georgia Tech.  
COACH GREGORY: You can't have everybody from the state of Georgia, but you can
try. I think that's one thing we've done in our first two years. We are going
to make Georgia Tech an option for the best players in the state of Georgia,
that understand that playing in the ACC, what that means, going to school at
Georgia Tech, what that means, where those two combined place you during your
career at the next step, then your career after you're done playing
basketball. We've had pretty good success in doing that.  
At the same time Georgia Tech and the ACC has a national brand as well. Being
able to recruit out of that footprint, in different states, is something that
we've been working hard on, as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck this season. Thanks for coming through.  
COACH GREGORY: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: I'm with Mark Gottfried from NC State.  
Do you need name tags for your team this year?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Yes. Lots of them. We have a new team, different team. It's
going to be a fun team I think to watch, watch them grow and develop.  
Yeah, we don't have a lot of the veteran guys like a lot of teams do.  
JEFF FISCHEL: It's somewhat symptomatic of what college basketball is right
now. There's a lot of change year after year.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think there's a lot of change. We obviously see more guys
leave for the NBA. We see more young guys in our sport transfer. Sometimes we
benefit from that because kids do transfer.  
We're also in a situation, when I got the job two years ago, we had a nucleus
of players that returned. We had them for two years. They won 48 games. They
did a lot of great things. Went to back‑to‑back tournaments. Now that group is
gone.  
It's somewhat for us like you're turning the page. Now it's a new time to
build, a new group of guys. I think from that perspective it's going to be
real interesting.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. Is this going to be an easier or tougher coaching job than last year for
you?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: That's a good question. I think in one respect it's going to
be tougher because this is a group that has to learn a lot and you want to get
competitive. We want to become an NCAA tournament basketball team. How are we
going to do that? I don't know that's an easy thing for this group because we
have so many questions, unknowns with our team.  
At times last year you took a veteran team. It's nice to know that Scott Wood
is going to score and make threes every night, Richard Howell is going to get
12 rebounds, Lorenzo, you could go on and on and on.  
Practice is different with a group of young players. When we start playing
games, there's going to be a great learning curve for this group because
they're just not going to know yet how to win or how to execute things they
need to execute to win a game.  
It's going to be interesting with our group.  
  
Q. Talk about a lot of newness on your side with your squad. Talk about the
new teams coming in.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: We've kind of got the double whammy a little bit. We've lost
some great players. We may take a step back so we can eventually take a step
forward.  
At the same time the league got better, tougher, deeper. We've added in three
high‑quality teams this year that have great expectations, that expect to be
in the NCAA tournament, that expect to potentially be in a Final Four like
Syracuse was this year.  
It's going to make it more difficult than it normally would. I think it's also
going to make it more fun. You want to play against the best, beat the best. I
think this league is becoming clearly the best basketball conference in the
country.  
For us, we have to get good quick. These young guys we have, they understand
it. They get it. That's why they chose to play at NC State.  
  
Q. With the expectations being set where they are because your group is so
new, is there a thought that the promise of big wins could be even bigger and
sweeter this season should they occur home or away?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think there's probably a little truth to that. I think if
our team finds a way to become good enough to compete with the best teams in
this league, I think they are going to be really special. Although I will tell
you, beating North Carolina and Duke last year, Duke was No.1 in the country,
that was pretty special, too, at that time, even with a veteran group.  
We're a program that's trying to take steps, to build ourselves up to where we
can be one of the best teams in this league. We got a young group that's going
to be somewhat the foundation that we've laid here as we move forward from the
last two years.  
  
Q. Break down the new pieces you have, Rolston Turner.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Rolston Turner is a player, the good news is he's played in
the SEC, played at this level. He's been a good player for LSU. He sat out
last year. He understands everything we're doing. He took advantage of a
redshirt year.  
Outside of that, all these other guys are brand‑new to this level. Cat Barber
is a point guard that we're excited about. Got a chance to become a great
player. He's as good of an on‑ball defender as I've ever had.  
Desmond Lee is a junior college player we've been impressed with every day.
About 6'3". A guy I think that can help our team this year.  
Then we have three interior young freshmen guys, Lennard Freeman, Kyle
Washington, T.J. Warren. Each day it's different. Each day one of them will be
good, the next day somebody else will be good. The good news is they're all
trying, have phenomenal attitudes. They want to become good.  
We've got some new pieces, guys that haven't done anything at our level, they
have to step forward and become good.  
  
Q. You were talking about the players leaving early. Would you like to see
the rule changed where they have to stay longer than the one ‑and‑done?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think there's a lot of ways to look at that. I think if
you're going to have a situation where players have to come to college, like
we do now, one year is not enough, in my opinion. I would like to see three
years, like baseball, or even the NFL. I would like for players that are good
enough to go out of high school to have the opportunity to go out of high
school.  
When you look back at LeBron, Kobe, Kevin Garnett, some of those guys, I don't
know we can say it was a bad thing for them. For some of those guys it worked
out pretty well.  
I'd like to see guys have an opportunity to work towards their degree. If they
were in school for three years, if the NBA doesn't work out, professional
basketball ends at some point, now they have a chance where they're in
striking distance to get a college education, their degree.  
The one‑year rule in place now I think might be the worst part about it. It's
the worst way we could do it.  
I'm not the commissioner of the NBA or the president of the NCAA. If I was for
a day, I'd try to find a way to get that done.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Coach, thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Nick Faust](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25082)

### [Evan Smotrycz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25961)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Time to talk Maryland Terrapins. I'm excited about Friday night.
Your Midnight Madness. Nick, what is that going to be like?  
NICK FAUST: It will be a great thing. Growing up, I always watched guys
playing there. It's going to be a great opportunity for us and something we're
looking forward to as a program.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Fans are excited about it. Plenty of history in that building.
Supposed to be packed. Hopefully it goes well.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Evan, excited to get back on the court?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Yeah, it's been a great. Like you said, just looking forward to
getting back out there.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The season coming up. Nick, you finished strong. Is that a good
building block for this season?  
NICK FAUST: Definitely. Last season we felt as though it was a couple games we
fell short, didn't put us in the NCAA tournament.  
Coming back this year, it's definitely a motivation for us and we're looking
forward to it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. It's nothing to do with you guys obviously, but do you anticipate being
villains everywhere you go this year?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Yeah, I think no matter where we're playing, who we're playing,
ACC road games are going to be tough. We're looking forward to getting tough
road wins and using it as résumé builders.  
I don't think that it's because our last year in the ACC anything will be
crazier than usual.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Ready for some fired‑up crowds, Nick?  
NICK FAUST: Definitely. I'm ready for it. Been playing here the last two
years. This year we just feel as though we're more mature and our guys have a
lot of experience. We're looking forward to those big road wins.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How does this team change without Alex in the middle, Nick?  
NICK FAUST: It's a big difference. Alex was a presence offensively and
defensively, more so on the defensive side. His presence was a must.  
This year it's a more so gap‑building defense, building out, guarding,
pressuring the ball. It's more so on the ball defense in the past two years
where before, it was a lot of help side, things like that.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How is this team different than last year, Evan?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: We got a lot of guys coming back with major minutes under their
belt. Still a young team, but we got a lot of experience. I think that will
definitely pay off for us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Obviously, Nick, you're one of the returning starters along with
Dez Wells. Off the court, what is Dez like?  
NICK FAUST: He's a funny guy. He laughs a lot. On the court he's just so
serious.  
Dez is a great player. He just wants to win. He always has a will to win and
does whatever it takes.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Evan, describe Dez.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Dez battles every play. He hates to lose. I think that rubs off
on whoever is on his team in practice that day. He definitely gets guys going.
He's a big‑time motivator. I think me and Nick are learning how to do the
same.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We talked about how this team is changing a little bit without
Alex. Does that mean we're going to see up‑tempo? Is that what coach wants to
see?  
NICK FAUST: Yeah, for sure. Having Evan and Jake, guys like that who can
really stretch the floor. Evan can also play a little five at times. We'll
definitely be a running team. Having them two on the court at the same time is
dangerous. Leaves open driving lanes and things like that which will help us
out a lot.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think we have a team who can do a lot of different things
well. Real versatile, guys that can score in a number of different ways.  
As long as we get stops and we're able to get out and run, I think we'll be
tough to stop.  
JEFF FISCHEL: New look this year including 15 schools. Nick, how does this
change the conference? You're looking at now three great programs you have to
battle against.  
NICK FAUST: Yeah. They're all great teams. I can remember playing Notre Dame
my freshman year. It was a great game. We came out with the win, but it was a
tough one.  
Playing those teams is definitely something we're looking forward to. You come
to college to play on the big stage. It will be a great experience.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think it's great for the league. I think it's a great chance
to get a lot of good wins within the league, build your résumé come Selection
Sunday.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What is it like having to answer questions all day long?  
NICK FAUST: It's difficult at times, kind of annoying. But it's something
you've got to deal with (smiling).  
The question of the day is, What do you feel is the better conference, ACC or
Big Ten? You're like, They're both good conferences.  
It's a great experience overall, but something you have to deal with.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Is that the question you've been asked the most?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Yeah. I kind of have an interesting perspective. Like Nick
said, it doesn't really matter who we're playing against. For me personally,
I'll just be happy to be playing, period.  
JEFF FISCHEL: There are a few guys that are transfers. It's not like you're
hurt, you have to sit out a year. Take us what it's like through that season.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Game days are the worst, watching games you could be helping
in, feeling helpless.  
At the same time there's a lot of free time to kind of put towards your game.
You're not able to travel. It's a lot of hours in the gym. I think it
definitely benefited me seeing the game a different way, being able to devote
so much time to improving.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Are we going to see a different Evan on the court?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think I kind of can be able to make the right plays, make
easy plays, create for myself as well as others. I think just overall
improvements in athleticism, shooting the ball. Everything in general.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Nick, who is the one guy on the team you think is ready to take
a big step forward this season?  
NICK FAUST: Big step forward, I would say Jake Layman. He's matured a lot.
He's knocking down shots at a high rate right now. He's definitely going to be
a big contribution to the team because he can really stroke it when it's
going.  
JEFF FISCHEL: People on Twitter love his hair.  
NICK FAUST: Hair is gone.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I'd probably go with Jake, too. A lot more mature team. Guys
have made great strides. Jake in particular has been playing really well.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Mark Turgeon is in his third season at Maryland. Nick, talk
about how he's tried to build the program in his image.  
NICK FAUST: Coach just wants a team who is going to be committed to him,
committed to what he wants. Over the years I've seen him grow. Actually this
year he says this is the beginning where he's been the most relaxed. My
freshman, sophomore year, it was more so depending on young guys to come in,
step up, make a contribution right away. You have older guys now with more
experience who are going to make that step for the team.  
Definitely having him around and having him believe in us is a great feeling.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think coach is first a defensive‑minded coach. Early stages
of practice, that's really what he stressed. He made sure he established that
before we even started getting into offense.  
I think we'll be pretty solid there despite losing Alex. We'll just have to
focus on ball pressure.  
  
Q. How has Roddy Peters looked?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think he's ready to help right away. Great in the open court.
He sees the game pretty well for as fast as he's moving. Sometimes you have to
kind of slow him down when coach wants us to get into a set or stuff.  
He's learning. I think he'll definitely be able to contribute right away.  
NICK FAUST: Like Evan said, Roddy is playing pretty well. Kind of has a John
Wall style of play. Open transition in the fast court.  
JEFF FISCHEL: 25 wins last year, but you didn't get into the NCAA tournament.
Nick, what are the goals for this team this year?  
NICK FAUST: The goal for us is definitely to make it to the NCAA tournament.
That's the next step for us. Our freshmen year making no post‑season play.
We're ready to make that next step.  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think, yeah, like Nick said, make the tournament. I think we
have the strength of schedule that we'll be able to do that and get a lot of
strong wins early.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck this season. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [C.J. Fair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23639)

### [Baye Moussa Keita](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25953)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: Pleased to be joined by some of the new guys, Syracuse Orange.
Had a good run in the NCAA tournament. Let's start with the Syracuse press.  
  
Q. Talk about what you're most excited about.  
C.J. FAIR: I say I'm most excited about just playing new teams, being in a new
league. You see this league on TV a lot. It's going to be a fun, exciting
year.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Like C.J. say, going into a new conference, playing
different teams. We've been in the Big East a long time. Kind of excited about
seeing the new conference.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You have to replace three guys that were double‑digit scorers.
Give me a sense offensively what Syracuse is going to look like.  
C.J. FAIR: We going to have some new faces scoring the ball.  
This year we got a big front court. We got a new backcourt as far as our
freshman point guard, sophomore and freshman guard.  
We're going to have a good team this year. You just got to get the freshmen
feet wet, know what to expect. It's me and Baye's job to be leaders of this
team.  
  
Q. Joining the league now, what is the difference between getting ready and
traveling to Duke for a game as opposed to going to Providence or
Georgetown?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: I think there won't be a lot of difference. We'll get into
our game routine. The coach is going to get the scouting. We're going to go
ahead and do the same thing.  
It's going to be a little bit different playing different teams. Apart from
that, we'll just go about playing like we did in the Big East.  
C.J. FAIR: Like Baye said, we face a new opponent. Everything is going to be
new to us. We just got to handle our emotions and excitement, just stick to
our game plan.  
  
Q. Is there a team that you're going to miss playing the most? Is there a
team you're most looking forward to playing?  
C.J. FAIR: I'm not going to say I'm going to miss playing a team (smiling). I
know you hear a lot of talk about Duke and North Carolina, Tobacco Road, stuff
like that.  
I'm excited to be facing new teams. That's really what I'm excited about.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Like C.J. say, every conference you go into, there's going
to be a good competition. We're excited for that. Even though there's a lot of
rivalry between us and Georgetown, this is a new conference, so we're going to
have new rivals. We're excited about that, too.  
  
Q. Talking about Duke specifically, reports out yesterday less than a day
after tickets went on sale, they only have seats on the opposite end of the
dome. Record crowd expected. When you get a big stage like that, how much does
that get your juices flowing?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: We heard yesterday the dome is sold out. It's going to be a
good game. Just like we play Georgetown, the dome is always full. It's going
to be a good game, and like C.J. say, handle our emotion. Every time we play a
big team, there's a lot of excitement.  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, Duke and North Carolina come to the dome, I know a lot of our
offense want to witness that. We just got to handle our part, use the crowd to
our advantage, pull off a victory.  
  
Q. C.J., why did you ultimately decide to come back for your senior year,
not go to the NBA?  
C.J. FAIR: I just thought it would be best for me to come back. I went home
and talked to my family about, weighed the pros and cons.  
Leaving school early is definitely a big risk. I think for me coming back was
best for me and better my chances at the next level.  
  
Q. Talk about following up the Final Four with five freshmen now on the
squad, the challenge of that.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: You know, everybody was saying we have five freshmen.
That's really good. We went to Canada, played four games there, show up, see
what everybody have. Like C.J. said, we're leading them every day in practice.  
I think they're going to be good. Between high school and this level, a whole
different level. We're going to try to push them to be better. They've been
good so far during practice. We're going to wait to start the season and see
what we have down the road.  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, we went to the Final Four last year. So we got a taste of it.
This year our goal is to complete the job being in the Final Four.  
As far as our freshmen, we got a lot of talented freshmen. When we took the
Canada trip, you could really see how they operate, how they play. I was very
impressed. A lot of them exceeded my expectations for them.  
  
Q. C.J., you and I climbed up to the dome last year. Can you imagine five or
six games where people are sitting that far away? What does that do for you as
a player?  
C.J. FAIR: You just know that occasion, the enjoyment the fans get out of
watching us play.  
For me as a player, you just want to go out there and get the fans starting to
appreciate, by honoring them, play your best, play hard.  
  
Q. Bringing Pittsburgh and Notre Dame in, what is it going to be like to
keep those rivals going?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Pittsburgh is always a tough team to play, and Notre Dame,
too. We're going to Pittsburgh this year, and they're coming to the dome. It's
going to be a tough competition like usual.  
Keeping the rivalry going is a big thing. We're excited to go back to
Pittsburgh because it's a really, really, really tough place to play.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I want to thank Syracuse. Good luck this season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Ben Emelogu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25951)

### [Joey Van Zegeren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25952)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We lead off with Virginia Tech. Ben, talk about your
relationship with your coach.  
BEN EMELOGU: He's a player's coach. He loves us like our sons. He doesn't have
a family. He treats us just like his kids.  
Every day he asks us how we're doing. We know that he loves us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Joe, your thoughts on coach?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: I agree. When I first met James, he was an assistant coach.
When he got the job, I thought he was right in spot for that. Knowing him as a
person, he doesn't try to be a player's coach. It comes natural to him.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Have you seen him change from an assistant coach to a head
coach?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: I have seen him change. But I think he brings a lot of
experience with him from the assistant coach job. He knows how to deal in
certain situations and certain players.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What are the goals you and coach have set for the team this
year.  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: We're trying to get an ACC championship and then get the
NCAAs.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Ben, what are your goals?  
BEN EMELOGU: Helping my team out, have fun.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Who is your favorite player?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: My favorite player at the moment is Kevin Durant.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Why?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: I think he's versatile, athletic. I like the way he's a team
player.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Ben, who do you look up to?  
BEN EMELOGU: Kevin Durant.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What is the one app on your phone you can't live without?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: I'd have to say Skype. I'm from overseas. I Skype a lot with
my family.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Do you feel like it's hard being away from home so much?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: It's kind of hard, but I've gotten used to it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How many years have you been away from home now?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: Five, six years.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Ben, what do you listen to on your iPod?  
BEN EMELOGU: I listen to Jayco, Wally, very lyrical rapers.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's talk about Blacksburg. What has your first experience been
like?  
BEN EMELOGU: The people there are great. They're very kind and loving. So I'm
liking the city. I can't miss home at all. That speaks for itself.  
  
Q. Last thing before I let you go and move on. You're dealing with cameras,
is that fun for you or something you have to do as part of the job being a
college basketball player?  
JOEY VAN ZEGEREN: I see it as fun.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good start to the day.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Steve Donahue from Boston College.  
Steve, you have a rare opportunity this year. You get to coach five returning
starters. Obviously the game of college basketball has changed a lot. Talk
about that opportunity.  
COACH DONAHUE: I think obviously it's a very unique situation in this day and
age, especially high major basketball, where you can bring in a group of kids
as freshmen, play them a lot, lose, go through some values, build on that,
bring in a couple more guys, then have the opportunity to reward your team
hopefully with all the hard work and perseverance, experience that they gain.  
Hopefully you have a great season based on all the things you worked on.  
An opportunity that wouldn't have presented itself unless we actually started
them as freshmen, as we did.  
THE MODERATOR: Is it hard to have the long view?  
COACH DONAHUE: I've unfortunately coached some really bad teams in my day. My
experience at Cornell taught me a lot. I never really judge my teams on wins
and losses. That's kind of coach's speak. But I don't. I do it on quality of
growth. That means individually, that means collectively, physically,
mentally.  
I just thought when I got this job, I talked to my AD, I said, We got a chance
to be okay the first year. We had a really good year. Tied for fourth. But
years two and three are going to be building. Are you with me on that? Sure.
Okay, let's go.  
I think my experience, as I said, at Cornell helped me prepare for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Am I right in thinking that you had all five starters back in 2010 at
Cornell? Talk about anything you draw off that experience this year.  
COACH DONAHUE: We had five starters back. Very similar scenarios in how we
built that, what we did here.  
I was very fortunate. I know it's crazy. There was a clean cut from our
program that the former regime had after one year. At the time, in April of
that year, I had one scholarship player on campus, one player. Nine guys were
coming. I think that was a good thing, to be quite honest. We could do what we
did at Cornell, have veteran guys work together, play together.  
My experience told me that after about 50 college games, if you get a kid who
can play, start 30 minutes, go through 50 games, early in their career, after
I think you get a kid who figures it out. I think that's what you saw when we
won five out of seven at the end. You saw a group that really understood what
they were in for every night.  
They understood what to expect. I thought you saw a team that was able to
succeed once they figured that all out.  
  
Q. You knew what Big East basketball was like. Coming to the ACC, is there a
different brand of basketball down here? Talk about the challenge of making
that transition.  
COACH DONAHUE: Obviously for me personally, dramatically different play from
Ivy League. I was 20 years in the Ivy League.  
Syracuse, I think they are in for an eye‑opening experience. The basketball is
dramatically different, not because it's in the south, but just because of the
programs.  
That's the great thing about college basketball, unlike the NBA, teams are
dramatically different. The style of play in this league is dramatically
different than the grind‑it‑out physicality of the Big East. Doesn't mean
they're not going to be successful, it's just different. A different flow to
the game.  
I think our league is very unique in that all the places are on campus as
opposed to the Big East where you're going to Madison Square Garden, Verizon
Center, Wells Fargo, the dome. I think the home court is a huge advantage. I
think those are things that those three schools are going to see as
eye‑opening.  
  
Q. We had Ryan and Olivier in here this morning. Break down their games, how
they've developed.  
COACH DONAHUE: Both have done a terrific job since they arrived on campus. How
we end up with those two guys, they weren't finished products in high school.
Ryan was probably overlooked, probably a little heavy, not the most athletic
guy coming out of high school. Basically he's transformed his body. Now you
see a kid who I think overachieved dramatically because of his physical
limitations. That's because he's young, going against great athletes. He's
physically fit, older, stronger. He has that knack of scoring the basketball.
He has different ways of scoring. He rebounds, has an ability to track the
ball down that you can't teach.  
Olivier, the biggest thing coming into college basketball, he's never been
asked to score. He's always been a kid that tried to fit in. His AAU, high
school, he didn't know if he had the ability to really score. When he was
asked to score last year, he's got a special ability to score the basketball
in different ways, and he works at it. As hard a worker that I've ever coached
on his individual game.  
When you get a kid that's that talented and works at it, I think that's what
you saw in Olivier.  
  
Q. Obviously with the five starters back, expectations are going to be
pretty high out there. Now you have Syracuse, Pitt and Notre Dame coming in to
make it harder. Is it like, Not this year?  
COACH DONAHUE: I think it's a great thing for us. I think it's a great thing
for Boston College to have even a better league. If you look at our non‑league
schedule, I think we have arguably the best non‑league schedule in the
country. We're playing five true road games, another four neutral games. No
one does that. We have only three guarantee games.  
My feeling is that we can't afford to be at BC, play a lot of average to
mediocre teams, go 12‑2, then have a triple‑digit RPI and expect to win 13
games in this league.  
We're going to have to somehow win big games November, December, January and
February knowing that we're going to lose a lot as well. That's the whole game
now. The NCAA tournament is the RPI Invitational.  
I invite better teams in our league, I really do. Gives you more opportunities
to win big games, improve your RPI, make an impact on the Selection Committee.  
  
Q. Was there a game during the course of the season last year where you saw
your guys turn a corner and you started to feel the things you were imparting
on them was being absorbed in the proper fashion?  
COACH DONAHUE: Cut it in half. The pre‑season still felt like the year before.
We struggled. We lose to Bryant. Still not feeling like we're there.  
We go into the league and we play NC State, if you remember, really well, a
very talented team. Then from that point on, I say we're going to be fine. We
played Duke and Miami to one‑point losses at home. We beat a really good
Virginia team with a buzzer‑beater down 12. I think that day is when I
probably felt the best about my team, where we were heading. Felt really good
about fighting through adversity, beating a good team, down by 12. I think
that's probably the moment that it really hit me.  
  
Q. A moment ago you said to take the league out of it, this new conference
is good for BC. Talk about the conference as a whole. Does this have the
potential to be what SEC is to college football, be the dominant conference
year in and year out?  
COACH DONAHUE: I think it definitely has the potential. I say this 'cause I
think we all have to do a very good job in our non‑conference. I'm trying to
do my part for the league. I think we should all schedule up. Everybody's
situation's different. Job security, all that.  
That being said, if we do that, I think we can be the most dominant amateur
athletic conference that's ever been put together. No one has put this type of
résumé together. Hall of Fame coaches, national championships, incredible
traditional power basketball programs. Never been put together like this.  
No one has been bad. This is not against the Big East when they got 11 bids.
There's five bad teams in that league, traditional bad teams for 20 years.
Everybody in this league has been to the tournament since 2007. There's no bad
program.  
We have a great opportunity to set the bar that's never been set before.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck on a great season.  
COACH DONAHUE: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We have Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon.  
Have you accidentally said Big East instead of ACC at some point today?  
COACH DIXON: It's been a long day. I might have used the Big West, Big Sky
back in the day.  
We've been talking about it for so long, two years, it's finally here. So we
are excited.  
But, no, I think we're well aware who we're playing against this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We can take questions.  
  
Q. After coaching in the Big East, what have you been told about ACC
conference play? What are you expecting?  
COACH DIXON: What have we been told? First of all, we're excited. We think
it's great. We found our home. We've been talking about for so many years
where we were going to be, what conference we were going to be in. That's been
going on for about 10 years for us, given our location, given our situation
with the Big East.  
We're just excited. It's good to be asked, What's it like to be in the ACC,
rather than what conference you're in.  
Who are we going to play? We're going to play the best teams in the country.
That's what we were doing before. That's what we're doing now.  
I went down to the Duke football game a couple weeks ago. We had a lot of Pitt
people there at the game. I think people are going to find, we have a lot of
fans that have ties to Pitt that live in this area, in this region. That's
exciting.  
I saw that with the Duke game we saw down here. A lot of fans that live down
here, whenever the steel industry closed down. There's a lot of ties with Pitt
fans down here.  
I think it's great. I think it's a great tie‑in. I think it's something that
we'll show with the following that we get from Pitt people.  
  
Q. You come in with Syracuse and Notre Dame. When you get together with
those teams, is it going to be back to the Big East rough and tough days or
are you going to change a little bit?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, we're going to change Coach Boeheim, how he does
everything, change him overnight (smiling).  
I think Coach Brey, he's changed over the years. Coach Boeheim has changed in
slight ways with his zone, little things that he does with it. But we're
always trying to tinker and improve as coaches.  
But we just had the three of us together for a little sit‑down. Good friends,
great respect for both of the programs. I think maybe there's some familiarity
with those guys and the coaches due to playing against each other, being on
committees together.  
There's 15 really good teams. We're going to be all fighting for a spot.  
  
Q. The Big East had the reputation of being a very physical league. Do you
anticipate a big change coming to the ACC?  
COACH DIXON: I think what's going to happen here is you've gone from eight
teams now to 15 teams over the years. You're going to see a lot of different
styles in the ACC. You're going to bring in teams that play a lot of zone in
both Notre Dame and Syracuse obviously. You got teams that are going to come
in and press some with Louisville.  
What I found in the Big East, because we found it, too, we were nine teams,
ten teams, I was there 15 years, we saw changes in the membership, we saw
changes in the style of play. I think that's what happens. I think you're
going to see more styles of play just because there's more teams, first off,
and you're not playing each team twice, you're going to play them once. You're
going to see pressing teams, zone teams, matchup zone teams, switching teams.
You're going to see different things.  
I think it's going to make it better for us as programs, too, because you're
going to see all different types. I think the ACC has been basically
man‑to‑man. With our league, you've seen everything. It's going to be hard to
label it. It's going to be labeled because that's what people got to do. They
got to have a headline, got to have something to attach to it.  
The reality is there's a lot of diversity, a lot of different styles in the
Big East. Oftentimes we've been labeled and we've been far from what that
label has been. We've been one of the best teams offensively in the country.
The numbers surely indicate it. The people that do the analysis of it all show
how good we have been offensively. Yet if we're labeled, they'll say we're the
physical defensive team. The numbers would prove something completely
different.  
I think you're going to see a lot more style. I think at the end of the day
that's going to make us better teams, especially when going to the NCAA
tournament. We'll be better prepared because of playing against more teams
obviously, because there's 15, but more styles that are going to develop
because of the different teams coming in.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You mentioned stats. Do you look at those?  
COACH DIXON: We definitely do. To me that's always been important than points
per game, but the pace of the game can change based on who you're playing
against. Points per possession is very important. We always look at that, look
at what we do each time we have the ball, how we're guarding it or attacking
with it. We've always looked at that and been really good at both ends.  
With our record, you have to be pretty good on both sides of the court,
offense and defense. We've done that consistently year in, year out.  
We're trying to get better, improve in that. We're trying to win national
championships. We haven't done that. That's been our failure. That's what
we're trying to do.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You lose Trey and Steven. You have three big returning starters
back. Talk about where you are.  
COACH DIXON: Last year we were an inexperienced team on the perimeter. Then we
got pretty much everybody back except Trey on the perimeter. One year to the
next, you're probably an experienced team on the perimeter. That's how it
works now in college basketball. One year makes you young to old. That's the
situation we're in.  
Yet our post guys I'd say are new, don't have the experience. We lost a guy,
went as a lottery pick freshman year, one‑and‑done guy. We have to fill that
hole.  
I think we'll do it by committee. We don't have a 7‑footer in there, but we'll
have some good size. I like our perimeters. I like our guards. I think we have
some experienced guards, versatile guards, and good athletes all the way
through.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Give me your take on the one‑and‑done rule.  
COACH DIXON: It is what it is. We have no say in it. It's the NBA's rule.
That's what we play with. We can say all we want, at the end of the day
they're going to have to change it.  
I think everyone is different. You get a guy like Steve Adams who was a kid
that played one year, continued to go to classes, took online courses once he
left Pitt. Was a 3.5 student, a very good kid. He was there with the intention
of going to school all the way through.  
At the end of the day, we recognized it. His family recognized it. He's a
7‑footer that's 19 years old. Your best time to go in the draft is now. That's
what we felt, that's what he felt, his family felt.  
When you're a freshman, they draft on potential. When you're 7‑foot, 19,
potential is now. That's why he made that decision, why we supported it. He's
in a good position. I think there's a lot of talk about it. There's very few
that are doing it. All would like to do it, go one‑and‑done, but only a very
few can do it.  
JEFF FISCHEL: If you were in charge of college basketball, what would be the
rule you'd like to see?  
COACH DIXON: For guys coming in? Getting two years out of them would be good.
Now, go after a high school, similar to like the baseball rule, maybe make it
two years instead of three. To me, I think you've come up with a solution. At
least there's some give‑and‑take on both ends of it there. I think that's
probably the best way.  
NBA doesn't want that. They don't want to take high school kids in. I don't
know if they'll ever go to that situation. Again, I think that's the best on
both sides. That's a little bit of compromise, which is what we all need a
little bit of right now.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Jamie, thank you.  
COACH DIXON: Thank you.

BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We're joined by Wake Forest head coach Jeff Bzdelik.  
You have a lot of continuity. You lose C.J. Harris, but everyone in the
starting lineup is back.  
COACH BZDELIK: It's a great place to start. 62% of our minutes last year were
played by freshmen. They gained valuable experience. Of course, we have Travis
McKie, we can't forget him, who has played and started every game, averaged
about 30 minutes per game since his freshman year. He has great, great
experience.  
There's no substitute for experience. We had some great wins last year, some
real close, tough losses. Our team has really grown through that experience.
They're stronger physically, tougher mentally. They've grown together as a
basketball team.  
I'm very excited.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We'll start with questions.  
  
Q. In talking to your players earlier, they said you're so much more relaxed
this year. They said the seven freshmen last year made you a little bit
grumpy. Are you feeling more relaxed this year?  
COACH BZDELIK: No question. I'm very relaxed. Very excited. Very confident.
Last year, my approach with those freshmen, I had to shell‑shock them because
they needed to play. I told them, I'm going to be really tough on you because
you have no idea what's in store for you. They didn't. If you ask them that,
they'll tell you.  
Once they've been around the block now, they understand what I was trying to
explain to them, how tough you need to be, how tough‑minded you need to be,
not just physically but tough‑minded, in an individual way and collective way
as a team to survive and win, like we all want to win in this league.  
They understand that. They're working extremely hard. So, yeah, I'm very
relaxed, feel very confident. I feel great about this group.  
  
Q. We know you're excited about your depth. What specifically makes you
excited about that?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, depth is our asset, to be quite frank. We have 10 strong
players right now. When Greg McClinton, very close to coming back, a talented
freshman who is very athletic, that's going to give us even another player. We
have length, depth.  
It doesn't matter what combination of groups of guys I put out there, they've
all been very efficient in practice. So we're going to utilize that depth and
try and wear on people in terms of great, great energy at all times from all
spots.  
  
Q. Tyler Cavanaugh, we saw a little bit of him last year. What do you expect
out of him?  
COACH BZDELIK: Tyler has worked extremely hard. Coach Boeheim told me, Jeff,
he was always in our gym. He thought he was one of his own players. Tyler is
just a workaholic.  
Here is an example of that. Tyler came in as a freshman, 231 pounds, almost
13% body fat. Today he's 231 pounds, 6% body fat. He's changed his body in
terms of losing about 15 pounds. If you work that into an equation, eight to
ten pounds of muscle. He's moving better as an athlete. He can shoot the ball.
He's very skilled. He's one of our best post‑up player. Shooting the three,
he's really, really good.  
He's a hard‑working young man who is skilled, intelligent. He's changed his
body. He's going to be a tough matchup for fours in that he's a stretch four
kind of guy but also can go in the post. We're really excited about him.  
  
Q. Talked to Travis earlier. With all the experience that the freshmen
picked up last year, and he's a senior, is this the year for a guy like him
that this team needs to kick the door in and get to 20, 22, 23 wins, make a
post ‑season appearance?  
COACH BZDELIK: No question. We need to continue to show improvement and to
win. I have a dual responsibility as a coach. One responsibility is to win. I
get that. That's the bottom line in this business. But the second
responsibility is to protect the integrity of the university and have the true
student‑athletes. We've done that. There can't be a trade‑off between one or
the other.  
Getting back to Tyler Cavanaugh, all‑ACC, all‑academic player, too. In fact,
we had about five of them. The only problem there was, their GPAs were higher
than their scoring averages. I'm making a joke about that.  
You know, we need to have a winning year. Playing the type of schedule that we
have, that will put us in consideration for post‑season play somewhere, no
doubt.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this is a make ‑or‑break year for you personally?  
COACH BZDELIK: You know what, nobody puts any more pressure on me than I put
on myself. We had the fourth best attendance in the ACC last year. We have
great fan support. Fans were awesome. We had some great home wins because of
our fans, really and truly.  
I want to win desperately. I want to win as badly as anybody. That's the plan.
That's what we need to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you went small quite a bit last year. Do you anticipate that with
the three ‑guard thing? Bigger? Combination of things?   
COACH BZDELIK: Great question about playing small, playing big. We have the
versatility to do both. Andre Washington has made great strides. He came in at
215 pounds. He's every bit of 235 right now, playing very well. Going against
Devin Thomas every day. Devin has brought out the best in him.  
We can go big, we can go small. We can play Tyler at the five, who is a
handful because of his ability to shoot the basketball. That was successful
for us last year at times.  
We have that versatility. We'll use it accordingly throughout the course of
games and see which one is more effective.  
  
Q. Harris meant so much to you guys, now he's gone. Is he replaced by one or
committee? Is there somebody on the rise to be the next C.J.?  
COACH BZDELIK: It's a great question and something that as a coach, in our big
wins, C.J. was awesome, he really was. There's no doubt about that.  
Codi Miller‑McIntyre just said recently many times last year he deferred. Now
it's time for all these young guys to rise up in a collective way and through
committee, as you said so well, we should overcome the loss of a great player
like C.J. Harris, who was very consistent for us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: First practice this season, what is the first thing you do? What
tone do you set right off the bat for this team?  
COACH BZDELIK: Toughness. We need to get tougher from the neck up. What is
toughness? Toughness is imposing your will, a firm determination to succeed.  
Our players learned from last year how important every possession is. We lost
one game by two, a game by three, a game by four, a game by five, a game by
six. Would have, could have, should haves don't count. My point is
understanding how valuable each possession is.  
In practice, everything we do has a consequence because one loose ball, one
missed block off assignment, one defensive mistake from anybody, it takes all
five players to make a play, has a consequence, and that could be a tough
loss.  
In practice what we've done is emphasize every little thing to perfection so
we practice perfectly.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Do you get the feeling with this team everybody is onboard?  
COACH BZDELIK: No question.  
  
Q. The margin for error, is that a tough spot for a coach to be in, knowing
that guys, it's vital that each possession is valued so highly? The margin for
winning and losing is a minute.  
COACH BZDELIK: Not just our program, but any program. I'm not sure what the
exact stat is. I think the differential in college basketball is really just
like a possession and a half throughout an average for the country. It's what
makes it such a great game, it really does.  
We just want to control what we can control, and that's just a total effort.
What is defensive transition? Effort. What is running the court? Effort. On
offense, cutting hard, jumping into position defensively, being aware, being
focused, just selling out for your teammates, to get out of yourself and into
other people in terms of a team concept, that's what we're getting at.  
If you do that, come up short, you know what, so be it. Life doesn't always go
the way you want it to go. Strap it on, next play, whatever.  
But you can't have some letdowns. Young players, when they come to this level,
they're so good, they can take possessions off in high school. That's what
they don't understand. They can let somebody catch the ball. I'll block it
anyway. You can't let a guy like Plumlee catch the ball, for example. A guy
like Devin Thomas learned that. That's where experience comes in.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thank you very much.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We have Brad Brownell, head coach of the Clemson Tigers.  
Looking ahead to the season, let's look at what you have. You lost a big man
up front, but you still have some experience. Break down the team and the five
you'll have on the floor.  
COACH BROWNELL: I don't know if I can give you a starting lineup. Certainly
feel good about K.J. McDaniels. Worked hard the last couple years to make
himself into a high‑level player, terrific athlete, improved shooter, driver.  
Jordan Roper, who came with us today, is a guy who played very well for us in
Italy. Had a good freshman year. Can shoot the ball from three, very quick. A
guy who is kind of going back and forth between a one and a two.  
It's Landry Nnoko inside is a guy who is slowly emerging as our starting
center right now. He's 6'10", 245. A little inexperienced. Sophomore. Guy who
defends pretty well for his position. I feel good about him.  
Then we have a bunch of others, Damarcus Harrison, Adonis Filer. Rod Hall is a
guy who started a bunch for us last year at point guard, is a very seasoned
player in terms of experience, a glue guy that makes other people better.  
We have a little bit of experience in the backcourt, very young in the front
court.  
There's a physicality that you're going to face at this level that you don't
see until you actually get to the heart of the ACC night in, night out when
you're playing big, strong, athletic players in the front court.  
Landry Nnoko, Josh Smith is another sophomore that didn't play a lot more, but
at 6'8", 250, has the size physically to bang around in there. We signed a
post player, Ibrahim Djambo, 210, 215, a little thin, but a guy we feel good
about. Face‑up, stretch four, a little like Milton Jennings, can shoot threes,
just needs some experience.  
We'll see how it all shakes out during the course of the fall here, as we
assemble our team for our first game in November.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. Who are you looking for this year to be your leaders on the team?  
COACH BROWNELL: Probably our junior class. K.J. McDaniel, Rod Hall are the two
guys that come to mind. K.J. in my mind is an encourager, a guy that is very
supportive of his teammates, tries to make people feel good. Very supportive.  
Rod is a little bit quieter, but a guy who leads by example. Trying to become
more vocal. Certainly a tough‑minded, physical player that has the respect of
our team because of his unselfishness, his smarts, his ability to just grind
things out, tough things out.  
I think those two guys are probably the guys who are most likely to be
considered leaders in our program.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You did a great job defensively last year possession after
possession. Have you seen that from this team this year?  
COACH BROWNELL: Certainly I'm concerned with defending the paint and
rebounding. When we had two older players in there in Devin and Milt, Devin
was a very good rebounder in traffic. He was a guy who could get tough
rebounds for you against physical players. Those guys did a good job that way.  
I was proud of the way we defended last year. I thought we defended at a
pretty high level. Just didn't shoot the ball well enough.  
Whether we can defend at the same level, I don't know. I'm optimistic we can.
I think the rebounding is a little bit of a cause for concern right now.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Offensively where have you seen the most development?  
COACH BROWNELL: Well, the thing that excites me the most, I think we'll be a
better shooting team. We'll make more perimeter shots. We didn't shoot the
ball well last year, we didn't shoot free throws well. We put a lot of time
in, done extra shooting. We're still doing it. It's what we're going to have
to do to be successful this year. We're going to have to make more shots.  
We have Devin Coleman that can shoot the ball, that will be very encouraging.
Some other guys, Damarcus Harrison is an improving shooter. If those guys are
a little more relaxed, comfortable as older players, shoot the ball a little
bit better, that's the best way we have an opportunity to improve our offense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how tough this league is.  
COACH BROWNELL: This is going to be a great challenge. The teams that we
brought in are great programs, they're not just good teams. Notre Dame,
Syracuse and Pitt aren't just good every once in a while, they're good every
year. They have established basketball programs with great coaches and they're
at schools that are committed to it. They're committed to basketball. They put
money into it. Their fans support it. It's important to them. They're good
every year.  
When you add that with the kind of programs we already have here, it makes for
a lot of excitement. It makes this what we all think is the best league in
college basketball. You have to be prepared.  
I'm very excited about it now. When I'm in the middle of five games out of six
on the road, I might not be as excited at some point.  
The great thing this league does now it affords you the opportunity to beat
top‑25 teams every week. You're going to have an opportunity to improve your
résumé, to get big wins, to have great teams come into your building and play,
exciting games for your fans basically from January to March.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The lifeblood for a program is recruiting. What impact does the
new ACC have on that?  
COACH BROWNELL: I think it's positive. I'm a Midwest guy, grew up in Indiana.
We've made a conscious effort to recruit the Midwest in the last 18 months or
so. I think the opportunity of having Notre Dame and Louisville and Pittsburgh
from that area has opened some kids' eyes to the idea of maybe playing
elsewhere. Certainly add Syracuse to the mix, you can talk about northeastern
schools. Kids want to challenge themselves against the best. They have an
understanding of what's happening in this league. If you can be successful
here, you can be successful anywhere.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We talked about K.J. a bit. You can't really teach shot
blocking.  
COACH BROWNELL: None of that came from the coaches. He did that all on his
own. He's a highlight reel waiting to happen all the time. He's been on the
ESPN more on the top 10 list. He's a great leaper, incredible offensive
rebounder, runs the floor in transition, blocks shots. What he does you can't
coach. He just does it naturally. He's a great physical athlete that's
improving his basketball. That's the thing that excites me the most, is his
ability to do other things on the basketball court.  
Our fans are spoiled with that guy. He provides entertainment all night every
night.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The way you measure the success of this team this year, how are
you going to do that.  
COACH BROWNELL: I don't know. Everybody is going to look at wins and losses. I
need to see how this team grows, how we handle adversity, what individual
players on our team make, what kind of strides they make, what kind of
identity we begin to develop. This is a group that could be together for a
couple years. You want to begin to lay the groundwork with this group for some
things that are going to help you in the next couple of years.  
I'm going to see how we handle a lot of different things. We haven't talked
about a lot of specific goals with our team. We're just trying to work hard,
develop a strong identity and a bond together that's going to allow us to be
successful moving forward.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We have Notre Dame head coach Mike Brey.  
We've talked about this a couple times, but you never imagined the ACC would
extend all the way to South Bend, Indiana.  
COACH BREY: No way. Growing up a Maryland basketball fan, spending eight years
in this league as an assistant at Duke, I never thought I'd be coaching in the
ACC at Notre Dame. I'm thrilled, our fans are thrilled. Our team is excited
about joining such a prestigious, classy league. Here we go this year.  
I'm excited that we're getting in a year earlier than we first thought because
I still have some experience back, namely senior guards, which hopefully can
help me navigate what is going to be a new challenge for us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Having been a long time assistant at Duke, do you feel you have an
advantage coming back?  
COACH BREY: I do think I'm a little more comfortable than if we would have
joined the Big Ten or the Big 12, knowing this league. Some of the venues, I
only knew Cole Field House, not Maryland's new facility, Reynolds Coliseum.
There's a lot of new places. There's familiarity being in those towns, the
rhythm of the ACC. I've run into so many familiar faces today, media, that
were covering us when I was at Duke. I think that will help.  
I have two assistants that are former ACC players, one a Georgia Tech grad and
one a Virginia grad. Maybe it was just meant to be.  
  
Q. I saw a great quote on Twitter talking about your experiences under K and
his propensity for eating his young.  
COACH BREY: No question, he subscribes to the theory of eating his young,
absolutely. We had fun this summer talking about the league. We're certainly
at very different points in our careers. I'm certainly very indebted.  
It was a fabulous experience, the eight years I was there, being trained to be
a head coach. I was very ready then to move on to Delaware and Notre Dame,
draw on those experiences every day.  
Having said that, we're in it now. I'm excited about that. With Duke and
Carolina now on our schedule, when I got to Notre Dame in 2000, we were kind
of the whipping boy of the Big East. When we finally got to the point where we
could beat a Syracuse and Connecticut, those were program, credible wins.
Carolina and Duke are that now for our basketball program.  
Mike and I talked a lot about the ACC on the road this summer, how it's
changed, different styles of play. It's going to be neat being back on Tobacco
Road.  
  
Q. How much do you, Pitt, and Syracuse bring of the Big East to the ACC, or
is it the other way around, you have to fit in?  
COACH BREY: I've been asked so much about all this style of play, the ACC
style, the Big East style. I think what the three of us, eventually
Louisville, what the ACC is going to have that the Big East had was all kinds
of styles which makes it so exciting for fans and interesting for players and
challenging for coaches in their preparations.  
All three of us coming in all do it a little bit differently. I hope we can
add a little spice, a little variety to the league.  
But the league, certainly you have Carolina and Duke, then you have a lot of
programs trending up, guys that are building their programs with really good
momentum.  
Again, I think we become the best and deepest league right away. We're going
to get a lot of bids. It's going to kind of roll over from the Big East to the
ACC, in my opinion.  
  
Q. Is it going to be strange for you to not be going back to the Garden but
traveling back to North Carolina?  
COACH BREY: Very strange. If there's one thing I will really miss from the Big
East is the Big East tournament in the Garden. That was an amazing experience.
I know there's some talk of maybe this league moving that way eventually. That
I think would be really good if we could pull that off.  
I also remember being an assistant at Duke, playing in Greensboro, the
electricity of the ACC. I'm excited that I'll get to coach in that in the
heart of ACC country.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Your backcourt is phenomenal. How good does that feel as a
coach?  
COACH BREY: When you have guards like that, I don't want to over‑coach them. I
want to get those guys healthy, feed them, let them play.  
As Abe Lemons said, the old Texas coach, he started off his speech by saying,
If you ain't got guards, you ain't got blank. That's true. We have old guards
that have played together for a while. I would add Pat Connaughton in that.  
If you have good perimeter players, they give us a chance in this first year.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) and Cooley. Who is the next?  
COACH BREY: I hope there's one brewing. May be by committee. I expect Eric,
Sherman, the transfer from Michigan State. He's 23, a fifth‑year senior. We
really need him to do things. Zach Auguste, the young big guy.  
We're going to have to do it by committee up front. Luckily for those big
guys, they have some experienced guards to hold their hand and help them.  
  
Q. Can we expect to see any surprise Notre Dame uniforms again this year?  
COACH BREY: Man, we shook 'em up with those uniforms. I still hear from our
alumni on those things.  
Our players loved them. The guys I'm recruiting loved them more. That was
enough for me.  
We're going to ratchet it back a little bit. I don't think Greensboro would be
the stage to break out something that loud. New York would be better.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I liked them.  
COACH BREY: Our players loved them. I tell you what, everybody we were
recruiting, our guys loved them. Dick's Sporting Goods loved them. Everybody
loved the socks. It was a little extreme. Even this football weekend with USC,
alums will come up to me and say, Excited about the ACC, and by the way I
didn't like the uniforms last year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: When you're recruiting guys now, the message, You're in the ACC,
how does that resonate?  
COACH BREY: I think that's really powerful. Again, you still have the
Syracuse, Pitt, Louisville thing. I still kind of count Virginia Tech, BC and
Miami as Big East guys. It wasn't that long ago we were banging heads with
them. Certainly BC and Notre Dame have a long history of rivalry and tradition
in every sport. That's kind of reignited.  
I think on the recruiting front, it's really woken people up. I'm in Big Ten
country all the time. I'm fighting the Big Ten. It's Carolina, Duke, the ACC,
more of those Midwest kids I think have a little more of an open mind to Notre
Dame, closer to their home in the Midwest, but instead of the Big East, it's
the ACC. That's been powerful.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We talked a little bit about the guards, challenges in the front
court. You have guys stepping in now. Talk about a freshmen class that comes
in.  
COACH BREY: Demetrius Jackson, McDonald's All‑American from South Bend,
Indiana. We haven't had a kid from South Bend that played for our team in 40
years. We were fortunate enough to keep him home, a guard that will help us
right away. We'll play him with Atkins and Grant. Those three guys together
give us the speed on the perimeter I don't know if we've ever had in the
history of our program.  
JEFF FISCHEL: V.J. as well?  
COACH BREY: V.J. gives us speed. All those guys are battling for minutes. I'm
really pleased. That's our next wave of perimeter when these old guys leave. I
feel good we have good, young guards that will take the torch when it's time.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thank you. Good luck this season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim.  
You said this is going to be a lot like going to the dentist.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Without novocaine (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions right away.  
  
Q. Are you the most popular guy here or least popular? Are guys happy to see
you in their league this year?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't know. I'm not evaluating that. I'm not sure where I am
here in this world.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BOEHEIM: We're excited. Obviously this has been a long time coming,
thinking about it. To me, everything is done. We're in the ACC. We're excited
about it. Our fans are obviously excited about it. We're selling more season
tickets than we've sold in a long time.  
There's more excitement about Duke, Carolina, these schools coming in. The
players are excited to be in this league. I think the coaches are. It's just a
tremendous challenge. It's a great league. You want to be in the best league
you can be in. This is, I believe, the best league.  
  
Q. You played a lot of the teams in the ACC. Talk about what it's like now
competing for a championship with them now.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Every year when you start out in your league, you're trying to
win the league. That's what you're trying to do.  
We played a lot of these teams, six or seven of these teams were in the Big
East. We got familiarity with them, them with us. We played Duke, Carolina,
Georgia Tech, Virginia over the last few years home and home.  
It's not completely unfamiliar. Coaches and players adjust quickly. They'll
get to know us, we'll get to know them. By the time the ACC league starts,
we'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. If I'm not mistaken, your last game as a player was against Duke. Can you
draw a line from that in '66?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I didn't want to remember that game. Didn't turn out the right
way.  
But, you know, having the kind of interest that our fans have in Duke, I mean
Georgetown they were sold out the week before the game, and that's a first by
the long ways. I think Carolina will do the same things, some of the other
games. I don't think I've seen our fans this excited about basketball in
years.  
It's not like we got bad fans that are just getting excited. They've been
great. We've been second in attendance in the country for the last 15 years,
whatever it is. It's nice to see they've embraced this league.  
I think, to steal a quote from my good friend at Duke, these games are going
to be instant rivalries. You're going to have right away games that are big
games, meaningful games. You'll create rivalries immediately.  
  
Q. Looking at Mike Krzyzewski, what is it going to be like for you to have
the opportunity to go up against him, have him in the dome, what it really
means to know how successful you've both been?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've coached against really good friends a lot. You just don't
really look down. When we play Duke, I'm concerned about his players and he's
concerned about my players, what they're doing. We're not doing much. We're
not able to do a whole lot anymore.  
Duke is a great, great program. It's a great challenge for us to play them.
We're excited about it. We want to be the best team. We want to play the best
teams. That's how you get there.  
  
Q. How exciting is it to have C.J. back with a new journey into a new
conference, and Baye as well?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think it's important. We try to develop players. You're going
to lose some guys, that's just college basketball. But a key for us over the
years is to have some senior leadership.  
We've got two great seniors, C.J. Fair, Baye, they've been in the tournament
games, NCAA finals, they've been there. It's important to have that kind of
leadership, particularly with the challenges of how good this league is going
to be this year.  
  
Q. Expectations this year after the Final Four run last year, the fact
you're entering a conference with even more competition, the challenge of
that, trying to do it again. C.J. Fair said the goal is trying to finish the
job.  
COACH BOEHEIM: You start every year, you want to be the best you can be. If
you're anywhere in the top 30 teams in the country, you think you can get to
the Final Four. Reality is, you can. That's the way college basketball is now.  
Things change. I mean, we lost four out of five games during the year. I think
people were hoping we were going to win a game in the tournament. A notable
expert picked us to lose to Montana. That's just the way basketball is. If
you're a good team, you're going to go through some ups and downs.  
Everybody wants to be in a tough league, play great games. They want you to
win every game. That's not the way it works.  
If you're in a great league, you play a tough schedule, you're going to lose.
You don't plan it, but it's how you come out, how you turn out as a team at
the end of the year.  
Last year, even though we lost late, we got it together and went to New York,
had a good tournament, then we played great in the NCAA tournament. Played our
best basketball.  
I think that's really what you're trying to do. Everybody's trying to do that.
There's just more of an opportunity now if you do play well at the end of the
year to have success at the end of the year.  
  
Q. Going from the Big East to the ACC, are you anticipating a big change in
the style of play?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Not really. I think style of play is so similar. There's always
going to be some differences in how people play. Some will press, some will
play a little more aggressive man‑to‑man. There will be fast‑break teams.
There will be teams that will be patient, halfcourt teams. That's what you see
every year.  
You play 13 non‑conference games, you see 13 different teams. You're going to
see different types of styles all the time in those games.  
Then in the conference, within the conference, you're going to have different
styles.  
At the end of the day, that's what college basketball is. Coaches and players
adjust pretty quickly to what they have to face. I mean, you get in the NCAA
tournament at the end of the year, hopefully you're going to play four, five,
six games. There are going to be all different kinds of teams.  
By playing different kinds of teams during the year, that's what gets you
ready to be a good tournament team, that you've seen different styles, so when
you get in that situation you're ready for it, you're more prepared for it.  
  
Q. How do you evaluate the backcourt? You have a freshman point guard, then
some questions at the two guard spot.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think that's the first basketball question I've actually had.
Took seven, eight hours (laughter).  
We have a very experienced frontline. I think it's a better frontline than we
had last year. I think we're better, more physical, a year older, got mostly
the same guys. We have a couple freshmen that can contribute on our frontline.
It's the deepest, best frontline I think I've coached in a long time, let's
put it that way.  
Our back court I think is talented, but it is very young, very inexperienced.
I've started four freshmen point guards since I've been the head coach the
Syracuse. I'm as comfortable with this point guard as any of the point guards
I've started. I've had some pretty good ones.  
I've had a couple sophomores that made All‑American after not playing as
freshmen, so they really were kind of freshmen. Sherman Douglas, Michael
Carter‑Williams.  
I think at the two, we've got a lot of competition at that spot. You're
looking at two guys, Trevor Cooney had his second year, (indiscernible) is in
his third year. I think they may not have been ready as sophomores, but this
year they are ready to play. That's the area that we have the most questions
about in terms of our team.  
With our frontline of C.J. Fair, Baye, those guys, they've all gotten better.
I think they'll all be ready to go.  
  
Q. Steve Donahue was in here before you. He said this has the potential to
be the best conference ever created. Would you agree with that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, I don't usually like to make those statements. I
mean, in the past I've always said that the league that I was in was one of
the best leagues. I've always said that. I don't know if I've ever said it's
the best league. I may have used that word. One year, when we had 11 teams in
the tournament, I think you could probably say that was the best league in the
country.  
Certainly potentially this league has every chance to be the best basketball
league ever. I think that's true. But I still kind of think let's go out and
prove it rather than talk about it. But certainly this league has that kind of
potential.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate you coming through. Good luck this season.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: We're joined by Virginia head coach Tony Bennett.  
You have built up an incredible amount of depth and experience for this team.
I'm wondering how all these guys are going to get the minutes this year.  
COACH BENNETT: I think that will be certainly an issue. The one thing that I
think a formula for success for us at Virginia is to have a team that has some
maturity. I always envisioned us to have superior upperclassmen so you can
compete against the best in the league. We haven't been able to do that as
fast as we would have liked with transfers.  
We do have a couple of seniors, juniors. Now you have to find playing time.
You want that competitiveness in practice. With fouls, with injuries, things
like that, you need depth. I think that will be very important for our success
this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. You are picked to finish fourth this year by the media. Seems like the
expectations are higher for you this year. Do you sense that? How do you
balance that with your players?  
COACH BENNETT: I mean, the predictions, that's nice. It means you're going to
have a chance to try to prove that, to be a quality team in this league. I
think there has to be a balance. I think you have to have expectations to
finish well, to get to post‑season play, all those things.  
In saying that, there better be a balance of, we use the term 'falling in love
with the process.' How do you reach those expectations, get as good as you
can? That's improving each moment of every day. Our players understand that.  
Rick Carlisle told our players, he said, Listen, Justin Anderson, if I run a
last‑second shot for you, what are you thinking about? If you're thinking, I
got to make the shot, you're thinking all wrong. You have to think about your
balance, your footwork. The by‑product is if you make it or not. If you're a
team that has some more expectations, if you're so focused on the end result,
you're going down the wrong path. You better compete daily, improve, hold each
other accountable. When you face some adversity, how you respond to that is
going to determine how successful you'll be.  
We've worked hard to get our program to where we have experience and depth. In
this league, you better be good or you're going to be in trouble because of
the additions of the teams, the qualities of coaches in the ACC.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Joe Harris, the returning first‑team all‑ACC guy. One behind
C.J. Fair. What is the next step he took in the off‑season to improve his game
even more.  
COACH BENNETT: I think good players have the ability to go to take it to
another level, go to the next gear. I think Joe showed that at times last
year. I also think the opposite of that, a good player, their lows around that
low. Maybe they're off with a shooting night or something is not quite right.
Their play never dips too low.  
I think when you're a senior, you're one of the better players, your highs can
be elite, but your lows, they don't go too low. I think that consistency that
you're looking for, then just fine‑tuning little thing is what hopefully Joe
will add to this year's play.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Between Joe, Akil and Justin, you have a variety of experience.
That's got to stabilize that team heading into the season.  
COACH BENNETT: There's no substitute for experience in this league. As I said
at the beginning, I think Virginia has to do it with maturity, with guys who
have been in a lot of games, that have seen it. That's a great equalizer to
maybe going against guys that have a ton of McDonald's All‑Americans, such
high‑level talent.  
We have talented players. When they're mature and they really play together,
have that kind of chemistry, then you can be very difficult to beat.  
JEFF FISCHEL: On Twitter, the hashtag swoon.  
COACH BENNETT: I heard about that today. He met Taylor Swift.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Joe being as good as he is, it becomes fun not only to have a
guy like that on the team, but Akil admitted he's the biggest swoon fan.  
COACH BENNETT: I sent him to the barber that cuts my hair. Once he got that
good haircut, it all went up for him.  
JEFF FISCHEL: It's all about the hair.  
COACH BENNETT: That's right.  
  
Q. You mentioned the new additions to the ACC. How much tougher do those
teams make this conference? Can this be one of the best conferences ever?  
COACH BENNETT: I think to me, when you determine what's the best conference in
college basketball, there has to be two things present.  
I think the first one is are there teams that can contend for a national
championship. I think you have to check that box off and say, yeah, there are.
There's that in other leagues. But the other thing is, how good is the middle
of the league, how good is the depth from the bottom up. When you look at the
quality of depth in this league with all the teams, the winning percentages,
all that stuff, you can say for sure on that account, too.  
When you have those two things present, I don't know if there's another league
in the country that can boast that. I think that's what will give us the
chance to be the best in the league.  
Again, it will all be played out. All these pre‑season predictions, all this
talk about what's the best, we'll find out soon enough. That's the best place
to determine it.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BENNETT: I'm left‑handed, so that's a no‑brainer. Maybe back in the day.
I don't know if that's a big feather in my cap. I haven't seen the other
coaches shoot much. That's very flattering.  
I just want my team to be the best shooting team. We don't have Johnny Dawkins
in this league. He plays at Stanford. I don't know the playing background.
Leonard Hamilton said he would be the best defender.  
I'll take my chances if I'm a betting man on that one.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's talk about the defense. You guys play an incredibly tough
brand of defense. It goes to not only how hard you play on defense, but also
the pace you play. How do players adapt to that style and how open are they
when they first come there?  
COACH BENNETT: I think that's one of the things. When we are good defensively,
I think more teams are really getting serious about how good they are
defensively, and that actually probably lowers the possessions in the game and
points as you're seeing that on a national average in college basketball.  
I think it's a great equalizer. I really do. Even as you watch the playoffs in
baseball, other sports, you can't just be great defensively and not be that
good offensively or vice versa. There has to be a balance.  
But I think it gives you a chance to be in games, to be competitive first,
then successful. I've just seen it work. Again, it's not the most glamorous,
but it's effective. I think you got to start there. Hopefully as you get more
talent and ability, you can branch out offensively.  
JEFF FISCHEL: How did you and your father before you develop that pack line
defenses?  
COACH BENNETT: My father grew up matching Vince Lombardi. He'd go to their
practices. His defensive philosophy, he named it because he was in Green Bay,
the Packers. It's about packing the lane, not stretching. It went well with
the Packers. It's not that he invented it, it's just a sound philosophy.  
At the time I was playing for him, he made a shift that benefited his
personnel. Any coach looks and says, What is going to give us the best chance
to beat the best teams in our conference. It's a system that's based on
working people work. It doesn't disrupt, you're not turning people over, but
it's kind of a battle of wills. Whoever can out last the other opponent with
positioning, it's team oriented, wins the battle.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Eric Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23386)

### [Jerian Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23464)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: I'm joined by the Notre Dame backcourt.  
Jerian, is there a better backcourt in the country than the two of you?  
JERIAN GRANT: Personally, I don't think so. At the end of the day, we're going
to have to go out there and prove it. I think we've established ourselves as
one of the better backcourts. I think we're going to have to do that again in
the ACC.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Eric, go ahead.  
ERIC ATKINS: Yeah, I feel the same way. I definitely feel like we are one of
the best. We're definitely going to have to go out there and prove it this
year, playing against some great guards in the ACC.  
JEFF FISCHEL: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Jerian, with your brother Jeremi, what has the conversation been like?
Any personal battles between the two of you?  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, you know, we talk every day. We're just excited about
being able to play in the same conference again.  
I get to go down there and play against him again. Personally we both want to
have great seasons, we want our teams to have great seasons.  
He's looking forward to getting a lot more minutes this year, being able to
show people what he can do on a consistent basis.  
  
Q. What do you anticipate being the biggest change in this move? Will it be
the culture of the gyms you're going to, the style of play?  
ERIC ATKINS: In my opinion, it will be the culture of the gyms. In the Big
East we played at a lot of schools that had NBA arenas. Sometimes it wouldn't
be as packed.  
I feel like in the ACC, they're all like college‑based arenas. That's
definitely going to have a different feel to it. They're always going to have
more of a home‑court advantage I feel like.  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, I think it's going to be a little different. In the Big
East, you're seeing a lot of games that were in the 40s and low 50s. You turn
the TV on, the building ACC is scoring 75, 80 points.  
It's going to be different with the contrasting styles a little bit.  
  
Q. Can you talk about replacing the winningest class in school history,
especially a guy like Jack Cooley.  
JERIAN GRANT: Jack was a double‑double every night guy. I don't think we have
any one person that's going to do that this year.  
As a committee, I think definitely guys are going to be able to step up and do
that. Garrick Sherman is going to be more consistent this year, get a lot more
minutes on a consistent basis. That's definitely going to help us.  
ERIC ATKINS: I think we're definitely going to have to do it as a team. The
rebounding that Jack provided for us, hopefully Jerian's and I's class can
finish as the most winning class in Notre Dame history.  
JEFF FISCHEL: You went 25‑10 last year. Eric, what are the goals this season
for this team?  
ERIC ATKINS: One of the goals is, again, to get an NCAA bid in this new league
for us, just to be successful in the new league. It has a challenge of its
own. Then to make a run in the tournament. I think that's the biggest key for
us.  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, coming into a new conference, we feel like we have to
reestablish ourselves. That's something I think we're going to do and be able
to do this year.  
Then it's tournament time, it's time for us to get a win, make a run in there.
I think that will really be able to tell how we did in our season.  
  
Q. You touched on the different cultures of the gyms. Are you coming in with
the attitude of just kind of dipping your toes in the water at the start of
the season or do you realize you just have to dive in head first?  
JERIAN GRANT: Well, yeah, our first ACC game is against Duke. We have to come
ready right away. It's going to be a huge game for us to make a statement.  
I don't think there's no dipping your toes when you're playing against Duke.
It's all in.  
ERIC ATKINS: We have to dive in right away, opening up with Duke. The ACC
didn't make it easy on us at all opening up with Duke.  
I think that's good for us. We get the premiere team in the league to start
off with. It can only be good for us.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I'm going to talk to Mike Brey this afternoon. The guy is always
like positive energy. Is that what he's like for you?  
JERIAN GRANT: Coach Brey is a positive coach. If guys make mistakes, he's
telling you what you can do better next time, not how bad you did.  
He's always smiling, making jokes. He brings a lot of energy to the guys. I
think that helps a guy get better. Coach Brey tells them what they're good at
instead of telling them what you're bad at.  
ERIC ATKINS: In my opinion, Coach Brey is a great coach because he's a
confidence‑giver. Everybody feels like they can play their own game, letting
us do so.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I talked a lot about how you distribute very well, but you also
protect the ball well. How important do you consider sharing and also making
sure you're protecting the ball?  
ERIC ATKINS: That's huge for us. That's part of the culture and being a guard
under Mike Brey, is protecting the ball and being good with it. He instills
that in us very early. I think it just carries on year after year.  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, taking care of the ball, it's really tough. With Coach
Brey, you're not going to be on the court much if you can't take care of the
ball. That's the main focus for all his players. As you continue to do a good
job with that, you're going to continue to get a chance to play.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Sometimes you get on hot streaks. Jerian, I don't think I've
ever seen anything like the hot streak you were on against Louisville.
Describe that.  
JERIAN GRANT: Your teammates give you confidence. The guys are giving me the
ball, telling me to go make a play. When your coach and your teammates have
confidence in you like that, it boosts your own confidence. You think any shot
you shoot is going in.  
ERIC ATKINS: I've never seen a streak like Jerian got on against Louisville. I
can't say I've ever done anything like that, but it was amazing like that.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Thanks for come by, guys. Good luck to Notre Dame this season,
the first year the Irish are in the ACC.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Ryan Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19409)

### [Olivier Hanlan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24978)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: I'm joined by Boston College, the guys here helping the program.  
Start with how you feel about this year. Ryan, you've seen this team building
over the last couple years. Where do you feel you are heading into the season?  
RYAN ANDERSON: I think we have competent guys. I think we've really,
especially my class, grown from a 9‑21 season, coming into this season with a
lot of high expectations. I think we've really grown as a team and ready to
take the next step and be a real contender in this league.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Olivier?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Like Ryan said, everybody is a lot more mature and older. We
finished the season well off last year. Hopefully we can keep the momentum
going.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Haven't forgotten about 41 points?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: That was a pretty good game. We'll keep the momentum going as
a team.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions for Ryan or Olivier.  
  
Q. Olivia, talk about what it's like to play for Coach Donahue?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: It's been great so far. I really got a chance to improve a lot
last year, just play through our mistakes. Yeah, always had extreme confidence
with me during the summer before I came to BC. Got a chance to become a better
basketball player.  
RYAN ANDERSON: He's a really good guy. He cares about us, not just as players,
but as people.  
Even if we have a bad game, he cares about how we're doing in the classroom,
how our families are doing. Even though he's a great strategic coach, he's a
really good guy. It's great to play for him.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Unique to have five returning starters. How does that help your
team to have that kind of continuity?  
RYAN ANDERSON: It means everything. Not only do we bring some of our starters,
we bring back some role starters as well.  
We got a transfer from Notre Dame and some freshmen that can come in and play
right away. Just gelling and know how everybody plays already, as Olivia says,
is going to help us build off the momentum.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Olivier, you recognize everybody on the court.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I feel like it will be better for the freshmen coming in,
Garland Owens, Billy, to gel with us. Like you said, everybody is coming back,
used to the plays. However Coach D coaches us, it will be a lot better.  
JEFF FISCHEL: To give you a sense of how much this team is back from last
year, 96% of the scoring, 88% of the rebounding. It is a team that is
experienced.  
Give me a sense of the battles down low, who you enjoy going up against, who
you hate going up against?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Going against the Plumlees is difficult. There's a lot of big,
big guys. Mitchell, McAdoo, big men in this conference. It's going to be fun
going up against some of the best players in the country.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Olivier, which guards do you like going up against in the ACC?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Last year I liked going against Shane Larkin and Erick Green
from Virginia Tech.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What are the team goals coach has laid out for you this season?  
RYAN ANDERSON: I think Coach D, since the day I came on campus, was to improve
as a player and team. As long as we keep improving, that's a big goal for us,
just to continue to improve. If we continue to improve, we'll win a lot of
game, and hopefully be still improving as we get late into the season.  
  
Q. Ryan, what is it like having Syracuse as a rival in the conference?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Growing up, Syracuse has been a powerhouse in the country.
They're always pulling out NBA guys. They always have a great team, led by a
great coach.  
Any time you bring a team like, that you get to play against them, it's an
honor, great chance to get a win against a great team. I think it's a great
challenge. Everybody likes competing against the best teams. When you bring
one of the best, it makes it better.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Olivier, going against Syracuse?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I feel it's more a competition for the ACC. I love
competition. I love going up against the best. Having Syracuse, Notre Dame and
Pittsburgh, going to make my happy.  
JEFF FISCHEL: The conference got bigger with three great programs.  
  
Q. Ryan, how do you make the next step to being a better team in the ACC?  
RYAN ANDERSON: I think it's just our habits on our everyday lifestyle, what
are we doing on an everyday basis to become a better team.  
You can say a lot of different things, say you want to be up against some of
the great players, great teams, you have to do stuff on a daily basis that
prepares you for those players and teams.  
I think we've done that. Our habits have improved tremendously from last year.
I think that's going to pay off when things go and get tough for us this year,
we're going to be ready for it based on our preparation.  
  
Q. You have to believe you're as good as anybody in the league.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I think we stack up pretty well this year. Like I said
earlier, we finished the season off pretty well, had some pretty good
momentum. Everybody is older, more mature. They all know how to play the game
of basketball.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Number of wins or a specific goal you have in mind?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I think obviously everybody's goal is to make it to March
Madness, try to win as many games as you can. We're trying to get a 20‑plus
win season this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Give me a sense of what coach likes. We know he's an organized
guy. Ryan, what is he like?  
RYAN ANDERSON: I mean, he's a high‑energy guy. Any time I see coach, you ask
him how he's doing, he says something like, Tremendous, splendid. He's so
energetic all the time. He's a caring guy.  
If you meet him, he genuinely wants to know about you, how your day is going.
He cares about you. He's a high‑energy guy. I think a lot of people see how
much energy he brings to the court when he's coaching, but he brings that to
everything he does.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What does coach say about social media?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: He's not a big fan of that at all. This year we're not using
no Twitter, Instagram. We're trying to stay focused on basketball.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Is that a good idea?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Yeah. I think you can get caught up a lot of times in social
media, but it's good to stay focused.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Good luck to Boston College, guys.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 16, 2013

  

### [Garrius Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25960)

### [Rion Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25266)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
JEFF FISCHEL: It's time to talk to the defending ACC champs, the Miami
Hurricane.  
You guys are the defending champs, but every starter is gone, Rion. Talk about
how the team is preparing this year.  
RION BROWN: We're approaching it the same way as last year, just setting our
team goals. Coach L comes in with the same philosophy every year. We just want
to keep that going, just try to teach these young guys the winning ways.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Garrius, talk about the season coming up.  
GARRIUS ADAMS: Even though I wasn't part of the actual physical part of the
team with the championship run, I did do a lot of the teaching and helping
with the plays and being kind of like a second coach to most of the team.  
Last year was great. I just want to continue that success this year.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Let's talk about how coach L is handling having basically a new
starting five. Rion, have you seen him change the way he is approaching this
season, the kind of game plan he's drawn up for you for the season?  
RION BROWN: I would say this year feels like the first year he got here. It's
a lot of teaching the younger guys, trying to get them to understand exactly
what he wants from them.  
He never really changes. He's exactly the same every year. That's one thing I
think he takes pride in. He approaches every year with the same mindset, and
that's just winning and working hard.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Garrius, talk about what Coach L has been trying to pass along
to you guys this season.  
GARRIUS ADAMS: I would say Coach L is a very personal coach. He knows exactly
what to get out of his players, which ones does what well. I think he's going
to take a key to that this year and kind of exploit what me, Rion and all the
other players on our team does so well.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Questions.  
  
Q. In the past Syracuse, Pitt, Notre Dame, Miami was familiar with. What can
you say about having them in your conference?  
GARRIUS ADAMS: I'm in love with the new additions to the ACC. I think they're
going to come and help a lot. I think it kind of reminds most of the people
who were in the past with Miami about the old Big East. If you remember those
games, those were very physical. They were hard games.  
I think the new additions are going to be great.  
RION BROWN: It's definitely exciting. Haven't got a chance to play any of
those teams in my career. Getting new scenery on the road, it's going to feel
great. Never been to New York. I'm excited about going there to play Syracuse.  
I'm glad they made those additions to the ACC. I think it's definitely going
to make the conference better. We're considered one of the best and we're
keeping it going.  
  
Q. You were talking about the physical play of the Big East. Is there a
different brand of basketball for the teams that they're going to have to
adjust to?  
RION BROWN: I think, yeah, they're definitely going to bring some of that
physicality down to the ACC. It's going to be a little struggle, whether the
fast play continues, the more physical nature of the Big East starts to take
over.  
I think it's going to end up being a little bit of both. You're definitely
going to see a different brand of basketball now. It's definitely going to be
fun to watch. I'm ready for it, definitely.  
GARRIUS ADAMS: Like Rion said, I think it will be a little bit of both, too. I
think the teams that are coming in are great teams from great programs. I
think the ACC has done a great job of bringing in the best teams to be in the
best league.  
  
Q. Talk about how winning the title last year has raised the expectations at
home?  
GARRIUS ADAMS: I think last year, we were very focused. I think that was the
biggest thing that we kind of had to figure out was our focus. I think if we
carry that over to this year, we'll be fine.  
RION BROWN: I think it definitely raises the bar for us as a program. We don't
want to have a letdown. We want to continue to be one of the best in the ACC.
I definitely think we helped our cause with recruiting. Everybody being able
to see that we can be a force, we can go out and get those great players who
end up going to Duke and Carolina every year.  
I think that's really going to help us in the future and also this year. We
had a lot of great freshmen come in this year kind of under the radar. We've
been under the radar since we've been in the ACC. It worked out for us last
year. Coach L has been doing great with those guys. We look to continue.  
JEFF FISCHEL: What was last year like with the run?  
GARRIUS ADAMS: The excitement last year was tremendous. We did a great job of
handling all that excitement, too. Coach L does a big job on telling us we
need to have fun when we play, enjoying playing with your teammates. I think
that's what we did. We did that very well all the way up to the Sweet 16.  
JEFF FISCHEL: I've been doing a little investigating. Rion, you said you're
the best singer on the team. Is this true?  
RION BROWN: Yeah.  
JEFF FISCHEL: Do you ever bust out something in the locker room?  
RION BROWN: All the time.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Kansas State Coach Weber. Coach, welcome,
and your opening comments?  
COACH WEBER: Well, it's a year into my tenure at Kansas State in Manhattan,
Kansas. It was great to be part of a magical year at K‑State. Three Big 12
Championships. Football, watched Coach Snyder work his magic, and obviously
for us to get a piece of the championship, the first in 36 years and then
baseball to follow that up and win it, so it was fun. It's been exciting.
We're looking forward to this year.  
We lost some key members, there is no doubt. Rodney McGruder, one of the
all‑time greats in K‑State history. Jordan Henriquez gave us a great backstop
to our defense. And Martavious was rock solid for us.  
The key for us to be competitive in the league, there is no doubt our older
guys have to be consistent, starting with our seniors, Will Spradling, Shane
Southwell, Omari Lawrence, Ryan Schultz, they have to be there every day. They
have to be great leaders.  
You look at last year, we had experienced guys, Kansas had experienced guys.
It makes it so much easier on a coach.  
So those guys along with Thomas Gipson‑‑ I think has lost 30 pounds, has a
chance to be one of the better big guys in the league. They are consistent,
and that helps our freshmen. We have some talented freshmen. We're excited
about them, but they are freshmen. Every day is new to them. If we get
consistent play out of the older guys, it will make it a lot easier on me, and
a lot easier on the freshmen.  
But we're looking forward to an exciting year. It should be fun.  
I think a lot of question marks throughout Big 12. Obviously, Oklahoma State
has pretty much everyone back. But if you look at all the other teams, there
are some question marks who is going to fill this hole or take that role on.
That will be a key to who is competing for those top spots in the league.  
  
Q. Coach, Will Spradling has always been a guy that's tried to get out of
the ball and take a charge. Do you think with these new rule changes that
could be tougher for him, and just your thoughts on the new rule changes?  
COACH WEBER: There is no doubt. Almost every day Will takes a charge we're
like: Go back and watch. Is it going to be a charge with the new rules? And we
had a scrimmage the other day. And I talked to Curtis in between after he
talked that that's going to be the toughest thing when there is a guy making a
move to go to a shooting position, and is the guy there? It's almost
impossible to watch.  
So they're going to go‑‑ from what we understand, they're going to go on the
side of the offensive player and our guy has to do a good job of‑‑ we can't
get any little fouls. We need Will in the game, so he's going to have to be
careful about taking those charges.  
The whole rule thing, we went through the scrimmage. It was interesting. There
were a lot of fouls in the first half. I think our guys adjusted as we went on
in the game. That's what Curtis has talked about. It's going to be important.
But the key thing, and I talked about our guys being consistent. I think the
key will be all of the officials being consistent. Not only from one official
to the next, but from one game to the next, from one league to the next, in
and out of the different leagues. I think that's where‑‑ that's going to be so
important because otherwise the guys won't know what to do. Can we guard them,
can we not? It will be interesting to see how it all evolves.  
  
Q. If you would, could you talk about the upcoming Puerto Rico tipoff
specifically, and how you keep the guys focused and not let them get
distracted by all the island has to offer?  
COACH WEBER: It's a great opportunity for our guys, one, to go on a trip like
that, the warm weather, the beaches, all those things you talked about. But
the field is really a special field. I haven't looked at all the tournaments
around the country. But it's got to be one of the best. When you talk about
Michigan, runner up, NCAA champion, Georgetown, Big East champion, VCU,
Florida State. I think every team in it, except for Florida State, had 20 or
more wins. So if our guys aren't focused by that‑‑ we've talked about it since
the beginning, that's going to be a big part of our non‑conference season, and
you can establish yourself there.  
Now, we will stay an extra day. It just happens to end during Thanksgiving
break, so I'll let them go to the beaches. We always try to do that. We want
them to enjoy the experience. We'll do some kind of excursion with them. That
is part of the whole educational process of going on these trips. But we wait
until afterwards. During it we want to be focused.  
With so many new guys and so many freshmen, I think it will be a challenge to
stay focused on the games and not be worried about what's out there, outside
of the hotel.  
  
Q. Being new last year you had to get your guys to buy in to your program.
Could you talk about that transition?  
COACH WEBER: Well, it was‑‑ a lot was made of it. I think it was a lot easier.
The beginning was hard because we had to re‑recruit everybody, from Rodney to
Angel, whoever it might have been. Just one, selling yourself, selling your
staff, your system. We really tried to be hands on, one‑on‑one with them as
much as we could, be around them. I think slowly but surely they started to
appreciate what we were about. Then the system, it was different, but it
wasn't totally different. This year has been a lot tougher, to be honest, with
so many new players. Last year everyone was new, but they were older guys.
When I did a drill, I said we're going to do shell drill, they knew what shell
drill was. Now the terminology and teaching points are different. Now I do
shell drill and it might take 20 minutes because we have to stop so much with
the new players.  
So I think the guys bought in. There was a key to it. There were a couple of
little‑‑ George Washington on the road was a big win. Florida obviously here
right before the holidays was a huge confidence builder. Then opener in the
Big 12, Oklahoma State, that was a high‑level game. To find a way to win that,
Rod stepped up, those are kind of points in your season that all of a sudden
the guys are, hey, this is all right. They're all right. They know what
they're talking about.  
They come together as a team and we became a family. I think that was
important for our success.  
  
Q. As we've kind of followed the progress of the K ‑State program the last
few years, it seems there's been a go‑to guy established. It was Jacob Pullen
and then Rodney McGruder. I wonder if there is an obvious successor now or go
to the guy with the most experience? Is that going to be the case this year?
  
COACH WEBER: I hope it is. It's kind of the opening statement. If we're going
to be successful, those guys got to be consistent. Early we're going to have
to play well at the point pretty much most of the game. I'm not sure it will
take away from his scoring a little bit, so that means Shane Southwell and
Thomas Gipson have to be the guys that really step up.  
I think in the future, Marcus Foster can shoot and he can score the
basketball. The young man, the freshman from Wichita Falls, Texas, he can
score. Jevon Thomas is very, very talented also. But we're not going to get
him till Christmas, so he's kind of out of our thoughts right now. But those
two guys for the long‑term future will be special players for us. But right
now we need those older guys to be there every day and give us consistent
play.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say that Marcus is the most ready to contribute right
away?  
COACH WEBER: Scoring‑wise, there's no doubt. He just is very dedicated. He's
worked at his game. Jumps up and shoots the basketball very confident‑wise.
The All‑Star games in Texas, he was the leading scorer in both of them. We had
a scrimmage before the last football game. Right away, first shot of the game,
boom, Marcus three. So he doesn't seem to hesitate.  
Some of the other guys, Wesley can give us some defensive. He's got long,
athletic rebounds. Then Nigel gives us a little bit of quickness. I just think
scoring‑wise, Marc is probably the one that's going to set himself apart from
everybody else.  
  
Q. You mentioned Angel. If you would, could you just talk about how you feel
like the guys are handling the void left by a fellow who started 33 games last
year, gave you a ton of minutes and was obviously a leader for this
ballclub?  
COACH WEBER: It was obviously disappointing, especially when it happened so
late. Kind of people that have always been in it a long time, it's part of the
modern era of college basketball, transfers. You look at the list and every
year it grows and we set records.  
For our players, all we can worry about is what we can control. And that is
who we had in the program. We were fortunate to have Will. He's played point
guard. He's a four‑year guy. He really knows the game probably as well as
anyone. He'll be a coach down the road, I've got to believe.  
Then we have some talented freshmen, but they are freshmen. Just like Angel
went through the freshmen growing pains, these guys will go through it. So
we're fortunate to have Will, and wish Angel the best. He's a great kid. He
really bought in and did a great job for us. Just disappointing that we don't
have him. But, again, you've got to control what you can control, and that is
the guys in our program.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Tech Coach Tubby Smith. Coach,
welcome to the Big 12.  
COACH SMITH: Thank you. I'm excited to be here. Looking forward to our first
Big 12 press conference, Media Day, so we're ready to get started.  
  
Q. Obviously, you've been around the game a long time. We just heard Curtis
Shaw talk about the new hand checking rules. What are your thoughts on that
and the impact they're going to have on the game?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I really haven't had a chance to‑‑ in fact, we're going to
have a scrimmage this weekend. And we've been allowing our guys to play the
way they normally play, play aggressive, play physical.  
But it will probably add something to the offensive‑‑ I think you'll see
offenses be a little more explosive. Because if you disallow that hand
checking and physical play at the point of attack with the point guards and
the guards, it's tough enough because guards can really break you down off the
dribble.  
So you're going to see a lot. I think offensive scoring will improve, so it
should be an exciting time. It's going to be, obviously, enforcing it and
calling it is always a challenge. As long as it's consistent throughout the
year, then I don't think coaches or players will have a problem adjusting to
it.  
  
Q. What was it about the Texas Tech situation that attracted you there,
because obviously you could have gone a lot of other different places, you
could have bided your time? When you look at that situation that you stepped
into with the changeover they've had with coaches and the roster, what are
your priorities coming in?  
COACH SMITH: Well, first, when you're fired from a job, you never expect that.
I've been in the business 39 years, and you provide a service for programs and
communities and universities. So we did the best we could.  
Now, I think we've done it the right way over the years. So I wanted to take
some time. But sometimes it doesn't go that way. What happened was I get a
call maybe the next day or two days after I was let go in Minnesota by the
folks at Texas Tech, and it's good to be wanted. Certainly I feel like it's an
opportunity. They have a need there, and they want some stability and some
continuity. Certainly the commitment is there by the administration at Texas
Tech. So that's sort of how it happened.  
Again, you're right. When you're in that predicament and you're no longer
working, which you've been able to do for so many years. It never was my
ability to lean on coach and been questioned‑‑ well, I'm sure I've been
questioned by a lot of people, but never to that level where you're going to
be fired.  
I was impressed with the facilities. So I think Lubbock is the largest city in
the Big 12. The United Spirit Arena is a beautiful facility. Certainly they've
had a tough time at Texas Tech. They've had some lean years over the last few
years, so we felt like coming in there we could restore some pride and
prestige to the program. I think we're on the right track with some good
returning players that I think will help us. Because they were not far away
last year. I think in watching some of the film and going back and evaluating
their team from last year, they were very close from having a very good year
last year. And I felt comfortable having been to Lubbock before. Not
necessarily coaching, but through their recruiting, I've been impressed with
the people there and the things they stand for.  
Obviously, the Big 12 is an outstanding conference, as good as the Big Ten. So
it's another challenge and another opportunity for ourselves to measure
ourselves against the best.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been in coaching a long time. How much did Gerald Myers
figure into your decision to go to Texas Tech?  
COACH SMITH: Well, he's one of the most respected coaches and administrators
in the game of basketball and sports, in college sports. So that helped. It
helped that Coach Knight and Coach Myers had good things to say about Lubbock,
about Texas Tech. So that was a very convincing and very beneficial in helping
me make the decision to come to Lubbock. They've both been very involved
consistently and continuously over the last‑‑ since I've been here. Certainly
Coach Myers has been a great help and a great asset.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Curtis Shaw, who is the men's basketball officials coordinator
for the Big 12, is going to give you some information and take your questions.
He's going to wander around in the front, so we'll try to keep this officiated
pretty well here.  
CURTIS SHAW: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for letting me be here. We
started this last year, and I think it's a great way to get our message out to
your constituents and the people you talk to.  
This year is an exciting year in basketball. I know you've all heard about it
and seen a lot of stuff and heard a lot of coach's comments. I think for the
betterment of the game, the Rules Committee, the Men's Basketball Committee is
really undertaking some great steps to change the style of play and to make
the game a little more exciting, a little higher scoring. I think everything
we've done is of a very positive nature.  
I've been around visiting all of our coaches. They understand it. They know
it. There are different degrees of acceptability. There is a lot of angst
trying to figure out if they're going to do this the whole year, how are we
going to handle this. But I think all in all it's been really a great thing.  
I brought some film clips to show you some examples of what went on in the
past that we used to get away with, and this year they're going to be fouls.
The intent of these rules is not to shoot more free throws. I've heard a lot
of this. All you want to do is shoot more free throws. That is not the intent
at all.  
One of the unintended consequences early may be more fouls. But we have the
greatest athletes we've ever had in college basketball. We've got the smartest
coaches we've ever had in college basketball, and they'll adjust. It's just a
matter of getting used to what the new situations are and breaking some bad
habits because our kids have played so long doing certain things.  
I think we'll go through a little bit of a growth period. But because we
started so early talking to them‑‑ I've been to our practices, and the coaches
are talking to them every day. I don't think it's going to be that bad. I
think in the long run, it's really going to help our game and really increase
the scoring. It's going to increase the fan interest and increase the media
interest. So I think it's all going to be really great.  
Brought some film clips of types of plays I want to show, and we'll talk about
them a little bit. But the two biggest rules for this year that are changes
are the perimeter play, and it's the contact on the perimeter ball handler. In
the past, these rules were always in the rule book, but they were in the back
of the rule book. They were under guidelines, points of emphasis. The Rules
Committee decided this was so important they moved it into the actual rule,
Section 10 in the rule book, and said these are no longer judgment calls.
These are no longer plays that we're going to give you some leeway to decide
if it matters or not. If these four things happen, it's an automatic foul.  
If you continually jab at a player, it's an automatic foul. We say continual.
We'll let a player close out. We'll let them touch them and measure up. But
when they keep measuring up, we're going to call a foul. If you stick your
hand on them and leave it on them or stick your forearm on them and leave it
on them, it's an automatic foul. If you ever put two hands out on a player,
it's an automatic foul.  
Then the one I think is most important because it's how our kids learned how
to play is this forearm down here. They do a great job closing out on players,
and the minute they go to drive and move, they put this forearm down. We've
watched enough film to find out that forearm down here can guide the offensive
player wherever they want them, and it's a big change in the game. So none of
this contact is allowed anymore.  
The practices I've been at, the close scrimmages I've been at, the players are
figuring out. They close out like they used to, and they're starting to do
this. That's exactly what we want to have happen and the powers that be in
basketball want to happen.  
So I think it's a great change for college basketball. Maybe a little growing
pains early, but it's going to help the game.  
The next biggest change we made is in the blocked charge. We started a couple
years ago by putting in the restricted arc. It's player safety issues. We know
how much we talk about concussions in basketball and football and every other
sport. But we don't want a player being able to slide over in the last second
and undercut a player who is about to be airborne and can't change his
direction. The arc didn't work the way we wanted it to. We still had way too
many charging fouls that were never intended to be charges.  
So they changed the rule to the NBA interpretation, which is the secondary
help defender must be set before the offensive player starts any upward
motion. That's basically when he hits his plant foot, it's when they show that
he started up. That means a secondary defender can't slide under under a
defenseless offensive player.  
Again, it's a safety issue and it's a scoring issue. We want to see kids, if
they do a good job beating their primary defender, being able to go to the
basket and score.  
So two big changes. Both for the better of basketball. Both going to be a
little confusing early. Both may create some controversy early with the number
of fouls. But that's an unintended consequence. It's about making the game
better, and our coaches and players will adjust.  
Here are some examples of plays in the past we've let go. That contact with
the left arm, that contact with the left hand, those are now fouls. You can
see the consequence in this play. It created a turnover, and it was fully
accepted. But the offensive player never had a chance to get his team into
their offensive pattern and never had a chance to run his play because 50 feet
away from the basket, he's being harassed. That was never the intent of
basketball.  
Another example of coaches saying show your hands and get into them. But you
can't create contact as a defensive player. Here we have allowed the defensive
player to slide over and show his hands, but definitely stick his body in and
it creates a turnover. These are the type of plays and type of illegal contact
that the new rules are targeting.  
The forearm is our kids' favorite move these days. They've learned since day
one to show one hand and stick the other arm up. So even though this player
beats him on the baseline, this is a foul now. As soon as he extends that
forearm, uses it to ride the player, we're going to have a whistle. We're not
going to wait to see if he goes ahead makes the basket. There is no judgment
about advantage, disadvantage. It is a foul. Don't play with your arms on the
offensive player.  
Left hand, then right hand, typical plays. It doesn't seem like a lot of
contact, but as you can see by putting that hand on to measure up, then that
hand on to guide him, he loses control of the basketball, so we never get into
our offense even with that kind of contact. No more double hand check. Measure
up one time and keep your hands off the offensive player.  
Seems like a slight deal, but by being able to stick my left hand out and
keeping the offensive player from getting where he wants to in the middle,
automatic fouls now. No more judgment. Automatic calls.  
We talk about perimeter players. A perimeter player is anyone with the
basketball not in the lane area, facing the basket. So whereas the big man
pops out right here, and that's not where the foul was, once he turns and
squares up, even though he may be the five man, he's now the perimeter player.
So the same rules are going to apply.  
This hand on the hip is a play that the Rules Committee really talked about,
but they watched a lot of film and actually had an ex‑player come in who had
hands about this long. He said, if you let me put my hand right here, I can
take you wherever I want to. You can't even tell I'm pushing.  
So, again, a play like this where he just puts it on and reaches around, these
are going to be automatic fouls.  
Blocked charge. The second rule we changed the interpretation of. Again, it
was about safety, and it's also about freeing up the offensive player.  
There is a play that in the past it looks pretty good. As a referee, you're
always taught from day one, if it hits him square in the chest, you've
probably got a charge. When you watch his play and he ends his dribble and
starts his upward motion, the defender definitely takes that half step
sideways. The offensive player had nowhere to adjust and nowhere to change. So
why would we penalize him for making a move by the defender moving sideways?  
Part of the blocked charge rule is we didn't do a great job refereeing it. It
was a hard play to see when a defender was set when your foot left the floor.
This gives ‑‑ the new interpretation gives the officials a longer window to
see the whole play and to figure out was the defender legal or not. It's not
about drawing a charge. It's not about calling charges. We don't want more
charges. But if the defender is not legal, we cannot penalize the offensive
player.  
Here's an example where a defender still can get there and help as a secondary
defender. So the play still happened. But he has to get there and get set
before the offensive player ends his dribble and begins his upward motion.  
This is the type of play that we just want to make sure we have some kind of
whistle. Under the old interpretation‑‑ this happened to be in our tournament
a couple years ago, I watched this play, and it's technically a charge in the
old interpretation because he gets there before he leaves the floor. But that
is not the kind of play the Rules Committee wanted, so now it makes it easy to
call that a blocking foul.  
Again, Withey is going up. He's got nowhere to go and changes direction. The
defensive player is allowed to slide underneath him right now and gets a
charge under the old interpretation. But the intent of that play is not to
penalize an offensive player who has made a good move and beat his man. So now
under the new rule, it's a blocking foul.  
Restricted area that we thought would really help the game, we averaged .8
restricted area plays a game, so it just never happened. But a perfect
example, anytime a player has any part of his feet either in or over the
restricted area line, it's always a blocking foul.  
That's good. Let's cut those.  
I think that gives you an idea of what the Rules Committee and the Basketball
Committee is trying to do. It's not about creating more offense. It's not
about keeping teams from playing defense. It's about allowing basketball to be
the free‑flowing athletic game it was always intended to be.  
I think these are for the betterment of the game. Like I said, maybe an
unintended consequence early will be more fouls, but the players are really
good. Our coaches are really smart, and they're going to adjust and change
rapidly, and it's going to help the game.  
Any questions?  
  
Q. What's the biggest concern you're hearing from the coaches?  
CURTIS SHAW: We've had points of emphasis and guidelines from my 30 years of
basketball. Coaches say you'll come out in November, December, and do a great
job of calling it, and conference season hits and you don't call it anymore.
It's just going to be the same.  
What I try to tell them is this is different. It's not a point of emphasis.
It's not a guideline. They moved it from the back of the rule book to the
front. It is now written in Section 10 fouls.  
Referees have been told this must be called all year long, because it's a
rule. There is no judgment. If you do these things, it's a penalty. So I think
that's been part of the coaches' angst. Do I change the way I coach? Do I
change the way I play defense? And in January and February we're penalized. So
we're trying to reassure them this is nationwide.  
We have another conference call today with all the coordinators and the NCAA
to make sure we're all saying the right things. The Men's Basketball
Committee, the men's LLC, the Rules Committee is all saying this is for the
betterment of the game.  
So I think that's been the coaches' biggest concerns is is it going to be
called all year long.  
  
Q. With these new rules, do you think it will be harder for teams to play a
more full court press ‑type defense?   
CURTIS SHAW: I'm not a coach, so I don't want to answer for them. What I've
seen in practices and scrimmages so far is you really cannot guard a
full‑court, man‑to‑man in your face like we've allowed. Our coaches used to
teach because we allowed it. Get right up in them when they try to make a
move, make contact, drive them one way or the other.  
From what I've seen so far, you can still press. You can still press full
court. It's not the intent to take that out. But it's more you guide a player
one way or the other, drive him into a double team as opposed to just
attacking the basketball.  
So I think there will still be a lot of full court press. It will just be a
different kind.  
  
Q. The examples you were showing were basically all on the ball. How much
emphasis is being put on away from the ball, kids cutting, and the freedom of
movement and things like that?  
CURTIS SHAW: For the last three years that's been an emphasis. We want that
freedom of movement. We still have that same emphasis. When we talk to our
referees during the summer, during our clinics, we say the same things. If
they want to play defense, make them play by sliding their feet. If you're
trying to take a cutter, trying to hold him, bump him off a spot, it's still a
foul. So that really hasn't changed. We want to allow the total freedom of
movement for the ball handler and all the players that are cutting, moving, et
cetera.  
  
Q. I've talked to a lot of coaches who have obviously concerns. How do you
play tough defense in college basketball this year with the new rules?  
CURTIS SHAW: I'm not a coach, so I don't know how to answer that. But I will
tell you the focus of playing tough, physical defense was never the game of
basketball. The game of basketball‑‑ the NBA went through this cycle back in
the year 1999‑2000, and their scoring had gone from the 120 points a game to
100 points a game to 80 points a game. That's when they realized they had let
it get too physical.  
So we want you to be able to play defense. But it's always been you play
defense by keeping your hands up, slide your feet and keep your body in front.  
The fact of the matter of the ball handlers getting into the offensive players
was never one of the ten rules of basketball. If you go back to look at those
ten rules, it clearly says to hold, push, trip. It's always an issue.  
So I think we're just really going back to the rules of basketball, saying
let's go back to playing an athletic game, not a physical game.  
  
Q. Most of the questions have been about players and coaches adjusting. This
is an adjustment for the officials too. I'm curious, is there a plan of more
‑‑ I don't want to say oversight, but more regular feedback about how they're
calling these things than maybe in years past?   
CURTIS SHAW: We always give feedback, but in the Big 12 with the agreement of
our ADs and our commissioners, we put in a video review. We're going to review
every game within 48 hours of the game and grade it. So every call will be
graded in everything we do. This is something that they did in the NCAA
Tournament. They started it a few years ago. I have some history with the NBA.
They do it after every game, and we thought this was going to be a great way
to get feedback.  
We'll say Curtis Shaw was 15 out of 18 in this game. What were the three calls
missed? The referees will get a copy. The coaches get a copy. They'll know
we're reviewing it. It gives the referees a chance to go back and look at the
three plays that he, quote, missed.  
And it helps me find tendencies. If Curtis Shaw is 15 out of 18 for five
straight games and all of them are blocked charges, I know I have to do
something to teach him about blocked charges.  
So I think what our conference has done with the video feedback will help the
referees even more than we used to in the past.  
  
Q. How do you expect these rules to improve the game overall, long ‑term?   
CURTIS SHAW: Free flowing, scoring, less physicality on the perimeter. Allow
our athletes, which is probably the greatest I've ever seen in my 30 years, to
play basketball. Spend more time on the practice floor. I've seen in what
we've watched so far, it creates a lot more mid‑range jump shots that right
now we're not very good at. Our coaches will tell you, we don't want that
shot. We're shooting 35% from 12 feet. We're shooting 34% from the three‑point
line. Back up and shoot a three because we get more reward for it.  
I think we want to see the mid‑range game come back. If you're playing a
softer man, if you're playing more zones, which may be a consequence, that is
a game that's going to come back. So our 9th, 10th, 11th graders that we're
recruiting now will go in the gym and practice the mid‑range shot, practicing
the scoring moves in the post as opposed to going into the weight room. So I
think we'll get a lot more of the athleticism back in the game.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Bill Self from Kansas. Coach, your
opening thoughts and welcome.  
COACH SELF: Good morning, everyone. I wish we could have started this at 6:30
instead of 8:00, don't you guys?  
We're obviously excited for another great year of league play. It's going to
be a terrific team, and, I mean, terrific league with good teams, and
hopefully we'll be one of them.  
Certainly I think there is as much anticipation in our group as what we've had
in just about any time that I've been there. So should be a lot of fun, and a
time that we're very much looking forward to.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of talk about Andrew Wiggins, but Joel Embiid has been a
guy that's really blossomed, it seems, early. Can you talk about him and what
you expect to see from him this season?  
COACH SELF: I think Joel has a chance to be about as talented a big guy as
I've ever had. He's only been playing ball for two years. He's just starting
his third. He's made a lot of progress in a short amount of time since he's
been with us. If he continues to improve at this rate, he could be a guy that
could not only really impact our league, but impact the landscape nationally a
little bit.  
He's young and green and doesn't really know what he's doing, but there is
obviously a skillset there that few seven‑footers have.  
  
Q. The anticipation, I think you're right, but so much of it is unproven.
How do you handle that?  
COACH SELF: The thing about it is that we've had on a national scene, we've
been ranked higher preseason a lot of times than we are this year. But seems
like to me there is more hype around this team in large part because of our
recruiting class, the unknown, and of course getting Andrew late.  
All we've really doneis basically tell our guys there's been some pretty good
players here before you that have proven their ability and how they can impact
a program, and none of you guys have even made a basket yet.  
It's not going to be easy. You're going to have to fight for everything you
get. Certainly I think with the hype surrounding our newcomers, I think
they'll get everyone's best shot too. So if we're not prepared for that, it
could be a pretty slow start. But they're excited.  
They come to work every day, and really we don't talk much about the hype. We
just talk about trying to get a little bit better each day.  
  
Q. How do you respond when you hear LeBron and Durant comparisons when
people are talking about Andrew Wiggins?  
COACH SELF: Well, he hasn't asked for any of it. If you talk to him, he's
about as humble and low‑key guy that deflects attention as much as anybody
I've been around. But when you hear those things, it's not fair. It's because
he's not bad. I don't even know of one player that I can think of that he's
like that guy. He's just Andrew. That's all he needs to be is just try to be
himself and not live up to what other people think he should be. When you're
the cover of SI and they're comparing you to Chamberlain and Manning, and in
Chamberlain's first game he went for 52 and 31, that's not going to happen. He
could go for 20 and 10 and disappoint everybody.  
But the thing about Andrew, if you really understand ball, he'll be a guy that
will impact our team in ways other than scoring points because he can do a lot
of different things. And so much of what is perceived of him, if he didn't get
22 a night or whatever it is, it will be not successful. Well, that may not
happen. But he can impact in ways to help us win far more so than maybe
anybody I've ever coached.  
I hope people do cut him some slack from a production standpoint. I think the
expectation should be high. I think that there should be hype. But comparing
some of the guys that they've compared him to I don't think is fair because
those guys come around once in a lifetime.  
But he is talented and he can certainly put his handprint on everything that
we do.  
  
Q. Following up on that, you've had some big perimeter guys. How do you see
your guards fitting the way you want to play when you have a guy like Andrew?
Do they compare to any teams you've had before?  
COACH SELF: Last year we had big guards too with Travis and Ben. You know, not
quite as big as we're going to be this year. Some of my best teams I've had
little‑bitty guards, guys that make plays. But I do think there is a
difference with Wayne and with Andrew. I do think they can make plays and make
them off the bounce. I think they can make them off the catch too because they
both shoot the ball pretty well.  
It's going to be a little bit different, but we're not going to play much
different. We're going to try to put them in as many ball screens as we
possibly can and get them to the point where they can attack off the bounce
and get a piece of the paint like those little guards we've had in the past. I
think they'll be able to do it.  
  
Q. Hey, Bill, just discuss the impact of the new rules, how is it going to
change things?  
COACH SELF: My initial thought was that scoring is going to go up and good
play is going to go down. That was my initial thought. Because the reason
scoring will go up is because we're shooting more free throws. It won't be
because of artistic play. I've always thought the way to improve our game was
to try to create a situation where you get more shots. I don't know if this is
going to create more shots. I think it's going to create more free throws,
which I'm not saying is bad. But when you watch a game‑‑ early in the season
we may have some games where you can't go up and down twice without having
stoppage because it's going to be a broken game in large part.  
But I think players will adjust, coaches will adjust. I think over time it
will be good. I'm a little concerned early on that, to get to where we need
it, it's going to be some pretty fragmented games.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to prepare for a guy like Marcus Smart with all the
things he's capable of doing?  
COACH SELF: He's probably the best competitor maybe we've played against since
I've been coaching at Kansas. He's a terrific competitor and he's a great kid.
He can do a lot of different things. But the biggest thing he does is he wills
his team to win. He's a great player, but that is his biggest quality, in my
eyes.  
Preparing for his strength and preparing for his ability to get in the paint
and all that stuff is important. Yet he's going to do whatever it takes to
give his team the best chance. Sometimes those are the hardest guys to prepare
for.  
  
Q. You talk a lot about how freshmen by the end of the season aren't really
freshmen anymore. At what point does that change occur? Given the schedule
that you guys have, does that change have to occur maybe sooner than ever for
you this year?  
COACH SELF: Well, we're going to make mistakes and we'll struggle in some
areas, and I assume closing close games out could be a struggle until you
learn how to win and that kind of stuff.  
But I would hope by conference play we don't allude to these guys as young
kids, inexperienced and that kind of stuff. Because the game that's we play
non‑conference, if that can't get a freshman ready to become a sophomore by
mid‑season, I'm not sure there is any schedule out there that can.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH KRUGER: It's great to be here. It's a great time of year, and it seems
like all the coaches, we were here just a short time ago. It's come around
very quickly.  
But terrific time of the year with practice started and everyone's excited and
enthusiastic about the year ahead, and certainly we are. We look forward to
the first exhibition game in a come weeks and we look forward to that and
getting it started.  
  
Q. You guys had an overseas trip. Just talk about the benefit of that.  
COACH KRUGER: It was good. We've got a lot of new guys. The opportunity for
them to get ten practices under our belts, five games on the trip, the time
together off the court on the trip, sightseeing, whatever, it was really good
for this group.  
I think it benefits all groups, but I think it was the younger group. We've
got five or six guys that haven't played any Big 12 minutes, so for them to
get a little more experience, little more exposure is really good for them.
Don't know if we could have gotten more from the trip from a sightseeing
educational standpoint. Extremely beneficial. Ten days of practice, five games
over there were really, really good for us.  
  
Q. One of the new guys was Ryan Spangler, I believe is his name?  
COACH KRUGER: True.  
  
Q. Could you introduce us to him and what you hope he brings?  
COACH KRUGER: Ryan is a guy that's a blue collar‑type guy. He brings it every
day. He loves to play. He runs the floor very well, a good rebounder. Will
step out and make shots, pick up opportunities around the basket. Just one of
those guys that coaches love because he's very competitive.  
He's a gym rat. Will do all the dirty work inside. Just loves to play. He's a
good teammate. Even though he's just a sophomore, he'll quickly become a
leader for us and does a good job every day.  
  
Q. Have you seen your three guards or freshmen a year ago take a pretty big
step forward in terms of coming back for their sophomore seasons?  
COACH KRUGER: We really have. Isaiah will play a totally different role in
moving to the wing. Last year we saddled him a little bit with trying to be a
point guard. Little unfair to him, but we just needed some help in that area.
He worked at it, but much more comfortable moving to the wing, running the
floor, looking to be more of a scorer, attacking off the dribble much more.
Je'lon Hornbeak will play ‑‑ swing over and play some points and have a good
understanding for the game and very competitive. Making progress as well.  
But Je'lon and Buddy are both coming off surgery in the off‑season, buddy
during the latter part of last season with the fifth metatarsal. Both have had
good recovery from that and both playing full speed right now.  
All three of those guys, Buddy doing what he does in terms of great
enthusiasm, great energy, all very healthy right now and looking forward to
getting going.  
  
Q. Give us an overview of what your thoughts are on the Big 12 conference
this year.  
COACH KRUGER: Everyone thinks their league is great, and ours is no different.
Obviously, a lot of new players. That's exciting. There will be some turnover
in terms of rosters in some cases, in other cases pretty good chunk of the
minutes returning. But when you look at the roster with Kansas, Oklahoma
State, Baylor all returning a lot of people, I think they understandably are
thought to be at the top of the league in the preseason expectations. But
then, I think, great balance as well after that.  
It will be an interesting race, as all conferences are. It's great to see how
things unfold. Everyone has their expectations and predictions early. To see
how those either become reality or not, exciting to watch that.  
It will be a very good league, very good league, and fun to watch it unfold.  
  
Q. You've gotten Oklahoma back into the NCAA Tournament last year. I'm just
wondering how much of a sense of satisfaction you took out of that. It had
been a couple years a few years since OU had been there.  
COACH KRUGER: Well, satisfaction anyone feels from a coaching perspective is
the results of how the players feel. I was really, really pleased. I knew we
had five seniors, and Amath M'Baye is a sixth guy we lose off of that team.  
For those guys to have the opportunity to experience the NCAA Tournament was
very satisfying because they worked hard and had gone through their college
careers. For them to have graduated and not have had that opportunity‑‑ I know
they took great satisfaction in that as well. Because everyone, when you start
out a season, that is your goal to play in the NCAA Tournament. For those guys
to realize that goal was very satisfying and very pleasing.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to prepare for a guy like Marcus Smart when your team
is facing Oklahoma State?  
COACH KRUGER: He's a terrific player and does so many things on the floor. I
think when you have a guy like Marcus that can impact the game in so many
different ways, it makes it even more difficult to prepare for him. He's just
involved. Defensively, offensively, late game, terrific player, gets great
results. You've got to be aware of him at all times.  
I guess in one way that makes it easier to prepare for him because there are
not any surprises. You know he's going to be terrific, and you've got to be
ready to take it on every possession. He's an outstanding player and tough
preparation.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on the new hand check rules and how difficult they
could be for players to play defense this season?  
COACH KRUGER: It will be extremely difficult, and that's what they want. That
they are able to, and hopefully they are, call it like they're prescribing and
sustain that throughout the course of the season, I think we'll all be better
for it.  
That's a challenge. It's going to be a big challenge. NBA, when they did it
10, 12 years ago, it was a huge, huge difficult transition. Fans hated it,
players hated it, coaches hated it, and the game turned out much better for
it. But it took time. It took time.  
The games will be ugly early. Everyone will be unhappy about it, but hopefully
they can sustain it and call it the way they're projecting. It will be a huge
adjustment. A huge adjustment.  
Maybe, we were talking about it coming up this morning, as big of an
adjustment for the game as we've seen, and that includes the clock, the
three‑point line. It's going to be a huge impact on the game.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH KRUGER: Yeah, right at the very beginning of it, yes, yeah, they were.
So it wasn't a big adjustment for me because I didn't know any difference
anyhow. But tons of fouls, a lot of free throws, long, ugly games. I think
hopefully fans can prepare for that. Coaches are going to have to. It's going
to be frustrating. Players are going to be in a lot of foul trouble early on.
It's just going to happen. There's no way around it.  
Hopefully, again, the biggest challenge is clearly going to be for the
officials. Because they're going to take it from the media. No one's going to
like it. They're going to take it from the fans. They're going to take it from
the coaches. Players in foul trouble. It's going to be a huge adjustment for
the officials, and I'm hoping they can hang in there and execute the plan.  
  
Q. What kind of teams would be best prepared to take advantage of that?  
COACH KRUGER: The very skilled teams. The talent is going to win out. That's
what the NBA wanted a few years ago. The college game is wanting more scoring.
That will happen hopefully in time, but not just at the free throw line. Early
on it will happen at the free throw line, but hopefully later on it will be
higher scoring games through more movement. More good play, less contact. The
game has gotten‑‑ it's really gotten so physical and the freedom of movement
is something they're after and hopefully they can get that.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Trent Johnson from TCU. Coach,
welcome, and your opening comments?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I was impressed in year two, if we can get healthy and
remain healthy, we'll be a good basketball team. It seems like last year I was
up here saying if we can just find a way to be competitive to stay in games,
that would be fortunate from our standpoint.  
But we've got a good group of old and new. We have one senior in Jarvis Ray.
The young freshmen, Karviar Shepherd, Hudson Price, Brandon Parrish, Mike
Williams, they're all good, quality players, good kids. And the continued
development of Kyan Anderson and his leadership ability has been very
impressive up to this point.  
Like I said earlier, for us, and me in year two, I'm excited in my own way. I
think we have an opportunity, like I said, if we can get healthy and remain
healthy, we have a chance to be a pretty good basketball team this year.  
  
Q. Coach, was it an easy decision to bring Shepherd here even though he's a
freshman?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, it was an easy decision. I would like to bring all my
guys, quite frankly. But it was an easy decision because he's done his job in
terms of being coachable, competing at a high level, and doing all the things
that we as coaches and his teammates like in terms of being consistent with
his behavior.  
So it was basically not necessarily my decision, but it was everybody's
decision on this basketball team.  
  
Q. I remember you came here last year and kind of ‑‑ not downplayed, but I
think provided an honest assessment of where you thought your guys were going
to be. Now you're saying the bar is a little bit higher. Just talk about this
optimism. Do you think you're being undersold a little bit this season?   
COACH JOHNSON: No, no, you know me. I don't get caught up in all the fluff and
duff. I don't want to sell anything. I just think if we're healthy. We're much
improved from a skill‑level standpoint. We're much improved from size and
strength. Obviously, losing Devonte Abron hurts us. But what does it hurt us?
If we're fortunate enough to win with Chris Washburn, he'll be able to help us
this year. We'll still be able to compete and have better practices. That's
where you get better at. Last year we had too many coaches on the floor to try
to compete and play to just basically get through the year and through the
season.  
But my optimism is based off the facts, and the facts are you should shoot the
ball better and play at a faster tempo. I understand our scrimmage last year
at this time. Scoreless with six minutes to go. This year with 65 to 59. So I
shut it down with about seven minutes.  
That's where my optimism is based. Amric Fields is huge in this, but he's
going to be back when he's back. Is he on schedule, behind schedule? That I
don't know. That I don't concern myself with. I concern myself with the guys
on the floor now, and the guys in practice. They give me an indication and a
chance to be good if we can just stay healthy.  
  
Q. How much momentum have you gained from the recruiting class, from Karviar
and the others, kind of how to make your mark from that standpoint? Are you
seeing as you go around now off the court that that you are making inroads?  
COACH JOHNSON: I think we're making inroads. I said this when I took the job
that the state of Texas has a lot of good basketball players. Are there enough
great players to go around? I don't think so. But there are enough good ones
to go around. So without question, we have a great education, we have a great
location. With the renovations to Daniel‑Meyer Coliseum, which is where we
play, we have a commitment from our administration and our fans.  
The caliber of basketball we played last year wasn't good, so to get the kind
of support we did I thought was very, very encouraging.  
Like I said, there are a lot of good players in the state of Texas. The huge
thing is it's not a sell, it's a fact. The challenge is to the guys that we're
recruiting. Do they have enough courage to come and be part of building a
tradition and being part of it. They can go elsewhere and be part of something
that's already been established, and that's just a common fact. We've been
received pretty well. But the bottom line moving forward is we have to
continue to get better players in our program and tougher‑minded people in our
program, and I really think that's going to happen sooner than later.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now with Coach Bob Huggins. Coach would like to go
straight to questions, so questions for Coach.  
  
Q. With the new hand checking rules, do you think they'll improve the game
overall?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I think probably if we get a year maybe to see. I
think the fallacy is we're not going to have contact. You can't put ten people
that big, that strong, that fast in such a confined area. They're going to run
into each other. I mean, it just happens, and it's always been a contact
sport.  
I think what they're trying to do is free up the guy with the ball more. I
don't know. Ask me a year from now, and I can eloquently answer your question.
Or at least I think it's eloquent.  
  
Q. The story on the sweater? That is a good ‑looking sweater.   
COACH HUGGINS: Really good looking, isn't it? You're jealous. I don't know. I
figured I'd be the Max Good of the Big 12. I was in the LMC with Max, and
every year he'd come in with an entirely different look. So I just figured I'd
do it.  
  
Q. It works.  
COACH HUGGINS: It will be something for you to write about.  
  
Q. I think it's more of a photo op. Hey, just talk about Harris and
Henderson, how much you guys need to kind of be built around those guys.  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we've gone from, I think, trying to ineffectively throw
it inside to we're going to be more of a perimeter team. I think what's kind
of‑‑ there are a few fun things left in this business, and I think one of them
is to watch people mature. Those guys went from being very shy, skinny little
guys to not knowing what to do and kind of being not very assertive to taking
a leadership role. We don't have any seniors, and we only have five returning
guys, so those five guys kind of have to assume a leadership role for us.  
It's kind of fun watching those two guys grow into that role, helping the
younger guys with the things that I think they struggled with maybe initially
a year ago.  
But they're both talented guys. They're both talented guys and they're both
really good guys. So we look for them to have big years for us.  
  
Q. I know that throughout last season when people asked you about the
transition into the Big 12, you kind of held them off at a distance. In the
end you opened up about some things. The travel was difficult, and there were
some areas that were difficult. In a way, does it feel like starting over this
year? You've got the transition year out of the way, and you're starting from
square one?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I guess, I think people assumed since I've been in the
league for a year that I kind of knew what was going on. I was kind of hoping
that I did. It was an entirely different league when I was there. We had a
north division and a south division, and you played everybody in the north
twice and played the south once. So it's an entirely different league and an
entirely different atmosphere than it was when I was at K‑State.  
The travel was harder than what we thought it was going to be. I think the
commissioner and everybody in the league have done a great job of trying to
make it as painless as you can possibly make flying four hours painless. The
whole league is different.  
Let's be honest, officiating in this league compared to the officiating in the
Big East was night and day. The atmospheres were night and day. You go from a
league where you play maybe half of your games in NBA arenas that are
downtown, away from campus, and you don't have the student involvement that
you have in the Big 12. I think the atmospheres in the Big 12 are far tougher
to play in than they are in leagues where you don't play on campus.  
So there was, I think, a great deal of adjustment for not just the coaches,
but I think the players as well.  
And the other thing I think was before in the Big East because we were an hour
flight away and four‑ or five‑hour drive and because we had so many alumni up
and down the East Coast everywhere we went, we had a tremendous following. In
this league, it's really hard and we don't have the alumni base that we have
in the East. So there were a lot of differences.  
But as we tell our guys all the time, those students can't block a shot to get
a rebound, and I'm sure sometimes they don't call a foul. But there are other
things they can't do, so, you know, just play.  
  
Q. The NCAA just announced a five ‑game suspension with Frank Haith with the
Miami booster situation. I'm curious, do situations like that make college
basketball coaches more cautious about who they allow to be around their
programs?   
COACH HUGGINS: Oh, I think we all try. You know, it's really a double‑edged
sword because you want your guys to meet some people that are going to be
beneficial to them down the road. Potential employers, people who have
contacts, people who can make calls, people who can be references. At the same
time, you're supposed to stay away from those very people.  
It's a fine line I think we all walk to try to do the right things by the
kids, because the right thing really is for those kids to get to know people
that are going to help them down the road and in the future. But at the same
time, don't get too involved because then you cross over that line.  
I think we all do. I think we all walk a fine line. I mean, everybody could
sit up here and say we don't do that, and probably knowingly, we don't, but it
happens.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready with Iowa State head coach Fred Hoiberg. Coach,
your statement and opening comments.  
COACH HOIBERG: Great to be back. Always fun for us to come down to Kansas
City. It's been an interesting couple weeks of practice. We've got a lot of
production that we need to replace, losing over 52 points and 17 rebounds and
12 assists and over 280 of our 346 threes from a season ago.  
So it's been a lot of fun for us to see how hard our guys have come in and
competed for all the minutes available, especially in the guard court.  
We've got two great players coming back in our front court in George Niang and
Melvin Ejim. Both have added elements to their game, which I think will make
them a difficult duo to guard, especially when you can pull other teams big
players away from the basket. I think that's a great luxury to have on the
offensive end of the floor when you have two versatile players like we do in
our front court.  
Back court minutes, we're still trying to figure out who will deserve them.
I've loved how competitive our practices have been though to see who will get
those spots. DeAndre Kane was a very important addition for us, kind of a
combo guard is what he will be for us. He's a very versatile player again,
which fits how we play. 6'4", 210 pounds. You can use him in a lot of
different ways. You can post him up against smaller defenders where he's a
very good play maker. Averaged seven assists a season ago, and he's one of two
players in the nation to average 15 points in his first three seasons in
college basketball.  
Our two freshmen are really starting to come along. Matt Thomas is shooting
the heck out of the ball right now, and Monte Morris has been very steady and
will play for us at some back‑up point. Assist‑to‑turnover ratio has been
excellent in all the things that we have done statistically‑wise early on in
practice.  
Junior college players are starting to come along as well. The great thing
about them is their bodies are Big 12 ready. They've given us some experience
and played in good programs and been coached. We're just trying to put it all
together and trying to figure out what to do with the lineup on opening day.  
  
Q. If you could just expand a little more on what you're going to do at
point guard. I know Kane can play there, but is that the optimum situation for
you?  
COACH HOIBERG: He's been really good in that area for us so far. He's making
simple plays, which is something we really stress with our guys. Something
Korie Lucious, I thought, came a long way last year when he was trying to hit
home runs and had some turnover trouble early in the year. Again, DeAndre's
assist‑to‑turnover ratio has been very good. In fact, that's an area I think
we're a little ahead with this year's team than we were in the past.  
Monte Morris is a pure point guard. That is something that we really haven't
had much of in the past. Korie was really a scoring guard. Still did a good
job getting us into an offense and making plays. But Monte's first thought is
to go out and get everybody else involved. So I think he's got that point
guard mentality.  
Then the other thing we've done in the past is we've used multiple ball
handlers. Not only can DeAndre handle it in that first group, but George and
Melvin can also get us into an offense. That's a great luxury to have and it
makes you tough to guard.  
  
Q. How have the new rules affected your team, but in particular Melvin and
George?  
COACH HOIBERG: I think everybody will go through an adjustment period with the
rules. We've had a couple scrimmages where we've brought in Big 12 officials
inner squad, and it's a difference. It's going to be called. It's going to be
enforced. We've been told that by Curtis Shaw.  
So I think it will be good for the game. I went through it in the NBA as a
player where you can hand check guys, and then it went to an arm bar rule and
you couldn't touch anybody. It was pretty ugly at first. I remember some of
the games would take over three hours just because of all the fouls that were
called. But eventually the players adjust to it and the officials will adjust
to it. I think scores, I don't know if they'll go up this year, but I think
the next step is to lower the shot clock a little bit, and then you'll see the
scores starting to up.  
But I like the freedom of movement idea, and I think it will be great for the
game.  
  
Q. What's it been like for you to see where the expectations were for your
program when you took over to where they are now where you're picked fourth in
the league and most people probably have you going to the NCAA Tournament for
the third time in a row?  
COACH HOIBERG: I don't know about that. The one guy I showed our team is the
guy from USA Today that ranked us 10th. That is the one ranking I showed our
guys. That is the thing that I like being picked low, and then you try to go
out to prove people wrong.  
Again, I'm still trying to figure out what exactly we are as a group. What
will our identity be? Just because we have so many new people on this roster,
so many new faces. But I like what I've seen. I think our guys feel a little
bit of respect with being picked in the top half of our league. Will we live
up to that? I don't know yet. Hopefully we'll continue to evolve and come
together. We've been getting better every week, and hopefully we'll continue
on that trend.  
  
Q. You referenced USA Today. The coaches poll came out and Big 12 only had
two teams in the top 25. Is this conference being undersold a little bit?  
COACH HOIBERG: I think so. Obviously Kansas and Oklahoma State are very
talented. Throw Baylor in there as well. There is so much length and talent on
those three teams. Then I think there are so many unknowns with the rest of
us. I think we all lost quite a bit. There are quite a lot of newcomers and
transfers that have come in.  
So I think you could ask any of the ten coaches and I think they'd all tell
you, those rankings really don't mean much. Some could use them as motivation,
others can say, all right, if you're picked in the top 5, this is what the
expectations are we have to live up to. I think that's probably what you'd see
as far as what preseason rankings are all about.  
We'll see here soon. We'll see in a couple of weeks who was slighted and who
was picked where they should be.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you've seen George grow? As the team's third
leading scorer last year, can you talk about do you think he's ready to be
that number one option if he has to in some games?  
COACH HOIBERG: I don't know if I've seen George grow. I've seen him shrink a
little bit with his body. That is the biggest thing you'll notice in George is
he's a lot tighter than he was a year ago. Came in with some baby fat. Wasn't
able to play for long stretches like we would have needed him to or we'd have
liked him to play. When George gets tired, that's when he'll commit a foul
that he shouldn't do because he gets a little mentally fatigued as well out
there. He's in much better shape right now than he was a year ago.  
Still does everything he did a year ago. When you come into the league and
shooting 40% from three and the numbers go up as the competition gets better,
that shows the type of player and the type of‑‑ you know, George has always
played with a chip on his shoulder. I think he felt he was undervalued as a
high school player. Was never really ranked in the Top 100, but knew how
productive of a player he was. So we'll play through George a lot.  
The other guy, Melvin, is a guy who can play through. He's really improved in
the two years, the two summers when he's had a chance to play in two different
federations, Nigerian two years ago and the Canadian National Team this past
year. And he's really added to his game. Shooting the heck out of the ball
right now and making plays off the dribble.  
  
Q. I wanted to go back to the rules and your NBA experience. I remember with
the Phoenix Suns and the teams that took advantage of it then. What kind of
teams can take advantage of this situation?  
COACH HOIBERG: I think you can see a couple different types of teams. One
thing we're trying to incorporate more is driving the ball to create some hand
checks and get into the bonus faster where you can get three points at the
free‑throw line. Then, I think the fast teams, the teams that really get up
and down, will also be able to score better.  
The pressuring teams that hold you and grab you, it's going to be an
adjustment for those types of teams on how they're going to play and what
their style of play will be. But hopefully we can take advantage of it. We're
not going to deviate too far from what we've done here in the past because
we've had success scoring the ball. But one area we can is trying to get to
the free‑throw line a little more.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Travis Ford from Oklahoma State. Coach,
welcome, and your opening thoughts.  
COACH FORD: Excited to be here. Really I've enjoyed working with our team the
last three weeks. A little bit different feel with the early start time. But
I've really been impressed with our competitiveness in practice. The earlier
start time has allowed us to really mix the teams up and really have some
great scrimmages and different things with teams kind of evenly matched.
That's been exciting to watch.  
I really like our chemistry on our team right now. I really like the attitude
of our team right now. So it's been fun to watch. We just‑‑ at this point in
time, you've got to manage it all because it becomes such a longer season with
the new start time.  
But right now, the chemistry's been good. The attitude has been good. The
competitiveness has been very impressive. So those are the things that I like
about our team right now.  
  
Q. When Marcus came back, a lot of people talked about you guys being the
favorite at that point in the Big 12. Was that something you've embraced and
talked to your team about? Then when the conference poll came out, how did you
feel about being picked to win it with Kansas?  
COACH FORD: Well, we haven't talked much about where we were picked. We talk a
lot about understanding what our goals are and what we want to try to
accomplish. Winning a Big 12 Championship is something that we strive to do.
It's something we talk about, but we fully grasp that Kansas is still a team
to beat. I think any coach would tell you that. They're still the team in the
Big 12 that everybody's trying to compete with.  
We understand the expectations of this team. Our guys hear it every day from
the fans and the media and the positive things that are said, and we've
embraced it in the fact that, yes, we think we have a pretty decent team. But
we have to be humble enough to understand that expectation hasn't ever won
anything for anybody. We've got to be humble enough to handle it and hungry
enough to get a little bit better each and every day.  
We have a lot of motivation for our basketball team, which we talk about. Our
motivation is to be better than we were last season. We didn't end the season
the way we wanted to. But we had a lot of positive moments last season. A lot
of high moments, lot of great moments. But we did not end the season the way
we wanted to or expected to.  
We talk about that. We don't hide from that. We don't hide from, yes, we are
supposed to be a pretty good basketball team this year. We don't hide from
that. But we've got to understand it in the fact that we've not won anything.
We still have a lot of motivation to try to win a Big 12 Championship, a
regular season, a tournament and try to go deeper in the NCAA Tournament.  
So, for me, it hasn't been a problem as far as trying to motivate our guys
every day in practice, because there are many things to remind them that we
have not done.  
  
Q. How do you guys become a better perimeter ‑shooting team?   
COACH FORD: Well, we spend a lot of time on getting reps up and practicing our
shooting. At this point in time, practice has been one of our strengths,
shooting the basketball. Marcus is shooting the ball really well. Markel Brown
is shooting the ball really well, Brian Williams. We have some freshmen that
have come in and their strengths are shooting the ball, between Stevie Clark
and Jeffrey Carroll, these are some really knock‑down shooters on our
basketball team. Phil Forte is probably one of the best shooters in America.  
So we think we'll be an improved team just by what I've seen in practice so
far shooting the basketball. I think the new rules in place are probably going
to get you a few more open jumpers than in the past. So hopefully our
percentages will go up by the help of that rule. But it's an area we want to
look better at. There are areas we want to get better at. Shooting is one,
assist‑to‑turnover ratio is another, rebounding is another. Those are some
areas that we're trying to get better at from last season.  
I know who my top seven are right now. We're trying to figure out who is
eight, nine and ten on our basketball team. That is the challenge for our team
that we're looking at. So there are a lot of areas that we've got to get
better at.  
  
Q. Can you just go back and revisit Marcus's decision to come back and what
went into that and how rare it is for a guy like that who would be drafted so
highly to make that decision to come back?  
COACH FORD: Well, it was something that we knew was going to‑‑ as a coaching
staff, that we knew the decision was going to have to be made at the end of
the year. But it was something we never talked about with Marcus as the season
was going on. It was never brought up one single time. That's not always the
case. Some players you might need to talk to them about it as the season is
going along. But with Marcus it was never a distraction for him, so we never
really addressed it as the season was going along.  
Once we lost in the NCAA Tournament against Oregon, it became a daily
discussion, he and I and his mom and dad. We were able to keep it a fairly
tight‑knit group. But the biggest thing that I was proud of him about was it
went on for two, two and a half weeks, every day, discussions, putting in
front of him everything he needed to know about making his decision about
where he was going to be picked, the money situation, what that entailed, all
the pluses and minuses and everything that goes in it, we just gave it to
Marcus.  
What I was so proud and I'm so proud of him of and the greatest thing to come
out of that decision was he made it on his own, period. I think at some point
during the two, two and a half weeks he was waiting for somebody to tell him
what to do, because it's not an easy decision. But as I would tell him: I'm
not making the decision. I'm here to advise and you help you in any way
possible.  
There were days he would come in and he would say, Coach, I'm leaning on
wanting to stay. And I would play devil's advocate: I don't know if you want
to do that. You're going to be the third pick. Are you sure you can do that?
His mom and dad were telling him, Hey, you're only a kid once. You need to
make your own decision.  
When he finally made his decision and told me, I was so excited for him
because he made the decision, and that's‑‑ in today's day and age for an 18‑,
19‑year‑old in his position, very rarely do they get to make their own
decision. Someone is telling them what to do and they feel pulled in a certain
direction.  
I think there are a lot of NBA guys that leave early that really might want to
stay because college is a lot of fun if you're in a fun situation and you're
enjoying it. You can't get that back. I think that's what Marcus saw. It was,
hey, as he says, I'm not passing up the NBA. I'm just kind of pushing it all
to the side for a while. And I think that's pretty mature for a guy that was a
freshman in college. But he made the decision he wanted to make. Wasn't
pressured by anybody either way. He came to the decision: I want to stay in
college. I want to play in the NBA. It's a lifelong dream. I want to make a
lot of money someday. I want all of that. No question. But I am enjoying what
I'm doing. What I'm doing, I know if I make this next step‑‑ and this is him‑‑
I know I can't get that back. I don't care how much money I make. I can't come
back and play college basketball.  
He enjoys playing at Oklahoma State. He enjoys his teammates. He enjoys all of
that. I kind of thought that's the way he was feeling, just knowing Marcus
Smart. On the court you see his competitive nature, you see how serious he is
and how hard he plays. But in the locker room he's the practical joker of the
team. He's the most lighthearted guy on the team. And he just enjoyed being
that kid.  
So it wasn't a shock to me that he made that decision, but I'm very proud of
him and excited that he made the decision on his own. I thought it was very
mature of him to do that.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Scott Drew from Baylor. Coach, welcome,
and your opening thoughts about the season?  
COACH DREW: Well, it's an exciting time at Baylor University. Top 5 football
team in the nation, new football stadium. We're excited for the start of
basketball, and I know every coach is always excited to see how their team,
after practicing against each other for a while, how they compare against
other opponents. So we're excited for that.  
  
Q. You lost a terrific point guard. How are you going to replace that?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think, first of all, we return a great front court, and
that makes it easier for all guard play to begin with. But in practice we've
had six different people run the point at different times. So I think we have
multiple people that are capable of handling the ball, distributing the ball.  
I think instead of maybe being so dominant with the ball in one person's hand,
I think we'll share it a little bit more this year.  
  
Q. Could you just walk us through the conversations you had with Isaiah and
with Cory about whether to come back or head to the NBA? Both had their
options. What do their decisions mean to you in terms of the front line? This
may be as good as the one that went to the Elite Eight for you guys.  
COACH DREW: First of all, both people have great families and they get good
advice from home. I think their families would have supported them either way.
Starting with Isaiah, I know his family thought that another year in college
would serve him well and allow him to gain some strength and keep maturing on
and off the court, because all freshmen that sophomore year, you're able to, I
think, see more growth during that time than any other time.  
At the same time, Isaiah was perfect timing because he needed shoulder
surgery, and not being able to work out for NBA teams, it was a great chance
for him to rehab, get his shoulder right, work on his physical development. So
that's what went in with that.  
Again, we're very blessed because both individuals didn't receive bad advice.
It was more what's best for you. What would you like to do? And I think it's a
tribute to Baylor University and Baylor Nation that they'd want to come back
with Cory Jefferson who is a fifth‑year player now, and you don't see a lot of
those, and Cory is someone who is continuing to improve each and every day.
This summer he had great opportunities with the USA team, and with visiting
with him definitely could have gone at the same time. The thought of him
having a chance to play and move up in the draft this year and continue to
develop, that was something that he wanted to do. He cares for Baylor
University a lot. This will be his fifth year there.  
  
Q. Off topic, but Frank Haith reportedly will be suspended for five games
with the whole situation that happened at Miami. I'm curious, do situations
like that make college basketball coaches more cautious about who they allow
around their programs?  
COACH DREW: I think every college coach tries to do as good a job as they can
in trying to protect the program and making sure that we're not putting our
players in harm's way. Unfortunately we can't be with everybody 24/7, and
there has to be some trust. That's why it's great the more the rules are
explained, compliances offices are able to let the incoming recruits know that
stuff just so you don't jeopardize anyone's eligibility. Because a lot of
times‑‑ sometimes in high school rules can be broken and then they pay the
price when they get to college even and they didn't know that that rule even
existed.  
  
Q. Do you think the blocked charge (indiscernible) was worthwhile after
seeing it last season?  
COACH DREW: I definitely enjoyed it. I don't know how the officials liked it.
But from a coaching standpoint it was a lot easier to understand and teach
where you need to be. Players knew where they needed to be. I know with the
rules adjusting this year, it's going to be tougher to get charges, especially
in the middle tunnel. But I think overall it was something I was in favor of
for a while because I saw how‑‑ remember, coaches have to officiate in
practice. The charge circle made it easier for us. So you might have to ask an
official what they thought, but I was better in practice.  
  
Q. Last year you went into Kentucky and into their win streak there. This
year turn around, you're playing at Cowboy Stadium. They're going to be number
one in the country. Just how do you look at that game and both teams are
apparently on the upswing this season, as well as the venue where everybody's
going into Cowboy Stadium at the end of the year?  
COACH DREW: I think having the Final Four there is a great opportunity,
players from Kentucky and Baylor to have a chance to see what a Final Four
atmosphere is going to be like. At the same time, playing in a stadium like
that is nothing but exciting for everybody involved. I think it's going to be
a great weekend for Baylor University. You have men's and women's basketball
in a doubleheader versus Kentucky on Friday, and then on Saturday you have the
last home game at Floyd Casey Stadium versus Texas, an in‑state rivalry. So I
think that's going to be a great weekend for Baylor fans to watch sports.  
  
Q. I've heard a lot of buzz about Ishmail Wainright. What role can he play
for this team, and how important will he be for the program this year?  
COACH DREW: Well, Ish is what we call him for short. He's somebody that you
love to coach every day in practice. He walks on the floor and he has a smile,
brings energy to the team.  
Extremely coachable. Does all the little things. Sports fans really study the
game and appreciate the game because he's one of those guys that just makes
winning plays. He's very versatile, being someone that can play the 1 through
the 4. So he can provide match‑up problems depending on what position he
plays.  
Defensively, normally the biggest adjustment for everybody coming into college
is on the defensive end. He's somebody that really prides himself on that and
really wants to get after it on the defensive end. So that makes him somebody
that you don't have to worry about energy, effort, and the importance of
having them understand the importance.  
Sometimes coming out of high school, you can't really be aggressive or focus
on the defensive end because of the fouls. And you need to stay out of foul
trouble because of the offense. So it takes some time to catch up to the
intensity level needed. He provides all of that right away.  
  
Q. Coach, have you seen Isaiah Austin maybe take that next step in becoming
a more well ‑rounded player? How have you seen him improve so far this
off‑season?   
COACH DREW: Well, first of all, let's talk off the floor and being a sophomore
and leadership‑wise he's done a great job with the new players we have. I
think just seeing how he's related to them and how he's taken them under his
wing in different areas. Hey, let me help you get to class. Let me help you
with this. Now this is what you need to do. That's great to see.  
Then in practice he's somebody that we don't call a lot of fouls. He's moving
on to the next play and somebody that wants to know, hey, don't give me any
easy fouls. I want everything the hard way, and he wants to get better.  
A perfect example is losing team, if they have to run lines or whatever
punishment, he usually jumps in and helps them no matter if he was on the
winning team or not. So a lot of little things that are really impressive for
a sophomore.  
  
Q. You're going to be one of the few teams in the country that enters the
season on a winning streak. What was the value of that experience and then
your approach to that, to the NIT last year?  
COACH DREW: Well, cutting down nets in Madison Square Garden, there are only
two teams that finish with the win with the NCAA, and that's just a great
feeling going into summertime.  
But I think our approach, first of all, in the tournament was in it to win it.
I think you look at once you found the match‑ups and the brackets, so many
good teams in college basketball. I was just telling someone a little bit
earlier, the parity, the one year VCU was the last team in, people were upset
they got in and went to the Final Four and could have won a National
Championship.  
So it just shows you the fine line there is. That's what makes college
basketball so exciting today.  
Wednesday we knew who we were playing, and I know our guys were really excited
for that. Having postseason experience and being successful is very helpful,
especially to the young players who get a chance to extend practice time too,
and that post‑season feeling of win‑or‑go‑home mentality.  
So hopefully that definitely pays off for us this year. I know it was a great
experience for us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH BARNES: Good morning. Glad to be in Kansas City. If you're awake and got
any questions, I'm ready to take them.  
  
Q. If you're viewed as the hunter or the hunted, is there any difference in
the way you approach a season?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I think at the start of every season if you really have a
passion for what you're doing, you're going to‑‑ in your own mind you're going
to put the onus on yourself and your players and figure out that you'd think
that you could find a way to get things done.  
I guess when it gets down to the motivational part of it, I guess there's
always more pressure when you're being hunted. I've learned too that I think
it can work for you as well too. The one thing if you're being hunted, you
know you've got to be ready every single night, and that alone prepares you
for what you need to do in every aspect.  
On the other hand, if you're hunting somebody, you better be prepared too
because you know those opportunities are there, and you've got to be ready.  
But I think really the key to the whole deal is everyday preparation and that
you go about each game in a businesslike way, and you realize that college
basketball, a 40‑minute game, and we've seen it throughout our lives that
anything can happen.  
I just think it's about your daily preparation, and I don't like the clichés
of one day at a time and all that. But you do have to worry about today. You
have to be prepared for a lot of different things as you go with the injuries.
I guess, if you can get your guys to understand the fact that regardless of
what the situation is, if you're in it together, can you find a way to get
things done.  
  
Q. If you look at the roster, where's the scoring going to come from this
year?  
COACH BARNES: I think the players that have returned have all improved a great
deal. We're expecting a lot from Cameron Ridley, Jonathan Holmes, and Javan
proved a year ago he's capable of putting up numbers. That's been a big thing
with our improvement and our older guys coming back, and we're really excited
about our younger guys because of the way they really embrace the work ethic
that's been laid there for them from the older guys. I look at it as a team. I
do think that Javan and Cam and Jon Holmes all have proven that they can put
points up for us.  
Right now probably a little more concerned about our defense with these new
rules. It's a different game. I think it's going to be great for college
basketball. I think these rules have been great. I think they should have been
a long time ago. It's really hard for the defense. In the last two weeks we've
had to really think long and hard about how we're going to play without
fouling, because we've worked hard at trying to get fouled. Drive the ball,
put pressure on the rim. I'd like to see them take the rules a little bit
further. It's going to be really difficult to pick up a charge. So with the
defense being there, I wish they'd put the rule in where you cannot go up and
take it off the rim.  
The one thing I know we can do with this group is protect the rim, but these
rules have made it a little bit tougher. Right now I'm a little bit more
concerned about that side of it probably than the offense.  
  
Q. Coach, once the kinks are worked out, so to speak, will these rules
improve the game overall?  
COACH BARNES: I think it will. I think it's going to be a lot more‑‑ you're
going to have to move. You're going to have to move the ball. You're going to
have to move people. I think zone can make a big comeback. For a lot of people
there are going to be a lot of teams that will go back to the pack line
defense. Because if they call the rule the way it's going to be called, it's
going to eliminate contact on the perimeter. It's really almost going to be
really hard to pick up a charge. Because the rule is once you gather yourself
to take off, the guy's got to have legal guarding position.  
We actually had three charges that I would have thought‑‑ we had a scrimmage
Saturday that would be charges, but the referees called blocks. When you
looked at it on the camera, it was right. I think obviously we need more
scoring in the game, movement, but I'd still like to see them go to the NBA
lane line. I'd like to see them‑‑ now with not being able to take charges, I'd
like to see them let guys go up and take the ball at the rim. Snap it off
until it goes in. Love to see them lower the shot clock to 30 seconds.  
I'd really like to see us play the international rules. I think the game
should be a universal game, and we need that.  
But I do think it's going to be a drastic change in style of basketball if
they enforce that rule and call it like they say they are.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to prepare for a player like Marcus Smart with all
the things he's capable of doing?  
COACH BARNES: I think the thing that he's most capable of doing is he's a
tremendous competitor. I think as a coach, you know, you always talk about
competing with your players. I think that's a tremendous talent. I've always
said hard work is a talent. I think a competitor, someone that really has that
burning desire and passion to win, it's hard to come by. He's got a will about
him where not only does he compete the way he does himself, but it's what he's
done for his team.  
I think he single‑handedly changed the entire Oklahoma State program in terms
of the way he brought a level of intensity and toughness. But when you look at
him, he's one of those guys that I think is going to do whatever it takes to
put his team and himself to win games. So it will be interesting this year
when you think of him being a strong player, a hard‑nosed player. I think a
lot of guys this year as we adjust to these rules, but what Marcus has that
you've got to love is the fact that not only does he bring it every night, he
has a way to take a team and really rise their intensity to another level.  
I think that's what great players do. Not only do they do what they do every
night‑‑ again, when you're being hunted, as he has been and will be, the fact
that there's a lot of pressure, I don't think people realize how hard it is to
score 15, 16, 18 points a night when you know the other team is game‑planning
for you and you're able to go out and still do it every night. That's tough.  
Then when you also look at guys on like that that have the ability to make
their teammates much better, because they understand there may be nights when
they get double teamed that they're going to make the right play to make their
teams better. Marcus does all of that. He's a guy that I don't think there is
a coach in the country that wouldn't like to have him.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 22, 2013

  

### [Charlotte Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25992)

### [Bob Bowlsby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14164)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by two very special people to conclude this
morning's news conference. Up here we have Charlotte Anderson, who is the vice
president of the Dallas Cowboys, who will be co‑hosting with the Big 12 in
April, the NCAA Final Four Tournament, and the Commissioner of the Big 12, Bob
Bowlsby.  
We're going to start with Commissioner Bowlsby, and we'll let Charlotte make a
comment or two.  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Thank you. Appreciate y'all being here for Media Day.
Obviously we're in the eighth week of football season, but we're also getting
started for what will be another exciting basketball season, and that
basketball season will culminate in the greatest sports venue in the world,
AT&T Stadium. And we have really enjoyed the collaboration with the Cowboys,
and under Charlotte's leadership and we really feel like north Texas has
embraced this Final Four. It truly will be a Dallas‑Fort Worth and truly north
Texas hosted event. We are going to have events all over the Metroplex. It's a
terrific place to get in and out of from a transportation standpoint. There
are a lot of fun things that are going to go on during the course of the
weekend. Obviously, as the Commissioner of the Big 12, I believe we have some
teams with the capability to be playing when the Final Four commences in
Dallas.  
So we are excited about the basketball season from the Big 12 standpoint, but
we're particularly excited to be a part of the conclusion of the season, which
is the month of March, I think is among the greatest sporting periods that we
enjoy during the course of the year.  
I've had an up‑close and personal experience with the Basketball Committee and
the management of the tournament, and now I'm seeing an entirely different
element of how that process works, that being the view from the local
organizing committee.  
So very excited to be starting the basketball season. Very hopeful that we'll
have teams playing when the Final Four is configured, and very
enthusiastically engaged with our co‑hosts, the Cowboys and all of the many
people that are involved in their organization.  
So let me stop there and turn it over to Charlotte, then both of us can field
your questions.  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: Thank you, Bob. It's an honor to be up here on the stage
with you. We're certainly excited in north Texas to host the Final Four in
April. It seems like just yesterday in 2007 when we were putting our name in
the hat to be selected. It just kind of slams you in the face when you wake up
and go, oh, we're five months away from really playing basketball. We are so
excited about that. I know that the season for you all kicks off right here in
north Texas for us November 8, and then will also end in north Texas. That is
an exciting thing for us. It's been since 1986 when we held our first and last
Final Four, and we hope to set us on the road to host many more in the future.  
Our regional last year was very successful. It was a great dry run for us in
north Texas and AT&T Stadium to see how the game actually fit in our building.
Our region is so excited for everyone to come our way. Our hotels,
restaurants, and all the entertainment and events that are being scheduled,
the people are excited. They love basketball, they love college sports, and
they are ready to embrace this with everything that Southern hospitality is
all about.  
So I can't say enough about the Big 12. Obviously, Bob has an incredible staff
that works together to make this happen in Tim Allen, John Underwood, Rob
Carolla, all of those people that have come together to show us how to put on
a great college tournament, and we hope that you all will find it enjoyable as
well.  
So we look forward to the next few months in preparing, and we're ready to
play some basketball.  
  
Q. Why was it important and where would you put getting events all over the
Metroplex in order of importance for this event?  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: In terms of where they're actually placed?  
  
Q. Why was it important to get it spread out over Metroplex?  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: I think it's important for us, for north Texas, that we
are about bringing large events into that region. We obviously have incredible
capacity from a hotel standpoint to be able to accommodate the numbers of
people that we hope will show up. We think we're going to have a really big
crowd. We're expecting over 80,000 people in attendance. That is incredible.
That's great for us to be able to use the events for those who don't have a
ticket to the game and spread that out over the Metroplex to attend clinics,
basketball clinics as well as concerts and other events that will take place.  
So I think the Final Four, the NCAA has done a great job in selecting venues,
and we're excited to be able to host them.  
  
Q. You may have just answered my question. 80,000, is that going to be the
capacity for this? Because we know there have been crowds of 100,000 in that
structure.  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: We have the capacity to host over 80,000, and that's been
distributed already through the NCAA channels. We hope that we can open that
capacity beyond that for standing room. That is being under consideration by
the NCAA at this point. We know that we'll have a pretty packed venue, and we
hope that we can get as many people that want to come in the venue itself.  
  
Q. Can you share your thoughts since the Organizing Committee is in place
how much discussion there's been now that the NCAA has opened this up for
future Final Fours?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: We are, as a conference‑‑ and I respond not on behalf of
north Texas, but on behalf of the Big 12, we are very energetically engaged in
hosting championships. We have been for a long time. This is the tenth
basketball‑related championship that the Big 12 has hosted in our 17 years. So
we've been very energetically engaged. That includes, as Charlotte said, the
regional last year, which is a typical model when the Final Four is coming up.  
But we are also mindful that we can get ourselves spread a little bit too
thin. So we have worked with our members and our league and with the local
organizing committees and the various locales, north Texas, Oklahoma City, to
name a couple, where we've said we're going to try to keep ourselves to
hosting or being a co‑host on only one National Championship event a year. So
we're going to have to sequence a little bit from that standpoint. These
really are taxing on our staff.  
Charlotte mentioned Tim Allen and John Underwood and Rob Carolla. They'll be
spending an enormous amount of their time on this tournament as we go forward.
More of their time than I will be spending. But we're very committed to
hosting those events. I've been involved in the bid process for a very wide
variety in a whole bunch of different sports. I think as we go forward, we'll
continue to be called upon to be hosts and/or co‑hosts. So we're planning to
stay just as much involved as we have been in the past.  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: I think from our standpoint at AT&T Stadium, we'll host
you anytime you want to come. And, as Bob said, they actually do all the work.
So we're fortunate that I in an unbiased thought here is that the Big 12 hosts
this tournament better than anybody. We have all the confidence in the world
that when we sign up to partner with them, that we know it's going to be done
in the right way. So our job as a venue is to open the doors and let them do
all the work.  
But we have a great region that is very supportive, and north Texas is very
supportive. Our cities are, our mayors are, and the people of north Texas are
very supportive. So for us, we're clearly interested in being part of this
tournament for years to come, and we hope we get the opportunity to do so.  
  
Q. Looking back to last year's regionals, what were the takeaways and key
lessons that you had that will be applied to the Final Four?  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: From our standpoint, it truly was a great opportunity for
us to see the venue in action from AT&T Stadium standpoint. To be able to have
the seating configuration installed, to see how it works, to see how the flow
of traffic and people and everything actually evolves is very important. We
think that was very successful. We know we have the capacity as a venue to
host 80‑plus thousand people because we do it every Sunday when we bring
people in for the Cowboys game. So we know from a traffic standpoint, from
logistics, that we are prepared to do that. We think that our areas between
Dallas and Fort Worth and Arlington and everywhere in between, they are
prepared and ready to put this tournament on. I think being able to see it at
that level gives us all the opportunity to go back and make any tweaks or
adjustments.  
But from our standpoint, things were very successful from the regional point
of view. We think that was really kind of the case throughout the whole event.
So we don't see us being able to‑‑ having to tweak really much of anything,
just be ready to expand it.  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: I think the venue has a really remarkable thing that, at
that time it was Cowboy Stadium, now AT&T Stadium, was how good the set‑up
looked there. It really looked like it was built for that set‑up. The color of
the seats even matched. It was a wonderful place to watch a basketball
tournament.  
In all frankness, I'm not the guy to answer that question. Tim Allen is here
and can much better answer the tactical and logistical questions than I can.
Also, here is Joe Castiglione, who is the Director of Athletics at Oklahoma,
but also a member of the Men's Basketball Committee. I'm sure the committee
has had some discussions as to the elements that they might want to change.  
But I will say this: Charlotte has very modestly presented how AT&T Stadium is
going to host this. But, as you know, she comes from a long line of big
thinkers. I have no hesitation in suggesting that this will be the best Final
Four ever.  
  
Q. Charlotte, can you talk about ‑‑ I understand that a big art display is
there with the mirrors outside the stadium. Can you discuss how much the
esthetics are important for those who attend events at AT&T Stadium?   
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: I think we have prided ourselves upon building a venue
that is unique. For us, that means what can you offer to the patrons of your
event that is above and beyond what they might experience someplace else. And
for that, it's all about fan engagement at every level and every event that we
host. So not only do you want the experience of getting there, but once you're
there, the service and how people are treated, you want them to feel
important.  
But you also want to be able to offer something that is unique, and I think
we've been able to do that with the addition of the art collection that you
mentioned. It really gives a chance for people to think beyond the world of
sport. It also gives a chance for people to come to the venue that might not
be sports fans, to come see what we have to offer, but also be able to
appreciate the sport that they're attending as well. We think it's a great way
to cross‑connect different cultures, different beliefs, and bring them all
into one place and let them experience something that they wouldn't likely see
anyplace else.  
  
Q. Obviously Bob set the bar pretty high by saying it could be the best
Final Four ever. From your standpoint, in addition to the stadium, how do you
go about, I guess, working with the NCAA but at the same time putting your own
imprint on this Final Four so it's distinctly north Texas?  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: I think that is the key right there. We're trying to
differentiate us from other hosting cities, and what we are as a community. I
think that starts not only with the games themselves‑‑ obviously, we focused
on that to make sure that those are run at a top‑notch level and have an
experience that's unique‑‑ but we extend that out into the community as well
and want to reach as many people as we possibly can and engage them in the
community so they feel like they're part of the Final Four process.  
As you know, with the Final Four, there are great events that surf round that.
Between the concert series that goes on that's for free, between the Big
Dribble and Bracket Town, and to be able to take those events to another
level, if you will, to put our touch on it from a north Texas flair, and to be
able to do things that are a little bit more unique. From a concert series
standpoint, obviously the NCAA has done a great job in growing that. We expect
to see that grow right here in April as well.  
And beyond that on how we reach out to the community. I know we're partnering
now with the NCAA in a great program called SLANT that was originally
developed for Super Bowl. We really believed in creating a legacy that is,
once the game has left the community, what have they left behind? We prided
ourselves upon that during our Super Bowl that we hosted, and we've really
taken initiative in that direction to do so with the Final Four as well.  
As we all know, everyone can't fit in the building. So we want to make sure we
give everyone in the community a chance to be a part of it. So the NCAA sees
that value as well, how many people can they reach on any given weekend to
make more people aware of their sport and more about the good the sport
actually brings to the community.  
  
Q. You had mentioned earlier about the differences between being on the
Selection Committee and dealing now with an Organizing Committee. Can you be
more specific about those differences as you see it?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Yeah, I had to do a lot of work on the Selection
Committee. So far they've given me no real responsibilities, the local
organizing committee, except doing a few public appearances with Charlotte,
which is always a pleasure.  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: That's a pretty modest comment, I think.  
  
Q. Dallas did hold it in '86, but the last time this conference's
predecessor held it was in 1988 and two of its teams played for the National
Championship. If that doesn't happen this year, how disappointed will you
be?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Well, it's certainly a high standard to live up to. I do
think, though, that we have some teams that can play at that level, and time
will tell. It's a long time until March.  
I would not be at all surprised if we had somebody playing in that final two
or in the Final Four. It may be a little much to ask to have two of our teams
playing in the championship game. But I think that would be okay with all of
us.  
CHARLOTTE ANDERSON: I think we'd all like that.  
THE MODERATOR: You all did such a good job that you answered everything in the
first part. Thank you very much for joining us.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  70  
Kansas State  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Bruce Weber and student‑athletes Rodney
McGruder and Angel Rodriguez. Coach, opening comment.  
COACH WEBER: I couldn't be more proud of our kids, great group. They've really
had great chemistry. They've listened and got better. And it's just a shame
that we didn't shoot it a little better, take care of the ball a little
better, and make it a little better game.  
But Kansas was very good. They have good matchups with us. And you've got to
play your A game if you're going to have a chance. We just didn't play well
enough. So hats off to them.  
We've had a great year. Won a piece of the Big 12 Championship. Got to the
championship. We've done a lot of good things, but there's still more good
things to come. Hopefully that's what the kids‑‑ I told them to keep their
heads up and we got basketball left.  
But the next time you're sad it's all over, and I don't want that to come for
a while.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rodney, you looked as focused as I've ever seen you before a game
tonight. Could you tell me what was going on in that mind of yours entering
the game and as the game wore on?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: I just wanted this victory very badly. We worked so hard.
Worked so hard to get here. Just to let it slip. I just wanted to prepare
myself for the game. That's why I looked focused.  
  
Q. Rodney, what does Kansas do defensively that makes them so tough?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: It wasn't really their defense, it was our defense, more. We
gave them too many easy baskets at the rim. In the first half, we missed easy
baskets at the rim as well. So that hurt us.  
  
Q. Angel, a couple of scoring drives for your team. How frustrating was it
to chip away at that lead?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Very. I mean, looking at the percentages right now, the best
thing we did was shoot free throws, and we shot 50percent. So that says a lot.  
I thought we had open shots; a lot of times they just didn't go in. I guess we
gotta give them a lot of credit as well. And I guess it wasn't our night
offensively.  
  
Q. Angel, you're sitting next to a guy ‑‑ I believe he's the only player in
K‑State history to score 20points in back‑to‑back games in Big 12 tournament
games, and I just want to know after all this what does Rodney McGruder mean
to you guys?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: He means everything. He's our go‑to guy. He's the most
experienced guy we have on our team. He leads by example. He's always working
hard before, after, and in practice. It's somebody we look up to as players,
as teammates. And also he's a great person. He's a good brother.  
He's helped me a lot. I think this year we came a long way because last year
everybody was cool, but this year it's more like a brotherhood and not just a
team.  
So hopefully we make a run in this tournament, the NCAA, because he and the
seniors deserve it.  
  
Q. Rod and Angel both, you guys went a little over 10minutes in the first
half between field goals. How hard is it to try to keep in balance with what
you want to do offensively but at the same time you know ‑‑ maybe you start
push looking at maybe you need to be the one to go get a bucket?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: Gotta be patient. Can't force the game. Force the game,
that's when mistakes happen. And bad shots. And bad shots leads to transition
baskets for them.  
So just have to be smart and keep poised and just run your offense.  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I agree with Rod.  
  
Q. Rodney and Angel, did it seem like within the first five minutes of the
game that you all were winning the battle as far as being able to hustle to
the loose balls and win the rebounds? And, if so, when did you sense that to
start to change?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I thought the first half overall our defense was good. It was
a low‑scoring game because both teams are playing good defense. I thought
sometimes we took not bad shots, I'd say quick shots that kind of led them to
transition. That's what they're good at.  
But overall our defense the first five minutes in the whole half was pretty
good, and that was the whole focus. In the second half kind of let it slip. We
started scoring a little bit more in the second half, but then the defense
wasn't as good as the first half. And it was never a balance.  
  
Q. Rodney, three games now you guys have played against Kansas. What are
your thoughts on Travis Releford as a defender?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: He's a good defender. That's all.  
  
Q. I just want to know about your legs. How do you feel like the team's legs
were coming off of these games and entering this one as the game wore on?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: They might have been tired. But Kansas didn't care. So it
really doesn't matter.  
But I'm sure guys had sore legs and things like that, but you've gotta fight
on.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't want to get you in trouble, but can you talk about the
foul disparity and how that affected how you coached the game?  
COACH WEBER: I don't even want to comment on it, to be honest. We've gotta do
a better job of executing, screening. They've got good length. Like Angel
said, it was a low‑scoring game in the first half.  
But it seemed like when we broke down we gave them too easy layups and points
in the paint, just‑‑ they're so good at it. Just look at Ellis, Young and
Withey, that's the difference in the game.  
  
Q. How much did you want to be deliberate on the offense in the first half
and how much was it a product of KU's defense?  
COACH WEBER: We went into it with the same mindset as we always do. I think
the guys alluded to it, we took some quick shots. Some of it wasI think they
wanted to go make some plays, and you have to be patient, let things happen.  
We had some uncharacteristic turnovers because I think they were doing such a
good job defensively we got impatient. And when you go in the paint, you
can't‑‑ Angel, he thinks he can take on any giant, and sometimes you can't.
You gotta kick it out, make the next pass. And when he did, we just didn't
jump up.  
I can just run Ta (Irving) and a couple of guys with easy open looks. Right as
the last shot of the half, if that goes, it might make a big difference
mentally to our kids.  
But it just didn't go. And slowly but surely they kind of wore us down and
kept pounding it in the paint every time we made a run.  
  
Q. You guys made the 7 ‑0 run to take the lead in the first half, and then
right after that KU‑‑ I think it was 14‑2 or something like that in the middle
of your dry spell. At what point in that run did you realize it was turning
into a struggle more than just missing a couple of shots?  
COACH WEBER: We started out okay, then we made a little push. And then the key
was they got transition. They got some easy hoops in transition. And part of
it was not doing as well offensively as we needed to, turning it over.  
And then you can't defend layups and dunks. It's really hard in transition. So
we knew it would be hard to score. But I told them we gotta win 50 to 48. We
just can't break down defensively when you're not making shots. Gotta have a
good mindset through the whole game.  
  
Q. Bruce, you shared obviously the conference title with KU, terrific
accomplishment. But do you see beating them head to head is sort of a
significant next step for you and the program?  
COACH WEBER: There's no doubt. It's a big rivalry, but it's not a rivalry
until we make it a rivalry. And that means beat them somewhere. And they're
very good. They're a very old, experienced team. They know how to play.
They're winners.  
Hats off to them. Bill does a great job. And when you prepare your team and
when you go into a league, you think about the best team in the league and
they're the best team. And that's our goal and our job as coaches, to get to
the point where we can beat them.  
  
Q. Looking to next week, I mean, obviously you're going to be looking at
where you're going to have to play. At this point in the season where
technically every game is at a neutral site, does where you play matter as
much at all as who you play and how you play?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I think how you play obviously is huge. I think there's no
doubt there is an advantage if you're close to home. You're going to have more
fans and you're in a little bit of a comfort zone. If you played in the gym,
just mentally you've gotta feel good.  
But is that a guarantee you're going to win? I don't think that's a guarantee.
But we have done it both ways through my years. We took advantage of it. When
I was at SIU in Chicago, upset a couple of teams.  
We took advantage of it at Illinois and made the run to the national
championship on a bus and didn't have to get on a plane the whole way. You had
fans there all the time.  
And then I've had the other way at Purdue when I was an assistant. We were at
Indianapolis and lost a heartbreaker to Texas. And in Detroit it was close.
And lost to K‑State. Those are two games you always remember. And you had good
crowd support and you were close to home.  
So there's no guarantee. You've gotta play well. We gotta just‑‑ just look at
assists/turnovers, that's the key. And a credit to their defense, there's no
doubt.  
And that and we've gotta share the basketball. We've got to guard. If we do
those things, hopefully we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Question on Rodney and the urgency you've seen him play with, especially
in the last three games here and kind of putting the team on his shoulders,
and also anything that maybe he said to the team prior to coming out for this
one, the final time facing KU?  
COACH WEBER: If you've been around Rod, there's not much‑‑ he says family,
one, two, three, and he says 40minutes, one, two, three. As you said, he has a
game face. He's ready to play. He plays hard. The kid's a great example.
Couldn't have a better person.  
I still think either Rod or Withey or McLemore should have been Player of the
Year. Both of us won the title. And to me that's what determines who's the
Player of the Year. And that didn't happen. He gave it a go.  
He played as hard and as well as he could play here this weekend. It was
special. And I thought J.O. (Henriquez) gave a great effort, and we need all
those seniors to play well down the stretch.  
And, again, we're capable‑‑ I think we've shown we're capable of beating
anybody, but we have to play well. As he asked, you've gotta be playing well
at the right time and hope you get some good matchups and good bounces and
advance one day at a time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
Kansas  70  
Kansas State  54  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Bill Self and student‑athletes Jeff
Withey, Elijah Johnson, Travis Releford, and Kevin Young. Coach, we'll go to
you first.  
COACH SELF: I thought we played really well and efficiently all three days
over here. I think we guarded pretty well.  
We rebounded the ball well, and today was probably the poorest we played
offensively the first half, and then we look up and we're still up 8 because
we defended and rebounded.  
I'm really happy with our guys. Really proud of them. Different guys stepped
up each and every night. And we played a good team today. That's very
deserving of their ranking and everything.  
But I was really pleased at how aggressive we were and how efficient we were,
especially in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Does this ever get old?  
TRAVIS RELEFORD: What, winning? No, not at all. We enjoy it, we take pride in
it, and we work hard for it. So when moments like this come, we embrace it.  
  
Q. After you had widened out your lead to a double ‑digit lead in the second
half, I think with less than ten minutes left they were able to get within 9.
What kind of adjustments did you make to be able to protect the lead and not
give them a chance to get back in the ballgame?  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: Well, I think that we just played through it. A lot of our
mistakes, a lot of momentum changes that we had, they gave us another shot,
like every team should do. And I think that we just stayed into the game and
we just continued to play. So we got good results.  
JEFF WITHEY: In games like this, everybody's going to go on a run. They went
on a run and then we just countered with another run.  
We knew that we had to get stops, and we started getting more stops. Travis
did a great job on McGruder. And everybody played great defense.  
And like I said, everybody's going to go on a run. They went on theirs a
little earlier, and then we went on ours.  
  
Q. Travis, you're from this area, obviously. Doing this against K ‑State,
beating them for a third time this year, does that mean anything extra to you,
or is it just another team and would feel the same if it was Oklahoma State or
whoever?  
TRAVIS RELEFORD: I think how the season played out this year, I think it means
a lot to us and our fans. They have a lot of bragging rights now that this
game is over.  
But being from here, it was exciting for me and my family. My teammates know
how exciting it was for me. But we knew what we had to do.  
  
Q. Just curious for any of you that would like to tackle this, but how much
momentum does an impressive performance like this give you going ahead to next
week?  
KEVIN YOUNG: I think it gives us a lot of momentum because we're playing great
as a team right now, and we're starting to get a better feel with each other
and players are getting comfortable on the court.  
And it's just bringing us together even closer.  
  
Q. Travis, you're playing in front of your hometown crowd. It also seemed to
be a decidedly pro ‑KU crowd. What did you think of the fans today and how
much did you guys notice them?   
TRAVIS RELEFORD: I think they were great from the first game of the
tournament. They've been there, they supported us, and they know how much this
means to us and to them. So we just went out and played our heart out for them
and the guys right next to us.  
  
Q. Travis, when you get a matchup like Rodney McGruder and you're assigned
to him, it looked like you had him frustrated early on. He didn't start great,
he was 2 ‑for‑10 to start.   
TRAVIS RELEFORD: I think the key was help from my teammates, them being aware,
letting me know when screens were coming, because he ran off a lot of screens.
And I knew coming into this game I had to make him uncomfortable and be there
on the catch and not let him get easy looks, and I think that was a key in the
first half.  
  
Q. Kevin, you talked last night about tweaking your leg. How did it feel
today and did you feel like you were 100percent today?  
KEVIN YOUNG: I felt great today. It didn't really bother me at all. I got a
lot of treatment on it. So just going to continue to get treatment. It
probably won't bother me that much anymore.  
  
Q. Elijah, you guys shared the regular season championship and Travis talked
about how this carried a little bragging rights for you guys. In retrospect,
did it feel that way, that you had to have this one to prove something after
sharing the regular season title?  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: Well, I don't really feel like we had to prove something. I
felt it was more so for us. They tied out with us, the same record. So I felt
like this game had to be played.  
It's something that the fans wanted, for us to be in Kansas, both Kansas
teams. I think it was a matchup to play. So I think we fed into that, and I
think they did, too.  
So at the end of the day it was really a championship game. And I felt like
this game had to be played to be decided.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys won by a combined 59points against a pretty tough competition
here. What kind of platform does this give you maybe for a No.1 seed when the
committee goes and meets tomorrow in Indianapolis?  
COACH SELF: Well, I don't know if our body of work or resumé or whatever it is
that they look at‑‑ I think we're very deserving to be in the discussion. I
think we'll be one of the for sure five or six most highly ranked teams on the
seed line.  
So I'm not going to make a plea that we should definitely be a 1. We've been a
1 and lost in the second round. Been a 2 and played in the championship game.  
But it would be nice for our kids. You work so hard and everything's the road
to Final Four and No. 1 seeds get notoriety, especially with recruiting, so it
would be awesome to be a 1 seed, but I'm not going to beg or plea or anything
like that, because I know they wouldn't listen to me anyway. But I think our
resumé is pretty good.  
I could be wrong, but I think we have 13 or 14 wins against teams in the top
50 RPI. And I think that may be the most of anyone in the country.  
  
Q. Did Bruce's comments earlier in the week about the officiating in Ames
give you guys any extra motivation for today?  
COACH SELF: I don't know if it gave us an extra motivation. Our players
definitely knew about it. And the thing about it, I'll be honest, I don't pay
attention what people say in front of their fans or at a pep rally or whatever
to try to get them juiced up or whatnot, because I'm sure I've said some
things sometimes that people could probably look at and say, wow, was that
intended for us?  
But one thing about basketball, the calls add up pretty equal over the course
of an entire season. And I was really glad personally we got a chance to play
K‑State, because even though we tied‑‑ but we left little doubt leaving out of
here beating them three times that we were pretty good, and we stubbed our toe
a couple times we shouldn't have.  
But they had a great season. But I don't know if it was motivation for our
guys, but our guys certainly knew about it.  
  
Q. Bill, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the other day in the U.S.A. Today
article, looking to the national tournament, you talked about that you didn't
expect any major upsets this year. Why do you think the parity is such among
the potential 68 teams in the tournament that it's no big jaw dropper if a low
seed beats a high seed?  
COACH SELF: Well, the reason for saying that is that's been college basketball
all year. I mean, and it doesn't necessarily have to be‑‑ I mean, there's
never been a difference between a 5 and a 12 if you follow the tournament.  
There's at least one 12 or two 12s that win every year against a 5. So there's
not that much difference in like a seed line like that or 7 or 10 or 8 or 9.
There's not much difference in that at all.  
But the thing about it is when I'm looking at this, how many 4 seeds can beat
a 1? You know? All of them. Or a 5 seed. I mean, it's happened throughout the
course of the entire season. You've had 8 and 9 seeds or 10 or 11 seeds beat a
1 or 2 seed. It's happened in every league. I don't see why our tournament we
should expect a lot different.  
I think it will be great. I think it will be exciting. I think there's a
couple of teams out there that you look at on paper and say, wow, if they play
their best, they'd be hard to deal with. There's no question about that.  
But I don't know of anybody that's played their best for six games. It's hard
to do. And certainly when we won it in'08, we didn't play our best for six
games. The key to the tournament is going to be winning games when you don't
play your best. And that's going to be more difficult this year because
obviously the margin, the talent margin, has been reduced significantly
compared to years past, especially with the elite teams.  
  
Q. What does Travis Releford give you on the wing as a defender that makes
him so effective, and especially going up against a guy like Rodney McGruder
that they run off screens so much?  
COACH SELF: Rodney is terrific. He's a great player. He moves without the ball
better than anybody in our league, and he gets more screens for him than
anybody in our league because of the way that he plays, the motion. But he got
18, but a lot of them were points off of switches. Travis did an unbelievable
job on him, and I should have done a better job of maybe subbing Travis out
whenever Rodney subbed out just to give him a minute or two, and I didn't do a
good job of that at all.  
But I think when Travis is really tuned in, I think he's as good a perimeter
player as there is in the country. I do. I think he can guard a 1, 2, 3. A lot
of times a 4. And I think he can guard the ball. He can guard the drive. But
what he is, he's really smart and he understands angles. And he did a great
job playing angles today.  
  
Q. How important is it for your team when Perry plays the way he did the
past couple of games?  
COACH SELF: It changes our team. I mean, Kevin's not a natural scorer. But you
look at the production, like today. Hey, 21points, 15 rebounds from our 4 spot
in 41minutes. That's pretty good. That's better than Thomas Robinson‑type
numbers, and he was playing 35minutes.  
So collectively they're doing great. And of course Perry, the last four
games‑‑ I think he scored 55 points the last four games if I'm not mistaken.
So he's really coming into his own. He's going to be really good. But he just
looks like a different guy from a confidence standpoint right now.  
  
Q. Coach, before the game you said to a TV reporter you needed Kansas State
to be good. How good were they and how much better were you?  
COACH SELF: Well, we were better today. I mean, but when I say we need them to
be good, we don't need them to be good in the games that we play them. I
didn't mean that at all. I meant they need to be good because it brings
interest.  
You know, I've said this many times, even when Missouri was in our league, it
helped us when K‑State and Missouri were both good because what it did to us
was raise our level.  
And we want teams‑‑ we want our league to be great. We want our league to be
like the Big Ten was this year, because what it does, it raises everybody
else's level. And our league has been great since I've been in Kansas. We were
the top three in the RPI I think the last five years going into this year.  
So do I want Kansas to win it all or to win every game? No. But do I want them
to be good so it puts pressure on us to be better? Absolutely. I think that
type of pressure's good. And I do, I think it's good for our state schools to
be good. I want Wichita State to win without question. I just don't want them
to win at our expense.  
But I think that there's enough games to go around. That's not an unrealistic
view, because the more interest there is in this city, the more excitement
there is and that kind of stuff, and the better this tournament is, and the
tournament was off the charts.  
  
Q. That drought Kansas State had at the end of the first half, only had a
field goal for ten minutes or so, how good was your defense during that
stretch?  
COACH SELF: As good as it's been. It helped when Southwell got his second foul
because he's a 4 man that can stretch it. Kind of play it different and maybe
help more off of the cuts and stuff.  
I thought our defense, first shot defense, was about as good as it's been all
year long during that stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Rodney McGruder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22021)

### [Angel Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23548)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  68  
Oklahoma State  57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas State Bruce Weber, student‑athletes
Rodney McGruder and Angel Rodriguez. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH WEBER: Just really proud of the guys. This is a very, very good team,
Oklahoma State, that we faced. We didn't play the best defense at their place.
We scored 70points, and that was more than we scored at home, and they still
won the game. So it was a defensive mindset.  
We did a great job obviously getting Nash a couple of fouls, get some people
with some fouls the first half helps, but you think they're going to come back
with good energy the second half. We had the good run to start the second
half, and just able to keep it up, 10, 12, 14, and just played good solid
basketball.  
And now you get a chance‑‑ we're conference co‑champs, and now you get a
chance to play the team that tied you in a big game for the tournament.  
And I couldn't be more proud of Jordan. Struggled a little bit the last couple
of weeks. They tried a little different procedure today, obviously it worked
and he had great energy. And each day it seems like it's a different guy.
Obviously Angel and Rod are our consistent guys. But when you have guys like
D.J. and Jordan and different people along the way that step up, it definitely
makes a difference and gives you a chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Can you just tell me a little bit about what it means to you to be back
in this championship game, have another chance at Kansas?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: It feels good. But we have a game tomorrow. So just gotta get
prepared for Kansas.  
  
Q. This is for Rodney and for Angel. Coach talked about the run to start the
second half. What do you feel like were the keys to that run that allowed you
to secure the momentum?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: We got on transition. We made‑‑ we forced them to take some
bad shots. That allowed us to push the ball a little bit on the break, and we
got baskets. And then Coach called a timeout.  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: We saw they were tired by the end of the first half. So the
beauty of our team is we're deep and a lot of people can play for us and help
us, and that's what we did. We rotated our line and we got out in transition.
And pretty much every time we went into transition, something positive
happened. So that was the biggest key.  
  
Q. Rod, just on that run again, the beginning of the second half, the shots
you were making, was it just the time for you to maybe take over the game a
little bit?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: I just took the open shots and took the lanes that they gave
me, and I was fortunate enough to make those shots.  
  
Q. Rodney, I was wondering if you could talk about when you go deep into a
tournament, typically you need to have a great point guard, and you got one
sitting next to you. Can you talk about what Angel means to this team as he
progressed through the season?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: He means a lot. The way he pressures the opponent's point
guard and his craftiness with the ball, him finding open guys and him being
able to step up and knock down big shots, you know, you couldn't ask more from
him. He's done a tremendous job.  
  
Q. In your game, you move a lot without the basketball. There was about a
three ‑minute span in that second half where I thought maybe you were standing
a little bit. Did you get tired tonight?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: No, I didn't. I just seen the way they were face‑guarding me.
So I just wanted to wait and just set up my cuts, use screens better than I
was using at first, because first I wasn't waiting on screens and it didn't
allow me to get open.  
  
Q. Did Oklahoma State seem a little tired? They had a real tough game late
yesterday. Did they seem tired to you?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: At some point, yeah. That's actually when we made the run the
first half. Like I said, we got a lot of players that can come in the game and
help us play with a lot of energy and make plays with us. We've always gotta
take advantage of that. We do a great job pressuring the ball and getting at
that. At some point they're going to get tired and break down. If we get
tired, somebody's going to come in do the same thing, do the same job.  
  
Q. Angel, I know it gets repetitive, but you're on pace to do some pretty
incredible things as a sophomore at Kansas State. Can you just talk about
maybe the maturity that you've been able to get over the course of the season
and then also talk about your energy level heading down the stretch here in
March, and you guys play tomorrow at 5:00?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I gotta give a lot of credit to the coaches and the players.
At first I didn't‑‑ I wasn't playing that good. I was doing a solid job. But
the coaches have tremendous trust in me. They believe in me and my teammates
as well. It was just a matter of me having‑‑ it was just matter of me having a
good game that could bring my confidence back.  
Once I had that good game, I don't remember when it was, I just‑‑ I kept
playing well. And sometimes it's not going to be the best night. Like I played
at Oklahoma State, it wasn't my best game. But I'm always going to fight and
I'm always going to do whatever I can do to help the team get a win.  
  
Q. Angel, I'll let you answer this in front of Coach Weber. You guys do a
really good job of passing forward without actually dribbling against the
press like Oklahoma State was doing that 1 ‑3‑1 three‑quarter court. Is there
a drill you do in practice to move the ball forward without actually dribbling
it?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Yes. Right when practice starts, we do a 5‑on‑0 drill,
which is pretty much advance the ball and get some layups. And also when we
play 5‑on‑5 at the beginning of practice, me and Martavious and the point
guards used to get yelled at a lot for dribbling and somebody being open.  
So we've gotta give credit once again to Coach. Everything he does is for a
reason. And when we do what he says, positive things happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How much do you think fatigue played a part in Oklahoma State's ‑‑ how
they played in the second half? And did that boost your fastbreak, the fact
that they might have been a little bit tired?  
COACH WEBER: I don't think there's any doubt‑‑ we watched‑‑ at least the
coaches watched in person last night the second half and really thought they
were getting a little tired even in that Baylor game.  
And then it's a hard turnaround. Now we're going to have a hard turnaround at
5:00. Obviously a couple of hours for Kansas probably helps them. And it's
going to be a key with our depth. It will be important. But they were tired. I
think our guys noticed it. They kept coming in the huddles, and I think when
those guys were out the first half, they came back in, they forced a few
things. Get some transition. And he kept pulling Smart in and out. That means
he must have been having a little bit weary legs.  
So I think there's no doubt it was a factor. We weren't much earlier
yesterday, to be honest. So you hope it's your conditioning, rotation of guys
and the way we play every day, the way we practice.  
  
Q. Obviously Angel's had a great season. You've had some great players
through the year yourself. How closely ‑‑ being a sophomore, Second Team
All‑Big 12, how closely is he to paralleling some of those great players that
you've had with visibility?  
COACH WEBER: He's made a lot of strides. And I think it's just ‑‑ one thing,
he likes the game, he studies the game, he watches film, watches games. Not
all our guys do that. And he comes in and watches film, a lot of times with
Coach Frazier. Sometimes he's a little emotional, and during the game. And
then I think the thing he's learned, that, like he said, usually we're saying
something for a reason, we see something.  
And even tonight he got a bad call. Calm down, keep your poise, make the next
play. And so he's made a lot of strides. Obviously he's had a great season. I
think big strides, assists, turnovers, just being smart. And I hope he could
make another big jump‑‑ a guy like Deron Williams was really good as a
sophomore and then took another big jump, because now he knows what it's
about, especially being in our system, what we can do.  
And he's played all year, really, not healthy. There's days we can't even
practice him. So Jordan's done that. Will's done it. And now Angel. Those guys
have some toughness.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fact that Jordan had a little different procedure
going. Without being too technical, what exactly was done for him?  
COACH WEBER: Just trying to get the muscles to relax. We've done massage.
We've done muscle relaxers, a lot of different things. And today they took a
little bit of a chance on something different. And obviously it helped,
because he was much more mobile.  
Last couple of games he hasn't been able to move at all. It was gutsy. Eight
points, 11 rebounds. Three blocks. That's the difference maker. And the thing
we brought up‑‑ the first time we played him at home he probably had three or
four blocks, if I remember right, and when we played there he wasn't involved.
So when they did drive, he was a factor. And that makes a difference, because
they had free rein on us last week at their place.  
  
Q. Was this your best defensive game of the year? And would you talk about
the need to keep them ‑‑ keep Oklahoma State out of transition and from not
playing up above the rim like they did last week?  
COACH WEBER: You know, that's huge. And really we did a decent job last week
except for a couple of periods the first half, had a little run, second half
they had the run when we got the nine‑point lead, but you gotta keep Smart in
front of you, keep Nash in front of you. It's really hard to do. They're both
talented. And Markel Brown and Forte played off of them. We did a better job
helping.  
After last week, TCU and Oklahoma State, that's all we talked about, that's
all we worked on in practice: We gotta jump to the ball. We gotta be in help
position, just basic shell, drills we do every day. And then we talked about I
thought we did a great job of‑‑ we call it frenzy. If somebody helps, you go
help them. You play in a frenzy. Keep making the next play. I thought we did a
great job of that, and with that kept them from getting in the paint, which we
didn't do last week.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

### [Elijah Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22852)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  88  
Iowa State  73

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with Kansas, Coach Bill Self, Perry Ellis, and
Elijah Johnson. Coach your thoughts on the victory tonight.  
COACH SELF: I thought it was a very emotional game, both teams, especially
Iowa State, they came out of the chute fast, and our guys knew it would be an
emotion‑filled game. After about the 12‑minute mark I thought we did a good
job playing with energy and matching their emotion, and we played pretty good
defensively and rebounding the ball well, and of course we had one individual,
you know, Perry just was off the charts good.  
So they're good. They're talented and they stretch it, and hard to guard. And
I thought we did a pretty nice job.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. This is for Perry and for Elijah. Coach talked about energy. Do you think
that was maybe the deciding factor in terms of being able to take care of this
in 40minutes as opposed to having to gut out another overtime win?  
PERRY ELLIS: Definitely. We know that energy pushes our team, and we found
that out over the last couple of games and the games before that, that energy
really pushes us.  
So I feel it really does.  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: I agree with Perry. I think our energy definitely carried us
throughout the game. When other people relax, we try to feed off ourselves
instead of the crowd. And we just keep our head into the game. Give as much
energy as we can at all times.  
  
Q. Talk about how key that 3 that Releford made just before the half was.
Was that momentum going into the locker room at halftime?  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: That was big momentum. Coach has made me a big believer in the
way you go into the locker room definitely affects the way you go out of the
locker room. With Travis making that 3, he missed a couple of them early, but
he wasn't scared to shoot it, and I felt like it was set up for that one to go
in. It was a big momentum boost to go into the locker room with energy pumped
up and just come out and feed off of that.  
PERRY ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. We always want to try to go into the locker
room with momentum, and we came out and we pushed through. So it was great
momentum for us.  
  
Q. Perry, did you hear the chants out there? And you were a top 5 trending
topic on Twitter today. It was just such a huge night. How do you kind of sum
this thing up? Everybody in the world was saying your name.  
PERRY ELLIS: It was great. Kevin got hurt, so I just try to come in and attack
and help my team. That's all I was trying to do, was trying to win.  
  
Q. Perry, looked like Coach Self had some special inspiration for you during
that first timeout. Did that kind of inspire you to go out and do what you're
able to do the rest of the game?  
PERRY ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. I mean, it gave me a lot of confidence, and I
just tried to keep going, keep pushing.  
  
Q. Perry, you talked about Kevin getting hurt. Was this more of a matter of
just more opportunities were there for you in this game? I assume we can call
this the best game you played at KU, right? Was this more opportunities were
there, or was this more you were being more aggressive than maybe you've been
in the past?  
PERRY ELLIS: I would say‑‑ I mean, every time I'm subbing in for him I'm
trying to be aggressive, just coming in, playing my best. It was just my turn
to go play. So I just tried to play my best.  
  
Q. Elijah, a lot was made regarding the last game, the last time you guys
saw Iowa State, the revenge, the grudge factor. Did you guys feel any of that
leading up to tonight?  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: I mean, of course you feel the tension. But we know that we're
a big target regardless of who we play every night. And that's the type of
program that we're playing for. That's what's on our chest. So we expect that
from everybody, not just Iowa State. We expect that last game, the next game,
and today's game. So it's nothing too unusual for us.  
I just feel like it got to the media, it kind of became a big deal since we're
in the same building for the next couple of days.  
  
Q. Have you seen Coach Self ever that angry during a game situation when he
picked up the tech tonight?  
PERRY ELLIS: I mean, it was probably‑‑ I haven't, actually. That was probably
the angriest I've seen him.  
ELIJAH JOHNSON: I go to practice with him every day, so...no, I feel like
Coach did that to get us fired up. I felt like there was a reason to it. He
didn't do it for no reason. It worked.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. So was it on purpose, Bill, that you went after that technical?  
COACH SELF: I could have got one 10minutes earlier; would have saved me a lot
of embarrassment. I didn't agree with the technical call on Ben at all and
certainly didn't agree with the explanation. But John called it, and I should
live with it probably more than what I did.  
But the thing that‑‑ I acted like an idiot, I know. But the thing that I think
is so great about our game is you talk about our two games that everybody's
made a big deal with Iowa State, Iowa State's good. And we were fortunate to
win both games. And the whole deal is this is the third time and they'll be as
classic and as much energy, and we want to play Kansas so bad. It was
important that our guys played with unbelievable emotion in order to match
their emotion. So if the players are going to play with emotion, the coach
might as well have some emotion, too.  
So I was wrong to act like that and to get a technical and all that. And I
haven't seen it, so it may end up being a good call so I've got no reason to
gripe. Certainly at that moment, when it takes your best player out of the
game and gets him his second foul with 10 minutes or 12minutes left in the
half, that was a pretty big play.  
So I disagreed, and, yeah, they could have popped me a lot earlier, then I
wouldn't have had to act that way for so long, probably. But probably wasn't
much strategy involved, though.  
  
Q. What specifically didn't you agree with with the technical? And what kind
of things have you tried to get going with Perry throughout the season, just
to get him going?  
PERRY ELLIS: With my technical? Oh, I deserved that. They could have given me
one earlier. They told me they were going to give me one. And I'm not a real
good listener.  
But with Perry, our whole deal with him is to be aggressive, be aggressive.
He's one of those kids that as soon as you say run, he'll run faster. As soon
as you say jump, he'll jump higher. One of those things.  
So he's a quick‑twitch kid. But you want him to be more aggressive all the
time. And tonight they played behind him on the post and he was able to get
catches. And that's what he can do. I mean, he played great.  
But the plays he made are plays that I think he can consistently make if he
just stays aggressive and stays confident.  
  
Q. Coach, seems like every time you graduate somebody or somebody leaves
early for the pros you've got somebody else to step in. Is Perry Ellis the
next star?  
COACH SELF: He could be. We've had a pretty good recruiting class too.
Hopefully we're not done. Perry is going to score a lot of points at Kansas.
The thing about it isI hope he's a star. But a star‑‑ I thought Brady
Morningstar was a star and I thought Tyrel Reed was a star and I think Travis
Releford is a star.  
These guys have become really good basketball players without being the guys
that everybody talks about, to give us the best chance to win. But Perry's a
guy that can put up numbers, and not everybody has that capability. I think he
has a chance to be a tremendous player.  
  
Q. You were chucking that 3 ball in the first half, about 15 of them. I
think you had four in the second half. You pulled it back?  
COACH SELF: Well, two guys combined for 11 3s in the first half, and that's
fine, but not when you go 2‑for‑11\. And we shot‑‑ have been shooting seven 3s
a half. That's a good thing. Elijah and Travis were pulling. They weren't bad
shots, but they just didn't give us a chance to expose what we wanted to
expose, was getting the ball inside.  
And so the second half, you know, you stop and think about it. Our big guys,
our four big guys got 28shots, I believe was the total number or something
like that. I mean, 30shots. That's an unbelievably high number for us. But we
were so much better playing through our bigs in the second half.  
  
Q. With the way you were winning, so many moments under the basket in the
second half, did you intentionally try to be more physical with them this game
in the third matchup in any way, just in terms of the way they are smaller and
away from the hoop?  
COACH SELF: We did want to throw the ball inside more than we did in the other
matchups. But to be more physical, that's always something we need to do. But
to me, I got great respect for their players, and Fred does a terrific job.  
But watching that OU game yesterday, Iowa State didn't make shots but they win
the game because I think it's 44 to 31 on the glass and then they get hot
late. And I always think that's such an important deal with our team to
somehow steal some extra possessions, and you usually do that by being the
more aggressive or more physical team.  
I thought we were really aggressive going after the ball there in the first
half, especially. And then second half I just thought we just threw the ball
inside more.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

KANSAS  88  
IOWA STATE - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Iowa State and Coach Fred Hoiberg,
student‑athletes Melvin Ejim and Georges Niang. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game.  
COACH HOIBERG: I thought we came out with great energy getting an 8‑point lead
early. And I thought we got a little stagnant with the ball. You can't do that
against Kansas. They're too long to make those stops inside.  
You gotta try to get some pace in it and move the ball to the second side of
the floor. We didn't do a good enough job with that.  
We put ourselves in a position to be playing very meaningful games at this
time. Our backs were against the wall last week. We felt we needed to get
three more wins.  
And I give our guys a lot of credit for responding and going and get a big win
against Oklahoma State, get a great win on the road against West Virginia, and
then a huge win yesterday against Oklahoma.  
So I'm proud of our guys for the finish we had. It's unfortunate we didn't win
or get a chance to play for the championship right now. But overall the last
week and a half I'm happy where we are. And we'll regroup, get back after
Selection Sunday and put a game plan together for our opponent on Monday.  
But we're excited to be moving on and playing meaningful games at this time of
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Georges, Perry Ellis had the game of his life tonight. What was he doing
that was such a difference maker tonight?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think he did a great job of finishing dump‑downs. I think
sometimes we got caught out of position, and I think he had two open drop‑down
dunks. And he built off that. He hit a couple of jump shots.  
The kid played a good game, and we weren't expecting that, and sometimes you
just gotta take that and regroup and move on.  
  
Q. Melvin and Georges, can you talk a little bit about how physical Kansas
seemed in the second half? There were stretches where they seemed to win
everything in the shadow of the basket. How tough was it this matchup to deal
with them in the paint?  
MELVIN EJIM: They're a big, strong team. They're able to use their size to
their advantage to that. And they were able to get to the loose balls, loose
rebounds, and that was a big part of why we lost. They outrebounded us on the
glass, and they really got a lot of those 50/50 balls. We just weren't able to
get those stops. We needed to get those rebounds and get those loose balls.  
GEORGES NIANG: They did a great job of getting it in the post and drawing some
fouls early. And in the second half, they were making some tough shots in the
lane and we couldn't seem to stop them at some point.  
  
Q. Melvin, talk about the emotion your team had coming in tonight's contest
against KU.  
MELVIN EJIM: Coming off an emotional win from yesterday and then this game
where Kansas had beat us twice and we really wanted to win this game, we came
out really good. Our emotion level was high, and we were riding that a little
bit. Then it kind of died off and the game took over and we weren't able to
get those critical stops we needed.  
But I think everyone was excited for this game, and we came out and we gave
them the first punch. We did well.  
But towards the end of the game in the second half we just weren't able to do
those key things that a team needs to do to win a game like this.  
  
Q. How much did the game change when Self picked up that technical foul?
Seemed like they put it up another couple of notches after that. How did the
game change after he got the technical foul?  
GEORGES NIANG: Being out there, I don't know if I really noticed it that Bill
Self got the technical, that that changed anything. They just started scoring,
making shots. We tried to go down there too fast and make some tough plays,
and they got a couple of turnovers. And turnovers hurt us, and they got some
offensive rebounds that also hurt us.  
MELVIN EJIM: I don't think that his technical really affected anything.
Towards the end of the game his technical, it wasn't a game changer. Might
have motivated his team to play a little bit better, but for us on the court,
we were just playing a game. And like Georges said, they were able to go out
there and make plays, and they were getting stops. We weren't hitting a lot of
shots, and they were able to take advantage of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Fred, looked like there was a moment in the huddle where maybe you tossed
a chair a little bit. Were you trying to light a little bit of a fire during a
timeout there, is that what happened? And, if so, is that what you were trying
to do?  
COACH HOIBERG: I don't know that I tossed it. I just picked it up and put it
back down.  
Yeah, I was. I was trying to get us going a little bit. And they outrebounded
us by 10. And we really felt we had to win the rebound battle if we were going
to have a chance to win this game. It's what kept us in it the first couple
times. We had low turnovers and we got quality possessions really each and
every time down the floor the first time we played Kansas. We had 14 turnovers
and only ten assists. And that shows when we have low assist numbers we just
don't have that thing moving around and flying around the perimeter like we
normally do. The last one we had like this was Oklahoma. I think we had nine
turnovers. I'm sorry, nine assists. And then after that we were up around 20.  
And that's when we're at our best, is when we get that thing really moving.
And just too many turnovers and not a good enough job on the glass.  
  
Q. Tonight Perry Ellis had a big game, Elijah Johnson the last time. When
you guys kind of game plan coming into today, what were the things you were
focusing on and how did you feel overall you ended up doing looking back on
the game now?  
COACH HOIBERG: The game plan was stuff we talked about all the time with our
keys, is to take care of the basketball and control the glass. We talked about
that every game as being the keys to us achieving the win. And we didn't do a
good job of that. Again, 14 turnovers, only ten assists, get outrebounded by
10, and that's not good enough against a great team like Kansas.  
  
Q. How much do you think these last two games will help your team moving on
to what should be an NCAA Tournament berth?  
COACH HOIBERG: I think the Oklahoma game, the fact that we found a way to
respond and battle through adversity and get a tough win when I thought we had
to have it. It showed a lot of heart and character out of our team. I was
proud of our guys to get that one.  
Today we got off to a great start and hit a wall and had a tough time,
especially in the second half. They scored 15 out of 18 possessions, and again
they shoot 69percent in the second half. You just can't allow that and still
have a chance to beat a great team like this.  
I think we hit 8 out of 9 at one point, but we just couldn't find a way to get
enough stops to get over the hump.  
  
Q. When it comes to rebounding, was it their size or positioning or effort?
What gave them the advantage?  
COACH HOIBERG: I thought size. I thought they got the loose balls tonight. And
that's disappointing. We got them all in the second half against Oklahoma. To
outrebound that team by 13 in the second half showed how hard we were playing.
They just‑‑ the ball would bounce off us and they'd get it, go right up,
layup, or 3‑point play.  
You've got to have good, physical, strong cutouts against a team with that
type of length, because if you just try to jump with them, they'll go over
your back and get it and get second‑chance opportunities.  
I'll have to go back and look at the tape on it. Obviously you learn more when
you watch it the second time. But they just seem to get the 50/50 balls.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Perry Ellis's game tonight?  
COACH HOIBERG: He was great. I think Young got hurt a little bit, and Perry
Ellis stepped in there and obviously gave us a lot of trouble. Got deep
position on us, and, again, just got too good a position. We helped up on
Withey a couple of times from areas on the floor we weren't supposed to, and
dropped it in to him for a dunk.  
He got his confidence going. Hit a couple of jump shots. We were going to live
with those, with him and Traylor and Young shooting them, but that got him
going, got his confidence up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  68  
Oklahoma State  57

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with Oklahoma State Coach Travis Ford and
student‑athletes Le'Bryan Nash, Markel Brown, and Marcus Smart. Coach?  
COACH FORD: Congratulations to Kansas State. From the time the ball was thrown
up, they brought their hard hats. We didn't come out of the gates the way we
were wanting. I thought for about the first five minutes we didn't play the
way we wanted.  
Then the next 35minutes I thought we really competed. Didn't play great, but I
thought we played hard. That was evident by 17 offensive rebounds. And really
played hard. We just never got rhythm, never got rhythm at all offensively,
and a lot of that had to do with we were fighting adversity a lot throughout
the night, with foul trouble, obviously at halftime Le'Bryan hadn't scored,
Markel hadn't scored, Michael Cobbins hadn't scored. Two of them were in foul
trouble, and Michael had a little bit of an injury. And we were just out of
rhythm, couldn't get any offensive flow. That offense kind of hurt our defense
a little bit.  
I thought our half‑court defense was really good. It's just they kept scoring
in transition and rebounding the ball early. They really, really were hurting
us offensive rebounding‑wise after us playing really good defense.  
And that's draining, very draining, because we were really getting after it
defensively. And that was keeping us in there.  
But give Kansas State credit. They had a nice night. Wasn't our night. They
had a lot to do with it. And we move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What did the foul trouble do with you in your rhythm in the first half?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: It felt really bad, because now I can't help my team contribute
because I got stupid fouls. And it really got me out of sync. But I stayed
true to my team. That wasn't the trouble that we lost because we still were
down by 5. So still credit my teammates for keeping us in the game because it
could have got ugly.  
MARKEL BROWN: Did a lot for us. You're looking at three of the top leading
scorers on the team right now, and two of them were on the bench.  
We left Marcus hanging out there. That's something we can't do. We gotta be on
the court to keep our offense going, offense and defense. We just gotta shake
back from that one and move on to the next game.  
  
Q. How much of a factor, if any, was fatigue tonight, especially the second
half?  
MARCUS SMART: I don't think it was much of a factor. We still came out and we
played hard. It wasn't much fatigue, it was just going out there and trying to
stop, getting stops. And we weren't doing that on the defensive end. And
that's what was hurting our momentum, trying to come back on the offensive end
and turning the ball over and things like that.  
I doubt fatigue was much of a factor.  
MARKEL BROWN: I don't think it was a factor either. Kansas State is a great
team. They came out and they played really well. And like Coach said, we
didn't get in the rhythm offensively, and it slowed us down a little bit. It
might look like we were tired, but we played hard out there.  
LE'BRYAN NASH: Fatigue wasn't a problem with us, we just didn't make shots.
And that's not Oklahoma State basketball. We stopped them a lot on defense,
and we just couldn't come up with the rebound. That's just us.  
  
Q. Why was Kansas State's running game and their fastbreak so effective
tonight?  
MARKEL BROWN: Turnovers. We had a lot of turnovers. We had a lot of careless
turnovers and we took bad shots, and that led to Kansas State's transition.
That's something that we gotta go back and watch film on and correct going
into this next postseason.  
MARCUS SMART: Definitely what Markel said, exactly, bad shots and turnovers.
With a team like Kansas State who thrives off of that, you can't give them
that because that's what they thrive off of. And their momentum gets going and
we just gave them what they want and fed right into their hand. And like
Markel said, it's something we can go back and fix and watch film of.  
  
Q. Marcus, you guys, Coach Ford talked about the lethargic start. He called
timeout pretty early and really upset. Why do you think you had the lethargic
start even before Le'Bryan and Markel went to the bench with fouls? The
offense wasn't in any kind of rhythm. Why do you think you had the rough
start?  
MARCUS SMART: Like you said, we just weren't in rhythm to start the game and
it just carried over as the game went on. And we just couldn't find the
rhythm, and it just hurt us. So we just came out and we were searching for it,
but it just wasn't there for us. And with Le'Bryan and Markel getting into
foul trouble, it didn't help it any, it just made it worse for us.  
  
Q. Markel, question about Angel Rodriguez. You've gone against him three
times now in the last three months. He's done different things to you guys.
Can you talk about his game, what you've seen in him over the course of the
season?  
MARKEL BROWN: Angel is one of the better point guards in this league. He's a
defensive pest. He plays really good defense. And he controls his team. He's a
great point guard. He does a lot for his team. McGruder gets all the credit,
but no one really focuses on what Angel does for his team. He can shoot the 3
really well and he also creates for others.  
  
Q. Markel, does an offensive game like this worry you at all going into the
NCAA Tournament? In the NCAA you can't afford an offensive game like this. Is
this something you can put past you pretty easy, or is it a cause for alarm?  
MARKEL BROWN: Just learn from it, I guess. We can learn from it. Go back,
correct the things that we did wrong. We got time to practice. We got time to
put in new offense and work on other things. Just learn from it and correct
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. With about 15minutes left, Bruce goes into a ‑‑ it almost looked like a
stall with about 15minutes left there, running the clock down to inside two,
three seconds on every possession. And there's still 15minutes left in the
game. He described you guys as obviously visibly being tired probably from
last night's game. The players, Angel Rodriguez said we could tell they were
tired. Is that tough right there to combat when you look out on the floor and
you guys are shooting 28percent at the time and you know it's not working, you
know there's fouls, there's no rhythm?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, it's a bad feeling as a coach when you've got no offensive
rhythm. We could feel it. We were trying everything. But we had guys out
there‑‑ we were just fighting adversity foul trouble‑wise, but we just
couldn't get anything to work.  
It's amazing we hung in the game. It felt like the Iowa State game. At Iowa
State we played horribly bad, found ourselves down 2 with three minutes to go
somehow. Somehow we cut it back to 6 in the second half and they come down and
make a 3.  
It's just one of those nights. You go through‑‑ there was a lot of teams that
got beat today. Duke‑‑ it happens. They played well. I told our teamKansas
State won. Kansas State played better than we did. That happens.  
Now, there's a lot of things we could go back and we wish we could do better.
I felt we were‑‑ I wouldn't say that we were‑‑ because we got 17 offensive
rebounds. We got 17 offensive rebounds. We were fighting out there. I thought
we were. We may have been a step slow fighting and moving, but I thought our
guys were trying to make things happen.  
It was just‑‑ a prime example, Kansas State, one of the most physical teams in
our league and we don't get in the bonus in the first half. I don't know if
that's happened to them all year long. Don't get the bonus first half.  
That was difficult. It shows where our offense was at. We just never got in a
rhythm, but we kept fighting. I felt like we were fighting. I wouldn't say we
were tired. Maybe we were. But I thought we were fighting, we just couldn't
get anything to go our way for very long. If that makes sense. I don't know.  
I felt like we were out there fighting. I was very positive for every timeout
except maybe one or two because I thought we were here, you're fighting‑‑
couple times we got to the offensive glass and just smashed. And, I mean, I
told our team‑‑ and I'm thinking, oh, yeah, you're going to lay it in, and
then it just gets slapped out.  
It was one of those nights. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. But one of
those crazy deals. But Kansas State is a good basketball team. I told our team
there's a reason; they're good.  
  
Q. Going back to what you were saying about moving on, Coach. There was an
article in U.S.A. Today today that was saying that there isn't a clear
favorite this season the way Kentucky was last season or North Carolina was
four years ago. And I can see by the way that you're nodding your head you
agree with that.  
MARKEL BROWN: Yes, we say this a lot. But I think everybody can genuinely say
it this year. This year's like no other year. And for I don't know how long.
There's not a clear‑cut team that you would say like Kentucky. I agree with
you 100percent like last year, everybody knew who they were shooting for.
Everybody knew who‑‑ you hoped Kentucky plays bad.  
But anybody's got a shot. Anybody. There's a lot of mid majors, low majors,
StephenF. Aus‑ ‑‑ you go through, there are really good basketball teams. You
got a lot of good basketball teams out there.  
So I'm not as concerned about seeding and all that. I don't think it's going
to matter. I really don't. You're going to play good basketball teams. If
you're in the NCAA Tournament this year, you're a good basketball team. You've
earned‑‑ there's teams fighting. It just seems you've earned to get there. And
everybody's going to be good once they get there.  
So I just know we better play better than we did tonight, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Obviously Rodney gets all the attention being K ‑State's best player, but
he averaged 25 a game against you guys in all three games. Can you talk about
what he gets in the matchup against Oklahoma State that he takes as such an
advantage?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, he's had some success. Tonight we gave him some in
transition in the second half, which is‑‑ it's easy to score in transition.
But he earned some of them tonight. He made some really tough shots. Yeah,
he's a great player. Obviously he's going to get his touches within their
offense.  
Again, we were a step slow. We were just a step slow, couple times. And we
were doing things out of character. Did some things out of character. Played
hard. Guys were playing hard. Just kind of running into each other a little
bit.  
But he's a good player. I love his pace. I love his attitude. He obviously
means a lot to that basketball team. He means a lot to that team.  
  
Q. I wonder, the last two games you played two pretty draining kind of
games, gritty types. Is this something that you feel like your team can learn
from, or is it maybe even a case of concern going into the tournament because
of the way ‑‑ especially the way tonight played out?  
COACH FORD: I'm not concerned, no. We've won a lot of games right now and
we've won them in different ways this year. We played as well of a half
yesterday in the first half as you can play. Baylor came out and played like
they did against Kansas. They're a good basketball team.  
There's things we‑‑ I went and watched the film last night. I got back,
watched our game against Baylor and Kansas State. There were some things we
would have liked to have done better in the second half against Baylor, but
they kept fouling us and putting us to the free‑throw line for one thing, and
then it became that type game, and then we‑‑ I don't know if anybody's going
to stop Pierre Jackson when that game was being played the way they were
playing it last night. We kept‑‑ he just kept running into us for fouls. And
there's several times‑‑ I don't know what else we could have done.  
So I wasn't concerned about that game after watching it. I wasn't concerned
about the Baylor game. I thought, man, if can we bottle up that first half,
which we've won some games‑‑ and tonight, you know, it doesn't determine
what's going to happen in our next game. But I didn't see a group of guys
quitting out there. I didn't see a group of guys that weren't playing hard.
Guys were trying. It was just like you're trying to get through that wall. We
never could get through it.  
Guys were trying. They were encouraging each other in the timeout. So that
gets now‑‑ if I saw bad attitudes or guys not trying or we gave up‑‑ because
there's several times we could have packed it in‑‑ that's concerning. But, no,
we're a young basketball team. We've lost some games this year and we've
responded.  
So hopefully we can learn from this and bounce back from it. Don't have time
to feel sorry for yourself or anything like that. We got beat by a very good
basketball team. We're a very good basketball team. They played better than we
did tonight. Hopefully next game we play better than our opponent.  
  
Q. Kansas State, obviously a very good defensive team. They also got to play
you a week ago. Is there sort of a factor of getting to know your opponent so
well ‑‑ in other words, are you looking forward to fresh meat in this
tournament?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, depending on who it is, but, yeah. No, Kansas State was just
really physical to us tonight. We just‑‑ and they have been. It was a battle
the first game. First game it was a complete battle. It was a 2‑point game. We
had the ball and didn't score, or it's tied with two minutes to go at their
place and they made a big 3. We came back, beat them at our place in a big
game that at the time we thought was even bigger for them. And we were able to
sustain that effort from them.  
And tonight it was their turn. I wish we could have played better. I wish we
wouldn't have gotten in foul trouble. Even if we hadn't gotten in foul
trouble, they were really good tonight. They were really good tonight. They
defended us really well. So I don't want to make any excuses about the foul
trouble because I don't know if that would have made a difference or not.  
But sure didn't help us. But Kansas State is a good basketball team. They're
going to win more games. We gotta learn from it, which we do every game, and
move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Ben McLemore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24997)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Jeff Withey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22871)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  91  
Texas Tech  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas Coach Bill Self, student‑athletes Ben
McLemore and Jeff Withey. Coach, any opening statement?  
COACH SELF: Obviously we were pretty efficient offensively when we didn't turn
it over. Ben got us off to a good start and we kind of puttered around but
played a pretty good second half. And our defense was pretty good except we
just fouled so much.  
I thought it was a pretty good effort.  
  
Q. Jeff, after you guys started puttering around as Bill said, what was the
difference? What got you back into rhythm in the second half?  
JEFF WITHEY: We just knew kind of we had to step up and bring more energy. Ben
helped us out a lot and gave us a lot of energy by scoring, and one stop kind
of led to two. Whenever we're kind of tenacious on defense, it kind of helps
our offense out a lot.  
And the second half we did a little bit better job on defense, and that kind
of just gave us more energy.  
  
Q. Jeff, you've been through this a couple of times. Is this a tough game to
play during the day, a team you've already played two times, kind of in an
environment that's not maybe like you guys are used to?  
JEFF WITHEY: I wouldn't say it's a tough game. We got ready for it this whole
last week. We had practice earlier. And we knew that the Sprint Center
probably wouldn't be packed, but there was a good crowd out there.  
And I wouldn't say it was a tough game to play. We were ready.  
  
Q. You guys played a couple of pretty interesting games against Iowa State.
Just your thoughts on getting them a third time?  
BEN MCLEMORE: We just gotta be ready, get ready as a team, and just go out
there and play Kansas basketball.  
JEFF WITHEY: We're excited to be able to play them again. There is a lot of
controversy and stuff like that, and it will be a fun game. That's what I
like. So it will be a good one.  
  
Q. Unlike the regular season, you guys are playing games back ‑to‑back days,
so what have you been doing this week to prepare for the possibility, the
reality of playing more full games back‑to‑back days, not having days off?  
JEFF WITHEY: We practice every day. So it's not too much of a difference.
Being a senior, I can look back and see how important it is. Just to when
you're in your hotel, you gotta rest and take care of your body and drink a
lot of water and not just horse around in the hotel. That's pretty much all it
comes down to.  
And so, yeah, that's all you gotta do is take care of your body.  
  
Q. Ben, you say you guys play Kansas basketball. It's a beautiful thing. But
66percent field goal percentages is even better than a lot of people have seen
so far. So what was going right for you guys? What was keeping the hands hot
tonight?  
BEN MCLEMORE: We were playing as a team, moving the ball around, making extra
passes to each other and just create for each other. Like you say, we're
shooting 66percent, which was great. And we're just trying to get each other
involved.  
  
Q. You guys had some struggles in Waco on Saturday. What was the key of
turning things back and was that kind of a teaching moment as you guys got
ready for the game coming up today?  
JEFF WITHEY: Yeah, we came out flat against Baylor. And we made‑‑ we had a
couple of tough days of practice just to get ready for that. And we know that
we can't come flat because we become really average and not a very good team.  
So thankfully today Ben was able to come out and he was on fire and got
everybody going. So we gotta just come out ready to play every time.  
And we're just going to learn from our losses. And during this time of the
season, we can't have any more of those.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Everyone's looking forward to this game, the Iowa State guys are looking
forward to playing you guys, some of the players talk about payback for a
couple of close losses. What do expect tomorrow out of this game against Iowa
State?  
COACH SELF: I think it's going to be a terrific ballgame. They're good. They
can stretch it from all five spots. It's a hard matchup for us in a lot of
ways because it gets Jeff away from the basket defensively, and that's where
he's so good is protecting the rim.  
So you're right. We've had two classic games with them this year. The two
games may be the two best games, most exciting games played in our league this
year just about. There's been some other great games. But they both have been
classics. We've been fortunate both games.  
But we've also had some players step up and make some plays, too. But they're
very capable beating anybody. We know we're going to have to play very well.
We look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. In light of the controversy, your last game at Iowa State and the fact
that the conference office even made a public statement about it, are you
concerned that the officials tomorrow might be inclined to try to go the extra
mile to make sure that Iowa State doesn't have any complaints?  
COACH SELF: I hadn't thought about that because the officials are pros. I
mean, they're pros. And that won't even register in an official's mind. If it
does, then they're not a pro.  
But we got good guys calling the games. We had good guys calling the games in
Ames. I'm not going to make light of it. We benefited from a no call late. But
there's a lot of calls during the course of a game. There's not just the calls
that are at the very end of a game that can affect it. But there's a lot of
calls during the course of the game, and we benefited and it created interest
and controversy and attention and things like that.  
But if in fact it would play out the way that you asked the question, then I
would say that our league wouldn't be anywhere close to what it is. I mean,
that won't even register in anybody's mind, I don't believe, going forward.  
Great officials. Two good teams. Should be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about the run at the end of the first half and start of
the second half that opened up a close game and pretty much let you coast?  
COACH SELF: We started the game great. And we ended the first half really
well, even though it was a modest 5‑0 run, but it was one of those deals,
29‑25 I think, with the under four timeout and then we ended up finishing the
half right to get it to 9.  
And then of course I think it was Jeff's only points in the half was the last
five we scored, if I'm not mistaken. And in the second half we came out. We
played very well. Both halves got us off to a great start.  
But the big thing we have to do defensively, we've got to play without
fouling. We fouled way too much the second half. I think with about six
minutes left they had two field goals but they've made 16 free throws or
whatever. So we've gotta do a better job of that.  
  
Q. Is Iowa State even more dangerous as they come into this tournament
because they're one of the preeminent bubble teams?  
COACH SELF: They're not a bubble team. I don't think Fred could sell to his
team that they're a bubble team for motivation. They're in the tournament. And
I also believe that he doesn't need to try real hard to motivate his team,
just like I hope I don't have to try real hard to motivate mine.  
So it will be two NCAA Tournament teams hooking up and playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talk about the teaching points, you guys coming out of Waco, as you got
ready for the tournament, and do you think that was good for the team to have
those tough practices?  
COACH SELF: Well, I don't think it's‑‑ I'd rather learn through winning than
learn through losing, but if you're going to lose, you might as well learn.
And, you know, we'd been on a pretty good roll, winning seven in a row and
playing some of our better ball during conference play during that stretch.  
I don't know if I agree with Jeff. I don't think we came out flat; I think we
came out just off a little bit, and I thought Baylor was really on. And it's a
30‑28 game. It's a 6‑point game with six minutes left. And there would be a
lot of times when Baylor's playing really well that we'd have to play pretty
well for it to be a 6‑point game with six minutes left.  
And we didn't do that. But we just closed the game miserably and never put
ourselves in a chance to win. So there were some things to learn. Because the
biggest thing you can learn is there's no more safety nets. Just like the
seniors playing. There's no safety net. You're on a tightrope and there's no
net to catch anymore because there's not a next year. And the sophomores and
juniors, there is a next year.  
So that's the same way at the NCAA Tournament postseason, there's no safety
net. So there needs to be some pressures like that to get your team to perform
well. And that may have helped us a little bit, I don't really know. Jury is
still out. We'll see what happens moving forward.  
  
Q. Ben McLemore, the number of shots he's taken, his aggressiveness has been
a story line all year. Obviously came out very aggressive tonight. Is there
anything you've done or talked to him about, about as like clearly such a
talented player, the type of skill that could carry you through a tournament
if he is aggressive for whole games?  
COACH SELF: I don't talk to Ben like that. I guess in baseball you can have a
cleanup hitter that can carry a team during a stretch or something like that.
I haven't approached Ben like that.  
I know he's capable of getting 20, 25 any night. He knows he's capable of
doing that. But the biggest thing he's gotta do is put himself in position to
shoot the basketball or to drive it if they crowd him. And practice or in
recent games or whatnot, he has done that.  
So really since the Iowa State game up there‑‑ he didn't put himself in the
game at Iowa State as well. And I think he only had seven points. So that's
something that I know, that we have to look at that tape and show him how he
can be more aggressive in how they want to defend him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  66  
Texas  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas State Coach Bruce Weber,
student‑athletes Rodney McGruder and Angel Rodriguez. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's victory.  
COACH WEBER: It's a good win. We've talked about Texas, how much improvement
they've made over the last stretch, with Kabongo back, changes their team, and
I think they're 6‑3, since he got back. And since we played them they were
4‑1, and basically beat the same teams, most of the same team, Oklahoma State,
along that stretch.  
We knew we had a game. When we saw the big lineup, we thought they would play
zone.  
The second night, keep legs. I don't think they wanted to chase us. And they
had‑‑ for the most part it was pretty successful. We struggled. But the best
thing for us is we talked all week about getting better at defense.  
We had slipped I thought last week defensively, both in the TC and Oklahoma
State. It's nothing against them. They're good teams. But we weren't in a
position where we needed to be. And I thought we did a much better job.  
And obviously with Kabongo, he scored only the last bucket or last free throws
of the game, otherwise he has zero and made other people made plays.  
So proud of the guys. You keep finding somebody to step up. Omari went in a
couple minutes, Nino went in a couple minutes, but D.J., Darrell Johnson, who
was good in the year and he always gives us a minute or two, but he was huge
for us. So that was great. With J.O.'s (Henriquez) back kind of struggling, we
needed somebody with Thomas in foul trouble. And like we have all year,
somebody stepped up, and Darrell was definitely the difference maker tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rodney, you know I speak in broad ‑brush terms, but Kansas State beat
Texas all three times in men's basketball this year, also beat them in
football. We're talking about little K‑State toppling Texas in those two major
sports. What's the pride you have in wearing those colors to be able to do
what you guys have been able to do as a university this year?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: It all starts with our fans, how much they support us, and
they push us to go hard. And we know what we're doing is not only for
ourselves but also the Manhattan community.  
So it feels good to do big things for our community.  
  
Q. Angel, can you talk about what you guys did defensively in general and in
particular against Kabongo?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: The first game I think he had 24points and he pretty much
killed us. He did whatever he wanted to. So, you know, the whole key with
them, if you start Myck Kabongo and you let other players make plays, you're
going to have a higher chance of winning the game.  
That's what we did today. We've got to give a lot of credit to our teammates,
our big, did a tremendous job at hedging or just not letting him‑‑ not letting
him play comfortable.  
  
Q. Angel, did you feel like it was easier to push the ball and play more of
your tempo of the game the second half than it was the first half?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I thought we rebounded better and that gave us a chance to
actually push the ball, because the coaches were saying that they were all
crashing the boards. And if we make sure we get the rebound, we're going to
get a fastbreak situation, because they're all crashing the boards and
nobody's going to get back. And we did that a lot of times, we got a lot of
layups and a lot of easy baskets.  
  
Q. Rod, at times this year this team has been its best when scoring has been
spread across three, four guys. But there have been times where you've taken
over games, too. I wondered, tonight's game, was there a feeling that maybe
early on or maybe even halfway where you thought you were going to have to
take the majority of the shots?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: No. The shots that I took today were open shots. And I was
fortunate enough to make half of them. And Angel found me a couple of times on
the break and on the wing. So I just gotta thank my teammates for finding me
tonight.  
  
Q. Rodney, kind of going off the same thing there, I believe it's the fourth
time in seven meetings against Texas that you scored at least 20points. And
before the game Curt and Jamar both said they thought you would show up in
this game, and of course you did. Is there anything about Texas and going
against them that really lights your fire?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: I wouldn't say that. Tonight I just played with a sense of
urgency. I know this could have been my last game in the Sprint Center. So I
tried to go out there and give it my all, lay it all on the line.  
  
Q. Angel, you kind of had an off game against Oklahoma State. Can you talk
about your feelings when you came out there and hit your first few 3s like
that?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: We watched film, and the 3s I was taking against Oklahoma
State were kind of far. And sometimes it's not always going to be a good day.
But it happened already. I'm always going to play with high confidence. The
coaches and my teammates trust me a lot.  
So you move on. Regardless if you played good or bad, the next game is what
matters.  
  
Q. Rod, you guys kind of broke the game open with a 12 ‑0 run midway through
the second half. It started with that 3‑pointer you threw in right at the end
of the shot clock. Can you talk about that shot and how big that run was to
open up the big lead?  
RODNEY MCGRUDER: Angel did a good job penetrating. I looked behind him and he
found me, and I was fortunate enough to make the shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the play of your subs; you had two guys with
three fouls early in the second half?  
COACH WEBER: You know, I thought we'd go back to Will. He seems more healthy,
and it gives us a rotation with Martavious coming off the bench for either
Angel or for Will. If you start Martavious now, Angel gets in foul trouble, Ta
(Irving) gets tired, you're in a bind. That's part of the reason we did that.
I told Ta he's been great. Had nothing to do with him or how his play. But if
you play well, you're going to be in at the end of the game. That's where he
was.  
And I thought Omari had a couple of good moments. We tried to get Rod out as
much as we can. It's tough sometimes. But when O (Lawrence) goes in there,
he's played well against Texas all three times. He had a couple of nice plays
for us.  
And then Darrell, D.J., that's how he played early in the year. I'm not sure
what lit the fire tonight, but he was sure good. And seven rebounds, four
offensive, eight points. And just was a back‑breaker for them with J.O. kind
of struggling getting up and down the court. And then Thomas in foul trouble.
And even Nino, just a couple minutes here or there.  
All year it's been a key to our team, is that we are a team and we can come at
you with a lot of different people.  
  
Q. The 2 ‑3 zone that Texas put on in the first half, was it frustrating?
Was it annoying? Seemed like it just took a while for the offense to get in
gear.   
COACH WEBER: I told the guys I thought they would play zone. So it wasn't
unexpected. And they did it yesterday. Had some success with it against TCU.
They are long. And when you saw their starting lineup, you knew they were
going to do it. And they get you pretty out, you know, on the wings. They come
up high and get you on the wings.  
I thought we just didn't do a good job penetrating. When we did, it was
usually late in the shot clock and we were able to get some kind of action and
get something happening.  
I thought that and the ball screens we got a little better. And then somebody
mentioned about running. One, they turned it over 15 times. That allowed us to
run and beat the zone back. But they also crashed five, and they hurt us
early.  
We got better with our rebounding second half, as Angel said. And then we were
able to get down the court and beat the zone a little bit.  
And then Shane‑‑ I thought Shane, for only two points, it was one of his
better games. He just made a lot of little plays and was really solid
defensively. He started sneaking around in the zone. He didn't always get the
assists, but he got the assist that led to the assist, the hockey assist, that
made a difference.  
  
Q. You mentioned being happy with the defense, that some things came back.
You see the second half percentages, 25percent. Obviously that speaks for
itself. But is this effort back to the top level that you guys were playing
earlier?  
COACH WEBER: I'm not sure it's the top. But we were definitely in position
tonight. And, again, I'm not sure, and we did a lot of 5‑on‑4\. We call it
frenzy. We've got to scramble and help the‑‑ guard the next guy that's open.
Because that's how they get you. He gets by one guy, you gotta help.
Somebody's gotta rotate.  
And that's going to happen whether it's tonight, Pierre tomorrow, Marcus
Smart, whoever, that's what people have done against us.  
So I felt better about it that we gave up some points in the paint early, and
that's what‑‑ the last game we gave up 36points in the paint against Texas,
and did a much better job especially in the second half.  
  
Q. Question on playing Texas three times in a single season. The first time
of school history you beat them by 26 at Manhattan, 12 in Austin, 17 tonight.
Is there anything maybe about the familiarity of facing a team three times
that might make it easier?  
COACH WEBER: You know, people say it's hard to beat teams three times. And I
think you have a little bit of an advantage. You can sit back last night and
watch the game. Still they probably didn't get back to the hotel 11:30, 12:00,
and I hope as the game went on maybe that would be an advantage for us.
Although, they rotate so many people.  
But it's hard to tell. It's easier to prepare. We just played them two weeks
ago. It seems like everybody on our side of the bracket‑‑ the scout just
happened. It wasn't somebody that we played in early January.  
And it's a good win. We're catching them a year where they're kind of
rebuilding. They got a lot of young kids. They definitely made some
improvements. And just a good solid win for us. I'm happy.  
  
Q. You don't know who you play, but whoever you play, tomorrow's going to be
awfully talented and red hot. Can you talk about the challenge you have next
round?  
COACH WEBER: Both teams are very good. And we just played both of them in the
last two weeks, so preparation will be easier, as far as that goes.  
Our big thing is we've gotta guard. To give ourselves a chance, we hopefully
have a little bit of home‑court advantage with some purple in the stands and
again the excitement.  
One of the things I challenged the seniors about tonight was the last two
years they got knocked out first game. Now we're living in the second day. Now
let's see if we can get to the championship. And that's the thing we've talked
about all‑‑ actually not all year, but the last three, four weeks since Coach
Snyder talked to us, just be 1‑0\. We're 1‑0 tonight. Move on. Be 1‑0 tomorrow
night and we'll be playing Saturday.  
It will be a tough challenge. Hopefully our guys will rise up to the occasion.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  91  
Texas Tech  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Chris Walker, Dusty Hannahs, Dejan
Kravic, and Jordan Tolbert.  
COACH WALKER: First of all, I want to give credit to Coach Self. Great coach.
Team played great. They'll probably be a No.1 seed and vie for another Final
Four spot.  
They played real well. I thought we battled them in the first half. Couple of
plays here and there could have been the difference, but, again, that's why
they are where they are.  
But the one thing I want to say: I'm extremely proud of my guys playing
back‑to‑back days. I thought we battled with them on the glass, we just
couldn't make enough shots. And McLemore got going. And that's why they are
who they are.  
I want to say coming back, playing back‑to‑back days, proud of the way the
team played. And I think going forward as we battle and as we continue to move
things forward, I think the guys that played in that game today did a lot
about establishing how Texas Tech basketball plays, and I think that our fan
base can be proud of what we're looking to establish.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Dejan, what was the difference second half? And how hard was it to stay
in it once a couple big 3s start falling for them and it seemed like they
jumped ahead so fast?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: They started knocking down shots in the second half. We didn't
knock down shots. We were slow to come back in transition. They were getting
runs on us. That's how they got‑‑ that's how they built up the lead, really.  
  
Q. Jordan, what do you take from this now that the season is over? A big win
last night. Where do you guys kind of see this going forward, and what you
guys can accomplish as you get ready for the offseason?  
JORDAN TOLBERT: We definitely have to take the fact that we need to do better
rebounding. And I don't really‑‑ can we do a different question?  
  
Q. What did you learn about yourself here in these last two games?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: Just being confident and being physically and mentally tough.
That's really it. That's kind of what's been holding this team back, what's
been holding me back. Just being physical.  
We're looking forward to the offseason. We're going to have a strong
offseason, and we're going to come back stronger next year. We're very
optimistic about the future, and we're proud of what we've accomplished here.  
  
Q. Dejan, what kind of building block do you think that these last two games
‑‑ hitting the game‑winning shot last night, going for 20 tonight‑‑ will
provide you as you get ready for the offseason that you have ahead?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I just know what I need to work on now, what we need to work on
as a team. We're going to get in the weight room. We all obviously have to get
stronger. Rebounding was a weakness of ours, so that's something we need to
work on.  
It just starts in the offseason. Starts in the weight room. Starts in the gym.  
  
Q. Dusty, what do you say about this team going forward and what you guys
can be as you head into the offseason?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: Everyone showed that we're fighters, we're going to fight to
win. And now it's just preparing. Now we know what we have when we have a
strong nucleus and people are starting to get familiar with each other. And
the more practice we get with each other, we're going to be dangerous.  
  
Q. Can you describe what it's like to try and stop Kansas when they get hot
like they did today? They went for 66percent, had a big run to start the
second half that kind of blew the game open. How is that as far as trying to
stop that when they get rolling?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I mean, it's definitely tough. When they get rolling, it's
really hard to stop them. They're a top five team in the nation for a reason.  
So when they start attacking like that, they're so difficult to guard from
every position, from their point guard to their big men. They have pros on
their team. I mean, it's tough to stop. It's tough to stop when they get going
like that.  
JORDAN TOLBERT: I think they just make a lot of momentum plays. When they have
the momentum and they continue to attack you, they don't let up at all. So
it's very difficult to stop.  
DUSTY HANNAHS: They're just very aggressive. Like Dejan said, they have pros
and guys that know how to play the game, and older guys, seniors and juniors
that are seasoned, besides McLemore, and they just make plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What will this particular team mean most to you, just having been with
them this year?  
COACH WALKER: You know what, I'll say it's been a very unique experience,
because coming from where they came from and to where they are now. You've
often heard me say that the most important thing is being the best team you
can be by the end of the season.  
And the thing that I'm most impressed is that they're the best people they can
be by the end of the season. I think they become stronger as men, and that's
why they became stronger as a team.  
And I think they stayed together. It wasn't perfect. But and it wasn't a
perfect way we took over, but it was something, an opportunity for us. And I
think that we made‑‑ we made our fans proud and our fan base proud. And,
again, they provided something for us to build on for the future.  
But I'm really‑‑ as a first‑year head coach, I couldn't ask for a better set
of guys to handle the circumstances they did and turn a frown upside down and
really play to the end.  
  
Q. What do you see from them going offseason and what they could potentially
accomplish because a lot of guys have now at least a little bit of
experience?  
COACH WALKER: Seven of the ten guys never played at this level before. And I
consider a lot of the junior college guys and even Dejan Kravic as freshmen. I
think any team, any player when the season is over, the number one
responsibility you have is to get better, to work on your skill set and try to
improve so you can be the best. If you love the game, be the best player you
can be.  
I expect them all to be in the gym working on their game, taking a couple of
days. And they love the game. That's what they'll do. They'll get in the gym
and work.  
  
Q. Just talk about your immediate postseason plans and what you've got in
store between working for a contract and recruiting and things like that?  
COACH WALKER: You know what, I want to take it day by day. There's a process
that we're going through at Tech. And certainly aware of it. And I think it's
a good thing.  
And the one thing I can do‑‑ I've done all I can do to make the case. But,
again, the one thing I am is very appreciative of the opportunity that I
received from the university and very thankful for Kirby for having confidence
in me and giving me a chance to prove myself as a coach.  
Forget about the circumstances in which I took over. You get your opportunity
how you get your opportunity, and then you get an opportunity to do the best
you can do.  
And, again, my goal was to make sure that I made those guys the best men, the
best students and the best players they could be. And I honestly believe that
we achieved all three of those things.  
  
Q. What can you remember most about your first season as a head coach?  
COACH WALKER: The one thing I remember the most is when you're a head coach,
you have the opportunity to bring your personality to the situation. And,
again, I always say what would the world be like if Superman was a bad guy.
You have that kind of power as a head coach. And if you're a good guy and you
have a chance to really just be infectious with your attitude on young men and
you really want to have the opportunity to treat young men as if someone
else's son, you're going to want your son to play for me. No matter what. I'm
going to treat him the right way, I'm going to push him to be the best man he
can me, the best student, the best player.  
But at the end of the day, as I tell my guys, it's all about attitude. And the
one thing I learned is I can definitely, through a diverse situation, through
an adverse situation, have the best attitude I can have.  
  
Q. You guys had Kansas I guess kind of where you wanted them when it was a
two ‑point game midway through the first half. What changed? And what is it
about Kansas that makes these guys so difficult?  
COACH WALKER: They're experienced. You have guys that have played in a
national championship game. You have guys‑‑ even the guys that come off the
bench are big‑time players.  
That's what Kansas is. That's what we aspire to be, to have those type of
players and have that type of success. They just are what they are.  
And we battled them as long as we could, and I thought our guys did a great
job of doing that. We had them on the ropes a little bit.  
But, again, they're experienced. They've won a lot. It's the culture there.
And, again, that's what we're aspiring to be, and I think in time that can be
accomplished.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH WALKER: The tournament is quite simple. It's one and done. Obviously
experience helps. They can rebound, they can throw it inside, they have a
gatekeeper in Withey, and they defend well and they have a great coach.  
So absolutely with the culture with what's been established there and what
they've done in the past and even in the last couple of years, they absolutely
have a chance to make it to the championship game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  73  
Oklahoma  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma Coach Lon Kruger and student‑athletes
Sam Grooms and Romero Osby. Coach, your thoughts on today's game.  
COACH KRUGER: Tough ballgame to lose. I thought our guys played a lot of good
minutes in the ballgame. Had a stretch there in the second half where Iowa
State made some shots and did a good job to get into the lead and cut into our
lead and then take the lead.  
And, again, I liked the effort of our guys. I liked their thoughts throughout.
Again, we just had that stretch. Iowa State made some good plays, to their
credit, and did a good job and played better than we did down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Romero, it looked like Iowa State was getting a lot of loose balls that
accelerated down the stretch. Was that the way it felt to you as well, and can
you talk about just how you guys didn't seem to have quite the step today?  
ROMERO OSBY: Yes, you're exactly right. They got a lot of loose balls down the
stretch. A lot of loose balls that we were getting in the first half they
ended up being quicker to them in the second half. Even when we were up 12 or
13, they were still getting those loose balls and putting them back in baskets
or putting a lot of pressure on us.  
And I think that ended up being the deciding factor because they weren't
shooting as well in the first half, but getting those loose balls and those
easy buckets kind of got them in the rhythm and started to spark their
shooting in the second half.  
  
Q. Sam, what happened the last seven and a half minutes that turned the
game?  
SAM GROOMS: Just like Ro said. They were quicker to the loose balls. They
played a little bit harder. And, I mean, point‑blank they made shots towards
the end. Shots they were missing in the first half they continued to shoot and
they made them towards the end of the game.  
  
Q. Got off one shot in the last nine minutes. Did you guys kind of ‑‑ did
Iowa State do something to keep you guys from getting the ball or‑‑  
SAM GROOMS: They put a little more pressure on it. I think they tried to take
him out of the game as much as they could, and you gotta credit them for‑‑
gotta find ways to get on the ball. He needs to have it. He's our leader and
we've got to find a way to keep him going, keep him into it.  
But as far as what they did, gotta commend them. They did it well.  
  
Q. Ro and Sam, you guys, most people say you're clearly in the NCAA
Tournament, but losing the last two, is there any trepidation going into
Sunday and waiting on that announcement, or are you still confident you're
in?  
ROMERO OSBY: We're always going to be nervous about it. We've got a couple
days to sit down and just really think about it. But you can't really worry
about it. We've got to get back to work and get prepared for wherever we're
going to be. We're fortunate enough that we know we're going to be playing in
the postseason, whatever tournament it is. We just need to make sure we stay
focused on that.  
But we hope we're in. We think we should be in. But it's not about us, it's
about the committee and what they feel. And we have lost two straight games,
so they're going to look at that. But hopefully we're still able to make it.  
SAM GROOMS: I agree with Ro. I think we did enough to be able to be in. But at
the end of the day the committee makes that decision. And we did good enough
to play in some kind of post tournament and we gotta get back to work and
prepare for whatever lies ahead.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I was wondering: Do you feel like after what happened at Texas and then
today that they're just not able to close it out?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, we had a couple of bad stretches there for sure. Of
course, the other six, seven games we won in the last ten they did close it
off. So, yeah.  
This group played good basketball. The last half of the conference season
especially we've had those moments that we'd like to be able to change.
Probably most teams do. But our moments are pretty glaring when you consider
Texas and then at TCU and today in the conference tournament, liked to have
been able to play better than we did in the last seven minutes.  
But played a lot of good minutes of basketball today. And we're very active,
very aggressive. Got the loose balls early. The last eight, nine minutes they
got them.  
They got loose balls and converted some of those to buckets, second‑shot
opportunities. And that's the difference in the ballgame.  
Iowa State did a good job. Credit them. But we've gotta do a better job.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like you have to call all your buddies on the
committee say, Hey, remember us, or not, or do you feel like you're in?  
COACH KRUGER: That doesn't do much good. That doesn't happen. We played good
basketball. We made good progress. Don't have anything that we can affect it
with at this point.  
Like the progress they made, like the play that they've turned out. Obviously
a lot of it depends on upsets and other games. But I'd like to think this
group's deserved an opportunity.  
  
Q. When Iowa State made that run midway through the second half, you have
Romero on the bench, do you regret not getting him back in there quicker?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, it coincided with taking Ro out. I think we were up, what,
7 maybe when we took Ro out, and a minute and a half later it's an even
ballgame.  
So we tried to get him a couple or three possessions there, and they made the
run at that time. I don't know if that‑‑ we had a couple of plays there when
Ro was out that we would have liked to have done differently. But like to be
able to play him 40minutes for sure. He's had such good results for us.  
  
Q. I know you like the guys to play through stretches when things aren't
going well. But given the noise the Iowa State fans were making and how
quickly they got back in it with that 12 ‑0 run to tie it at 60, would you
have liked to have, looking back, maybe used a timeout to stem that momentum a
little bit?  
COACH KRUGER: Yeah, we had a TV timeout there under eight, thought we were
okay there. But, yeah, you can always look back say liked to have made this
shot or liked to have had a timeout here, liked to have run something
differently. No question, that's always going through your mind.  
  
Q. In addition to Romero not getting a lot of looks late offensively, Cam
Clark came on, got hot, scored a lot of points, and late in the game he didn't
get a lot of looks offensively. Was that a defensive thing by Iowa State, guys
hurrying through possessions, not getting it to the hot hand?  
COACH KRUGER: Iowa State did a good job getting physical late and getting into
bodies a little bit more, dictating it more defensively. Cam had a good run.
Cam had a good stretch. Gave us a good lift, as Ro did earlier. But you've
just gotta do things to try to keep your guys that are making plays involved a
little bit more. Iowa State did a good job to fight that off.  
  
Q. Was it disappointing that if you play Iowa State and they just get hot
and sink a ton of 3s, that's one thing, but they actually hurt you on second
‑chance points a ton, got a bunch of points in the paint. Not a typical Iowa
State script. Is that even more disappointing to know that you got beat that
way?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought we played them pretty well for‑‑ defensively doing
things we wanted to do. Made some shots late. They got the loose balls late.
Combine those two things together, it was a difference in the ballgame. That
swung our lead to them.  
But they're a good shooting team and they made shots at critical times late in
the ballgame, and some of those came off of second‑shot opportunities, loose
balls that they got to that we didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  74  
Baylor  72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Baylor Bears, Coach Scott Drew,
student‑athletes Rico Gathers, Cory Jefferson, and Pierre Jackson. Coach, your
thoughts.  
COACH DREW: Well, I thought everyone that stayed saw a heck of a game. You saw
a tale of two halves. First half Oklahoma State played great; we didn't play
well.  
I thought probably in essence in the last three weeks you've been first four
out, last four in, on the bubble. All the pressure, stress probably showed
tonight when we were 0‑for‑13 and just out of sync and couldn't get anything
going and started pressing.  
And then second half we couldn't have been any more proud of how our team
responded and played. I thought the upperclassmen did an unbelievable job
leading.  
And to come back from 18points down versus a team like Oklahoma State showed a
lot of heart and a lot of courage and toughness, and I know our staff was
extremely proud of how they came back.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Pierre, how difficult was it not to get down when you're down like 20
there in the first half? How difficult was it to not get down on yourself and
give in when you're down 20 in the first half?  
PIERRE JACKSON: I mean, we've been in that spot before. We were down 14 at
their place with seven minutes to go. So we knew what the situation was. We
just tried to stay positive as always, execute on defense and offense, and we
were able to get back in the game.  
  
Q. How did you all change it around so much in the second half? What did you
all do?  
PIERRE JACKSON: We played Baylor basketball. We played as a team. Shots
weren't falling for a couple of us. We just kept getting to the paint. Coach
emphasizes paint, and we did a good job at that. We stayed solid on defense.
So that's the way we play.  
  
Q. Pierre, take us through the last play. What did you see on the ‑‑ when
you got to the 3‑point line, did it feel like a good look for you?  
PIERRE JACKSON: The last shot? Yeah, I definitely thought it went in. But
Coach did a good job calling the play. We executed well and we were able to
get a shot up at the last second. Unfortunately, it didn't fall.  
  
Q. Pierre, you kind of laid on the floor for a few seconds after. Just talk
about the emotion of being a senior and your last game, last shot to get
there.  
PIERRE JACKSON: It really hasn't hit me yet. But at the same time just kind of
the moment you live for, being able to take that last shot and helping your
team out. And I wasn't able to knock it down for my team. I feel like I let
them down a little bit, but at the same time I'm proud of our team for how we
fought back.  
  
Q. Rico, how disappointing was this after making such a great comeback?  
RICO GATHERS: I mean, of course you'd be disappointed because of the loss.
But, I mean, I was so proud of my teammates and how we were able to rally
back. And that was the most exciting part of this game, being able to play
with Pierre and A.J., and I got Jake on the sideline, we're giving it our all,
110 percent. And just coming up short, you know what I'm saying?  
You can't really dwell on it, you know what I'm saying? You just gotta look at
the positives out of the situation. I mean, have to spend the last game of my
season with some great teammates, and that's what means the most to me.  
  
Q. Pierre, obviously you guys show a lot of moxie and heart the last two or
three games. How disappointing is it going to be for you when those Selection
Sundays come along if you guys don't get picked in the tournament?  
PIERRE JACKSON: Of course, it's going to be very disappointing. Can't do
nothing about it. All I want is my teammates to play hard for me and I just
wanted to play hard for my teammates at the end of the day. You can't really
complain about that.  
That's how the cards are dealt, and we can't complain about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Did you get a look at the last play with Forte and the foul in the lane,
and what did you think?  
COACH DREW: The great thing about film is you get it right away. Great thing
about computers, you can go frame by frame, clip by clip.  
I saw it. I have an obvious opinion, real easy opinion. But I'll pose the
question back to you: If for three weeks you've been struggling on the bubble
trying to make this tournament and everybody says you win you're definitely
in, you lose, you don't know, would you want the game to come down to that
play? Period. And that's the question I'll throw back to you guys.  
Shouldn't have gotten down, but Oklahoma State's a top 15 team in the nation.
And they're a good team and they caused us to get down.  
That's how I'll answer that.  
  
Q. Travis mentioned that you guys should be in based on the eye test. And
knowing where you're at right now, are you ‑‑ is it your feeling that it's
going to come down to an eye test for you guys, or do you feel like numbers
should still get you in?  
COACH DREW: Joe Lunardi, we'll see what his final bracket says, because he's
usually pretty good. But I think with the committee‑‑ I think a perfect
example is VCU a couple of years ago, whenever it was, they went to the Final
Four, and people were like, Why did they get in? Well, the committee knew they
were a Final Four‑type team.  
Who recently has beaten Kentucky in Rupp and beaten Kansas? I think we can
beat anybody in the country. That means we can play in the Final Four.  
At the same time I know everyone in the country has games like why didn't you
win? But I think we can compete with anybody in the country.  
So if the committee sees us worthy, we would definitely be excited. That's an
understatement.  
  
Q. Were you almost surprised that that last shot was as open as it was? Was
that what you drew up to get him loose down the sideline like that?  
COACH DREW: For a second I didn't know if there was contact or not. I look
forward to looking at that play, too, because I thought it was a great look. I
thought it was a great job by Pierre.  
  
Q. Isaiah had a tough night tonight. Was it just Oklahoma State's defense?
He never was able to seem like he found a rhythm. What was up with Isaiah
tonight?  
COACH DREW: Tough thing about 18‑, 19‑year‑olds. And I think Isaiah's been
great most of the year and tonight just wasn't. He didn't have it working. And
thank goodness Rico came in, gave us a really great lift and gave us great
energy.  
Isaiah will be back. Good players don't have back‑to‑back bad games. So we
know he'll come back.  
  
Q. In the lineup, the comeback, did you have second thoughts about maybe
getting bigger down the stretch because of what Nash was able to do?  
COACH DREW: That's where you have to give Nash some credit, because I think
one of those shots for sure was really a tough shot. You've got to give your
hats off to him. I think the ball hit every part of the rim and went in, and I
don't know who was guarding or if it would have mattered at that point. So he
made some big plays down the stretch.  
That was something we had talked about, but we had momentum coming back and we
were hoping to ride that through. And earlier in the game Nash had scored on
some other people, too. So I think it was just a great player making plays
down the stretch then.  
  
Q. Down the stretch, Nash was posted up three times and you had Gary on him
once, Deuce the second time, and then Cory. What matchup were you looking for
and what would you have liked to have seen?  
COACH DREW: We were trying to not let him get the ball. To his credit and the
passer's credit, they were able to get him the ball, number one. Number two,
we were trying to draw a charge on him. Tried to use our quickness, beat him
to a spot, get a charge.  
We've seen that on film. Some people have been able to do that earlier in the
year. So that was something because he's so effective down there, if you let
him get to the rim.  
So obviously none of them worked. So credit Nash for making great plays. He's
a great player.  
  
Q. Scott, did you all just take them out of their game in the second half,
just hurry what they did? Or what happened?  
COACH DREW: I think they took us out of our game first half. We took them out
of their game. I think the big thing is they only made six field goals the
second half. That's pretty good defense. We only made eight first half. That
was pretty good defense by them.  
So it's amazing. Momentum changes with shots going in, too. They had some open
ones they missed. We had some open ones we missed, and that definitely affects
the game.  
  
Q. Scott, the contributions from A.J. and then the shot by Gary there at the
end to get you the four ‑point play, how big were both of those, I guess?  
COACH DREW: I mean, A.J.'s in the locker room cramping, hyperventilating,
whatever. He left it all out there. He's a senior trying to get to the NCAA
Tournament. It was huge what he did second half.  
And Gary really gave us a good lift. And the big thing is the free throw he
made. I mean, it's one thing knocking down the 3, and saw that on film. It was
a good. I mean, it's great that he made that. And then he went to the line to
make it. So just proud of him.  
  
Q. Say things don't go the way you're hoping on Selection Sunday. What will
you look back at the season and say we needed to do that better in order to
not put ourselves in this position?  
COACH DREW: I think every team in America can look back and have a number of
games. I don't think college basketball has had a season like this in a long
time. And that's what makes it so exciting if you're just a basketball purist
and you're not getting your heart broken every night. But at the same time
it's just‑‑ I mean, any night you never know what's going to happen.  
Obviously you look at Oklahoma State, take them by themselves. We have a
chance to win it and a chance to win it at their place. We're down 14 with
seven to go. We come back. Force overtime. Lose at the buzzer on a great play
by them. And then tonight.  
So, again, I know we can compete with anybody in the country. And just we
needed to‑‑ if we don't get invited, we need to do it‑‑ win a couple of those
close games. And tough thing is the common denominator in the close games,
50‑some percent from the free‑throw line, and on games we win, 70‑some
percent.  
It's kind of like the field goal kickers; you don't miss until a close game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Marcus Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25024)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  74  
Baylor  72

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Ford will catch up. We'll go to questions for our three
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Le'Bryan, can you talk about your difficult first half but then you came
on in the second half? What got you going in the second half?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: My teammates, my point guard and Marcus telling me just keep
playing. I think I had a real bad first half, and I was worried about my ankle
because I twist it. The second half I just told my teammates, if you give me
the ball, I'm just coming through clutch. I tell these guys every time that I
like playing in the clutch, and it worked out for me today.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you dodged a bullet when Pierre's last second shot
didn't go down?  
MARCUS SMART: Definitely. Knowing‑‑ we knew Pierre, he was going to make a
play for his team. He was one of those guys that can do it for his team. He
came out, and he started hurting us a little bit. He went through one of those
spurts where he just was just scoring, attributing to the team with assists
and just affecting the game.  
We definitely dodged a bullet with that last second shot.  
  
Q. (Off Microphone)?  
MICHAEL COBBINS: You know, Phil Forte, he came through and made him adjust his
shot like that and made him miss. But we gotta be better than that for the
next game.  
  
Q. Marcus, what's going through your mind as you see Pierre racing down the
court like that knowing what a hot hand he's had and what a great player he
is? What were you thinking?  
MARCUS SMART: At that time we were‑‑ to be honest, it was: Oh, crap, he's
coming full speed. Like you said, he had the hot hand and he's a very great
player. When players have the hot hand at this caliber, it's hard to stop
them. And that definitely was what was going through my mind, and it gave us a
scare.  
  
Q. After he missed, he's lying on the floor. Several of you guys went over
to kind of help him up. Was that just respect for a great player?  
MARCUS SMART: Definitely. You know, he's had a great four years at Baylor.
He's done things that most players would dream and only imagine of doing. And
he's had a great season.  
And so there was no need for him to do that. But I can understand, because I
know the feeling of frustration, of missing that last second shot, giving your
team a chance. And much respect goes out to him and that Baylor team.  
  
Q. For any of the three of you, what do you have left for Kansas State
tomorrow?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: We have everything. We know they're a good team. We're a good
team. It's going to be a good battle. And we're going to come out stronger
than we did today. We've gotta keep focusing on the task at hand and keep
playing.  
  
Q. Marcus, your offense, very solid in the first half. Not much offense in
the second half. What happened to stagnate your offense?  
MARCUS SMART: We lost a little bit of focus. We came out in the second half,
we're up 18, and we didn't really match their intensity like we should have in
the first ten minutes. They came out ready and more energized than we expected
them to.  
At this level, this time of the season, you've got to expect it at all times.
You can't have any slipups or "oh, shoot" moments. You've go to be ready at
all times, and that's just kind of what happened tonight.  
  
Q. Marcus, one more for you. I know when Forte was at the line there you
turned away and you weren't looking when he hit that first one. Was that ‑‑
why were you doing that? You couldn't bear to watch?  
MARCUS SMART: It's a little thing I do. I was playing with Phil my whole life.
In close games like that he's been at the free‑throw line. It's just a
tradition I do to turn away and I guess relieve some of the pressure off of
him looking for his teammates' eyes and having to make a big shot a big time
moment.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, 18 ‑point lead at halftime with the prospect of another game the
next day and the hopes for another on Saturday. Are you taking your foot off
the pedal? Is that the mindset going into the second half at all?  
COACH FORD: No, not at all. Not at all. Second half was more about Baylor than
it was about us. What happened to our offense is what happened to our defense.
We were scoring so many points off our defense in the first half, we couldn't
get any stops in the second half to get out on the break and create some
things.  
Again, and Baylor really played great defense. I just got through obviously in
the last couple of days watching them play Kansas on Saturday. That's the team
they‑‑ we played really, really well the first time. They played really well
the second half. That's what happened, period. They played really well. And we
came up a couple of points more. They're a very good basketball team. We did
nothing different offensively. We ran all the same stuff. But we just didn't
get out on the fastbreak as much as we would have liked.  
And we pressed a little bit in the first half. We weren't scoring at a big
enough clip. And to get into our press as much as we had, we had a point in
mind that we were going to press at some point, but we never got to that point
where we wanted to score‑wise.  
  
Q. Did you say a little bit something stronger than "oh, shoot" like Marcus
said after‑‑ when Pierre had that last attempt?  
COACH FORD: I wasn't overly excited about seeing him run down the court wide
open. But I'll tell you, we made a lot of defensive mistakes. We know we made
defensive mistakes because of our game plan. A lot. We made another one there
at the end that I was supposed to switch and didn't switch.  
We made a lot of mistakes defensively in the second half. More than we've made
in a long time. And that caused us a few problems and allowed Baylor to get in
the rhythm that we didn't allow in the first half.  
We didn't make many mistakes in the first half defensively. I think we just
played not to lose rather than playing to win. It's a popular statement by
coaches, but I think that was a pretty true statement.  
But Baylor came out very good, like they looked like Saturday. Saturday it was
never a game. That's what they looked like. So they're more than capable of
playing that way.  
  
Q. That last play with Phil, the foul, it went to your side of the floor.
What did you see develop there and was the ball supposed to be in his hand to
finish the half?  
COACH FORD: I was blocked from the foul. But it's something we work on as far
as trying to get penetration. And try to let Marcus‑‑ something happen, and
guys on the perimeter are supposed to do certain things.  
So that is a possibility for that to happen, definitely.  
  
Q. Are you concerned with how much your team has left for tomorrow?  
COACH FORD: Well, you can't worry about that, not at this point. Can't worry
about that at all. I was shocked we were up as much as we were at halftime.
Then the final score is not a surprise. I knew how hard Baylor‑‑ what they had
on the line and what this game was about. I had a lot of respect for their
team.  
So I was expecting a hard‑fought game. So that's what it ended up to be, to
say the least.  
  
Q. You got Le'Bryan going there in the second half. Some of the mismatches,
but early he seemed to be the only guy actually sort of in the flow of an
offense. What was working well with him in the second half?  
COACH FORD: Well, he didn't play too well the first half. We weren't getting
him in position where he likes to get the ball a lot. In the second half he
got the ball in some areas, with some mismatch. They went four guards last
five minutes of the game, I guess. And it's tough for guards to guard him down
there.  
That's difficult at times for him. And I know when LB's (Nash) rolling, and
you can get a feel. And we ran a lot of stuff for him to get the ball.  
  
Q. You mentioned you knew what Baylor had on the line. Would you argue for
them as an NCAA Tournament team?  
COACH FORD: I think it's easy, yes. Easy. They won a lot of big games, a lot
of big games in this league. They've beaten Kansas. They've beaten us. They've
beaten Kentucky in Rupp Arena which is not an easy thing to do.  
I think they've done a lot, absolutely. Absolutely. They're a‑‑ I don't get
it. I don't know about the numbers things, but if you know basketball and you
look at that team, that's a team that can win a lot of games in the NCAA
Tournament, a lot could win. And I think they called that the eye test, if I'm
not mistaken. So if there's an eye test, it's an easy one.  
I don't get the numbers. I would have guessed their numbers should be good
enough to get in. But they're a really good basketball team. They've proven it
a lot. They've proven it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  73  
Oklahoma  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fred Hoiberg and student‑athletes Will Clyburn
and Melvin Ejim. Coach, your thoughts on today's victory.  
COACH HOIBERG: I can't tell you how proud I am for the guys continuing to
battle and to gut out a huge win for us.  
I thought the difference from early in that game, I thought we really‑‑ the
effort we started playing with was about five minutes to go in the half. I
believe we were down 8 on the battle of the boards at that time. We cut that
all the way back to 1. Got ourselves back in the game, had an 8‑point deficit
at the half, and just came out in the second half with a great mentality.  
Those last nine minutes defensively was as good as we have been all season. To
hold the team with Oklahoma's firepower to 28percent in the second half is a
great stat for us.  
And then going back to the glass, we outrebound them by 12, 43‑31\. A lot of
that was a smaller lineup there in the second half. Melvin's out there. He's
Canadian, so he's tough. He's out there playing with a bloody lip that entire
second half and swallowing blood, which can't be fun. And Will went out and
made play after play for us down the stretch.  
The other thing I want to point out is Bubu Palo, who didn't play at all
really until about the five‑minute mark, and then he brought us home. And then
obviously clutch slots. Tyrus hits a big one, and then Babb hits the one to
put us up by 5.  
Couldn't be prouder of our guys. That's a great win. The other thing, we
haven't won here in seven years. You can see by our fan support, we get as
good a fan support as anybody down here.  
To get this win for them is really special, and going all the way back to my
Big Eight days‑‑ I'm longwinded here‑‑ getting back to my Big Eight playing
days at Kemper Arena and playing in front of the fans, I know how special it
is for them. Couldn't be happier for our fans.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Melvin and Will, you can both answer this. As shooters, as a team, you
guys have moments where you shoot yourself into games and shoot yourself out
of some situations. Did you ever lose confidence you'd have the ability ‑‑ I
think you were 11 or 12 as a team in the first half. How did you stay
confident shooting the basketball?  
WILL CLYBURN: We have a team full of shooters. And one thing about shooters,
you have to have confidence. Forget about making or missing. If you miss a
shot, gotta shoot the next one. That's what we have on this team. Shooters
with confidence.  
MELVIN EJIM: Going into the second half we know we didn't shoot pretty well,
but we knew we had confidence. Coach kept telling us these shots are going to
fall. All year we go through stretches where they don't fall and we go through
stretches where we can't miss.  
We kept our confidence, kept our composure, stayed with our defense, and our
shots started falling toward the end.  
  
Q. Will, the second half there you put the team on your back a moment or
two. Bringing the ball up the court, looked like you were really feeling it.
What were you guys doing differently or from your perspective what kind of
clicked for you there in the second half?  
WILL CLYBURN: Just in the flow of the game. Everybody was out there playing
hard. Everybody was out there playing for each other. I wanted to do all I
could to try to will us to a win.  
And my teammates helped me. They got me the ball. They set good screens. They
got open. It was a good team effort.  
  
Q. How do you explain holding them to without a field goal in the last eight
minutes of the game?  
MELVIN EJIM: We knew we had our backs against the wall, and we just started
playing harder than they did. In the first half, they played harder than we
did, and we knew that. We came out and we really had this talk in there, and
we said we needed to come out and play hard and get the rebounds and be tough
inside and not give them easy buckets.  
We came out and we did that, and we were able to hold them down.  
  
Q. Will, you talked earlier in the week about not going in your shell. Did
you have to remind yourself not to do that after struggling through the first
half and kind of exploding there the last five minutes or so?  
WILL CLYBURN: Yeah, I think it's all about just me growing up as a person.
Earlier in the season I tended to do that.  
I had a tendency of going to my shell when things weren't going right. But my
teammates and coaching staff, they stayed on me. I just wanted to play hard.
Even if I wasn't scoring the ball, I wanted to do something to help the team
through rebounding, defending, being a good teammate. I wanted to do something
to help the team.  
  
Q. Guys, it hasn't happened yet, but how much would you welcome a third
matchup with Kansas here?  
MELVIN EJIM: Two first games against Kansas were pretty tough losses for us.
And they're a good team; we're a good team. We felt we played them well.  
So we're excited to play them and get another crack at them.  
WILL CLYBURN: I can't wait for the opportunity. If they win today, I want some
payback. They beat us twice during the year. Probably games we shouldn't have
lost, but, hey, I'm ready for payback.  
  
Q. Melvin, what was Bubu able to do down the stretch that maybe changed
things for you guys offensively/defensively?  
MELVIN EJIM: Bubu has a great ability to be calm all the time. In the last
couple of minutes he calmed us down, was able to get the ball where it needed
to be. He showed great poise, and that's contagious when your point guard
starts doing that. Korie did that throughout the game as well, but when the
point guard starts doing that, especially in a crucial time like that, when
you're down, it really helped everyone to get into their groove and Will the
ability to take over and really get ourselves organized and in that groove.  
  
Q. Your jump shots were falling in the second half, but you also had a
pretty significant edge in points in the paint. Seemed like you really messed
with OU. Where did that come from? Why were you guys so effective inside as
well as the jump shot?  
WILL CLYBURN: Everybody knows we shoot 3s. Everybody's going to go out there,
try to guard that. So usually 2‑point field goals and trying to get to the
lane, they don't want to come off shooters, so it's a lot easier for us to get
in the paint.  
And I feel that was a strength of ours today, and plus our shooting in the
second half.  
MELVIN EJIM: I think when we started missing those first couple of shots in
the beginning of the game, we just‑‑ we didn't want to be complacent, with
just shooting 3s. We started attacking the basket, tried to look inside and
really going for offensive rebounds and trying to get easy buckets.  
So I really feel that was a big significant part of why we started scoring
more points in the paint, because we weren't shooting it as well. And then we
kept doing that throughout the game and our shots started falling, so it was
just playing off of itself.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How excruciating is it to watch your team from the bench when you go
through one of those long spells where you can't hit anything compared to when
you get hot?  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, the one thing I know with the shooting that we have on
this team is eventually the percentages will work themselves out. We shot them
much better in the second half, 6‑of‑14, and we're going to take looks. We're
going to take open looks.  
My job as a coach is to try to get those guys playing with confidence every
time they're out there on the floor. The one thing that I did like and that I
talked to them about is how we did attack when the shots weren't falling, and
if we continued to attack that would draw on the defense and if we made the
right play and kept our spacing, we'd get some of those open looks.  
Guys stepped the at key moments, made huge ones. They go up 13. We hit one
right back at them. Will hit that one‑‑ I'm sorry, Georges hit that one. I
knew eventually if we kept attacking and playing that way that we'd eventually
hit some and some crucial ones as well.  
And then to score 36 in the paint and we didn't shoot the ball at a real high
clip today is something that I think won us the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you went with Bubu Palo in the second half for a pretty long
stretch there and had Korie Lucious on the bench. What was the reasoning
behind that?  
COACH HOIBERG: The biggest thing about Bubu is his defensive ability. I think
he and Chris Babb are our two smartest, two best perimeter defenders. We
needed to string together stops. I was putting the ball in Will's hands at
that time so we could afford to have Korie out.  
And I talked to Korie. He went over‑‑ he actually came over to me‑‑ this is
huge for a leader to do this‑‑ and he said: You stay with those guys out there
on the floor.  
And that's huge for a guy like Korie to say that, that has the experience that
he has and has hit big shots to get his team into the Final Four.  
So that just shows you the maturity of our team, the leadership on our team.
And we went with Bubu and, again, he made play after play down the stretch and
also set some good flare screens which got our guys open and Will found him.  
  
Q. What did you like about the smaller lineup in the second half, Booker or
Gibson or anything?  
COACH HOIBERG: I was a little concerned with that. We go small at some point
during the game just because we were not doing a job on the glass. So I was a
little bit concerned with that. But second half, just with the effort we were
playing, I was confident we could hang with them. And then our ability to push
past was great. Plus Melvin stayed out of foul trouble today. And Melvin's the
leading rebounder in our league and he always finds a way to get those big
ones, including the big last one, and he knocked down the two free throws to
put us up three possessions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about with the first two Kansas games going to overtime, now
the job shifts and Oklahoma's in the rearview mirror, but what do you talk to
those guys about in terms of checking emotion or energy, or how do you want to
prep them for that game? It will be pretty anticipated.  
COACH HOIBERG: It's going to be a fun game. The first two especially for
Kansas were very fun. For us, obviously we came on the losing end, but they
were entertaining games. And we gotta find a way to get some stops against
those guys. McLemore went off on us the first time around, and Elijah Johnson
had about as good a eight‑minute stretch as you could play plus the overtime.  
We're going to continue to play the same way. Try to come out there and find a
way to get a win. Our guys, they'll be ready for it. I know some of them
played a lot of minutes today, but you get another opportunity to play Kansas.
Our guys will step up, and I'm confident we'll play well.  
  
Q. You've seen Will play through struggles quite like that before and come
through on the other side?  
COACH HOIBERG: That's the best I've seen Will. In fact, I was going to take
him out, and he's saying, Coach, I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it, so go for
Tyrus. We took Tyrus out and kept Will in and he responded with a big shot.
Will said that to me one other time this year, and that was against Baylor.
And that's the game he went off, so I decided to go with it and stayed with
Will.  
Not only that, but he kept us‑‑ kept alive some offensive rebounds, went out
and had three big ones that led to some baskets. Just, again, made big‑time
plays, not only scoring the basketball, but also making plays for his
teammates.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  66  
Texas  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Rick Barnes and
student‑athletes Jonathan Holmes and Myck Kabongo. Coach, we'll call on you
first for your assessment of tonight's game.  
COACH BARNES: Kansas State's really good. I mean, really, really good. I love
what they're made up of. I love their makeup. I love the way they do a lot of
things. They play extremely well together as a team.  
They understand their roles. They compete. They get balls, they get their
hands on balls, they come up with it. And Rod McGruder is a tough, tough,
hard‑nosed basketball player that I've really watched develop over his time,
and he is really active and does a lot of things.  
But they're really good. They're really good. And I thought we did some things
early, but we helped them too much. There's turnovers you can't have. You
can't‑‑ a team that's not going to beat themselves. You can't fuel that fire.
We fueled the fire about what we did with some of the turnovers we had that
just gave them easy baskets, put them on the foul line early.  
We knew they would make some baskets against the zone. But our zone was really
good enough, other than I would like to have seen us rebound a little better
out of it.  
But the turnovers, again, you look at it, it's pretty simple. They had
24points off turnovers. And we still don't understand the game yet in terms of
how valuable the ball is, how to execute when things aren't going well.  
But, again, we got beat tonight by an outstanding basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 3 ‑pointer by McGruder at the end of the shot
clock, gave them a double‑digit lead for the first time?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I mean, he hit an open shot. And, I mean, that kind of
changed the momentum. But we still had to keep playing, try to come back from
that.  
  
Q. Myck, you scored 24 against them last time. They seemed to do a better
job of helping out. What was that like for you trying to get by them into the
lane?  
MYCK KABONGO: They're a good basketball team. They did a good job. I still
think we got a lot of shots we wanted. We got in there and just not finishing
plays, and just taking care of the ball and getting in there was another part
of the game where I think if you take away those possessions, I think it's a
different game. But I think we did a good job as a team of taking the shots we
wanted, just taking care of the ball.  
  
Q. Myck, did you individually feel like you were in sync and in rhythm
tonight? Or how would you assess how you played individually?  
MYCK KABONGO: I mean, we didn't win. So it doesn't matter how you play as an
individual. We didn't win. It's a collective thing. We need everyone to play
well, and that's what it takes to win, and we didn't do that. So that's why we
did not win. So it's a team thing.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, if you can answer this, Texas had its struggles against
K ‑State in football, men's basketball, 3‑13 I believe since 2006 in those two
sports. When you guys see the Powercat, what comes to mind? What do you think
about?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I mean, just seeing another team we need to beat. We know
they're going to be physical and tough just like the rest of the Big 12 teams
are. But they're physical, play good defense. And there's no‑‑ we're going to
be up for a battle that night.  
  
Q. Jonathan, even though you knew you were getting Myck back later in the
season, was that string of losses at the beginning of the conference season
pretty much too much to overcome for the team to be successful?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I don't think so. I think we still had some games at the end
of the year we had to win and we needed to win. But I think at the beginning
we just were in some of those games. We just never gave ourselves chances to
win.  
So I don't think that led to us playing bad down the stretch. It's not an
excuse.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How big was that shot by McGruder and what did it do to your team?  
COACH BARNES: I don't know if I would say one shot in particular. I mean,
think about it. We were down 11, and I'm telling you, if I were Bruce Weber
and the three wide‑open 3s we got in succession, I would have been very upset.  
We came down and we had three straight opportunities with guys that we wanted
to shoot it, and we could say, well, maybe we need to take it to the ball, but
I could never ask Javy (Felix) to turn down that shot. I could never ask
Sheldon to turn it down or Julien.  
But our defense was good enough. Our zone, they made, what, tonight, nine 3s.
We've had games where they made seven, eight, nine 3s against our man. That's
not what it was.  
Again, I don't think that at all. I think it was rebounding, where we had some
chances. And those plays and people look at them as not being big plays. I
mean, those huge plays because it gives them a little bit of room, they were‑‑
again, our zone defense in itself was good enough, if we would have finished
them with some rebounding, but they're a strong team. We've got to become a
much stronger, more physical team. There's no question about that.  
But I don't know if I'd say any one play there. It's just‑‑ offensively we
still have guys that when things do go like that in that situation, the crowd
gets into it, they don't settle in and understand that's where you've got to
really be a team and you've got to really work. And like I know Jon Holmes
wants to win, but he comes down, puts his head down one time and goes in,
misses a layup, Myck goes in, misses a layup, those type plays.  
But you can't‑‑ you gotta play as a team. And I know we got a group of guys
that ‑‑ again, Kansas State, they don't need much help. They're a good team. I
think they're the best team in the Big 12. I do. I think they're the best team
in the Big 12.  
Now, whether or not they ‑‑ if you go back and look, they tie up for the
championship and can always go back to an Iowa State game there. But we'll
see. They're going to have to‑‑ they're set up to win a tournament like this
because they're tough, they're hard nosed. They get their hands on a lot of
balls.  
And you can't help them. You can't help them. And we helped them a lot
tonight. We've helped them in three games. I can go back and we made the same
mistakes. We talked to our guys about it. Eliminate a few of these turnovers
here or there, we can do that, and make sure we're going to get what we want
on offense.  
We will be okay. But we didn't eliminate them. Our guards, starting guards had
nine turnovers.  
  
Q. I think Myck had five of those. How would you evaluate how he played
tonight?  
COACH BARNES: The turnovers. It's always tough, because the one thing we want
to do is, again, we had a couple of turnovers that honestly I'm like looking
at the coaches and all of a sudden, Are you kidding me? I mean, after playing
this many games, I just don't understand it when we talk about rebounding,
talk about taking care of the ball, and we just throw the ball in areas that
we don't‑‑ again, I can't answer that.  
Just some of those turnovers, they're baffling, I'll just say that.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) came out early in the second half after I think K ‑State
scored. What did he do there?  
COACH BARNES: Well, you watched the game, right? We were in zone the whole
time, right? Didn't change anything. He came out second half, just ran down
the floor. And I took him out because we didn't understand what he was doing.  
And he said, I thought we were in man. I said, What would make you think that?
And he said somebody said it. But we wanted to stay in zone. And anytime‑‑
when he's in that lineup with Papy (Papapetrou), Myck drives the ball. He has
to get back. He has to get back. And he kept just staying in the corner and
didn't move back in transition. And you think about some of those run‑outs, he
has to get back on those situations.  
  
Q. Obviously K ‑State has a lot of veterans, but the difference from‑‑ I
know you're on the outside looking in, but the difference Angel Rodriguez has
made from last year as a freshman to this year as a sophomore?  
COACH BARNES: I think he's terrific. And I think he's going to have to learn
how to play without fouling away from bounds because it drive Bruce nuts
because he's so competitive. You think about some of the fouls he picked up,
he has to stay away from those.  
Angel, I don't think there's a coach in the country that wouldn't like to have
him on their team, because he got a great demeanor. I love the way he plays, I
do. We told Javan Felix, that's who he needs to play like, especially
defensively. He needs to disrupt things and get down and play like that.  
I hope Javan will make that kind of a jump like Angel has. I hope he makes
that adjustment and that jump like he did from one year to the next.  
  
Q. I believe you faced an opponent ‑‑ the same opponent three times in a
single season probably 10 times in 15years in your career. So it doesn't
happen a whole lot. But just what are your thoughts? Do you just write this
off, or do you simmer with frustration maybe heading into the offseason?  
COACH BARNES: I'm not sure what you're asking me. What are you asking me?  
  
Q. Losing to Kansas State three times in a single season and this might be
the last loss of the season. What's going through your mind right now?  
COACH BARNES: We've gotta get better. We've gotta get stronger. We've gotta
get tougher. We've got to continue to work harder. We've gotta. Whether it's
Kansas State or‑‑ Kansas State, like I said, big champions.  
I would like to have seen the team we had from the beginning of the year, but
we never did. We never got things going because of the situation that we dealt
with.  
But I'm disappointed. I think that when you have high expectations in anything
you're going to be disappointed. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed we didn't
win today. I think we could have won this game today. I think we could have
won this tournament, but we didn't because we again made the same mistakes
that we made in two other games with them.  
We helped them out. And they don't need any help. They're too good a team to
help. And I'm not going to take away from them because I think they're an
outstanding basketball team.  
But I think we're better and should be better, but we still haven't‑‑ again,
we played how many games? I can't even think. 32, what, 33 games? It's the
same mistakes. One stat jumps at me: They have 24points off turnovers. You go
back to the other game, same thing, second‑chance points.  
Those are things you've got to figure out along the way that you can't
continue to keep doing. And we did. And that's why we got beat by them three
times. But they had a lot to do with it.  
So, again, as a coach you always think‑‑ if you ever think you can't win every
game, if you ever start thinking, making excuses, you can't win. And I just
know that we've all gotta do better. We've gotta get‑‑ and I don't like when
people say we're young, this‑‑ I don't buy that. I don't buy that. I know
we've gotta get tougher. I know we've gotta get stronger.  
And we work hard, but we've gotta learn and understand what goes into the game
of basketball in terms of winning.  
  
Q. For 14 straight years on Selection Sunday you have heard the Texas
Longhorns name called. How do you put that in perspective to where you are
now?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I've always said that's something we've never taken for
granted. I certainly haven't. I think people act like it's easy to get to. I
don't think it's easy to get there.  
And we've had some times where we knew we were in. Other times we had to sweat
it out. Other times we had to play it out. I've always said that's gotta be
the goal. You gotta get there to have a chance to play for a national
championship.  
But I've never taken it for granted. Am I disappointed? I'm disappointed. But
we are who we are. We weren't good enough. We weren't good enough to make the
NCAA Tournament this year. And so with that said, it is what it is.  
But we weren't good enough, because if we were good enough, we would be in it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Terry Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24965)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech  71  
West Virginia  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Mountaineers of West Virginia, head coach
Bob Huggins and student‑athletes Terry Henderson and Eron Harris.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Either Terry or Eron, you guys beat them the first two matchups. Did they
do anything differently today?  
TERRY HENDERSON: I think they played harder, because it's a do‑or‑die
situation. Crazy things happen in the tournament. They just took the
opportunity and ran with it.  
  
Q. They got 14points at one stretch. Then you guys went on a long run.
Sometimes that takes something out of a team to have to recover from a big
deficit. Finally get even, and did that happen to you guys? Did you ‑‑  
ERON HARRIS: I don't think we were supposed to be down that much in the first
place, but we fought back. So it might have took a little bit of energy out of
us, but that shouldn't matter. We've got to play 40minutes regardless.  
  
Q. Terry or Eron, what are your impressions of the Big 12, first year
here?  
ERON HARRIS: I mean, I don't know any other conference. So it's pretty good to
me.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Bob, did it matter at all that this team that you have this year was
recruited for the Big East? I'm not saying they're not good players, but was
that a factor at all in the way you kind of had trouble getting traction in
your first year here?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. The fact of the matter is they were recruited,
they were all signed and on board before we switched leagues. But certainly
should have done a better job than what we did. That's my fault. I'm not
blaming anybody other than me. We should have done a better job.  
  
Q. Did you get a satisfactory answer as to what the two player technicals
were, since they happened on the other end of the court?  
COACH HUGGINS: I guess there was some talking going on. They told them to shut
up, and our guys I think said something after they were told to be quiet. The
truth of the matter is it should never happen. You can go back and look, my
guys don't do that. They have never done that. It's inexcusable.  
  
Q. Does the way this game ended kind of sum up this season? You did a few
little things like block the shot at the end. But you just never carried it
through to fruition?  
COACH HUGGINS: Our credo for as long as I've coached has always been get to
the ball. It's hard to win when you don't get to the ball. I think that's any
sport, that's just not basketball, that's any sport. And this group, for
whatever reason, is the worst that we've ever had at getting to the ball.  
Eron makes a block on the ball and unfortunately it gets knocked to them. I
mean, if it bounces over the rim, we rebound. And it didn't bounce over the
rim. We didn't block out either, though, which I guess sometimes happens in
situations like that.  
But as much time as we spend on rebounding the basketball and blocking out,
you would think that at a time like that maybe you try to get the ball. They
got a very fortunate bounce. It bounced right back to where they were.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech  71  
West Virginia  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We will catch up with Coach Walker. We'll start with the
student‑athletes for the Red Raiders, Dejan Kravic and Jordan Tolbert and Jaye
Crockett.  
Questions?  
  
Q. Jaye, just take me kind of through the emotions to win a game like this,
what you guys have been through this year, and just what's the feeling like
right now.  
JAY CROCKETT: All we're thinking about is the close one we had up there in
West Virginia and we came up short, and this time we didn't do well on that
loss we had up there. We kept fighting. We knew we had to keep fighting to
beat these guys. They're a tough group and coached by a great coach. We came
in and fought hard, and it was great to get this win.  
  
Q. Dejan, can you tell me what you were doing on the last play and what was
going through your mind?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I was setting the screen and the play was for Josh to come
through and Dusty to go up, and that didn't work out. Jamal had a 3‑pointer.
And I just played it. It's a 40‑minute game. Just played until the last
second. I saw the ball come towards me. I thought time was already expired,
but I just put it up and made the shot in time.  
  
Q. Jordan fouls out in the final minutes of the game. What are your thoughts
coming in and having to take charge of their big men and also the offensive
attack down low?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I knew I had to step it up. We had to step it up as a team when
J.T. came out. That's our main player. I mean, with him out, we're not as good
as a team when he's off.  
So we all had to step up. It was a team effort, and we're just happy we got
that W.  
  
Q. Dejan, you seem pretty calm. Buzzer beater, get your team into the next
round. Are you faking it right now or what?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I let out all my emotions in the locker room. I don't have any
more emotion.  
  
Q. What was it like out there? What was it like in the locker room
afterwards? You had a ton of wins this year, so it had to be ‑‑  
DEJAN KRAVIC: We thought we played a really hard game today, so it was good to
have a W in the end. When we got out in the locker room, we were getting our
emotions out, yelling and dancing. Ready for the next one tomorrow.  
  
Q. Have you ever hit a buzzer beater like that or no?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I don't think so. You see it on TV; you never expect it to
happen to you. So it was a crazy feeling.  
  
Q. Jaye, where would you say this team's playing right now? Are you guys
playing some of the best basketball you've played this year?  
JAY CROCKETT: Definitely. That was Coach Walker's goal from the beginning of
the year. He was saying he was worried about this team being the best team we
could be by the end of the season. We finished the season off. It's post
season. We're playing to the best of our abilities.  
  
Q. That said, obviously you know what the challenge is tomorrow. How quickly
will you celebrate and then get back into worrying about tomorrow's
opponent?  
JAY CROCKETT: I feel the celebration should be done now. We have to focus on
this next team. They're a great team, No. 1 seed. And they'll come in there
and they'll come hard. We have to be focused like right now until tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordan, Deniz, obviously, Kilicli dominated you guys a little bit in
Morgantown. What was the difference you guys were able to do on him and really
just kind of have your way a little bit more inside?  
JORDAN TOLBERT: We had to be a little more physical with them, try to keep
them out of the paint and make sure we got those rebounds and didn't give them
a lot of second‑chance points, and we did that tonight. Did a great job, and
that's why we won.  
  
Q. Jaye, just talk about the 3 ‑point shooting you were doing tonight,
3‑for‑3?  
JAY, CROCKETT: It felt great hitting shots. Our point guards today, they were
just getting in the paint and they were drawing two guys, so they were giving
me open shots. Our guards were doing a great job. I give them the credit for
those shots I was getting.  
  
Q. What are your recollections of your previous matchups with Kansas this
year?  
JAY CROCKETT: The last couple of games were pretty tough, especially the one
at Kansas at KU. And they're a great team. They came in, they beat us. So this
time we just have to go in, look at the film, make sure we don't make the same
mistakes we made last game. Just hopefully we can come out with a win.  
  
Q. Jordan, for you, where are you guys different now than when you played KU
the first time, I guess the first and second time?  
JORDAN TOLBERT: We definitely played some of the best basketball we've played.
I think the win's going to definitely bring us closer. We're just going to
talk more as a team and just do everything we can do to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said all along playing your best basketball at the end of the year,
that's the goal you set since day one. How gratifying is it then to play
probably the most complete game in terms of contributions from pretty much
everybody up and down the lineup tonight?  
COACH WALKER: Extremely gratifying. After playing the Texas game, I thought we
had a great chance to win the game even though we came up a little bit short,
but we're playing well. We had a good vibe in the locker room and coming to
this game I thought we had a great chance. I thought it was a great matchup
initially. And we really played them well last time up there. It's hard to
beat a team three times. It's a hint, but it's hard to beat a team three
times.  
We have to keep playing hard and keep playing together. And if the guys
believe, and it comes down to especially this time of year when it's one and
done, you never know what could happen. That could be an emotional uplift and
all of a sudden guys make plays you haven't seen them make plays all year just
because of the pressure of the situation that some people thrive in.  
And today I'd like to say the guys thrive in it and they played a complete
40minutes.  
  
Q. For Dejan to have that moment, he's been through a lot, sat out last
year, had his ups and downs. For him to get a moment like that, how happy were
you for him?  
COACH WALKER: Very happy. Peaks and valleys. I consider Dejan like a freshman
playing at this level. For him to have that moment where he made a
game‑winning shot, you have to be extremely happy for him. I believe Dejan is
going to be a really good player.  
Again, it comes down to the culture of our program coming down to us having a
great attitude for those guys. If his mind's in the right place, that's the
only way something like that can happen for him. So he stayed with it. And,
mind you, he missed the free throw. That would have put us up two. He didn't
put his head down, he didn't pout. He stayed with it and made the game winning
play. I couldn't be more happy for him.  
  
Q. Talk about the final 20seconds and your thoughts during that situation,
very, very similar to the situation you find yourself in Morgantown except for
being tied up instead of down by two?  
COACH WALKER: Well, it wasn't for Josh Gray to shoot a three, that's for sure.
We wanted him to drive the ball, drive the ball. We try to run the play, kind
of didn't break down, did a good job defending us, do a good job driving the
ball, tried to make a play, and we ended up getting a basket out of it.  
That's what happens at the end of a game like that. It's so frantic people, do
not want to foul. So anything going to the basket is a good thing.  
And we end up being the beneficiary of a putback, which is great, which is
rare for us, which is really good. I think that they were trying to get back
and ended up getting a putback.  
  
Q. Just the way you drew it up, lock shot, miss 3, tip it?  
COACH WALKER: You know what, again, the lucky‑‑ I would rather be lucky than
good, how about that. Again, it comes down to playing everything out. Playing
it out. Nothing good could happen unless you have a good attitude. There's
guys playing hard out there. You get a little bit lucky, I will accept that
because that's part of the culture of our program.  
  
Q. Follow ‑up, now you've got Kansas, so if you could talk about Kansas and,
hey, great win tonight; now you've got the No. 1 seed?  
COACH WALKER: That's part of the game. Again, that's competition. That's why
we're in the Big 12. That's why I like coaching in the Big 12. That's why my
players like playing in the Big 12. You've got an opportunity to play on
national TV and postseason play versus the No. 1 seed in the league.  
So there's nothing to run from; something to run to. And that's something
that, again, as our program ascends and as we look forward to the future,
these are the kind of games we want to be in all the time. So this is a great
precursor to what we believe the future is going to be like.  
  
Q. Quick turnaround for you, emotionally, physically. How tough is each one?
Which one's more difficult to come back so soon?  
COACH WALKER: You know what, again, my guys, every single time, no matter
what, they have a tough task. They come back. Again, it's all about the way
our guys think and the way they carry themselves. I believe it's a great
culture of belief in that locker room. I believe we're going to come out and
play hard.  
Everybody may look at the scoreboard, but that's not what we believe in. We
said that at the West Virginia game; that's not what we're going to do. We're
going to play hard, together, play smart with pride and leave it on the court.  
What happens after that, then it happens. But all we want to do is we want to
make sure we represent the double T with pride and look ourselves in the
mirror and know we gave it everything we had.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  70  
TCU  57

  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns and Coach Rick Barnes and
student‑athletes Sheldon McClellan, Myck Kabongo, and Julien Lewis.  
Coach, we'll call on you first for an opening statement. Congratulations on
tonight's victory.  
COACH BARNES: Really good win for us. Start of the game I thought our defense
was outstanding. We really came out and created some offense.  
Our defense got stymied on offensive a little, on the offensive end. We knew
it was going to be a hard‑fought game from the beginning. But second half our
zone was really good for us. And got aggressive. Started driving the ball,
making some shots. Did a great job at the free‑throw line.  
But I thought in the last five minutes we came out of a timeout, we called
timeout, took a quick shot that wasn't a good one, but after that point I
thought we really executed and worked the end of the game the way we needed
to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Julien, you feel this was just a carry ‑over from the Texas State game
and getting more aggressive in the second half?  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: I would say Coach wants to be aggressive take shots that we
know we can make. That's what we did the second half. And I played kind of
passive the first half, so I want to be more aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. Sheldon and Julien, seems like the bench got an identity the last four or
five games. I wonder if you could describe the confidence you guys are playing
coming off and giving them lift and getting a lot of points?  
JULIEN LEWIS: I think we're coming out with a lot of confidence. Coach asked
us to be aggressive when we come in. We gotta go in and do our jobs. But most
importantly it's the first half. The starters, they're going in, they need to
do their job for us, it's got to carry over to the team. The bench has got to
come in and do what the starters do.  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: I would say just bring the same energy, no let down from
the bench. We know the score. That's something that we do day in, day out.
Just want to be aggressive coming off the bench.  
  
Q. Can you talk about all three of your guards driving to the paint like you
did today?  
MYCK KABONGO: Being aggressive, that's all it is, is being aggressive and
staying in attack mode and knowing that when we're in the bonus, just take
care of the ball and trying to be aggressive. Just being aggressive.  
  
Q. Sheldon, what did you feel like going to the 2 ‑3 zone? TCU couldn't hit
much once you went to that.   
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: It was very effective. Got in foul trouble early. Went
zone. And with our length and quickness, we can disturb a lot of teams'
offense. That's what we wanted to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been nine games I think since Myck's been back now. Was there
some rust there that maybe between him and the team, maybe they just had to
get used to playing with each other now and you've got those things worked
out?  
COACH BARNES: I do think it was rust‑‑ there's no doubt. You want to put it
rust or feel or whatever. He's played nine games this year. He sat for a long
time, but he's worked hard. And throughout practice, the question about our
bench, I don't know ifwe've got a bench. We've got 11 starters. Every guy I
started at some point in time because of different circumstances throughout
the year.  
But I do think that we're figuring some things out with a full rotation. We
never got to do that in practice with Myck because he was always with one
group, and his group could change every day. But I do think more and more
we're starting‑‑ they're starting to understand more of a rotation that we may
have to go to.  
  
Q. Myck had a little struggle in Lubbock shooting the ball. Did you have to
say anything to him special to get his confidence back? Looked like he had a
pretty good game tonight.  
COACH BARNES: I don't know about anything special. We just talked about that
he got outside of himself. He's such a competitive person that when things
aren't going well, he wants to fix it. And he continued to get himself in
trouble by doing that.  
And tonight I thought he really let the game come to him as opposed to really
trying to early have some turnovers where again he was trying to force it a
little bit too much.  
But I thought he really settled down and really did some really good things
and things that you would like to see your leader point guard do, whereas in
Lubbock he didn't. He kept trying to fight it, fight it. Sometimes he can
become his own worst enemy because he's so competitive.  
I thought he settled down tonight. I thought he was engaged really from the
beginning with his teammates and with the bench.  
  
Q. Kansas State played you guys pretty good twice this year. Quick rundown
on tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I'm not sure they're not the best team, one of the best
teams in the country. They're the conference champion. And that's for a
reason, because this is a team that they know how to win. They know each
other.  
I think it's a team that really understands their roles extremely well, that
they stay together. And it's a group of guys that, again‑‑ I mean, what can
you say? They're the conference champ. And Bruce has done a great job with
them. They defend you. They don't give you anything easy. On the offensive
end, they really, really play well together.  
  
Q. With as well as Sheldon, Julien, and Myck are playing, can you talk about
Demarcus and what he's doing at the beginning of games with his hustle and
setting the tone defensively?  
COACH BARNES: He and Myck set the tone on the defensive end. Demarcus, he's a
guy that we just love what he's about. And we think he's going to be really
terrific. And he's not a guy that we're asking to score. He can probably score
better than he does sometimes. He's so quick, but he gets himself in trouble.
If he just settled in, take shots, as opposed to really trying to
overpenetrate.  
But he's an everyday guy. Every coach in the country would love a guy with his
attitude.  
What you see in games, he and Myck really get after it like that every day in
practice. And I think he's helped Sheldon and really Julien because they
watched what he's doing and they're even doing a better job on the defensive
end. But every guy‑‑ I thought Jaylen Bond's minutes tonight were really
important. We were struggling to rebound in the zone. We're getting things
that we wanted done out of it. But Jaylen came up with a couple of really big
rebounds.  
  
Q. Having played K ‑State twice then, what needs to change? What needs to
improve for you guys to get a win?  
COACH BARNES: I think there's a lot of things. I think we're going to have to
be a lot better from start to finish tomorrow than we were tonight. We have to
rebound the ball better. I don't care who we play. We gave up, oh, 15
offensive rebounds. Seemed like a whole lot more than that. But we've got to
rebound the ball. We have to do that.  
And they played‑‑ we're going to have to match‑‑ we can't just match their
effort. We're going to have to play harder than we've ever played because they
play hard. They do all the little things, and that's what it's going to take
from us. It's going to be a game where I think it's going to get down to
competing and finishing possessions and just fighting.  
This time of year is hard. Every game's going to be hard. You want to keep
playing. So just doing the little things. I mean, whether it's blocking out,
whether it's passing the ball, pass the ball well against them. Screen, if we
don't do that, you don't get many looks because they work hard defensively.  
  
Q. TCU hadn't been a great 3 ‑point team or free throw, but they were
hitting them for the first two‑thirds of the game. You wonder if you just
couldn't catch a break on stuff like that?   
COACH BARNES: Well, we knew we were going to mix it up a little bit. We really
thought about more zone earlier in the game because we wanted to do that. And
it's my fault. We're a good zone team. Earlier in the year we were playing
really, really well. We used it a lot early.  
I think with some of the young guys we weren't moving ahead offensively,
defensively man‑to‑man like we needed to, when we needed to come out of it and
play. So we really spent a lot of time trying to get better with our man
defense and got away from it a little bit. And we weren't really‑‑ we made a
couple of mistakes at the guard position.  
And tonight we cleaned that up, and it got better at what we wanted to do. But
they rebounded. That's what they do. They really attack the lane hard. And
what we wanted to do against the zone, because they pass the ball to the
middle, they're looking to pass from there more than they were looking to
shoot it.  
When we use it up there, at their place, our middle guy in the zone is coming
up way too quick. Prince Ibeh made one of the great plays of the game tonight.
He left the middle of the lane and actually blocked a jump shot from the
corner. That length is really important. We like playing it with he and Cam in
there as much as we can.  
But we wanted from the beginning to force them to shoot jump shots. And
somebody‑‑ they're going to make some, but overall you gotta play the numbers.
And the only ones that we talked about was knowing who the shooters were when
we're getting too deep and giving up too much separation, because we
definitely wanted to keep the ball out of the middle of the lane, and a couple
times guys got sucked in too much.  
  
Q. The win streak, since the end of November, December1st, what are your
thoughts about that?  
COACH BARNES: Like I told you at Lubbock, I guess winning two in a row is a
winning streak. So three adds to it.  
You know, I think our guys know that we're capable of winning. I do think that
we're going to have to do it. And we have to change some things, and I thought
we did in the last six minutes. I thought we executed and did what we needed
to do, make free throws. But we got the balls to the right people and we got
everybody. Couple of guys didn't have particularly great nights out. But
that's why we have a team and that's where maybe guys playing all year. We'll
see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  70  
TCU  57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with TCU Coach Trent Johnson and Kyan
Anderson and Devonta Abron.  
Coach, we'll call on you for comments on tonight's game.  
COACH JOHNSON: We got a bad start, the start of the second half, Texas went to
the zone. A lot of open looks didn't go down for us.  
They played well. They're playing well. They're real physical. And basically
the bottom line was they made open shots, we didn't, down the stretch. And
that was the ballgame in itself.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kyan, you started the game shooting so well. What was that zone doing to
you all? Was it affecting the shot selection that you were getting?  
KYAN ANDERSON: I think it came down more on us than anything. We couldn't
knock down open jumpers. I mean, they knew that, so they stayed in the zone.
And it just comes down to us being able to knock down open jumpers.  
  
Q. Devonta, you guys, I think, made your first 12 free throws, something the
team struggled with. And down the stretch, I think, you made four of your last
nine. Did you feel like as long as you guys shot the ball well from the free
‑throw line, that you could stay in this game?  
DEVONTA ABRON: It was all a mindset. Like Coach said, we just had to play
hard. Shooting free throws is just you and the free‑throw line, just gotta
knock them down.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You gotta be happy to a certain degree with how well they shot the ball.
But what happened there in the second half? Was it the zone that was causing
the struggles from the floor? You still think the shots were good?  
COACH JOHNSON: First of all, there's nothing happy with the looks. We have had
a lot of experience on losing this year. Second thing was they did a good job
getting us out of rhythm, but basically we had a lot of open looks and we
haven't shot the ball well all year, with the exception of certain people, the
ball just didn't go down for us, versus Kansas State on the road and last time
at home we made some shots. And tonight we didn't.  
It was more us than what they did. Obviously they're big, strong. They're a
dangerous team right now. If anybody's capable of winning three more, they're
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2013

  

### [Montrezl Harrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25090)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Peyton Siva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22009)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  78  
SYRACUSE  61

  
COACH PITINO: Obviously, it's a real special night for University of
Louisville. The final minute of play, first thing I thought of is what an
incredible group of guys I'm coaching. Then I thought how happy I was for my
family, and then immediately I thought of Dave Gavitt and what he formed, and
all of us in some way or another flourish because of Dave Gavitt.  
This was a special, special night. First half, I had to jump our guys pretty
hard at halftime because we were‑‑ our defense wasn't great because our
offense is quick shooting, and we're not a quick shooting team. So we are
putting ourselves in a hole by not moving the basketball working high‑low.
Gorgui was the facilitator of the game because, when we got the ball high,
Montrezl with his length, he has a tremendous wing span, could obviously do
much more than Chane Behanan and taking a step and going up.  
Peyton Siva now goes in a class with Patrick Ewing. Just a tremendous game for
this young man. I told the assistant coach before, Peyton hadn't played well
against Syracuse. I guarantee he plays well tonight. Very few young men in
this business that I've coached is like him.  
I'm really, really excited. Very sentimental about what happened tonight.
Tremendous grip by our guys because in the first half we were shooting
ourselves in the foot, and for a veteran team, we shouldn't have done that. To
go out in the second half and score 56 points off good offense, and our
defense came because of the good offense.  
  
Q. Rick, I know last year when you guys won, you cut down the nets. You
didn't tonight. Any specific reason why.  
COACH PITINO: You know, not particularly. I just thought we had four goals
going into this year. One was to win the regular season, and we shared it with
great teams. Two was to win this championship. Three was to get a very high
seed. And four was to win a National Championship.  
Now, we don't presume at all that we can get there. We just wanted to savor,
if we ever do get there, that one moment.  
  
Q. Rick, in all your times coaching college games, have you ever seen a game
swing like that with defensive pressure?  
COACH PITINO: Well, in order to get that type of defensive pressure, where
you're conditioning, where all that hustle is a factor, you have to take good
shots, and we took good shots in the second half. It was untypical of Peyton
and Luke taking some of the shots.  
Like I said at halftime, we were down 16 to Memphis on the road in a hostile
crowd. This was not as hostile, but this was a road game tonight. I was trying
to find red, and we found about 1,500, 2,000. But to play like this, I had all
the confidence in the world.  
Peyton said, you doubt us. I said, I didn't doubt you. I really didn't. But I
had to wake you guys up. Wake you guys up. If I swear they would have heard a
lot of cuss words. Thank God I don't swear.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Boeheim said that when they were up by 15, that's when you
really put the pressure on. If the score was a little lower, would it have
been the same?  
COACH PITINO: We just got after it more, trapped more, but because we were
taking so many outside jump shots, we couldn't get the press on. Press is only
a factor.  
First half we shot such a low‑‑ we shot 26 percent with half of those not
being good shots. And then the second half we started working the high post
and going high‑low, and then it opened up the corners, and then we started
getting our pressure on. You can only press on a make. That was the key,
offense to good defense.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the play of Montrezl. When you were down 16,
he got that basket and tried to get the crowd and everybody else with his
hands.  
COACH PITINO: You know, I'm always telling the guys stories. It's like I put
them on my knees and tell them stories all the time.  
I was telling them a story about at Providence, we're going, can't beat
Georgetown, we beat them at the buzzer, and there I stood with John Thompson,
ready to go at it with him, and I pointed at his naval, and I said, look out,
big guy. Then they just wasted us senior night by 30, in the Garden by 30. And
I said to the guys, don't worry about it. We're never going to see Georgetown
again. We're playing great.  
Then of all things, who do we face? Georgetown in Louisville. As I told them
the story, you know, the most unlikely hero, Delray Brooks and Billy Donovan
were carrying us. The most unlikely hero, Darryl Wright a man off the bench
wins the MVP of the whole region. You never know in college basketball who's
going to step up, and tonight Kevin Ware, and in the tournament Stephan Van
Treese, and tonight he takes over the backboard, takes over the game, and
Peyton and Gorgui allows him to do it with great passing.  
That's the beauty of college basketball. You can pretty much pencil in LeBron
or Dwyane Wade or somebody in the pros. But in college basketball, you never
know, and tonight this young man gave us a tremendous lift.  
  
Q. Peyton, second year in a row you guys played great in New York. You won
ten in a row. To head into the NCAA Tournament the way you guys are playing
right now means what?  
PEYTON SIVA: I mean, we have a lot to work on, as you saw in the first half.
We didn't really communicate well on the defensive end. We have a lot of
things to improve on, but I think for the most part our guys really bought in
the second half of playing defense and not allowing our offense to affect us.  
For us to come back from down 16 really meant a lot and really meant that it
showed a lot of heart for the team. For Montrezl really to step up like he did
today, just means, like Coach P said, someone on our team will step up big.  
That's the thing about this team. We don't need a lot of points from me or a
lot of points from Russ. On any given night, it can be somebody has a big
night. That's what Coach P has been pressing. It really showed tonight for
Montrezl going out there and knocking down all of his shots.  
  
Q. Rick, you said something about in all of the final fours you've been to,
you really felt confident, and some others not so much. Where are you
confident here?  
COACH PITINO: I had seven or eight first round NBA draft choices. So you
should be confident. But I'm humble enough at my age to understand that Duke
and Missouri had great runs last year, great teams, and they lost in the first
round.  
I'm not overly confident in anything except just taking care of each practice
and each game. That's what I want these guys to do is get better. If it
happens, it happens for this basketball team. I know one thing. You're not
going to find 13 nicer young men.  
Even when we lost in the first round three years ago, I've had the greatest
time of my life coaching these guys. Not for a long time. They listen to every
word you say, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir. It's just an incredible experience
to coach these guys.  
  
Q. Rick, I'm not a psychologist, but has this week been as emotional as I
think it has been for you with Jack Curran and this being the last ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: I think for Jim (Boeheim), me, Jay Wright texted me tonight and
said, hey, good luck. It's only fitting that you and Jim are in the finals. I
really appreciated that. It's very sentimental.  
Jim and I both know‑‑ we hope we can coach as long as we can coach, but we're
never going to do with in the Big East. To come back like that tonight, it
shows tremendous heart. I'm really excited for them they can be part of
basketball history. I'm really happy the basketball history took place in
Madison Square Garden. And I'm really excited we can do it in Dave Gavitt's
memory and now Jack Curran for Russ Smith.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could share with us, you were very exuberant out there,
what were the emotions you were feeling, and did you anticipate you could have
a role in tonight's game?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: I came in the game just being prepared for whatever coach
needed me to do. When I got on the floor, I just wanted to help guys with a
big lift. I was going all over the place, trying to get rebounds, either
offense or defense.  
These guys looked for me, and I just tried to finish for them. I just came out
hard and played my heart out.  
COACH PITINO: By the way, your free throws looked great. Even the ones you
missed looked great.  
MONTREZL HARRELL: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Peyton, you looked a little pleasantly surprised maybe with the MVP. Was
that the case, and what did it mean to get done against Syracuse?  
PEYTON SIVA: To be honest, I didn't think I would get the MVP. I wasn't really
focused on it. I just wanted to get the win. Syracuse has been my Kryptonite
for the last couple of years, and I didn't think we'd play them again.  
Coach had the confidence to leave me in the game this time, and I didn't want
to let him down. My shots weren't falling, so I tried to attack, and Montrezl
finished a lot of my assists. Even though I get hit a lot on defense, I just
want to point out to Coach P, I got a block tonight.  
COACH PITINO: Thanks for pointing that out.  
  
Q. Peyton, can you describe how Louisville, the strategy and the way that
the press gets applied, and can you also describe what you see in the other
team when you guys are feeling it?  
PEYTON SIVA: Our press is pretty much like controlled chaos. Russ, when he got
in the game, he kept telling us, we're going to press. We're going to press.
We're just going to run and trap, run and trap, and Coach P is like, no,
you've got to do it in a smart way. For a minute there, we were running around
the court with our head cut off and got a couple of steals.  
For the most part, we tried to pressure their guards. Michael Carter‑Williams
did an excellent job handling the pressure, but at the end we tried to wear
him down, wear him down. And it took effect later in the game. They were hot
in three‑point shooting in the first half, second half not so much, and that
was really big for us.  
  
Q. Peyton, to follow that, what was the moment in the second half when you
knew your defense was in their heads?  
PEYTON SIVA: I think at one point in the game, we had two or three steals or
turnovers right off the back, and we scored off of those three possessions.
For a team, everybody really stepped up at that point. Luke, you know, he
really showed his energized self. Russ is always energized. Even Montrezl was
running back and getting blocked shots.  
For us to really battle like that, it really shows a lot. We've got to
continue that momentum and continue to play that way.  
  
Q. Coach, with ten straight wins, is this enough to be the ones in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH PITINO: I would say probably. It's not a big deal. I would say we're
going to be the Number 1 seed of the number ones, but if not, it's no big
deal.  
Last year we had the number one toughest schedule in the nation, this year
we're top ten. Won a lot of games, won two Big East championships. So
probably, but it really is not a big deal for us. We'll let the committee
decide on those things.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you get down? Was it something you could pinpoint to
Syracuse?  
COACH PITINO: We were just taking bad shots. I think‑‑ you need length to play
against Syracuse. That's where this young man came in. You've got Gorgui and
him. And then we made a lot of mistakes by Southerland. We needed to stop any
attempts by Southerland, and we didn't switch out properly.  
I think by not walking through today, and we got them off their feet because
we were pressing a lot, it may have been a mistake by me‑‑  
PEYTON SIVA: No.  
COACH PITINO: But I think just good offense led to good defense. Poor offense
led to poor defense.  
  
Q. How do you prepare for the NCAAs with that, with this experience?  
COACH PITINO: We're going to go over the film. We watch a lot of film, and
we're going to go over the film and show the guys some of the mistakes. We try
to confuse, create total chaos, and but we got to do it in a smart way, and we
did it in a very smart way offensively and defensively in the second half.
That's a lot of points to score against Syracuse.  
  
Q. Coach, tonight in the awards ceremony, Peyton Siva's name was mentioned
with Big East royalty in terms of Patrick Ewing, and I saw your face. Your
eyes got wide when that was said. This kind of performance in New York, what
can you say about that?  
COACH PITINO: I don't know‑‑ why I was so startled, I didn't know only two
players had ever won that. So for him to get it, this is a young man that is
really, really special. Really special.  
When I said about‑‑ it was interesting what I said about Billy Donovan and him
being the two best people I ever met in my life, ever coached, when I yell at
him, I go home and feel terrible. That bothers me that I do that. So every
time I get on him, I walk away, and I feel bad about it.  
So I'm going to still do it though.  
PEYTON SIVA: Probably will.  
COACH PITINO: It's really special, though. If anybody deserves it, it's him.
It's an incredible thing. We had a senior night that was so amazing because I
started coaching in Hawaii, where every recruit that came in got little leis
and everything. And all of a sudden, Peyton gives a speech to the crowd, and
36 Samoans come onto the court with leis for the whole team. I've never seen
that in my life.  
For me working in Hawaii and seeing that again and the love the Samoan give,
brought me back to 1974.  
Peyton Siva big family. Incredible. Incredible. Thank you very much for the
coverage. We appreciate it.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Thank you, Louisville.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [James Southerland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23346)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  78  
SYRACUSE  61

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: This is Louisville's third title since '09. In '09 they beat
Syracuse 76‑66\. Last year beat Cincinnati 50‑44\. It's their fourth
appearance in a final in the last five years. For Syracuse, it was their 15th
final appearance. It's a Big East record.  
COACH BOEHEIM: We played as well in New York as we ever could have hoped for.
That's really what we thought about coming down here to try to get ourselves
back on track. Obviously, those 4 out of 5 games, you're not thinking of
yourself as a viable team in the NCAA Tournament.  
And to come down here and turn around what we did, losing to very badly the
first time we played Pittsburgh, to beat them, and to losing even worse at
Georgetown, to beat them, and then really we played well tonight.  
I think Louisville's the hardest team for us to play at the end of four days.
The same thing happened when we won the game and went overtime against West
Virginia, it's very difficult to go back and go against a pressing team in the
last game in the fourth day. That's really hard to do. You have to give
Louisville tremendous credit because they are, in my mind, one of the best
pressing teams in the country and have been.  
I thought that they were the beast team in the league from the beginning of
the year, and they proved that today.  
  
Q. Jim, Louisville is obviously a very good pressing team. Did your team
handle it as well as you would have liked?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Obviously not.  
  
Q. James, do you think you guys ran out of gas because of the four games?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: I just feel like we kind of made it‑‑ we didn't make some
smart teams at the end, but we kind of had the lead. We didn't take advantage
of our lead and move the ball around like we should have.  
  
Q. Coach, were you looking to extend your two ‑three zone a little higher
the way you did against Georgetown, hoping for similar results?   
COACH BOEHEIM: No, we played it actually about the same. We wanted to get to
Hancock. Other than that first one, we got to him. We wanted to let‑‑ Siva has
not shot well against us. Defensively, we were fine. We lost the game against
their pressure. They had 32 points off turnovers. They didn't have many points
off our defense.  
They had 22 in the first half, and 32 points in the second half, 56 were
probably turnovers. It wasn't anything to do with our half‑court defense. Our
half‑court defense has been good all year. It was good tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, how much more prepared, despite the loss tonight, do you feel the
team is with the wins they've been able to get tonight?  
COACH BOEHEIM: That's what I talked about for ten minutes. I'll repeat it. We
came to New York, not playing well, we lost 4 out of 5, and we needed to get
ourselves going. We beat a team we usually don't beat, Pittsburgh. We beat a
team, Seton Hall, which shot 50% from the field and 50% from the three which
nobody has done against us this year. And we beat a team that beat us by 25
and 10 or 12 in the two games we played them.  
So obviously we're playing better than we were then.  
  
Q. Jim, considering their depth that they have in their backcourt; is there
any team that can simulate what that's like?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think they're the best pressing team that I've seen this
year. In the two games we played, we had no problems against their pressure.
We had a couple of turnovers at the end of our game with Syracuse, but two of
them were out of bounds plays. They really weren't on trapping situations.  
So we played them twice, and we didn't have a problem. We won one. I mean,
both games could have gone either way. It was probably the worst thing to
happen to get up 15. If we hadn't played well and we were up four or five,
they probably wouldn't have done that, but that's what they had to do at that
point to go after it, and that was exactly what I would have tried to do, and
that's what they did, and they're good at it.  
  
Q. Jim, you mentioned having to play Louisville at the end of the four ‑day
run. Is going up against that press at that time, is it much mental fatigue or
physical fatigue?   
COACH BOEHEIM: I think it's‑‑ obviously you're tired, but obviously we made
some mistakes that you can't blame on just being tired. We made some mistakes,
and they made some great plays. They're a tremendous defensive team.  
  
Q. Coach, final Big East conference tournament, what are some of your
thoughts?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Just how badly we handled their pressure was the only thing I
was thinking about, and we've got to get ready and get to the airport. Those
were the two thoughts I had. All of the other stuff I've been thinking about
for two years, and I said it all. I'm not going to repeat it all again
tonight.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Syracuse, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Otto Porter, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23299)

### [Markel Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24980)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  58  
GEORGETOWN - 55

  
Q. John, can you go through the last possession, 14 seconds left, called
time. And maybe, Otto, you can go through what you saw and what transpired on
the play.  
COACH THOMPSON: We saw own ball on one side of court and tried to run Otto off
a screen along the baseline to give him the ball on the other side of the
court. They played it well.  
  
Q. John, the last game, you guys really shut them down from the outside, and
then that first half you hit that stretch where you made a few. What was the
difference at that point?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think that they did a better job of getting each other open,
setting screens and getting each other open. Through three games now,
Southerland has given his Gerry McNamara imitation very well. But I think they
did a better job of helping each other get open.  
  
Q. Coach, when Boeheim came out here, he said that they had made a conscious
effort to play up higher in their zone to neutralize Porter and Sparks. Did
you tell your players to work for Hopkins a little bit more down low. Did you
make that adjustment?  
COACH THOMPSON: Yeah, it was obvious. I said that after every time we played
them. You say the Syracuse two‑three zone, but he adjusts, tweaks, even from
the first game to the second game, they played us differently.  
So we anticipated they were going to play us a little bit differently, but
that's why everything was open along the baseline. Nate got a few baskets down
there. Markel was constantly open down there because they were‑‑ last game
between Markel and D'Vauntes made shots, and we knew they were going to focus
on Otto.  
  
Q. Considering what this has been to college basketball, fitting it went
into overtime. When that last three was in the air, did you think it was going
in?  
COACH THOMPSON: Fitting that it went into overtime, I think it's‑‑ yeah, it
is. It's a shame that they're heading down‑‑ it's a shame they're heading down
to Tobacco Road for a few dollars more. This is a rivalry that meant a lot to
our program and to their program and to this conference.  
I could give you my spiel about intercollegiate athletics is going through an
evolution, and this is just part of it, and you heard me say that. But it's a
shame that we are no longer going to have the same type of relationship. I
thought it was going in. I don't know what they thought.  
MARKEL STARKS: I'm going to say definitely again.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious, Otto and Markel, just not being in the championship
game, obviously, you carry certain disappointment, but having that extra day
of rest, having one fewer game take its toll ahead of next Thursday or Friday,
just how does that change preparation for you, and is that something that is a
potential advantage coming into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH THOMPSON: That's the wrong time to ask that question because I had not
planned on not playing tomorrow. So in theory, does the next day make you
better off? Yes. But we came here with every intention of playing tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Markel, could you just describe the atmosphere in the second half as you
guys are making a comeback and whether you feel that on the floor, get some
energy for it, or are you so blocked out?  
MARKEL STARKS: To be honest with you, obviously, it was loud in there, but I
don't want to dwell on the atmosphere. Obviously, we felt like we made some
plays down the stretch, some positive plays. We did some good things. But that
doesn't mean anything with the outcome.  
Obviously, we will learn from this experience. Obviously, it hurts right now.
But at the same time, we just didn't‑‑ we didn't execute when we really needed
to. I'm not going to knock Syracuse for their victory. It was a good game. It
was an excellent game. Both teams were playing hard. All the players that
played, played hard. The fans were into it.  
I don't want to take away from Syracuse's victory, but at the same time, it
hurts. It hurts.  
  
Q. Otto, when you go to Georgetown, what do you hear about the Syracuse
rivalry when you first get there? Do you sense the importance of it as soon as
you arrive or know about it ahead of time? What's the feeling throughout the
program when you get there?  
OTTO PORTER: I mean, it's Syracuse. Anybody from Georgetown will tell you that
they don't like them. It's the best rivalry in college basketball. They're
going to let you know right away.  
  
Q. Otto, Coach Boeheim called you the best player that he's seen in the Big
East at the small forward position. What does a compliment from someone who
has seen so much basketball mean to you?  
OTTO PORTER: It means a lot coming from him. It's tough playing against him
and his team. He just makes tweaks and things on his own. It's a great
compliment.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Georgetown, thank you.

COACH PITINO: It's very exciting to be in another final game, especially the
last year of existence in the Big East. So we're very excited. The young man
here that really has a sore calf, and I was just driving him, driving him,
telling him it didn't hurt, didn't hurt, there's nothing wrong with you.  
I know he didn't believe it, but he played through it. So I'm real proud of
him. He had a great game. Luke's given us a big lift offensively.  
We did a lot of great things. Made them shoot a low percentage in the second
half. And even the shots from three, the two bank shots from three would have
been an even lower percentage. Great defense in the second.  
If we were a little‑‑ I would say, we worked really, really hard last night,
very hard. It wasn't a great performance, but it was a very good performance
to get into the finals.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the lift that Van Treese gave you. Have you
played Van Treese and Gorgui in the same line?  
COACH PITINO: Probably not too much in games. We do it all the time in
practice. Steven is the best rebounder on the team. He gets people shots. He's
a great screener. He had five rebounds in ten minutes, so per minute play,
he's the best rebounder. I just have a lot of confidence in him right now
because he gets a lot of loose shots, and these guys have a lot of confidence
in him, which is more important than me, because they know what he can do.  
  
Q. Last year, Rick, you weren't supposed to be in the Big East Tournament
finals, so to speak. You were sort of a lower seed. This year you're sort of
expected. Which is harder?  
COACH PITINO: I just told Andy that Syracuse is in the same boat. We walked in
here losing 4 out of 6, and everyone said they're not playing good basketball.
They're not playing good basketball. With us, it's a little different. We
weren't healthy until the Big East Tournament.  
So all of a sudden, the tournament turns you around. You see it like with
Vanderbilt right now in the SEC, they're playing great ball. Sometimes
tournaments bail you out. Syracuse goes right now from not being able to make
a shot to on fire just because the belief in the tournament.  
And we know because we faced it four years ago, maybe it was longer now, we're
going to play a road game tomorrow. We know that. But that being said, it's so
exciting to be in the Big East final. Whether expected or not, we had to
perform. We had a Notre Dame game, according to some of the tweets that were
coming out, that we had to be ready. So we knew that.  
These guys read it, not me. They told me.  
  
Q. You held them to 12 of 31 from 2 ‑point range. How good was your defense?
  
COACH PITINO: I just felt we were at a couple of bad places at one time, and
Peyton Siva kept bailing us out one rotation after another. He's just an
incredible player.  
I sometimes don't give him too much of a break because I have so much
confidence in him in every phase of the game. Once in a while, he wants to
catch a break and wants Russ to get it up, and I'm all over him saying, are
you going to be the point guard or not? He's trying to cop a blow for one
second, and I won't even let him do it. That's how much of an ass I am.  
  
Q. Rick, in the scope of history, Peyton is now the all time leader in
steals at Louisville. What does that mean for the school?  
COACH PITINO: When you realize the talent we've had at Louisville, one of the
greatest traditions in all of college basketball‑‑ it's one of the top seven
traditions‑‑ that's saying something because they had so many great athletes,
so many great players.  
I say this, I keep repeating it over and over and over. The two greatest
people I've ever coached in my life were Billy Donovan and Peyton Siva, just
as people, and then you match the fact that they were both great point guards.
So I've been very, very lucky to have coached Billy, and now I'm very lucky to
coach Peyton.  
I didn't know you got that record, so congratulations. Let's see if he can do
a little better tomorrow.  
  
Q. Peyton, can you describe what it's like to be that good at stealing the
ball for us that don't have any idea.  
PEYTON SIVA: In all honesty, it wasn't‑‑ I just made the right spots at the
right time. More of the pressure from Russ and Gorgui and them trapping, and I
just made the right rotations from watching film and know to get to the
baseline of some place and getting to the right spot in our press.  
Those people kept telling me not to back up and keep running aggressive, and
that's what I try to do. The ball just came to me tonight. It's as easy as
that.  
  
Q. Peyton, it's four title games in five years for Louisville and your third
title game. I know that everyone's been nostalgic and everything, but like why
do you guys kind of own this tournament now?  
PEYTON SIVA: I hope we own it tomorrow. I think around this time of year Coach
really pushes us to become‑‑ bring our game up to a higher level. Throughout
the year, we're still trying to figure out our defenses, and we're still
trying to figure out our offenses and still trying to figure out our defenses.
Coach P around this time, we work so hard and condition so much that these
three days are just like three days of practice.  
We're used to it. We're used to running. We're used to getting up and down. I
just think that this style and the way the tournaments are played, Coach P is
really great at coaching us throughout it. A lot of teams wants to slow it
down, and he wants to push the pace.  
That's what he's been great these last three years, and I'm just grateful to
play for him.  
  
Q. For both players, what is it like for us who don't know, what is it like
to step out on that court and the arena that bills itself as the world's most
famous arena. How do you respond to that energy, when it comes to the
tournament, on this court in this arena?  
RUSS SMITH: This is my first time playing, but just being‑‑ I experienced it
last year as a redshirt, and it's just an unbelievable feeling to be out there
and the crowd and the history of Madison Square Garden. It's pretty
unbelievable. For this to be the last tournament of the Big East as it really
is, as the power basketball conference that it is, it's pretty special.  
PEYTON SIVA: For me, it's great. Playing in Madison Square Garden, I love the
atmosphere, especially since Coach P loves this place so much, we try to win
every game for him.  
The court is new this year. It wasn't like last year. So we noticed that right
away. It's just a great feeling. You love the atmosphere. You love the new
arena, a lot of it is refurnished, and you just love playing in it.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked all year about Luke getting the shoulder. The last few
games, he's 16 for 26, and they all seem to come at a crucial time.  
COACH PITINO: He's a cool customer when it comes to being on the court. It
says something when you name someone captain and he never plays in uniform.
That shows how much confidence you have in him.  
He had one of the worst shoulder injuries that Fred has ever seen because he
tore everything. Basically he played three months of the season, I used to
tell him, Luke raise your hands when you block out and stop blocking out with
your arms, and he said, I can't. Fred said, there's no player he ever coached
in the organization that could play as quickly as Luke played.  
He said, by mid‑February he'll feel good. Probably now after 20 minutes of
warmup, he's no longer in pain, and he can lift his arms up. He's a great
player. I knew when I watched film on him at George Mason, but he learned to
play defense now.  
When I asked Jim Larranaga, I said, tell me about Luke. If you need someone to
take something under pressure, he's your man. If you need someone to take a
shot at the end of the game, he's your man. If you need someone to grab a
rebound, he's your man. I said, what about defense? He said, he's not your
man.  
But he's really improved his defense. It's come a long way.  
  
Q. Coaches have different philosophies about how to address a conference
tournament, and I read somewhere recently that you felt this conference
tournament is a good prep for the NCAA. What is it about this tournament that
does it for you?  
COACH PITINO: I felt this way at the SEC as well. Different coaches have
different strategies and some like to rest. We're a well conditioned team.
What I love about these tournaments and I did it at Kentucky as well when I
coached there is that you get three days to really prepare. It gets the guys
to understand film and watch it in a very condensed period of time. When you
play Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you guys are used to focusing and
being in high pressure situations.  
So for us, I think it's great preparation for the NCAA. I always wanted to win
the conference tournament at the end of the year, peak at the right time
because your guys feel great about themselves when they get on the bus and go
home.  
  
Q. Notre Dame's the only team that beat you the last month and a half. Is
there anything special about this game? And then when they cut it to seven
with 1:30, was that a sense of deja vu from last time?  
PEYTON SIVA: Notre Dame is a great team. Led by two great guards, probably the
most underrated backcourt in the nation. It was definitely tough playing
against them. They match up so well against us.  
This is my third time out of six or seven that we haven't went into overtime.
To really get into them and beat them today is really something special.  
I know a lot of those guys. We went to camp together. It's kind of great just
to have the bragging rights for summer because I won't have to play them
again.  
  
Q. Coach, how fitting is it that it's going to be you and Boeheim in the
finals of the final Big East Tournament?  
COACH PITINO: I'm happy for Jim because his team was going the wrong way, and
now he can‑‑ I don't know how many more years‑‑ he asked me the other day, he
said, are you going to retire soon? I said, I don't know why Jim would ask me
that. He's asking me that. And then my wife grabbed him in a restaurant and
said, Jim, are you going to retire? He said, no, Rick needs to retire. His
children are all grown up. Mine are young. I have to coach 10 or 12 more
years.  
I'm happy for him. He's a great guy. He's like most coaches. When you lose,
we're not real nice to you, not nice to your dog, to anybody. But he's a great
guy, he really is.  
I have the cutest story about him that I'll never forget because his first
assistant coach, and I never forget this as long as I live because you've seen
him when he gets upset. Well, we won the Carrier Classic. We won it. And Marty
Burns had a great night. We beat Michigan State, Judd Heathcoat was the coach.  
He went ballistic on this writer Rob Lowen (phonetic), as he went through the
media room because he knew Rob really well. He used to work for a media
newspaper. And he took a stat sheet and threw it at his head and said MVP‑‑
because he found out Rob voted for the other guy. You voted for Ervin Magic
Johnson and he threw the thing. How could you possibly do that over Marty
Burns?  
Years went by, and I kept thinking when I was in the pros, looking at Ervin
Magic Johnson, I don't know how he could vote for him over Marty Burns. But
that's just me.  
I love Jim. He's loyal to his guys at Syracuse. We're happy for him that he's
in the finals, and we're excited to be in the finals.  
  
Q. Rick, you talked about Russ' performance.  
COACH PITINO: Russ can be very frustrating at times, but that being said,
you've got to give him his latitude because he's such a great player. Russ
is‑‑ I think Russ is actually going to be a very good NBA player because‑‑ you
know, the NBA is really a 15‑second shot clock. I know now they went to 8
seconds in the backcourt, 16 seconds with the shot clock.  
So you don't have a lot of continuity. You don't have a lot of ball reversal.
You've got to create for either yourselves or your teammates with a 16‑second
shot clock. That's why Russ offensively as well as defensively does it. Peyton
does it at both ends of the floor. That's why these guys are going to have a
great future going forward.  
So Russ can‑‑ he'll take a bad shot. I don't get really upset at Russ' bad
shots. I get upset when he screws up defensively. That's what bothers me. It's
mostly off the ball or a scouting assignment, but I let him have his latitude
offensively. Great scores. You've got to give him one or two bad shots and
just got to tell him to settle down. So he's a great player.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Louisville, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Jack Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23435)

### [Jerian Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23464)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE  69  
NOTRE DAME  57

  
COACH BREY: I love how we‑‑ we weren't very good in the first half, and a lot
of that was Louisville's defense. I love that we fought back and had some
chances, but just probably too many turnovers at key times. That's what they
do. They impose their will on us too much to really close the gap or think we
could win it. They're very good, very impressed with them. We certainly know
them pretty good. We played them three times in our last 11 games.  
But I'm proud of our group. I think‑‑ I didn't like our first half. Our second
half, I did. I loved our other two games. I think we found maybe another gear
up here and really at the right time with what's coming up next week.  
  
Q. Mike, I know you want to look forward to next week. What is it going to
be like walking out of here for the final time not being able to get to
Saturday?  
COACH BREY: I'm very disappointed we could never get to Saturday. I guess I
got to say can we get to Sunday afternoon now in the new league or whatever.
But I'm thrilled that we played in the semis in such a magical night here.  
So a little bit of unfinished business, but we'll get over it quickly and get
ready to prepare for next week. And I can't say enough about the Big East,
man. I don't think it's really hit me yet saying bye to O.J. and John and some
of the other people, Joe D., and the Big East has kind of made me.  
I've always said, I've been as proud of being a Big East guy as I am a Notre
Dame guy. We'll miss that. I do like the fact that there's some of those
people coming to this new league with us, but unbelievable memories of the
league and especially this building.  
But enough about that. What else you want to talk about?  
  
Q. Jerian, what did you and Mike talk about arm in arm getting off the court
like that?  
JERIAN GRANT: Getting ready for the NCAA Tournament. Coach expects a lot from
us going into the postseason, and we want to play hard for him.  
  
Q. Discuss the benefits of the conference tournament. You said your team
took it to another level.  
COACH BREY: Well, this conference tournament is unbelievable in this setting.
Again, we've gotten to the semis four in a row. We found something here that I
think can help us. We played with a freer mind. We shot it better. We're
shooting it better. I sure hope we can move forward with that.  
But I think there's a confidence coming out of here. We played well against
Rutgers. We played a heck of a team at Marquette last night on a neutral
floor. And this team is going to be a 1 seed that beat us tonight, we had our
chances. We were right there.  
So I think there's a lot for us to feel good about, that this tournament maybe
helped get us tougher and more confident for next week.  
  
Q. Mike, if you put it together and make a run, which you've been looking
forward to in the NCAA Tournament, why would it happen? What would you have to
improve upon from now?  
COACH BREY: We'll have keep‑‑ I felt for the most part here we were very
poised, more poised than we were during the regular season, and we were pretty
darn good during the regular season. We were mature about stuff. We didn't
hang our head as much on mistakes. Tonight we made a lot of them.  
But we didn't hang our head. We didn't hang our head when we missed a shot. I
kept saying last night it felt like you were coaching men, and I hope we've
learned that, I talked to them about that, because that's how we'll have to be
if we're going to stay alive in the next one.  
  
Q. And what do you have to do better specifically within your game?  
COACH BREY: Well, take care of the ball, but we played against a relentless
team that turns you over, and we're pretty good with the ball. We're going to
have to defend and keep it to one and done.  
I thought for the most part we did some very good things here defensively.
Rebounding has got to be a key here for us. Sure would be nice to keep
shooting the ball well.  
  
Q. Jack, why was it so tough offensively? Never really a sort of consistent
offense.  
JACK COOLEY: Their pressure on the full court started us off going fast, and
by the time we got settled in our offense, there wasn't a lot of time left on
the clock. Putting that pressure on it kind of helped to eliminate some of the
post feeds we were getting the first two games.  
All their defense stems from their pressure.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how difficult it is to prepare for that kind of
defensive intensity, that pressure they apply.  
COACH BREY: It's tough because you've got two small guards in Siva and Smith
who can get up and underneath you. Really, for Eric Atkins and Jerian, it's an
unbelievable workout to bring the ball up. They don't come out of the game
much, but against other teams, they can stay pretty fresh for the stretch run.
They were exhausted tonight. That's been the case every time we play them.
They kind of wear you down.  
Those small guys can really get underneath you, and they've got great
strength.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Notre Dame, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [James Southerland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23346)

### [Brandon Triche](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21890)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  58  
GEORGETOWN - 55

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought like last night we got our offense going the first
half, thought our movement was really good. We got James open. We really did
some good things offensively. Our defense has been good. It's been good all
year. Nothing been wrong with our defense.  
The second half offensively, we struggled. We just couldn't get the ball in
the basket. C.J. got some good opportunities, we just couldn't finish. But our
defense hung in there.  
We tried at the end of regulation. We're pressuring them. I thought we did a
good job on Porter, whether it's bumped him a little bit or whatever, maybe.
Okay. In the overtime, we did the same thing. We came up and trapped just like
we did last night against Pittsburgh, and C.J. made a great rotation into the
area, and it made a great play.  
Baye was just unbelievable tonight. I told him he's going to shoot the
technicals from now on the rest of the year. And Trevor Cooney, he struggled
this year, but we know he can shoot. We have faith in him. Players found him.
They got him open shots, and he knocked them down. He got four defensive
rebounds. I thought he played tremendously well in the first half. He was a
big part of that.  
But this was just a great win. We didn't shoot that well. We didn't score that
many. But they scored just enough. It was a really good win. Georgetown beat
us easily in the last game, and it happened once before. We lost twice during
the regular season, came here, and played them in the first round once, and we
beat them then too.  
It's hard to win three, but they're a really good team. I just thought tonight
we played a little better defense. We cheered up on Porter a little bit more.
We left Hopkins alone, and he did get some work done there, but not as much as
Porter and Starks would get.  
Again, a really good win. These guys were really gritty, and they hung in
there.  
  
Q. Brandon, a couple plays where you were able to get to the basket. I'm
just curious what in particular you saw. Was there an opening or something you
noticed in the previous two games against Georgetown that gave you that
opening, that opportunity?  
BRANDON TRICHE: I normally like going left. I think they was just playing me
and closing the left side off also. I figured I'd bounce back right. That's
where I got my two layups from just bouncing back right.  
  
Q. Coach, C.J. was basically shut down by Otto Porter the whole game and
then had those two huge plays, including the steal at the end. What did that
mean for the game.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Otto Porter‑‑ I hate to say this in some ways, but I was
talking today before the game, I think he's the best all around player I've
seen in this league. I don't think I've seen a better all around player. The
guy plays defense.  
C.J. is a great player, and we were going at him. We were going to go at him.
And he really couldn't get much accomplished against him. I think he's a great
defensive player. I think he's a great passer. I think he obviously can shoot
the ball, and he just‑‑ really, I don't see a weakness in his game from a
perimeter point of view of a guy that I've seen in this league over the years.  
There's been so many great players, but centers, power forwards, point guards,
two guards, but I don't think I've seen a better small forward in this league.
He's just a complete player.  
If we were still in this league, I'd be saying that to get him out. But we're
not.  
  
Q. Why would Syracuse walk away from all this?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It's got nothing to do with basketball, you know that. You're
way smarter than that. This is just to do with football. You know that. It's
just where everything is going. Just wait a few more years. Everything will be
gone.  
  
Q. Do you look around in the final minutes when the game's over and realize
just how special it is?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I was busy in the final minutes. I noticed one cheerleader
but‑‑ no. That will be trouble.  
I thought about it before the game, obviously, and you think about it a little
bit. It means a lot to us to get to the finals of this tournament. It means a
lot.  
But the biggest thing is we came to New York with this year's team, and
obviously we had not performed well, and we had a chance in a couple of games
and let them get away. So we needed to come here and play well. That's what
our main concern was. It wasn't defense because our defense has been good. It
was offensively. I think we've gotten better offensively.  
  
Q. Jim, given everything that this game is about, the atmosphere out there
and how close it was, you had contributions from Trevor in the first half and
Baye throughout, to get guys like that to really factor in, what does that say
about the effort tonight?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Trevor was a surprise, obviously. We've seen good things from
him in practice, but there's no question that this was‑‑ nobody saw this
coming. It wasn't like I thought, you know, Trevor Cooney is going to get ten
points in the first half, so I'll just put him out there. He got help and got
a second foul. I usually play guys with two fouls in the second half,
especially seniors.  
But Trevor, he hit that short jump shot, and he plays good defense. He
really‑‑ he hit four defensive rebounds. He really was the best player on the
court in the first half for either team. I mean, he clearly was.  
But Baye is a good player. Our other center was sleeping tonight. We couldn't
wake him up to get out there to play. So it was important that Baye stepped
up.  
  
Q. James, I think you tied Gerry McNamara's tournament record for threes at
16. Get a chance tomorrow.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Don't tell him that.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on trying to win a title and breaking a record along
the way the same night.  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: First of all, I just apologize to G‑Mac. Sorry, man. I
didn't mean to do that. At the same time, going to focus on what we need to do
and execute plays and play better defense.  
  
Q. For James also, you guys struggled at the end of the regular season
against some very good teams, but kind of on a downer coming in here. Can you
describe what emotion this team came in, maybe channeling it from Jim, your
coach, and some of the other guys like McNamara. What kind of emotion did you
feel coming into this?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: Everyone was eager to go out there and prove to everybody
what we could do. Coaches did a great job of staying on us. Also, we did a
great job of not hanging our heads this season. We did an even better job of
coming together as a team and just talking and making sure that we trust each
other.  
That's the main thing, trust each other and working on defense and talking.
Since then, we feel‑‑ we all feel like we're in sync, and we're ready to go.  
  
Q. Did you sense the importance of this event through Jim?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: Oh, yes, we all sense it. This is big time, the Big East
Tournament, and we're here and ready to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you just had four guys in double figures with no one with more of
13 points. Does that sort of team game say something about the way you play in
the Big East?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We have normally four guys that are capable of scoring between
15 and 20, but in this kind of a game, it's going to be a struggle. It's going
to be a defensive battle the whole game. I think‑‑ I'm just proud of our
effort and the fact that we made some mistakes and overcame them, missed some
free throws and overcame, foul a guy, put him on the line at the end of
regulation, made a couple‑‑ made a bad turnover after we got the lead. We were
able to overcome all that.  
I think that it all stems back to when we came home, the assistant coach is
gone, players, and I thought we had a couple of really good players. The
players were out early. They were really talking and talking to themselves
about it. They didn't like the way we finished.  
I thought it was more from the players and the assistant coaches getting them
going that enabled us to come down here and to play well.  
This is a monumental tournament for us to get our confidence back and what we
can do and what's ahead of us. We fully got that back. So that's why this
tournament is so valuable for us this year. We really needed to have this kind
of a tournament.  
  
Q. For both players, when you knew you were going to get Georgetown the
third time, did you guys talk about there's no way we're going to let them
beat us?  
BRANDON TRICHE: Exactly. I remember two years ago we ended up beating them
twice, and they beat us in the Big East Tournament. We just wanted to return
the favor.  
Just us losing last time by 20, that meant a lot for us to even get to play
against them again. Just reading comments from them, talking trash about us,
it made it even more important to win a game like this.  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: I kind of‑‑ I think we all kind of saw this coming. But at
the same time, no matter who we played, we're just going to go out there and
play as a team, and I'm just glad we're able to face them again and have a
chance to win a championship.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Syracuse, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

NOTRE DAME - 73  
MARQUETTE - 65

  
Q. Buzz, it looks like it got away from you a little bit when they called
that third foul on Vander.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought it was a critical play in the game. What was the
score?  
  
Q. 54 ‑52.  
  
Q. Coach Brey said after the game last night he challenged his four big men
to perform like they did in Milwaukee. Do you think that was the key to the
game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought they did great. I think it was 48‑50 with 7:03 to
play. Of the next 11 points, they scored 7 of them on offensive rebounds, and
then the call that Michael just mentioned. I think they had two more offensive
rebounds from that point. I thought those guys were great.  
  
Q. What was the difference of turnovers in the first half and then in the
second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think when you get embarrassed on national TV with 11
turnovers against a team that doesn't press, you hope that you respond in a
much more positive way, and I thought our guys did.  
  
Q. What's your expectations now, Buzz? You go home and wait on selection
Sunday.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We'll go home at some point tomorrow. We'll practice before
the selection show. Try to figure out‑‑ last year we didn't know who we were
going to play. Hopefully, on Sunday we'll find out who and where and when we
play.  
Either practice Monday and Tuesday and leave, I would assume, is probably what
it will be. Our kids will be back in school. So they'll go to school on
Monday, probably practice Tuesday morning, go to school Tuesday, and then
leave, I would assume‑‑ unless we're playing on Friday.  
  
Q. Your expectations would be?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Win one more game and then win another one. We have to be a
lot better than we were today.  
  
Q. Buzz, do you use this game as consistent motivating tool over the next
few days, or will you review tomorrow and do your best to get the team move
forward ahead and put this in the rear view?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, we need to learn from our offensive inadequacies from
the first half. I mean, we shot 60 percent, but we turned it over 11 times.
Our turnover rate was way too high. Our points per possession were much better
in the second half just because we didn't turn it over as much. But we have to
learn from it.  
The season isn't over. This part of the season is over, but we need to learn
from it and grow from it and then flush it out and begin to prepare for
whoever we're going to play next week.  
  
Q. Do you have a different feeling now with this team as opposed to other
ones where you've left the Big East Tournament in the past and headed into the
NCAA with a loss?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The last time we got beat, we handled it pretty good, which
was last year. And then‑‑ oh, I can't remember. I can't remember what happened
two years ago. Won one, lost one. And then three years ago, won two, lost one.
And then four years ago, won two, lost one. I think that's what it was.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the biggest difference between today's game and the game
in Milwaukee earlier in the season?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Cooley was much more involved. Connaughton‑‑ how many balls
did he shoot, ten?  
  
Q. Six.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He made six? That's pretty impressive. Last night, did he make
six or seven?  
  
Q. Six.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Six? I don't know that he took one dribble. That's really
good. I don't mean that in a negative way. I mean, somebody else created a
shot for him. That means you were in rotation, and he was standing there, and
he made 6 out of 10 balls, and he did the same thing last night.  
That's the thing. You have to guard the ball screens with Atkins and Grant,
and it puts you in rotation because Cooley and Knight, Sherman and Zach are
all rolling. So now your guards have to absorb, and then Connaughton is
standing out there waiting on somebody to pass him the ball.  
So if he does it on the four that he missed, how about they rebounded two of
them, and they probably scored both of them. They had 17 offensive rebounds at
our place. And they had 12 tonight. We held them to 40 percent from the field,
but they also got 30 percent of their points from the free‑throw line, which
is atypical for a Notre Dame team.  
And then tonight for us, we scored 15 percent, and we're not built like that.
We played 39 minutes until we got into the bonus. That's not good for us. We
could have played‑‑ what's Notre Dame's sister school?  
  
Q. St. Mary's.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We could have played them. If we don't get to the bonus with
one minute to go in the second half, it will be a close game.  
  
Q. When Davante was in the game, did you want to go back to Chris?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I did, and he whipped Chris. Then I went to Davante, and he
whipped Davante. We were trying to tag team him, and he just kept knocking us
out.

### [Otto Porter, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23299)

### [D'Vauntes Smith-
Rivera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24979)

### [Markel Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24980)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGETOWN - 62  
CINCINNATI  43

  
COACH THOMPSON: Questions?  
  
Q. It seemed like the team turned up the defense in the second half. Was
that what got you the win?  
COACH THOMPSON: Without a doubt. They have very, very good players, and the
first half, you know, we were letting them get open shots. Cashmere got hot
right there. We gave them open looks.  
In the second half, I think we were much more attentive. I think they only
made one three in the second half. And then our guys did a decent job. If not
a very good job actually, once we stopped the threes, guarding the
penetration.  
  
Q. John, your team's defense on Kilpatrick was pretty good. 3 for 12. Was
that the game plan going in?  
COACH THOMPSON: With them, I don't think you can necessarily say let's focus
on one person because, if you focus on Kilpatrick, Parker can hurt you. If you
focus on Parker, Cashmere can hurt you.  
So Jabril was on him most of the night, and I thought Jabril did a pretty good
job of not getting stuck on screens and chasing him, as they ran him off all
those screens, and ran him off all those on balls, and just trying to get him
to take tough shots, which Kilpatrick can take and make, but I think today,
unfortunately, they came out.  
But I think overall we tried to stick with him.  
  
Q. John, they came back from a 16 ‑point deficit and take the lead. How do
you think‑‑ do you worry about your team at that point, or are these guys‑‑
have they shown you enough that you think they're going to get through that
little patch and get back?   
COACH THOMPSON: The thing where I don't think‑‑ yes, you were. If you're up 16
and all of a sudden you come out. I want to say the first three, four
possessions of the second half, we looked extremely flat. But then we turned
it up at the defense. We started getting stops, which then helped our offense.  
For the most part, this group doesn't get rattled. They went to‑‑ they went to
a matchup, which threw us off. It took us a few possessions, too many
possessions, actually, to kind of get settled into what we wanted to do. And
then once‑‑ in the end, just trying to make plays, and our guys started to
make more plays.  
  
Q. Otto and Coach. Otto, I'm curious how your role has shifted on this team
since you guys lost Whittington? Coach, I'm curious if you can talk a little
bit about what he's meant to this team the past two months.  
COACH THOMPSON: I don't know that his role has shifted. I think that one thing
that's important, everyone likes to point towards when we lost Greg. But I
think this team would have progressed anyway. I think we have just gotten
better every week. I think that would have happened whether Greg's here or
not.  
Like I said many times, you look at what we've done since he got hurt, and
we're a better team with Greg Whittington on the court as opposed to being
home. But we've gotten better.  
Otto, obviously, has played very well during this stretch here. He's done a
very good job. On nights like tonight, where they were just keen on him, of
helping his teammates get shots. These two guys immediately to my right and
left have done an outstanding job of helping him and helping everyone else get
the ball where they need it.  
  
Q. Moses Ayegba exceeded his minutes in the first half. How good was his
game?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think he exceeded. The first part of the year, Moses wasn't
playing‑‑ the second part of the year he has played that much. His average
minutes per game are somewhat skewed. You go back and look at the last 10, 11,
12 games, it's probably consistent. I'm looking at the minutes right now, 18,
that's probably pretty consistent with where he's been playing probably the
last 10, 15 games or so.  
He gives us a presence. He definitely gives us a presence. He does an
outstanding job at the defensive end.  
  
Q. How much of an impact do you think that changing defense is having? You
played zone. You played man. You pressed.  
COACH THOMPSON: I mean, I like to sit here and say it's a great strategy,
really worked, but they're good players. They figure it out. We wanted to keep
them off balance in that, once they fall into their rhythm, it's hard to stop
them. I think we had to keep switching it up so they couldn't fall in.  
That's one of the things that probably happened in the first half. Probably
stayed in the zone a little bit too long, and they fell into a rhythm.  
  
Q. John, along the lines of what you were talking about with Kilpatrick,
everyone has been talking a lot about Otto for obvious reasons. What about the
luxury of having D'Vauntes and Markel and Jabril? Do they bring you help, in
this kind of game especially?  
COACH THOMPSON: No, it's key. I said to you, I said before, Otto's getting a
lot of attention, and he should. He's an outstanding player, one of the, if
not the best player in the country, in my opinion.  
But we have a very good team. I've said over and over again, during the same
stretch when Otto is playing well, Markel and Nate have been very, very good,
have been very, very good. And those three have to play well for us to win.  
Then you have D'Vauntes, who can come in and give us a boost. You have Jabril,
who gives us a boost. So we have good players. We have a good team. I think
they've done an outstanding job at both ends of the court of being unselfish.
Most of the time, people talk about being selfish, you talk about offensively,
but I think on the defensive end they've done a good job, helping for each
other, covering for each other, not just focusing on my man, but realizing I
have to help my teammate, which is why we've been able to win a few games.  
  
Q. I think a lot of people would love to see Georgetown ‑Syracuse tomorrow
night. Could you just talk about the significance of that, if that were to
happen. Also, if Pitt wins, you'd get a rematch in a game you guys lost.   
COACH THOMPSON: We're going to go sit out there and watch, and whoever wins,
the head coach is going to be really nervous about playing against them, and
we're going to prepare for it. I don't necessarily have a preference. They're
both very good teams. Obviously, they're both very well‑coached teams.  
It will be just as much theater but different dynamic, depending on which one
we play.  
  
Q. Coach, coming back to you saying that your team doesn't get rattled, this
is another group, another really good group with no seniors. What did you see
from them in terms of Cincinnati coming back and being able to turn the page
and get right back to work?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think, one‑‑ and this goes back to the latter part of the
previous question‑‑ they believe in each other. They believe in me. They
believe in what we're doing. So I think we knew what we had to do. We knew why
they got back in the game. So it was just a question of settling down and
getting back to our game plan, to what we wanted to do.  
  
Q. For Markel and D'Vauntes. Can you guys just talk ‑‑ with all the
attention towards Otto of late, has that opened more opportunities for you
guys in games?   
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: I mean, it definitely has. A lot of teams are starting
to key in on more, and I think more of the strategy for them is to try to stop
him and kind of worry less about the other guys on our team. Guys like Nate,
Markel, myself, we're starting to get going.  
You saw Jabril come in earlier today, and he was knocking down shots also. So
it definitely helps.  
MARKEL STARKS: But we're all on the scouting report. But, sure, like I said,
we all‑‑ the attention Otto is getting is well‑deserved, but at the same time,
knowing that going into games that he's going to have that attention, we have
to step up.  
It's not‑‑ we don't just say, hey, it's just Otto. No, we play as a team. We
play as a unit. We're going to continue to do that, and we will continue to
get better.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about defensive selflessness. Is this your
best defensive team, and is that a primary reason why? If so, what else plays
a part in making this your best?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think I probably want to wait until the season is over
before I make that statement. It's up there. It's up there.  
When you asked that question, my immediate thought was back to the '07 team.
We had Roy (Hibbert) sitting in the back. We don't have a Roy sitting in the
back right now. And so I'm not sure. Hopefully, we'll be playing for a few
more weeks here, and at the end of the year, we'll make that assessment.  
  
Q. For D'Vauntes, how has your confidence grown as your involvement has
grown and you've become a contributor on the court?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: I mean, I never really lost any confidence in my game.
It's just understanding what my role is on the team and understanding the
concept of our offense. Once I started to get comfortable with it, I think
everything started to roll from there.  
  
Q. For any of the players, do you see Syracuse and Pitt in the bracket
possibly in the semifinals. What's your opinion on that intensity that the
game could bring tomorrow night?  
OTTO PORTER: Syracuse, I mean, it will be a great game. I'm pretty sure they
will want a rematch against us. I mean, it will be a terrific game to play
against them.  
  
Q. And as far as Pitt, obviously, you're in for a rematch, but it's not at
your place, it's here at the Garden. What do you think about that?  
OTTO PORTER: Another tough game between two great teams. We'll see.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Georgetown, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Peyton Siva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22009)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE- 74  
VILLANOVA -55

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: We'll start with questions for Russ or Peyton.  
  
Q. I was wondering, did you hear about Jack Curran passing and just your
thoughts on it?  
RUSS SMITH: I found out, and it was really hard for me for about 45 minutes
when I was on the bus crying and stuff. A few guys I knew who were very close
with him, and I called the athletic director, and I found out.  
It was really hard on me. It was almost heartbreaking to think about it.  
  
Q. Did you dedicate ‑‑ I know you write on your sneakers a lot. Did you have
any message for him?   
RUSS SMITH: It was more internal because everybody knew about it. I just
wanted to win and do anything I could to win. Today was definitely Coach Cary
day for me, and it will be the rest of my life.  
  
Q. Ankle, did you just kind of twist it there? Did you get it retaped?  
RUSS SMITH: I twisted it pretty bad, and coach taped it. I went back out there
and put everything aside. We've got a Big East game going on. Just tried to
finish out strong.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Welcome to Coach Pitino.  
COACH PITINO: Our guys had a big treat. President Clinton came back to say
hello. We got the chance to take a lot of pictures. It was a big treat for our
guys. Mayor of Providence and everybody. It was a lot of fun.  
These two guys did a tremendous job tonight. I told Russ‑‑ Russ had a heavy
heart tonight, as I'm sure he mentioned. A good friend of mine and obviously
Russ' mentor, Coach Curran, one of the legendary high school coaches of all
time, for two sports, not only for basketball but for baseball, and I just
told Russ we have to play this tournament in the NCAA for Coach Curran. Coach
Curran really enjoyed coaching Russ, and I really enjoyed coaching Russ, but
we both knew what he was all about. So it's very exciting that Russ could have
that type of game and honor his coach like that.  
This young man to my left is one of the best leaders in college basketball.
These guys did a tremendous job. We lost last time around for three reasons.
We missed free throws, didn't guard the three‑point line, and didn't cause
enough havoc. Tonight we did all three. We wanted to keep them from shooting
free throws. We wanted to keep them from shooting threes, and we did a very
good job of doing that.  
  
Q. Rick, 18 turnovers in the first half. Was there anything you would have
done differently, or is this just a higher level?  
COACH PITINO: I think we were just very intense. We were really quick. We're
fast. It was an all time high, including the deflection chart. We keep a chart
that, if we get 35 to 40 deflections and we don't give up an inordinate amount
of threes, we're going to win a number of games. To get 40 is what I'm saying.
We had 58 tonight.  
  
Q. What did you have at halftime?  
COACH PITINO: 38. And that's never happened in my 80 years of coaching. So it
was an incredible thing to witness. Very, very active.  
  
Q. Can you guys just share a little bit about what Bill Clinton said in
there and what were your thoughts again?  
COACH PITINO: He was just telling a lot of stories. I knew him back at
Kentucky, when he came to the University of Kentucky, I was able to introduce
him on campus. At that time, Republicans were going to win the state and
overturned it, and he got elected by, I think, two percentage points.  
Since that point, we've been very friendly toward each other. He was telling a
lot of stories not only about basketball, but Senegal where Gorgui is from.
He's a walking encyclopedia. It was very enjoyable for the guys.  
  
Q. You had a lot of forced turnovers and a lot of misses. What did you tell
the guys before the game defense ‑wise?   
COACH PITINO: We've been a good defensive team. We know we have to win. We
shot the ball well tonight. We did a lot of good things. When we went down
there, it was our poorest game of the season. That's because Villanova made it
the poorest game of the season with the way they played.  
So we studied that film, and we knew where we made our mistakes. A backcourt
played tremendous, and we got a tremendous lift from Stephan Van Treese
because it wasn't Gorgui's night. He's very fresh going into tomorrow.  
  
Q. You had seven guys with at least one steal. Talk about the contribution
from those other guys besides these two.  
COACH PITINO: I think we win with our defense. We're a good offensive team,
and tonight‑‑ we're not a great three‑point shooting team. That's probably‑‑ I
know you pick up the stat sheet tonight and say, well, you shot the three. We
took all good threes.  
Any time you can drive and you can step into the shot, they're all good
threes. Our offense has gradually caught up to our defense. Guys like Luke
Hancock, and certainly Russ is one of the prolific scorers in college
basketball right now. Peyton has got his jump shot online. He's a very, very
confident young man as well.  
  
Q. Russ, even before the emotions that came with the news today, were you
feeling like you wanted to have a better game at Madison Square Garden than
you had the last time that you were here or in the championship game last
year?  
RUSS SMITH: Me and Coach talk a lot about performing on the road since I've
been home and made‑‑ I don't know. I can't remember the games. I haven't
really played too well on the road.  
Coach talked to me, and we go over scouting, and I have to look at the open
sections. We watched the Villanova game, and I've seen all the mistakes I
made. Tonight I just tried to correct them and look for my teammates on the
drive and just improve.  
I think that was the main focus tonight. It wasn't so much the guard just
playing good or anything, it was so much the win and what I got to do from a
scouting standpoint to help the team win.  
  
Q. Peyton, can you talk about the defensive effort. It was 38 deflections in
the first half, especially the first half, how good you guys were.  
PEYTON SIVA: The whole thing tonight was just to be aggressive on offense and
defense. Last time they bullied us around, and Coach Pit told us we've got to
stop learning from our losses and learn the first time.  
Tonight we came out with a great intensity. We took away their 3‑point shot
and that's what hurt us last time. We just tried to pick up from our
deflections. When we guard deflections, 20‑plus, 30‑plus in a game, that's
when we feel like we can win. Tonight everybody did a great job. V.T. came off
the bench and got eight rebounds for us, and everybody just played great
tonight.  
  
Q. I was just wondering to share your thoughts on Jack and what do you think
his legacy will be.  
COACH PITINO: Well, I got a chance in my life, one of the great thrills was
spending time with Coach Wooden on a number of occasions, and I played golf
with Jack about four or five times. I knew a lot of his players back from the
Bobby Carver days and those guys. I went to his camp, friendship farm, I think
it was called back then in New York. I went to his camp for three years.  
He was just‑‑ he had all the great traits of a great leader. Very humble,
great teacher, very wise man. It was always about the players with him. He had
a lot of what I witnessed with Coach Wooden. They were very similar
personalities. They were great teachers. Although he was a great basketball
and baseball coach, he probably was even a better gym teacher. He was just a
great teacher and a great person. Never lost his passion and love.  
I don't know how he did it. He led a blessed life, and a lot of people are
going to miss him greatly.  
  
Q. Peyton, when you're creating as much havoc as you were tonight, beyond
the stats, is there anything that tells you the other team is feeling the
pressure the way that they handled the ball, et cetera?  
PEYTON SIVA: I think we just did a good job of really trapping and
communicating. It was a couple of possessions where our communication was
really on point, where we would switch to ball screens. We made the right
rotations, and I think scouting and watching on film, we made the right
rotations of going inside and playing that.  
So I think from that point, scouting and watching film really helped us out a
lot and knowing what they were going to do and the pressure that Russ and
other guys put on them and really helped us out.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier, Coach Boeheim mentioned the final four teams in this
tournament starting tomorrow is the best in the country and felt that any one
of the four teams could really go far to the national title. Do you feel that
way too?  
COACH PITINO: I don't know who the fourth team is going to be. The way I look
at the NCAA Tournament is a lot different than everybody. We had three times
in the Final Four where it was totally unexpected. There's only been one time
in my life where I thought we could go to a final four and win it all. The
other five times, I never thought about getting there. Just played it one game
at a time.  
I think the Big East has three or four teams. I think Gonzaga, I watched them
play‑‑ I have a lot of respect for Davidson. I watched them really, really
beat Davidson bad in a lot of phases of the game, and you don't do that to a
Bob McKillop team too often. There's a lot of teams that could do it, and
certainly Jim's right in that regard.  
When we shoot the ball like we do tonight and share the basketball like that,
we're a pretty tough team because of our defense, but it's not always the
case. What I got on the guys at halftime is don't let your scoring dictate how
you play this game because Russ the other night against the last game we
played, they made up their mind they were going to stop Russ Smith. I said,
Russ, that's scouting. You've got to make up your mind that night to get other
people the ball.  
There's only been a few players in my lifetime like Michael Jordan and Kobe
Bryant, after the scouting was over, who could still score. I said, you've got
to understand. It wasn't you having a bad game. They decided to stop Russ
Smith. And tonight he was brilliant because he passed the ball, he played
awesome defense, he got after them, and he shot the ball well, made great
decisions, even when a couple of his turnovers were pivoting and trying to get
people the ball.  
  
Q. Russ, you said that you learned about Coach Curran's death this morning.
Could you tell us a little bit about who told you, where they told you, how
they told you.  
RUSS SMITH: Every time I'm in town, I'm an alumni of Archbishop Malloy, and I
always love to go back there, communicate with the guys. I was giving them a
call, calling Coach McCleary and how is he doing. What's the schedule looking
like, and maybe him, Coach, and a few others could make the game.  
Then he told me, and I paused for a second. It was really hard for me to take
it all in because a guy like Coach, obviously, he's old age, but you just
wouldn't think twice of him ever passing. It was really, really hard for me to
like just focus ahead and to just put it all together.  
I really have no words, but I miss him a lot. I'm going to miss him. He was
everything to me, and to my mom, my family. He treated everyone with respect.
He taught me a lot of things, phrases, quotes, and one of the main ones was
the road to success is always under construction, and I'll keep that. I always
say that, and I'll always keep that to myself, and I always work around that
little quote.  
He's just a great guy.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Louisville, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [JayVaughn Pinkston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25008)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

LOUISVILLE- 74  
VILLANOVA - 55

  
COACH WRIGHT: I just want to congratulate Louisville. They played an
outstanding game. Their guards completely dominated the game. 18 turnovers in
the first half was just a credit to them.  
The game was allowed to be played very physical. It was very fair. We just did
not respond to the physical play. That's what happens, you turn the ball over
like that.  
But you've got to give them credit. I thought they were well prepared. A lot
of things we did against them the first time in the press, they took away. I
think we didn't physically respond well enough, and that was the difference.  
  
Q. Jay, we're in the time where referees do let players decide the game.
Last five ‑game stretch, I think you're averaging 17, 18 turnovers. Obviously,
it's to say a worrisome trend. As you go forward, how do you address it?   
COACH WRIGHT: That's our weakness as a team. We don't have that jet guard that
can just break down a defense. So we've got to do it. We've got to do it
bypassing and precision, execution, and that's been our consistency‑‑ our
inconsistency this year is sometimes we execute, and that's very difficult to
do.  
If you've got a really good quick guard that can make great decisions and
break down a press, that's easier to do, but if you don't have that guy,
you've got to really execute, and we have done it at times. The first time we
played Louisville, we did it well. I thought we did a decent job the second
half last night, but we did not do it today. You start off the game that way,
and you make 18 turnovers in the first half, you just‑‑  
It's a big difference coming out and playing from behind nine points in the
second half than it being a tie game and then pressing you and the shots they
take, there's a big difference. I thought that was them getting that nine
completely at halftime and still being able to press was big.  
  
Q. Jay, when Rick was in here, he mentioned how turning you over and keeping
you off the foul line was part of their game. Was that more of their guard
getting up on you and pressuring you and making you uncomfortable?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, we could‑‑ once you get behind on them, they're not the
kind of team you can press and turnover. They've got great guards and great
quickness. The first half was the key. They didn't allow us to get the ball up
into the front court where we could get the ball inside and get to the foul
line.  
J.P. (JayVaughn Pinkston) and Mouph (Mouphtaou Yarou) here, when we got the
ball inside, were pretty effective. We couldn't get the ball over half‑court.
It was their guards. Their guards were in us, man. They did a heck of job.
That takes a lot of effort. They were very, very good.  
  
Q. Jay, so what is the next three days going to be like? What kind of a wait
will it be for you guys, and what do you do?  
COACH WRIGHT: Mike, I think we've got a good enough resume, but I honestly
haven't been able to‑‑ I haven't followed it to know it well enough. So I
will‑‑ believe it or not, I have people around us that follow this very
closely. I'll get all the info about where we are. We have class tomorrow. So
we'll try to get back tomorrow morning early so we'll get the class, and these
guys will get a day off tomorrow. We'll regroup on Saturday, and then we'll
see where we are.  
I know we'll be playing in some postseason, and this group loves each other.
We want to keep playing, keep getting better. This one, you got to swallow.
This is tough to take, but it's part of life. It's part of college basketball.
Learn a lot from it.  
  
Q. Jay, you've talked all year about how young your guards are, how at times
you have to kind of ride the roller coaster. When you only have 24 hours to
prepare for a defense like that, how difficult was it? Do you think their
inexperience showed tonight?  
COACH WRIGHT: Their inexperience definitely showed. I think our inexperience
as a team definitely showed. I talked about that all year.  
When your 5 man is your leader, he can't go back and get the ball and bring
the ball back up the floor. He needs perimeter people to get him the ball, and
that's where we're inexperienced.  
That's been our‑‑ it's who we are. And I really thought playing St. John's
would prepare us better. As good as St. John's was in their press, these guys
were another level.  
  
Q. On Monday, you mentioned JayVaughn was sort of ‑‑ not concerned, but just
coming back to New York, you had some issues with players on that. How do you
think he performed the last two days?   
COACH WRIGHT: I think he was great. I think he learned a great lesson these
last two days. I think he played his two best games in New York.  
In relation to how good of a player he is, he's had horrendous games here.
That probably isn't even the right word. He hit a seven turnover game here.
It's just because he gets excited to be back here, and he loves New York. And
he really concentrated these last two games on his defense and rebounding and
playing solid and not worried about where he was. I thought he learned a great
lesson. He did very well in these two games.  
He did a lot of little things defensively that don't show up in the stats. He
did a great job on Sampson last night, did a real good job tonight in terms of
getting charges. That's one of the positives we can take out of the
tournament. I think he's grown a lot, and he's important to our team.  
  
Q. Coach, is there some sense of relief now that the few games you'll be
playing now are against teams that don't know?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think we'll get to that. I've got to be honest with you, I
can't feel that right now. This one‑‑ look, we have played well against good
teams. We've played‑‑ actually, against most good teams we played, we played
really well. It still stings that we didn't perform tonight right now.  
This team could win a National Championship. Louisville, this is a really good
team. You take their talent and then put on top of that the fact that they've
been there, that experience is so valuable. If you look at all of our teams
that have advanced, the year before, when we went to final eight, the year
before we went to Sweet 16, the year before we went to Final Four, the year
before we went to Sweet 16. They get that. They went to the Final Four,
they're going back through this again. This is a very good team.  
We lost to a really good team. I'm not as disappointed with losing as I am in
our performance in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, at this time of the year with so much youth on the team, is this
where you expected your team to be? You talk a little bit about, to the extent
you are where you wanted to be, and what surprised you, if anything?  
COACH WRIGHT: I'm very pleased with this team. Very pleased. Disappointed in
the performance tonight, we pleased with where the leadership of this team is,
where the growth of this team has come to. I'm trying‑‑ we're trying to teach
them the urgency that you have to have at this level.  
Adults, we understand it because we're older, but when you're young, you don't
understand that urgency, and we're trying to teach them that. This was another
failure, I think, for us. Not getting that through them. After a couple good
wins, you've got to put another one together, you can't relax. That's where
we've got to grow.  
  
Q. JayVaughn, you faced pressure before, but this seemed to be a little bit
more intense tonight. Now, was it, and on top of that, how do you bounce back
from this?  
JAYVAUGHN PINKSTON: I think they played well. They just turned us over a lot.
But now we're just going to have to get back into the gym and keep getting
better working on fundamentals and playing Villanova basketball.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Villanova, thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  62  
PITTSBURGH  59

  
COACH DIXON: All right. Obviously, disappointed in the loss, but proud of how
our guys fought back in the second half. We obviously dug a hole for ourselves
in the first half, but I could see how hard we played and the effort.  
We out rebounded by 16. We seemed to get every loose ball. We were on the
floor and showed a lot for us to come out and play like we did in the second
half. So to be down by 13, come back, and be in the situation we were, down
one with the free throw. Obviously, we battled and fought. Out rebounded by 12
when it was all said and done. So I could see the effort, the fight in our
team, as always.  
Simply put, the first half we didn't play our defense. That dug the hole for
us. That's why where we were where we're at and why we weren't able to make up
the 13‑point deficit.  
I saw a lot from our guys. I saw what our team is made of in that second half,
and we're going to get ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, what happened at the end of the first half? You had a foul to
give. You didn't give it, and they end up hitting a three. That's the
difference in the game.  
COACH DIXON: When we fouled before, on the play before, you know that.
Obviously, it just didn't go the way we wanted it to go. We had the foul to
give, and he bounced one in.  
So, obviously, just didn't go the way we wanted it to.  
  
Q. Jamie, what, if anything, did you guys do better in the second half to
limit Southerland's touches? Coach Boeheim talked about how a lot of his shots
were contested.  
COACH DIXON: Well he only had ten shots and he obviously made treys, but he
got one in the zone, the one time we played zone, and he had transition.
Simply put, our transition defense wasn't good in the first half, and that's
how he got open looks. When he got matched up on different guys, our 5 was
guarding him on the one play.  
So it was different reasons for each one, and we didn't guard him well enough
coming off a play that we knew, have seen run over and over again. We didn't
guard him twice on that play.  
So we did a better job‑‑ obviously, we did much better in the second half and
put us in position to win. There's no question that was our team in the second
half. That's how we play. But the problem is you've got to play the right way
for two halves, and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of intensity in this game, as always, between you and
Syracuse. You guys are moving together to the ACC next year. What can you take
from this game, and what are your feelings about the Big East moving along?  
COACH DIXON: It's great. Obviously, we wanted to win this tournament, and now
we're going to be going home, and it's disappointing. I think that was really
the first‑‑ the main focus of ours was we were here to win today and win this
tournament.  
We've gotten better as the year's gone on. We've improved. I think we're a
team that‑‑ I think we're the team you saw in the second half, but the first
half was not our defense, just to put it real clear.  
We're focused on winning this tournament, and we're focused on winning this
game, and now we've got to go focus on getting ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. For Tray, as a senior, can you put into words playing the last Big East
Tournament.  
TRAY WOODALL: First off, I want to apologize to the cameraman at ESPN. I was
frustrated during the game, and he came at me with the camera, and I moved him
out of the way. I was disappointed, obviously.  
We were prepared to come into this tournament and win. I was disappointed, but
I guess now we've got to focus on NCAA Tournament. As you saw in the second
half, we played our style of basketball, as the Coach said. Now we've got to
focus on this tournament. We'll dwell on it for a few hours tonight, and then
we have to move on.  
  
Q. When you saw the kind of physical tournament this was, do you at all
allow yourself to think, is the league we're going into equipped to handle the
play that you bring, Syracuse brings?  
COACH DIXON: I think so. When a team is playing hard, I think it's just teams
being in the‑‑ playing with intensity, and every league plays that way. We've
got bigger bodies. I think that's probably five or six from our league and
probably some other leagues. There's no question teams are playing hard and
getting after it.  
I think that's how every league plays. I think we've got probably some bigger
guys, and that may be something to do with it.  
  
Q. Jamie, does this game kind of epitomize what the league has been about?
Physical play, every loose ball is hard fought?  
COACH DIXON: I think so. I think it was obviously come down to last
possessions and play, just I think it was a game that pretty much every one of
ours has been like against Syracuse over the years. We've been here 14 years.
This game isn't too much different.  
I think this is why it's been the best league, and games like this typify
that. So, again, really proud of how our guys kept battling. That shows
something too. In our league, teams get down and keep battling. That's pretty
consistent throughout our league.  
  
Q. Lamar, can you talk about your last game in the Big East Tournament
here.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Disappointed. I feel like I let the first half get away from
us, and that was the hole we couldn't get out of. It's sad that we had to go
out like this, but I had fun playing in the Big East.  
  
Q. Coach, did you get an opportunity before or during or after the game to
take a moment and just sort of take it in and see the experience as something
beyond just a game, or was that something you can do only in retrospect?  
COACH DIXON: No, it's not. We're focused on, before the game, your opponent,
figuring out who you're going to play in the situation you're in. It's all
about preparation. As great as it is and as great as the event is and has been
over the years‑‑ I talked to people during the week, and when you're winning
and playing in the next game, it's all about preparation and getting ready for
the next opponent.  
You don't really have time to sit back, especially during it. Maybe at some
point afterwards, I think there's no question, as I've said, that the Big East
has made our program, and we've had great runs in this tournament. It didn't
happen this year. We felt we were equipped to do it, but we simply didn't.  
The thing about this tournament is there's always about a dozen teams or so
that believe they're equipped to win this tournament and are ready to do it.
That's why they've had so many different champions.  
  
Q. For Tray, you mentioned before how you obviously maybe dwell on this for
a couple of hours and try to move on to the NCAAs. It's not like you need more
motivation for the NCAAs. Is that like one and done here? Does this put a chip
on your shoulder for you guys?  
TRAY WOODALL: I don't think we need any more of a chip on our shoulder. We
want to win regardless. This game in the second half showed what kind of team
we really are. We played outstanding basketball in the second half.  
I just hope from here we're building on what we did in the second half, and
erase what we did in the first half.  
  
Q. Tray, you said before the game having the double bye worked against you
guys before. Did you feel like in this game the first half had anything to do
with not having played yesterday?  
TRAY WOODALL: No, I don't think so. Just the first half wasn't our style of
play. We just didn't play basketball the way we're accustomed to playing
basketball. Had nothing to do with that. The coach said we've got to get the
loose ball and got to rebound. We just dug ourselves a hole.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you tell the team at halftime so they came out in the
second half with a lot more energy?  
COACH DIXON: I just said we had defensive breakdowns and mental mistakes, out
of position and not doing what we needed to do. We had time, and obviously we
did, and we had opportunity to come back and do it right. We had to get our
rebounding totals to change, which we did, and we had to do better, which we
did.  
So we responded in that way. But you've got to understand that this is‑‑ you
can't make these mistakes in a game at any point, and for this one it was
stretches in the first half we simply didn't guard well enough. We can't allow
our team to shoot 53 percent and 61 percent from three in the first half.
You're just going to dig a hole no matter what you do.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Pitt, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Jaquon Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20583)

### [Cashmere Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22083)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGETOWN - 62  
CINCINNATI  43

  
COACH CRONIN: Give Georgetown credit. They played well. They played hard.
Obviously, we struggled to score the basketball. Without fouling, we'd have
held them to low 50s if we could have just played the game out, which should
be enough to win the game or have a chance to win the game. We just really
struggled on offense. Obviously S.K. didn't have a great game for him.  
Some of our other guys got to gain some confidence on the offensive end. But
our effort was tremendous again, our effort is always tremendous, which I
appreciate from our players. Tough to win when you can't get the ball in the
basket.  
38 shots isn't enough either. We only had 38 field goal attempts.  
  
Q. Coach, when you think about leaving the Big East conference and the split
that's happening, is there sort of an extra sadness given that your game, the
type of game your team has played, seems to dove tail so nicely with the way
the Big East it switching.  
COACH CRONIN: To be honest with you, today would be the day that I wouldn't be
real sad about it for certain reasons that I'm not going to discuss. The whole
thing is tragic. The whole thing is tragic. I'll be quick and then move on.  
Nobody cares about student‑athletes. All anybody cares about is money.
Everybody in the NCAA, in college administration, they talk about academics
and student‑athletes. If people cared about student‑athletes, West Virginia
wouldn't be in the Big 12 with ten teams flying 800 miles to their closest
home game. That's really conducive to studying. The whole thing is a
hypocrisy.  
But I'm part of it. I love doing what I do because I get to coach basketball,
but I get to help these guys grow up and hopefully become better men, have a
better chance at life, but the money has ruined it. If I was a fan, I'd be
very disenchanted.  
  
Q. Mick, it's kind of a cliche to suggest you ran out of gas after you took
that two ‑point lead. It's just a matter of your offense couldn't score.   
COACH CRONIN: We're not a car. We didn't run out of gas. Couldn't score the
ball. Too many guys‑‑ like I said, S.K. struggled. We didn't get much
production other than two seniors.  
  
Q. Mick, you talk about the 38 shots not being enough. Yesterday you talked
about playing faster. So some of the 38 shots were because of turnovers ‑‑  
COACH CRONIN: Turnovers didn't help. Definitely hurt us.  
  
Q. Was it the team didn't play fast enough?  
COACH CRONIN: Georgetown is a low possession game. They're going to work you
deep in the clock. That's just what they do. That's why against them, the way
they play, running the Princeton offense and being so deliberate, every
possession gets magnified, which magnified every mistake.  
When you're in a close game against them, and it's a four‑point game, and
Cheikh Mbodj turns down a four‑foot bank shot and charges and we cut it down
to two, that's like a triple mistake against them. That's just a style of play
where you get used to playing against them. Possessions get magnified just
because there's fewer possessions when you play them in a game.  
  
Q. Mick, looking ahead, do you feel like you guys have done enough to make
the NCAA Tournament? What's these next few days like waiting?  
COACH CRONIN: I don't think that's any question. If it is‑‑ again, I don't
know how anybody could question that.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this week off is potentially good?  
COACH CRONIN: That's a good question. With getting guys healthy and getting
fresh mentally, having gone last year to the championship game here and then
having to beat Texas and Florida State and the NCAA made us play at 10:00 on
Sunday night and bus home and get home at 6:00 in the morning and turn around
and fly to Boston on Tuesday and play against a team you can play on Saturday
an hour from home, that was a disadvantage.  
So I do think the team getting some rest could be an advantage. Obviously, the
best teams will win, whoever plays the best. But we came here to win. It's not
like I say, well, we're in the NCAA Tournament. We don't care. We wanted to
win the Big East Championship. I don't like it when teams lose, and they say,
well, it's no big deal. Next week is what matters. It was a big deal to us. No
mistake. I do think it could help some teams to get some rest, in the Big East
and the Big Ten especially. They're a very, very physical league, and the
games are demanding on the kids.  
  
Q. JaQuon, could you talk about what got you guys going in the first half.
You had a lot of trouble scoring at the start of the game, and Cash made a
couple of threes. Is that what got you going?  
JAQUON PARKER: Yeah, it did. Whenever any one of us make some shots that do us
should good on the defensive end, it gets everybody riled up, everybody gets
to playing better, get to moving better. Like him making shots really helps us
out.  
  
Q. Once you got the three, I think you went six minutes without scoring. Is
there any reason for that, anything that you can attribute that to? You have
these droughts a lot. Is it just a matter of not getting good shots?  
JAQUON PARKER: It's like Coach said, when you play against Georgetown, it's
like limited possessions. When you actually get the ball, you've got to
actually score. If you turn it over, it's magnified, exactly what he said.  
  
Q. How do you guys feel? Obviously, you don't feel good about it. Talk about
going out this way your last Big East Tournament game.  
CASHMERE WRIGHT: It sucked.  
JAQUON PARKER: Yeah, it sucked.  
COACH CRONIN: Nobody's happy. We came to mean.  
  
Q. Cash, can you elaborate on that, what you're feeling now?  
CASHMERE WRIGHT: I'm like disappointed. I mean, when we got the lead, I felt
like they just amped up their defense and just focused on certain players and
just like baited you into doing things we regularly wouldn't do. And then we
just weren't taking the open shots and trying to get better shots instead of
taking the best shots.  
  
Q. Mick, what about the technical that you had?  
COACH CRONIN: It's ridiculous. Not on my part. Anybody who was around the
court knows I simply said that's not a foul. That's not a technical for every
coach in the country. I think we all know that.  
I worked with a guy that could have got a technical on every play. In the
'90s.  
  
Q. Coach, if, as you say, college basketball is a hypocrisy, what could be
done to reform it? Because the coaches want their money and the fans want to
be entertained.  
COACH CRONIN: I wouldn't put it on the coaches. When I started coaching, I
made $800 a month and drove 12 kids home in the back of a car with no grill
every day. That's not why I got into coaching. I work 12 months a year.  
I have to raise $250,000 a year to run our program at the highest level so we
can travel like other teams.  
The problem is there's not enough money for women's sports and Olympic sports.
Your revenue sports, there's not enough money. The economy has trickled down.
The states give less money to universities. Universities give less money to
athletics. So everybody's just, well, let's change leagues because we can
solve our money problems.  
And people that suffer are the student‑athletes. They're the ones that suffer.
And the fans because, obviously, the tradition of what made college sports so
special is really tradition. The fact that we're sitting here and this is the
last Big East Tournament is beyond ridiculous. This is the greatest tradition
in college athletics, this tournament, at one site for over 30‑something
years.  
It's only gone for one reason, money. Money. But other people sit around and
say it's about student‑athletes and the student‑athlete experience. Last year
when we were told we had to bus home from Nashville and lose an hour and win a
game and get home at 6:30 in the morning, but yet we had to be‑‑ we had to
miss class and be on time for that press conference for the Sweet 16.  
I'm sure everybody was worried about my guys' academics right then. I don't
anybody was worried about academics.  
I will talk offense to anybody talking about coaches because every coach I
know got started off making peanuts.  
  
Q. Do you see ‑‑ if there's not a hope of reform with things the way you've
laid them out, do you see a need for players to be compensated?   
COACH CRONIN: Oh, there's no question players are being exploited. Football
and basketball players are being exploited, there's no question about it. I
used to be against it because I wouldn't want my guys thinking that a couple
thousand dollars is a big deal because I talk to them all the time, somebody
could give you $10,000, you're going to blow it in three months. I'm trying to
give you a life where you can make real money with benefits and medical
insurance and things.  
I try to explain to these guys, when they graduate and go off their parents'
medical‑‑ these are things we talk about with these two guys. Cash is going to
get a surgery when the season's over probably. You know, real life. These guys
aren't just jerseys.  
So I wouldn't want them to get‑‑ I don't know if it's good to get confused
thinking, hey, you're getting $3,000 a semester. That's really not going to
change his life. He needs a degree so he can have a career when basketball is
over, whether these two guys will probably end up coaching or whatever
student‑athletes end up doing, they need a degree. So I was against anything
that would make them not want to get their degree, make them think that I'm in
college, I'm big time, I've got a scholarship, now I've got a little extra
money.  
I don't know how you do it. I don't have the answer. If you tie it into
graduation, make it an annuity, they get it when they're done, so maybe it can
help them start off their life. I would be against anything that distracted
them from the truth because giving them $5,000 a year for four years isn't
going to change their life. I wouldn't want that to distract them from getting
that degree because that's the most important thing for these kids, maturing
and getting to a point where you can survive in the real world because there's
stuff out there‑‑ unemployment and jobs, and it's not an easy country to be
living in for these guys.  
They do‑‑ somehow they need to get something. Some way. Because everybody else
is getting a lot of money.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Thanks, Cincinnati.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Pat Connaughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23387)

### [Jerian Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23464)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

NOTRE DAME - 73  
MARQUETTE  65

  
COACH BREY: What a great college game. I'm really proud of our group. I
thought we were men the whole night. The game didn't start really well for us,
but we fought back. Two good teams going at it. They made another run, and we
fought out of it. We made such big plays at key times, and everybody had a
hand in it.  
We're thrilled to be playing in our fourth straight semifinal. I know no one
else in the league has done that. We wonder what it would be like to play on
Saturday because our program has never played there.  
  
Q. Mike, what was the difference tonight? Same sort of start as Milwaukee 12
days ago, and you guys were able to bounce back tonight.  
COACH BREY: I thought we were able to get our defense going. We got some
stops. We play a little zone and turned it over. They turned it over 11 times
in the first half. We went back to man to man and did a good job getting
stops. That gave us some confidence again and slowed them down. We got some
things in transition. To be up four after being down 17‑4, I'm ready to have a
parade at halftime. We're in great shape.  
Even last night, there's been a different kind of poise about us than the
regular season when Rutgers made those runs. There was no panic. There really
wasn't any panic. As a matter of fact, in the huddles when it was 17‑4,
Connaughton kept saying, it's just like the Pitt game. So I'm really proud of
our group.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask Pat and Jerian about that. How did you guys process what
you were going through at the start and not let it get really bad?  
JERIAN GRANT: Coach just challenged us. He even asked us if we were scared and
we took that personally. The guys came out and said either you play now or go
home, and we weren't ready to go home.  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: It was actually a good thing that we had been there before at
Pitt and been able to fight back from it. That's really why we had so much
confidence coming out of the huddles and going down towards halftime.  
It's something we just wanted to cut into the lead piece by piece. Coach said
we're not going to tie this thing right away. It's going to be a process, and
that's something that we kind of figured out how to do, and that's what we got
done by halftime.  
  
Q. Mike, have you ever had four big men where you could just ‑‑ it's like
every other night you press a different button, and it works for you.   
COACH BREY: And everybody at times tonight was the fourth big man in my mind.
Throughout the night, they became the first big man again. Jack Cooley, I'm
really proud of him because it wasn't a real good night, but he kept trying,
and he kept plugging, and he made some big, big plays for us.  
Garrick Sherman was fabulous. I think we found another weapon here in March.
Tom Knight, Zach. Maybe it wasn't as much a night for Zach, but you know what,
tomorrow night could be. It's a great luxury to have all four of those guys.  
  
Q. Mike, Marquette was second in the Big East in free ‑throw rate coming in.
You guys kept them off the line a lot. Was that something you focused on?   
COACH BREY: That's really who we are. When we're in our rhythm, we don't foul
a lot. We play our position without fouling. We're a defensive team. We're not
gambling. We're not trapping. I thought we were able to do that. We weren't
able to do it in Milwaukee, but we were tonight.  
  
Q. Garrick, what is it about the big man rotation? Looks like all four of
you guys can take the load for a while.  
GARRICK SHERMAN: Whatever it is, we're just trying to make sure we're on the
floor doing our job. We're always ready to go. Everyone has their role, and
tonight is one of the nights I had to step up.  
  
Q. This is one of the biggest talking points of the game. What do you guys
think of the uniforms?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: Love them. We're going to keep winning, we've got to love
them.  
COACH BREY: We're 1‑0 in green and 1‑0 in white. They're pretty good so far.  
  
Q. What about facing Louisville again?  
COACH BREY: Here we go again. When the games have been in overtime, that's
when we've gotten our wins. When they've one, they've usually thumped us. I
hope it's overtime. They're really good. We just played them last Saturday,
and they're playing with a great rhythm, and it comes down to taking care of
the ball.  
We took care of the ball last Saturday, but their half‑court defense is so
good, it was so hard to get a good shot that many of the shots we took were
turnovers because it was a struggle to get a good shot. That's where we're
going to have to really work. First we've got to get through the wave. Last
year in the semis, they turned us over in the first half and kind of broke us.
So you got to get through that wave.  
We've got to really control tempo, and against‑‑ you know, we've got to shoot
it well. We didn't shoot it well. We shot it well here two nights. You've got
to shoot over the top of their defense a little bit.  
  
Q. Mike, just from a basketball fan standpoint, this is the last Big East
Tournament. You've got Syracuse, Georgetown on one side, and you guys and
Louisville produced the best game of the year so far. Is it fun to be a part
of these four teams?  
COACH BREY: Unbelievable. I was talking to our staff at breakfast this
morning, look at the matchups today. They blow away any other league. Are you
kidding me? Just the sounds of the matchups, and then certainly tomorrow
night, I just told our guys, I said, coming out on Friday night for the
semifinal game, we've been‑‑ this is our fourth time. It's electric.  
I know it's the last time, and we're trying to get our money's worth out of
this thing.  
COACH BREY: Notre Dame, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [James Southerland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23346)

### [Brandon Triche](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21890)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  62  
PITTSBURGH  59

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought offensively that first half we played as well as we
played all year. Pittsburgh is a tremendous defensive team. We just had great
ball movement. Got the open guys, and James just got‑‑ he got good looks, and
he made them.  
He only got five shots. That's the only shots he had really. They defend so
well. It's so hard to get him looks. We were able to get them. Second half, we
couldn't get him really anything. I think he got one look, and he made it.  
I thought‑‑ you know they're going to come back. I think offensively we
weren't quite as good movement‑wise in the second half. The first half, we out
rebounded them four, and the second half was minus 16. That was really the
difference. They're a physical team. They're a very good rebounding team, and
they just got on the boards. They're very physical rebounding team.  
We just couldn't get defensive rebounds, and that just allowed them to get
back into the game. I thought we played extremely hard defensively for 40
minutes, and it was a tremendous win for us.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the poise that Carter Williams showed down the end of
the game with those final shots.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think the one thing with Michael, earlier in the year he
missed some against Temple in this building. He had one other game that he
missed some. He's a competitor. He's worked hard at it. I could see that he
was determined.  
Sometimes you have to go through those bad experiences to be able to come back
in this situation and be able to make them. And they were huge. I mean, I
don't think we win the game if he doesn't go to the line and make those free
throws. They had a lot of momentum, and it would have been difficult for us if
he hadn't made those, and then he makes a great defensive play at the other
end too.  
So, again, I think those bad experiences early in the year, I think, have
really helped him. It's his first year playing college basketball, and I think
he's a tremendous player.  
  
Q. Jim, just curious what your mindset is going into tomorrow night and how
important it was to have the kind of shooting that you have, 6 for 6 from
threes after I think you were going over in the last game against Georgetown
facing them.  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: I think it's very important. Georgetown is a team that's
going to play tough and physical. So if you keep moving, getting people open
and setting screens, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Jim, hearing you talk about how physical this game was ‑‑ Pittsburgh is
physical, you're physical‑‑ is the league you're going into next year ready
for play like this?   
COACH BOEHEIM: Let's worry about that next year.  
  
Q. For James, in the second half, how did Pittsburgh lock down on you
defensively as opposed to the first half, when you got a lot of looks?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: They did a great job of staying with me. Even when I was
moving, they did a good job of trying to be physical, but also opened up a lot
of opportunities to get the basket with guys like C.J., Brandon, and Mike.  
  
Q. Also for James, what kind of feeling is that to almost hit everything
that you look at? Why do you think that was? Did you sleep on the same side of
the bed?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: It's a great feeling. I didn't realize I was 6 for 6 until
I looked down at the paper now. I don't think about it. I just go out and play
and make sure I make every shot.  
  
Q. Brandon, it feels like the last two games, you guys played with a ton of
energy. Does that have to do with the stage, the Garden, the Big East
Tournament? Is that where you guys are getting that from?  
BRANDON TRICHE: We have to. After going six or seven games straight with a
lack of energy, I mean, we know we have to be urgent. We know that this means
a lot to us, as a basketball team and as a program. This can very much jump
start us to the tournament. So we know how important this Big East Tournament
is.  
  
Q. Coach, considering it's the final year here of the Big East Tournament,
Georgetown ‑Syracuse Friday night, a third chance to take on the Hoyas, what's
going to have to be different for you guys Friday night to win this game?   
COACH BOEHEIM: We're going to have to play a lot better than we have in the
two games we played.  
  
Q. Jim, along those lines, I know you've talked endlessly about that
rivalry. Does it seem fitting that you're going to go through Georgetown again
in the last round here?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't know. That's for you guys to figure out.  
  
Q. Do you have any feelings about that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm just happy. We came to New York with the only goal to just
get playing better, and we played really well here in two games, and that's
important. I think it's still important going into tomorrow night to, again,
to play well.  
They're a tremendous team, and we have no answers for them down there. When we
played them in Syracuse, it was a good game in Syracuse for most of it. We
just didn't play well in either game. They're too good. If you don't play
well, they're going to beat you. Should be a great game.  
It seems to be‑‑ it's a great thing to be‑‑ the doubleheader that's going to
be here tomorrow night will be a great basketball night, I think. I think
you're going to have arguably four of the best teams in the country playing
here tomorrow night probably. So it should be‑‑ it's a good way to go out if
this is it, for this league as it's constituted now.  
It's a great way for this league to go out. We got to the semis in this
tournament a lot, I think over 20 times, and it's great to be able to do that
because it means you played pretty good, and that's what we're trying to do,
play good and get ready for, unfortunately, the only thing that matters, next
week.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like your team thrived in these atmospheres where you're
playing back to back nights. Have you seen that the past couple of years? What
are you telling your players about that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We've been a good tournament team. We've had good results in
tournaments that are back to back. Two and three days, we've always been good
in those situations. That's what we're doing now.  
  
Q. Jim, do you think Pitt is a team that can make a run in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH BOEHEIM: They're a very, very good basketball team. They're very
physical, good defensively. We had to have a tremendous shooting game today to
beat them, and it's usually hard to shoot well against them. Even the shots
James made, he was guarded.  
Really, I think five of them, he was fairly closely guarded on the six threes
he made. They were there. It wasn't like he was just getting open shots. Like
last night he got some open shots. He didn't get open. There was somebody
there. But they switched, and there was a guard on them, so he could get up
and get it off.  
We made shots. Pittsburgh's a very, very good basketball team. They've got
good leadership, good seniors. They've got some good young players. They're a
very good‑‑ they're a really good tournament team. They've got good depth.  
  
Q. For either Brandon or James, how much do both of you want another shot at
Georgetown?  
BRANDON TRICHE: I want it a lot. Them beating us twice, not too many teams
have done that. I remember beating them twice, and the third time they beat
us. That was in the Big East Tournament. We're trying to pretty much return
the favor. That means a lot. Anybody that beats you by 20 points, you want
revenge.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Syracuse, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Austin Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18395)

### [Myles Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24970)

### [Mike Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19654)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

NOTRE DAME  69  
RUTGERS  61

  
COACH RICE: I want to thank my seniors. They showed tremendous heart,
especially the young man beside (Austin Johnson) me leaving everything that he
had. If it is his last game, wow, what a way to go out at Madison Square
Garden and doing everything you possibly can to help your team.  
We just didn't play two halves, didn't have any passion or energy or intensity
the first half. Coaching staff's had to do cartwheels and cheering and yelling
and screaming to get these guys, and when they did respond, that was the
Rutgers that we had seen through the last month. It just took too long, Notre
Dame's too good of a team.  
When we did have it rolling, it seemed Pat Connaughton found the opening
tonight and certainly was‑‑ he was very impressive shooting.  
  
Q. Mike, coming out of the gate, was there sort of a change in adjustment to
be made from playing DePaul to a totally different team like Notre Dame? Is
that part of the problem?  
COACH RICE: It's part of the problem because of their pace and the way they
implement it, but we fell right into it. We just kind of got lackadaisical,
ran with the cutters, never put any pressure on the ball. So we kind of
allowed them to dictate in the first half. In the second half, whatever
happens, the intensity and the energy and the dictating has to be our way. I
thought we did a better job in the second half.  
  
Q. Mike, with Connaughton, was it more of them running things more or losing
sight of them?  
COACH RICE: Losing sight. When you're running and trapping and doing some
things. But three‑‑ I would say, out of the ten shots, seven we just lost him.
You can't lose Pat Connaughton. Of anybody, you can't lose him.  
  
Q. Given there was a lack of energy in the first half, what did you or the
staff or the other guys in the locker room do at halftime to sort of say we've
got 20 minutes left?  
COACH RICE: I just questioned their heart. You know the things you do in
coaching. Question their pride. Austin spoke up, and I think Jerome spoke up.
And, again, they responded. Pressed and did some things to pick up the level
of intensity and energy, but, again, it still wasn't enough because, when it
got close, when it got two possessions‑‑  
I still don't know what happened on the out of bounds. Mike Poole maybe wasn't
down far enough, but he'd been there for 30 seconds. He was standing up as
they called a foul. I was telling Mike what we're in coming back, and they
inbounded the ball. I'm not sure what happened on that. It was my fault, some
of the players' fault on the floor for not being aware enough.  
That's down six, and that's a critical three that they hit.  
  
Q. Mike, you say, if this is Austin's last game. I guess in terms of the
postseason tournaments, what does that mean?  
COACH RICE: We'll discuss some things. I know some of the secondary
tournaments had called and gauged our interest, and that's something we'll
look at as a program. Do we want to do that, or is this going to be our last
game. That's just something we're going to discuss.  
  
Q. Austin, obviously, this isn't the way you wanted to end your career, but
could you talk about the effort you put in.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: It just came down to the fact I knew these were possibly the
last two halves I'd ever play. Playing with these guys, I've been lucky to
play under Coach Rice and his staff and some of my teammates.  
It's been the greatest year of my life. Even though it's been an emotional
roller coaster at times. I just wanted to leave everything out on the court
and have no regrets at the end of the day.  
  
Q. A.J., just to follow up with that, could you talk about the emotion of
what it was like to walk off the court in a setting after a night you just
had.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: I think there was no better place to cap off your college
career than playing at the Garden. Everything hit me when I was walking off
the court. I knew I would never step back into a game and it was my last time
playing with these guys possibly.  
Everything came to me at once, and it was a really crazy feeling.  
  
Q. What is it like now knowing that this is possibly the last time you'll be
out here?  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: It's a numb feeling. I feel like it won't hit me until I'm
sitting by myself later on. I just want to tip my hat off to all the other
guys who battled. Even though we came up short, I felt like everybody gave it
everything we had in the second half.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously, a completely different game for Wally as opposed to what
you saw the last time out. Was it just the step up in personnel he faced?  
COACH RICE: Again, I thought he was much better in the second half in his
attack. He always let the defense hit first, and in great post play, it's a
foot battle, and then you have to be the one creating the contact. So you can
be balanced and attacking. He just didn't do that. He just let Cooley and
Knight and all of those guys knock him off balance, and he just didn't shoot a
balanced shot. The second half, he had two or three really good plays. One of
them went in, the other two didn't. That's what we saw the other night against
DePaul. He wasn't letting the defense take him. They were knocking him off
post and knocking him out of position. You can't do that as a defensive
player.  
  
Q. When Austin spoke up to the rest of the team, what did that kind of jolt
for you guys in the second half to make this into a game?  
MYLES MACK: We just thought about this as the seniors, this could possibly be
their last game. We're just going to go and play for those guys. They gave us
their all from beginning to end. From last year to this year, these guys have
been fighting. I just wanted to dedicate it to these guys and go out there and
play my hardest.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Rutgers, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Mark Fratto](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24962)

### [Phil Greene, IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24963)

### [Steve Lavin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21860)

### [JaKarr Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24961)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VILLANOVA  66  
ST. JOHNS  53

  
COACH LAVIN: From what I could tell, the stats were very equal, 17 turnovers
each. I think they had one more field goal than us. One more three‑pointer
than us. The other team shot the ball well from the three‑point line. They had
ten more free throws. So their team point disparity, one three‑pointer and ten
free throws, that was the difference.  
But getting to the foul line more was the result of their physicality around
the basket area. Finished well, some point blank shots they put down. We held
them to 40 in the game, which is 39% is our goal in games.  
But I think the physicality allowed them to get into the bonus and to get to
the foul line and convert from there. Thought our kids regained their
composure, got back in the game, tied it at half, and we were pleased
considering we weren't playing very well but we were hanging around and doing
enough good things to stay in the game.  
Then they separated themselves with the ability to finish and to convert from
the foul line and get enough stops defensively to put the game away.  
  
Q. For both players, please, how difficult is it going to be between now and
Sunday night trying to find out whether you're playing again this year.  
JAKARR SAMPSON: Very difficult. Just sit around a lot just waiting. We don't
want to be in this position. We wish we could have advanced to the next round
and win this game, but it happened like that. So it's a lot of sitting around
just waiting to see what we're going to do.  
PHIL GREENE: The same thing, piggy‑back off JaKarr. It's going to be very
difficult. Nobody likes to lose. We're just going to see and wait until Sunday
and see what happens.  
  
Q. After the final buzzer, you seemed pretty ticked. What was going through
your mind? I saw you with your fists. I mean, what are you thinking right
there while you're experiencing that?  
PHIL GREENE: After the Big East Tournament, like I said, nobody likes to lose.
Nobody on our team. We hate losing. We wanted to advance and play the next
day. It was just hard.  
  
Q. For JaKarr, can you describe the pressure on your game without being able
to play off D'Angelo.  
JAKARR SAMPSON: I felt like I had a lot of heat on me. My shots wasn't falling
that I normally made. Really, I felt like it was just myself. I just wasn't
hitting shots that I normally make. I went 5 for 18, and I normally don't do
that. I normally shoot the ball pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach Lavin, second half, 11 of 35 from the field. Did Villanova, their
two ‑three zone give you guys some more problems, more problems in the first
half? It just seemed like you guys weren't penetrating enough, just settling
for perimeter shots. What happened in the second half in terms of Villanova's
defense?   
COACH LAVIN: Villanova is an excellent basketball team. I think they're
capable of making a run here in the NCAA Tournament. Obviously, very strong,
physical style of basketball that's allowed them to beat Syracuse and
Louisville and Marquette and Georgetown most recently. So they are a very top
team.  
More than any schemes, I think we didn't finish. Kind of what JaKarr said, we
just didn't finish shots that we expect to finish. We had some point blank‑‑
and, again, I think Villanova is an excellent basketball team. I think they've
got the chance to make a deep run in the tournament, but I feel we didn't
finish or take care of the basketball.  
Some were unforced turnovers. It wasn't as though‑‑ we didn't turn it over
against their press. It was more just we'd have the ball and get it stripped
or dribble the ball in a crowd, and they'd take it from us. Or it looked like
we had an offensive rebound, and they would pull it away from us. In
particular, early it seemed like that happened.  
Then we came back and found a way to tie the game at half. But I thought
Villanova's ability to convert some high percentage shots, inability to
convert at the rim and in the paint.  
And, again, it always takes two to tango. So some of that is Villanova's
defense, or physicality, the thing that makes them so effective. But a little
like JaKarr, I agree. I also think we also didn't convert or finish in the
basket area, and even open looks, 10, 12‑footers, wide open, no one around us,
just didn't put it in the hole.  
  
Q. Two kind of business questions. You're already going without D'Angelo,
and yet you put Lipscomb in before Felix. Can you explain that?  
COACH LAVIN: Guard play. He's a point guard. Felix is a forward, and David is
a point guard. We had a point guard and two fouls, put another point guard.
We've got to get guard play in there.  
I'm proud of the kid. He didn't turn it over. Gave us what we asked him.
Didn't embarrass himself. I think he'll be a scholarship player down the line.
He's one of those kids that keeps working hard. Maybe a redshirt year in
there. He's a kid from a coach's family. I'm proud of him, definitely proud of
him.  
It had nothing to do with Felix wasn't in trouble or didn't do anything wrong.
We just needed a guard in there. This whole week we played him at point guard.
As we were alternating Phil and Jamal.  
  
Q. Do you have an update on Felix?  
MARK FRATTO: Left ankle sprain. Not a high sprain, but just a regular left
ankle sprain. Obviously, he didn't return in the second half. Dr. Osric King
examined him with Ron Lynnfont, our assistant athletic director for sports
medicine, in his 32nd season as athletic trainer.  
  
Q. Coach, despite the kind of disappointing end to the season, what signs
did you see early in the Big East play that kind of give you optimism for next
season?  
COACH LAVIN: I just shared with the kids after the game some of the things we
put on the board that I knew and the guys that cover us on a regular basis
right from the outset, I was very open about the fact this would be the most
challenging season of my coaching career because it's unprecedented, in my
experience, as an assistant coach at Purdue and UCLA, as a head coach at UCLA
and St. John's, and even as an analyst in the seven years in television, it's
the youngest team I've ever been a part of or covered. I don't know if there
has been a younger team, but just very unusual.  
And the one upper classmen, Marc‑Antoine Bourgault from junior college, it's
all first and second year players. Some of the good young teams that have had
success, there's the one or two seniors or couple of juniors or some upper
classmen. So I'm proud, given the fact that this young group, youngest in
school history, youngest in the country, had to come of age in the toughest
league in America.  
As I've said, kind of the school of hard knocks, and I think that will pay off
for us after whatever happens next week, spring, summer, our foreign tour, and
coming back next year.  
I told you Villanova went the last two years without making the NCAA
Tournament. Is that right? So I said, yes, we're playing a team tonight that's
going to be in the same situation we are next year, a hungry group of players
that last two years didn't get to the winner's circle, didn't get to
experience the NCAA Tournament. So you have a physical basketball team that's
determined to have a run in the NCAA Tournament.  
That will be us next fall. Like them, when you have a resolve because you've
been knocked down or beat down as we have, that's when you move forward. We
have to have that resolve in this off‑season. Probably bring 98 to 100 percent
of our team back. So that's unusual too. Usually, there's a senior who left.  
But we have gift, who redshirted, and all of these kids that are playing here
tonight. The future is bright. Like I said earlier this week, as a coach, you
always have a four or five‑year plan. While I wish this year we were 11‑7 or
10‑8, I think we were a whisker from being 10‑8, 11‑7 in this league. We
weren't. We were 8‑10, and that's where we were. And we got knocked out here
in our first game in the Big East Tournament. We just have to move forward and
learn from it and get better.  
There are a number of areas, both individually and collectively as a group. I
told them I'm proud of them, and we'll get better.  
  
Q. For Phil and JaKarr, big stage here because it's the conference
tournament. The arena is more packed than it's been during the season for you
guys. And you take 18, you take 19 shots, and the next highest guy takes only
6. Is that because you guys are used to being the scorers, or did it seem like
more people were deferring to the two of you?  
JAKARR SAMPSON: I didn't even know I took that many shots until the end of
this game. I was just playing basketball, playing the game I love, and just
doing what I do. I wasn't really thinking about the shots I was putting up or
anything like that, like it was just a normal game for me. I just didn't make
most of my shots that I normally make.  
PHIL GREENE: The same thing JaKarr said, just being aggressive. Just taking
what the defense gives you. It just happened that way. I didn't pay attention
to it like JaKarr said.  
  
Q. Question about the conference. What do you think college basketball loses
with the minds of the Big East as you knew it?  
COACH LAVIN: Wow, the minds. I think, and I said this earlier this week, but
as a coach, you're just so‑‑ and it sounds like coach speak, but it's the
truth. I've been so locked in‑‑ and especially this month because it's been
such a unique situation for me personally and with the team and really just a
hard month on all fronts. But I think I'll be better equipped to speak in an
informed manner, in an intelligent manner probably either the middle of the
summer, or maybe it will be a couple of years before I can really put it all
in perspective.  
You're just so focused on your own kids and their development and leading a
basketball program at this level and then recruiting and all the things that
come with that.  
I'm not at a point where I can really speak in an informed, intelligent manner
about what this means, in an existential way, in a historical way. I'm just so
focused on what's going to happen next for this group.  
I think down the line, where I decompress and get away from things, or even a
couple of years where I can look back on it, I think I'm really encouraged
about the group of schools we have. I think the future of the league is very
strong. I'm glad we got the name because the brand is very important in
anything, Coca‑cola, Hershey's, can't go wrong with a Hershey bar logo. We've
got the right branding. We've got good leadership. There's still some things
in play that we need to take care of. But that's to be expected when you go
through a transition on this.  
So I'm bold on the future of the Big East, and yet I know that we lost some
Titans. We lost some great rivalries and some great coaches and great
institutions, and unfortunately, that's kind of the world we live in and the
beat goes on. You reinvent yourself and do the best with the group we have,
and I still think we're going to be one of the preeminent groups in the
country.  
  
Q. Coach, you mention a five ‑year plan a lot. This is really your third
year, well, really the second. Is this where you've seen‑‑ is this where you
saw your program, or is this where you think your program should be when you
took the job?   
COACH LAVIN: Yeah, I mean, I knew‑‑ coaches are always‑‑ our goal is always to
win the Big East championship and then win the tournament championship. But
you look back, and there's a reason we were picked 12th in the league. We're
seeded 10, and Connecticut's in there. So we wanted to get to the NCAA
Tournament, and we realize a couple of box‑outs, couple of free throws, a
couple less turnovers, a couple bounce of the ball, officials call, made or
missed jump shots, and your season is 11‑7 or 10‑8\.  
But it's going to be like that in this league everywhere. When you consider
that we are as young as we are, I'm pleased with the direction of the program.
We have back to back top ten recruiting classes, and being around this group,
they're just an enjoyable group of players to work with.  
What I shared with them is the areas we have to improve upon. We have to get
physically stronger. We're naturally going to get emotionally stronger. When
you get beat down, beat up, go to the school of hard knocks like we do in the
Big East, younger players grow up. That's what resistance is about. And we'll
be a team as we've proved this year we can take punches and come back.  
We did that against Marquette the other day in overtime. Now we want to take
punches, punch back, get over the hump, and finish with a record that will put
us in the NCAA Tournament on an annual basis. I'm bold on the future and the
fact the whole team is coming back, the group of people, the character, the
work ethic, their talent, and we're moving in the right direction.  
We're never satisfied with where we are, and we've got a lot of work ahead of
us. I definitely like our core that we're building or moving forward with.  
  
Q. Steve, after the Connecticut win, you guys were in a really good place,
and then it was a 1 ‑7 finish. This were personal obstacles to overcome,
professional upheaval. How do you evaluate that finish? What did this team get
out of it?   
COACH LAVIN: You know, it's interesting. This league for starters with the
losses, I think Syracuse came in today losing 4 out of 5. I wish that we went
6‑3 the first half of the league and 6‑3 the second half of the league,
obviously. At the end of it, you'd love to have 10, 11, or 12 wins in this
conference, but it's very difficult to do.  
And there's some things that were beyond these kids' control, and I told them
that's why I'm proud of the way they dealt with things. I found out February
3rd my father was going to die. I went home February 4th for the Super Bowl to
be with him, and he died February 10th on the Syracuse‑‑ the day that we
played Syracuse. It's not their fault. But from that point, obviously, I had
to be with my family.  
So the losing streak started the day I found out my dad was going to die. But
we can't‑‑ we still wanted to box out and make free throws and beat people and
take care of the basketball and finish at the rim. So things happen, but I
share a major part of the responsibility in the fact that we didn't finish as
well as we would have liked to.  
But there are sometimes takeaways and lessons even in that because there is no
coaching manual on having a father die, and I've never navigated through
something like that in my career, and I don't think they've ever had a
situation where their head coach's father died in the middle of a season. It
was unusual. From February 3rd forward, it's been really tough.  
That's probably were I feel as close to this team as any in my coaching career
and why I'm so grateful to work with them and looking forward to brighter days
ahead, to the future with these kids because they deserve it. They're a good
group, and they're going to do special things before their careers are over,
both here and beyond in basketball and the like.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: St. John's, thank you.

### [Kyle Smyth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24950)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE- 75  
SETON HALL- 63

  
Q. Kevin, what can you say about the way your team played today after
playing overtime last night.  
COACH WILLARD: They played the same way they played all year. They played with
a lot of heart, a lot of pride. The turnaround time really hurt us because we
didn't come out of last night's game very healthy, which we weren't healthy to
start.  
These guys did what they did all year long. It's tough to explain, as a coach,
to normal people how proud I am of these guys because no one's been in our
locker room. No one's been in our practices, and these guys all year long gave
unbelievable effort, unbelievable attitude, and we're playing like we did
tonight, usually with six guys all year.  
So tonight doesn't shock me because they've done this for me all year.  
  
Q. What did you tell them afterward in the locker room?  
COACH WILLARD: Pretty much what I just said. I usually don't get emotional at
the end of the year but this one hurts because it was such a frustrating year.
I think I kind of knew how we could have been all year if we'd been healthy,
and I feel bad for these guys because they really had to deal with a lot of
negativity and a lot of frustration from the fact that it's hard to explain
that you go into this league or any league with six guys, 5 1/2 healthy guys.  
We took a vote who wasn't hurt this year, and I think Tommy was the only guy
that didn't get hurt, and he was coming off ACL surgery.  
So just proud of them. I really am. I hate losing, but I love these guys.  
  
Q. You basically didn't play five guys. When you play five guys against a
team like Syracuse on a stage like this, is this pretty much all you can ask
guys to do.  
COACH WILLARD: To be honest with you, I think, if we didn't have to play at
2:00 p.m., I think we would have played a little bit better defensively. I
don't know why you'd play a night game and then a day game. We watched a
little film last night, but they were spent.  
This morning we woke up, had breakfast, and kind of just went through the
ballroom. You play a very well‑‑ probably as good a coached team as there is
in the country and as talented team as there is, we probably could have used a
couple of extra hours, not only rest but just preparation.  
  
Q. Kyle, it seemed like a pretty emotional scene obviously when you came
out. Can you just sum up what this year's been like for you personally and
what this game was like.  
KYLE SMYTH: I think any collegiate athlete, when it comes to the end, it's
very emotional, and just all the emotions you run through five years in your
head, everything that went on.  
Ending it with the guy I started off with, that really meant a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked yesterday about the excitement, about the future of
your program as far as the league, but do you have a lot of things going on on
campus? A lot of construction. Talk about how that will advance your
program.  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, obviously, the new league is really exciting. I think
again it's going to be a basketball league, not a football league trying to
play basketball. So I think all the schools are really excited about the fact
the focus will be on basketball, about these great guys who play the game.  
And what's going on campus, any time you make improvements to facilities, that
helps you. I'm actually just‑‑ I'm more excited the fact we're going to take
some time off and get guys healthy and regroup a little bit and get guys‑‑ get
their bodies‑‑ these guys have been beat up, and just kind of get everybody
healthy again.  
  
Q. Fuquan, I was wondering how it feels to play a game with such a quick
turnover. Do you feel really tired out there?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: No, I didn't feel tired for the most part. Just growing up, you
get used to that, just playing AA basketball and things like that, you might
play three games in one day. So you get pretty used to it.  
KYLE SMYTH: You come out in a game like that, and you're ready to go. You're
all juiced up, the whole team. We were. I think, like the coach mentioned, a
couple more hours preparation, different things, get certain things down
defensively. I think that would have helped.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious, from your perspective, you talk about going into a
new league, but at the same time, knowing you're coming back here for a
conference tournament next year. Does it feel to you like you're going and
doing something different, or does it feel there's a certain continuity?  
COACH WILLARD: No, I think that's what everyone's excited about. It's really
not a new league. It's kind of just like a restart. From that standpoint,
being able to come back here and play in the Garden, I think it's a great
treat.  
That's why I put Connor in in the end. Not only to get Smyth out, but to give
him an opportunity. Still one of my best memories is playing in the Big East
Tournament. I think that's going to be really special.  
For my guys, I have four seniors next year. For these guys to play their last
tournament here, I think will be really exciting.  
  
Q. Kevin, talk about how proud you are of your team and how difficult this
season has been, but is it nice knowing you're pretty much having the entire
team back and you can actually show everybody what you thought you had this
year?  
COACH WILLARD: Yes. I'm looking forward to being with these guys again and not
having to deal with what we've had to deal with all year long. They're looking
forward to not going into every game and wondering who's going to play power
forward, who's going to play small forward now. Do we have seven guys, or do
we have six guys? What offense do we run?  
That's why I feel most bad about Smyth is the fact he's got to play power
forward, you're playing small forward. We put a new defense in under 15‑minute
time‑out. We tried to. Just because once I started seeing Brian breaking down,
I didn't want to hurt him anymore, trying to play two bigs. I'm just looking
forward‑‑ we stopped practicing in January. I'm looking forward to being able
to work all year long and be cohesive all year long going into it.  
I think more than that, I don't feel like this group has to prove anything. I
think, if anything, people should be proud of the effort they've given all
year under the circumstances we've had.  
  
Q. Kevin, do you think the injuries from this year was kind of a cause and
effect? That you're playing with so few guys and not a lot of guys practicing
and all that kind of stuff. How do you prevent that next ‑‑ what steps do you
take next year so that doesn't happen?   
COACH WILLARD: That's the tough thing about it. Aaron Cosby tore his MCL in
October on really layup lines. Brian Oliver blew his ankle out just going up
and coming down on someone's ankle. Brandon Mobley popped his shoulder out on
a defensive closeout. Patrik broke his foot when he got shoved. I don't think
we were worn down. We just kind of had injuries that were like kind of freak
injuries.  
Brandon was‑‑ his shoulder was a big one, and Patrik's was a big one. I think,
once those two guys went down, big Kevin tore his meniscus. I don't know if it
was‑‑ it was tough injuries. It wasn't like guys were pulling ham strings or‑‑
we didn't have any pulled groins, we had major disasters. We had guys break
their foot. We had guys tear their shoulder out. We had guys blow out every
ankle, every ligament in their ankle when guys tear their MCL.  
I think that was maybe my frustration. I didn't handle that overly well this
year. I put it on those guys a little bit sometimes. It wasn't like, hey, you
know what, maybe we're practicing too long or lifting too much. It was things
we really couldn't control.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Seton Hall, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Sean Kilpatrick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22084)

### [Jaquon Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20583)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CINCINNATI  61  
PROVIDENCE  44

  
COACH CRONIN: Obviously, the Providence team won 8 of their last 10 playing
extremely good basketball. They had our attention. But great effort by our
guys on the defensive end of the floor. I thought pressure defense.  
Although we didn't force a lot of turnovers, we tried to take them out of
their rhythm so they couldn't get Kadeem Batts the ball wherever they wanted.
He does such a good job of dissecting you with the set plays that we tried to
make sure we committed to not let them get comfortable to where they could
just pick us apart with getting Batts the ball deep in the low post and trying
to get us into a full court mode of attack mode.  
We're just a better team when we play that way. So proud of the way the guys‑‑
we're not a very big team, and we've got Justin Jackson back today, and he
gave us a lot of energy, I thought. We out rebound people despite our lack of
size, and so credit to the kids in the uniforms.  
They've got great toughness, and they're really committed to winning.  
  
Q. Mick, what about the job Shaq did again today?  
COACH CRONIN: He's playing‑‑ that's the thing about some of the international
guys, the sad part about it is they don't play enough growing up. Like for
Adam Hyranciuk, he is on the Polish national team now. Last season with us he
couldn't make a layup. He started to get comfortable, I think. We're all
trying to give him more confidence on the offensive end.  
But production is key. He gives us eight, seven, and five. It's huge. We're
not going to be able to win, you know, S.K. and Kad we can't play three on
five, these guys sitting up here with Cash.  
I thought Shaq Thomas was tremendous. He had eight rebounds. Best game he's
ever played for us.  
  
Q. You used him early tonight.  
COACH CRONIN: We just tried to evaluate some things how we're going to play
our best in the postseason.  
  
Q. Why does he give you an advantage?  
COACH CRONIN: Just trying to be a faster, more athletic team. It is nothing
against Dave or Kelvin. I'm sure there's a time they're going to be able to
help us. The problem with playing so many guys on the wing, somebody gets left
out.  
So playing four guards with Jermaine and Titus at the four gives you only two
subs on the perimeter, which would be Ge' and Shaq. Gives me a chance to get
Shaq more minutes, playing Justin at the five for the most part with Shaq.  
  
Q. It seemed as if you pressed up on them a little more right from the
start. Could you talk about that.  
COACH CRONIN: That was our game plan. A couple things strategy‑wise, they lost
to DePaul, who pressed them. I've got to say they only turned it over seven
times. It's not like we were stealing the ball. We were just trying to throw
body blows and wear them down.  
I don't know, you would know where they rank in minutes played in the Big
East, but one of them's got to be the leader. We were trying to take their
legs.  
We're just a better team when we play that way regardless of our opponent.
Against them, they don't have quite the depth that Ed's going to have once he
gets to his third and fourth year rebuilding the program.  
  
Q. Sean and JaQuon both, was it that defense that got you going? Your
offense was so efficient early in the game when you built that big lead. Is
that what did it?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: Yeah. We're a great team when we play like that. When we're
up on everyone and when we're just playing like with a lot of energy on the
defensive end. That's something that we spoke about all week, you could say.  
I mean, that was just a game plan, and everyone bought into it, and I guess
that's what happens when we play that way. You come out big, and that's
something that we need.  
  
Q. JaQuon, you made some shots early. How important is it for you to get
your game going?  
JAQUON PARKER: It was cool. It was cool. I'm glad I took the shots I took, and
I made them. It kind of got me going on the defensive end. Just when you make
a shot, you just want to play on.  
As a senior, you know, no matter whether you make your shots or not, you've
still got to play hard. It was good for me.  
  
Q. S.K., can you talk about playing Georgetown tomorrow. Obviously, they're
the number one seed. You played them once this year, and just your thoughts on
that.  
SEAN KILPATRICK: We know they're a great team, but like we talked about
earlier, we're a great team as well. Especially the way we're playing defense
the way we are. We're a team that's hungry. We're a team that's not going to
back down from anyone, and we're going to come out and give our best fight
every night. That's something that we look forward to.  
  
Q. For Mick, there was a point there where you had an eight ‑point lead, but
you weren't getting much done on offense, and I counted 6 out of 7 shots,
Providence shots, that didn't reach the rim. Do you think that was kind of the
key there, holding them at bay when you had them 41‑33?   
COACH CRONIN: That's where, I think, our pressure affected them, no doubt.
Their lack of depth probably and our pressure defense. You'd like to think
that had something to do with it.  
But, yeah, I think a lot is made in our case, people talking about scoring or
lack of scoring. The defense is so good and the coaching is so good and the
kids play so hard in the Big East, you're going to have lots of scoring
droughts, and you've got to make sure you hold yourself in there when you
struggle to score.  
I think that's where veteran players come in, and that's the team‑‑ those are
the teams that are going to play on Friday and Saturday in this tournament,
teams that can fight through that because it happens to everybody. You've got
to be able‑‑ your defense has to be able to hold you in there when it happens.  
  
Q. Mick, can you talk about the matchup with Georgetown and what happened
the first game.  
COACH CRONIN: Well, it was a great game. Obviously, it was 51‑51, and we
missed two free throws. We had plenty of chances in our place.  
Obviously, they've had a great year. The development of Markel Starks and Otto
Porter. Obviously, I know D'Vauntes, we recruited him, so he's made a huge
difference in their team. Gives them another point ball and more ball
production since he's developed into a scorer and he heard us scoring.  
Because they're so good defensively, if they can get to 60 points on you,
you're in trouble because they rarely give it up. I think the first ranked
defense in points allowed, I'm pretty sure.  
So it's going to be a great challenge.  
  
Q. For the players, what did you think of the uniforms?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: We love them.  
  
Q. Do they feel better than they look?  
COACH CRONIN: You notice, if you guys were going to go out tonight, they
wouldn't dress like you either. They think they look good. And most important
thing is the recruits think they look great. That's the most important thing.  
So we're appreciative that Adidas includes us in their league program in the
postseason.  
  
Q. Mick, going back to the defensive effort, to see Providence go 9 of 32 in
the first half and same thing in the second half. To get a consistent effort
like this given how the last month has gone, how important was that?  
COACH CRONIN: It's big for us. I think something was big. Shaq Thomas, 19
minutes. Justin, 14. Jermaine, 17. Get a good team effort. We had bench
production‑‑ they helped us in scoring. They helped us in rebounding.  
That's something that I try to evaluate what we're doing and what we got to do
differently in the postseason. As a coach, I think sometimes you can blame
players, and you got to look at yourself. What can you do?  
So I try to look at what can I do to change this? We made‑‑ so our biggest
adjustment was playing Justin Jackson at the five and getting more perimeter
guys off the bench, like Shaq Thomas. Gee had foul trouble, but Shaq and
Jermaine and Ge'Lawn more minutes.  
Make it a faster game. Make it a full‑court game, and hopefully it will play
in our favor.  
If you slug it out, it's going to be 50‑48, and we've lost six games in the
last minute, 9‑9\. We lost six Big East games in the last minute. We also lost
to New Mexico in the last seconds by one. It's not a situation‑‑ we're not
built to play that way. We're not as big and strong as the Cincinnati teams of
the past. We're more faster, quicker, more athletic.  
But like I said, Georgetown again, speeding them up is going to be hard
obviously because it's all about a challenge. It's hard to speed them up.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Cincinnati, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

CINCINNATI  61  
PROVIDENCE  44

  
COACH COOLEY: First, you got to credit Cincinnati. I think they played well. I
think that's one of the better games they've probably played probably in the
last three or four weeks. So credit them and their energy that they came out
with, take us out of some of the things we wanted to do.  
As I just explained to our program‑‑ because I expect to be in big games as we
move forward. I think our program has come a long way in the last year. First
and foremost, not playing on Tuesday, getting to Wednesday, I think, was
important as a growth piece for our program.  
But our program isn't ready for that moment yet. We're not ready for that
moment. Cincinnati's won six games in the last three years in this building.
Providence hasn't won in this building in I don't know how many years. So it's
my job. I need to do a better job educating our kids on how to play in the
moment, and we're just not there yet.  
I thought we made a big jump from a year ago in conference play to get to
where we were. We've positioned ourselves, and unfortunately, we haven't
played well enough to win the last two basketball games. But I'm encouraged
about our future.  
I don't know if we have more basketball games left in us. But if we don't, I'm
proud of what we've achieved this year. It's tough losing. But you've got to
credit the guys that won the game.  
Cincinnati did a really good job. I thought their early pressure bothered us,
put us on our heels. But I thought, when we did get back into the game, we're
just not ready for that moment. When you've got guys like Kilpatrick, more so
Parker and Wright that have been through the wars, and Mbodj, they've been
through the wars. They know what they're doing, and they've embraced the
moment.  
Right now our program just isn't there right now. Hopefully, in the future, we
can get there.  
  
Q. Do you think they're going to come back or was it the start? Obviously,
the start really doomed you?  
COACH COOLEY: I'm just talking about as a program. I'm talking about
programmatic success. That's my job, and I need to do a better job of building
that programmatic success, you know what I mean. We'll get there. Right now
we're just not there.  
I thought their depth really hurt us today as well.  
  
Q. Can you explain that start? Both sides really just ‑‑  
COACH COOLEY: I don't know. Their energy, they came out. I thought we
definitely got back into the game. I thought my young guys were a little
nervous to start.  
But, no, it was just one of those things‑‑ the start hurt us. I don't think
the start won the game for them. I thought the 40 minutes bothered us more so
than anything. A lot of errors. I think we got it to about four or five. Then
we had two really awful possessions.  
We had the game right where we wanted it. They scored 60 points. I mean, come
on. You're not going to win many games scoring 60 points. Wow. If you'd have
told me before the game that they have 60, I'd say we've got a great shot at
winning the basketball game. We can't go 0 for 7 with our best shooter or
whatever we shot from the three‑point line. You're not going to win many games
doing that.  
It's not like we had contested shots. I thought we had open shots. We just
missed.  
  
Q. What are some of the things, specific things over the last ten games that
give you optimism going into next season?  
COACH COOLEY: The guys sitting out. It's called recruiting. The guys sitting
out. The guys that are in our program. Dunne is doing really well. Kadeem
having a breakout season.  
You win in this league and win in these tournaments, A, if you have special
young players, but, B, if you have juniors and seniors. Look around college
basketball. If you just have phenomenal, phenomenal freshmen, these go in
stages, and you have to change their draws every now and then.  
  
Q. The shooting from three was 1 for 16.  
COACH COOLEY: Yeah, gross.  
  
Q. Do you attribute that ‑‑ you said the team is not ready for the moment
yet. Do they not believe enough in themselves coming in?   
COACH COOLEY: I'm not going to say they don't believe in themselves. I thought
we had wide open shots. Cotton doesn't miss too many wide open shots. They
didn't go down today.  
Again, credit Cincinnati? Was it their length? Probably. I want them to shoot
seven more shots. I believe in them that much. It's not that they don't
believe in themselves. Our kids got some belief. If they didn't, we wouldn't
be in this game.  
  
Q. Looking ahead at your ‑‑ to the new Big East, what kind of opportunity do
you think that league will present for teams that have been in the bottom half
of current Big East.   
COACH COOLEY: I haven't thought about that. First and foremost, it is‑‑ I'm
going to miss the old Big East, if that's what you want to say, you know what
I mean? It's unfortunate that things have changed. Without change, sometimes
there's no progress. I'm excited about our league that we're going to be going
in. But to take away some of those rivalries. I was born and raised on the Big
East. You know what I mean? I don't think there's any better basketball in the
country, Big Ten, ACC. That's just basketball.  
This is God's basketball here in the Big East, and it's unfortunate, the
things that have happened. Embrace change and look forward to a better future.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the advancement. You're reaching Wednesday as
opposed to Tuesday. Isn't it just a matter of experience now? Your guys will
be playing more games like this now.  
COACH COOLEY: I hope so. I mean, I have to grow as a head coach in this
league. Our players have to grow. Our program has to grow. I thought we did
this year. I thought our players did a tremendous job. I didn't realize we
started 0‑3 to get to where we were to position ourselves to probably have
success.  
Some of our shortcomings, A, is our depth. We came down here with eight
scholarship players. We've had to coach a team through four or five different
personalities, with injury guys coming off of eligibility. I'm proud of our
guys. Today is not indicative of the future for us. We just had a bad game,
and they played well. Unfortunately, it's a tournament, so you pack your bags
and go home. Pat them on the back and look forward to hopefully another game.  
  
Q. How important do you think it would be for the program to have an
opportunity to play another game? Even last year, a team like Pittsburgh had a
rough regular season? They went to the college basketball invitational, not
the NIT, and won it.  
Would you like the opportunity to coach this group in another team regardless
of the tournament?  
COACH COOLEY: If we don't play in the NIT, our season is gone. I didn't come
to Providence college to play in another basketball tournament. If the
standard is the NCAA, that's the standard. You know what I mean? I don't think
we need to. You move on, and you move forward.  
I think those other tournaments, they do a great job. I played in one at
Fairfield. That's not where our program is. That's not downplaying anybody.
That's just my personal opinion. If somebody don't agree with it, that's just
your problem.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Pat Connaughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23387)

### [Tom Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24969)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

NOTRE DAME  69  
RUTGERS  61

  
COACH BREY: Any postseason win is a great win, and I loved how we got off to a
good start. I thought that was important, especially offensively. We were
flowing pretty good. Both of these guys gave us a great punch on the offensive
end, and I thought, from a defensive standpoint, our position defense was good
enough to win.  
They put some game pressure on us, and we're thrilled to escape and play
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Mike, you're waiting for this from Pat for a while? He kind of had it in
him.  
COACH BREY: Yeah, he's got a great stroke. We need him to be aggressive. The
one thing about Pat that's been something that is a trait of his is, when the
lights are the brightest and the stakes are really high, he's really, really
good. He's such a gamer.  
I think this kind of catapults him a little bit. I told him, if he turns down
a shot, I'm going to get a technical because I'm going to tackle him during
the game if he turns down any more shots during the rest of the postseason.  
  
Q. What was it that got him all his open shots, the focus on the inside?  
COACH BREY: I think we have a team that really can pass the ball, and we have
two guards that really can find you. Jerian and Eric did a good job of getting
in there. Our bigs can pass it. We find a guy that's open. Mike's been good at
that throughout the year. Tonight he really cashed in on it.  
  
Q. Pat, what was falling for you? Was it a matter of just having the stroke
tonight?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: I think it was something that I needed to work on. Something
that moving without the ball to get to those open spots so those guards could
find me easier, make it a little easier on myself to get open looks.  
  
Q. Tom, you talked the other day about how important it was for you to get
off to a fast start. Did you feel like you were really ready to hit the ground
running when the game started?  
TOM KNIGHT: I came out for the games wanting to give energy where the team
needed. If it was rebounds or scoring, that's what I was going to try to do,
and today was scoring.  
I'm going to try to work off of that, just hit the ground running every game.  
  
Q. Mike, Rutgers obviously had scoring troubles this season, but when you
saw what they did last night against DePaul, did that change your game plan at
all?  
COACH BREY: I was concerned. What we did a good job of is not let them really
get going from the arc. Those two guys knocking down threes would have changed
the whole complexion. What we gave up was some inside stuff. We didn't help so
much. We hugged the perimeter.  
Overall, over the course of time, that paid its dues against us. They've got‑‑
I love their personnel with what they have coming back. That front line is
physical. They've got good guards. Get Carter back. They're a heck of a team.  
  
Q. Mike, any thoughts about Marquette, longtime rival?  
COACH BREY: The big thought is they thumped us early. We did not get off to a
very good start, and it came down to defending their bigs. Their bigs beat us
up.  
I just talked to our guys in there, challenging our four big guys. We have to
do a better job establishing our post presence defensively and offensively
against Marquette.  
  
Q. What's it been like to navigate sort of the ups and downs, having a good
shooting night? Maybe a lull here, coming back the last couple of games?
What's it been like navigating that?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: I think that's something my team has helped me with a lot.
The chemistry on this team, everybody likes each other and picks each other
up. That's helped me keep the confidence and keep shooting. That's something
they've been on me to do.  
That's helped me get through the times where I wasn't shooting the ball well
and needed to work on it in the gym.  
  
Q. Mike, did you tell your team to pack for the whole week? Do you expect to
be here all week?  
COACH BREY: We expect to be here a while, no question. We love New York City.
I'll take that over South Bend for a while, so we're going to stay.  
  
Q. You talk about the maturity of your team being real key this week. What's
it tell you about the way you took two or three real big hits in the second
half and hung in there.  
COACH BREY: What I told them is the first two media time‑outs or the called
time‑outs by Rutgers, I thought we had such a great poise about us when we
started the game. I said, we're kind of playing like men. We were really
mature and poised, and as you said in the second half, they're coming at us.
We made great plays out of time‑outs. We defended. We had putbacks. We had
great rebounds. We made big free throws. We made big threes tonight.  
That's something I'd love to see us ride. I think we're a team that could
shoot the ball better than we shot it from the arc throughout the year. I
would love to see this jump start us throughout the year. It's a great weapon
for us.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Notre Dame, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [James Southerland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23346)

### [Brandon Triche](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21890)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE- 75  
SETON HALL- 63

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought that Seton Hall was a team I really didn't want to
play. They really passed the ball extremely well. They used the whole clock,
and they've got four guys that can shoot.  
We weren't active in the beginning. We left guys open, Oliver and Smyth, and
they had nine and six, I think, in the first five, six minutes, and they had
two the rest of the game. We got better defensively.  
Our offensive movement was the best it's been probably all year. We really
moved the ball. Mike played, I think, his best game of the year. James kept us
in it when we weren't playing well. And then Brandon and C.J. got going the
second half.  
For us to be effective, Mike has to make plays, and Brandon and C.J. and James
have to score. That's what happened in this game.  
I thought it was‑‑ we haven't played a good offensive game in a long time, but
this might have been, if not our best offensive game, certainly right there in
terms of ball movement, shots that we got. The better shots you get, the more
you're going to make. We had really good movement.  
Their defense is very good, and I just thought it was a really good offensive
game for us.  
  
Q. You didn't lead at all in the first half. What was different in the
second half of play?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We really‑‑ I told them at halftime we're leading because we
were so far out of it, to be tied at halftime was a lead to me.  
Then we kind of got going, but they came back when we got the first lead, but
then we just continued to move the ball, and our defense got a lot better. Our
defense got a lot better.  
Again, the teams that play with four shooters‑‑ fortunately, there's not many
of those teams, but teams that can put four shooters out from the three are
very difficult to play against.  
  
Q. James, you're a New York guy playing here in the last Big East Tournament
for Syracuse. Can you talk about your emotions going out there, playing in New
York. How much do you want to keep the Syracuse run going here and also just
how well you played.  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: It definitely feels great being back at home, playing in
our last Big East Tournament. At the same time, I want to go in there and be
focused, be a leader for your team, and just go out there and make plays.  
  
Q. Brandon, after you hit the one three ‑pointer up at the top of the key, a
little fist pump there. We don't usually see any emotion out of you. What was
going through your mind? What were your emotions like when you saw that go
down?   
BRANDON TRICHE: I haven't made a three‑pointer in like a month. So I figured
I'd celebrate a little bit. I'm showing a little bit more emotion this year
than any other year.  
But just trying to do whatever I can to help the team. Just being confident
out there and trying to make plays.  
  
Q. Coach, was there any different feeling for you walking into the building
this morning?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, there was. In the locker room before the game, I was
thinking about all the times coming here. I first came to the garden when I
was a sophomore in college, the old, old garden. Seems like about 50 years
ago. Oh, it was 50 years ago.  
I was thinking in the locker room before about the game, some of the games,
and some of the highlights we're playing. Things have kind of been two years
coming, but now that it's here, your whole life has been spent in this league,
and the last 31 years coming to this building, that's a lot. That's a lot of
memories, a lot of time.  
It's just been such an amazing place. Unless you were here for all of them,
you probably can't grasp it, and I can't explain it probably as well as I
should. But Dave Gavitt did something that nobody could have done ever, no
one. You can pick anybody. Nobody except somebody above could ever have worked
this out. What he did to work this league out is incredible.  
Like Louie said, he dragged us into the league. We didn't want to go. Louie
and I talked about this. We're winning. What do we want to do this for? What
do we want to come to New York for? Dave Gavitt was a great‑‑ first of all,
he's a great friend of mine, in the interest of full disclosure, but he was a
great man. I mean, he really was. He built something for all of us.  
There's a lot of people in the Hall of Fame that would never be in the Hall of
Fame, never, not a chance, if it wasn't for him. Mike did an unbelievable job.
I think they both knew what was coming, and what was coming was inevitable.
Nobody should ask how the Big East was broken up. People should ask how did it
stay together with the differences, the schools.  
Of all the games in the league and everything, those are great, but the games
here‑‑ I mean, I've been fortunate to be in a lot of them, to have been in 14
finals here. I remember every one of them like yesterday, the plays. Walter
Berry should have never blocked Pearl's shot. It would have been a happy
ending.  
The heartbreaks are what makes the good ones so great. You have to have them
both. I can't really describe it accurately. It's just‑‑ it's my whole life. I
never thought it would happen. I never thought I would last five years or ten
years.  
I'd have been happy if someone said, Coach, you're going to coach Syracuse and
be in this league ten years. We'll give you ten pretty good years, but that's
it. I'd have said, okay, I'll take it, right then. It's just been
unbelievable.  
  
Q. You didn't get to play against Pitt about a month ago.  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: I thought I did a good job of moving the ball. I'm capable
of spreading out the floor. I know Pitt plays a physical game. We're going to
go out and be physical and move the ball around. We'll be tough to guard.  
COACH BOEHEIM: No scouting reports, James.  
  
Q. Brandon, just a followup on what coach is saying. Syracuse has been
identified with this tournament and vice versa. What does this event mean to
you as a player?  
BRANDON TRICHE: It means a lot. It's one of the reasons why I chose Syracuse.
Just being able to play in the Big East meant a great deal of me coming to
Syracuse, just to be able to play tough basketball. Being from Syracuse and
not being able to come down to the city as much, just being able to play and
just remembering G Mac, the run he made his senior year, just made it that
much exciting than watching my senior year, Johnny Flynn going to six
overtimes and played a hell of a game.  
All these memories, it's a lot. Especially being here four years, being able
to come down here with my team, it means a lot, especially to be the last one.  
  
Q. When you say that to us, it's been my whole life. So like how do you feel
about that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Basketball life.  
  
Q. I guess, but in your basketball life, it is going to be different next
year. Are you going to be able to embrace that part of the challenge in the
same way that you always have?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, it's a new chapter. This has been unbelievable, but next
year we'll be tremendously challenging, and I think that will help me next
year. I think that will be good for me because it's such a tremendous
challenge to change leagues and to go down there. It's very difficult to do
that. We know that.  
So it is a tremendous challenge, and I think that's good for me. Tired of the
same old thing every year. It will be great. It will be a different thing, but
I think a tremendous opportunity for us and for our players.  
The Big East, as great as it is, has changed over the years. There's always
change in teams. So we're going into a league where the reason I never wanted
to go to the ACC years ago when it first came up was I didn't want to be the
only team in, and I don't think that's been a good thing. I think that's hard.
I think we're going in. Six or seven Big East schools are going to be there in
two years when you look around.  
First of all, Miami and Virginia Tech were in our league. Boston College was
in our league. And Pitt, Notre Dame, and Louisville are going in. So you've
got six or seven teams that you're familiar with. So I think it's different
than it would have been going in ten years ago.  
And I think it was‑‑ this was inevitable. There was no way this wasn't going
to happen. It's a miracle that it didn't happen sooner.  
  
Q. Seton Hall played pretty much five guys today. Did you sense they were
starting to get hotter?  
JAMES SOUTHERLAND: We did a great job playing in the first half as a team.
Even though we got down, we made smart plays and moved the ball, and we didn't
try to rush anything when we were down. We did a great job in the first half
of hanging in there, and the second half just took control.  
We had a lot of guys come off the bench giving us energy. We had Baye coming
in playing hard against good shot opportunities. We had Jerami Grant, who
didn't have that many minutes but got a nice tip dunk. Just having them go in
there and play hard was to our advantage.  
COACH BOEHEIM: This was a slow game, and they were going to play five guys or
six, and that's what we did. When you play against a matchup, you've got to
get a certain rhythm on offense. It's different than if you're playing a team
that's playing man to man. It's easier to play more people. Very difficult
against a matchup you're trying to get in a certain rhythm, and there's free
movement. There's not really a pattern, you're running against a matchup.  
So I think it's important instrumentally to keep the same guys out there, and
they're keeping the same guys out there. It's a slow pace. Pittsburgh tomorrow
will be more physical, man to man. We play more people tomorrow.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Syracuse, thank you.

## March 13, 2013

  

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Mouphtaou Yarou](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20760)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VILLANOVA  66  
ST. JOHNS  53

  
COACH WRIGHT: A very difficult game, and I want to give St. John's a lot of
credit. They lost their leading scorer, and you're not going to just go find
one. I thought Steve did a great job with the team in finding another way to
play, just get after you and really drive the ball.  
So we were struggling in the first half. I felt the second half we got more
aggressive against their pressure and started to make some plays and got to
the foul line. First half, we were just too tentative, too tentative against
their pressure. It created offense for them.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about ‑‑ you only hit three three‑pointers, but the
three that Ryan hit there in the second half, how big was that for you?   
COACH WRIGHT: We count on him for that, and he knows that. I think there was a
point in the game where he was looking, and we needed a big shot. We needed
someone to make a play. We could sense he was searching it, and that was. That
was big. It kind of gave us a little separation. We had 18‑6, and after that,
it was either their lead, tie, or close game. That was the first time we got
separation again. That might have been like 14 minutes to go in the first
half.  
  
Q. Jay, when you recruited Yarou four years ago, did you ever think there's
going to be a game that carries you offensively?  
COACH WRIGHT: That's a good question. You know what, he was pretty skilled.
No, no. He was good‑‑ he was good tonight, and it's not a surprise to us. We
know what a good shooter he is. Most people take it away from us, but they
really took our guards away from us tonight, and they kind of made a decision
we're going to make him beat us, which is not a bad game plan. He was big
time.  
He hit jumpers. We went through‑‑ usually in our offense, we're going to
Pinkston in the post, and we have Mouph down the perimeter, and down the
stretch we went to Mouph in the post. He was big.  
  
Q. In that same regard, Jay, it seemed like he was drawing back out from
under the basket, and that created a lot of room inside.  
COACH WRIGHT: That's what we were trying to do most of the game. That's why he
got some jump shots. I felt the other people weren't doing a good enough job
taking advantage of that on the team.  
That's really Mouph's value to us. You have to guard him on the perimeter. So
he hit a lot of jumpers. But you notice at the end, he did a great job keeping
Pinkston out of the post. He was the only guy who could post up at the end. He
made two big plays on post ups down the stretch. They were straight up
post‑ups.  
  
Q. Jay, when Harrison out, they had two guys who took like almost all their
shots. How much ‑‑ does it change the number of dimensions they have?   
COACH WRIGHT: It does. You lose your leading scorer, I mean, that's huge
because a leading scorer like Harrison‑‑ and you all saw our last game against
them. He draws two other‑‑ he draws another person, which makes everybody else
better. So losing him is big.  
One of the things that was difficult was you didn't know which guy was going
to get it going. When you prepare, it's easier when Harrison is there to
prepare. It's not as easy to play against him, but you know they're going to
go to him. Without him, it was hard to prepare.  
But they're not as explosive with him on the floor. That's a big loss.  
  
Q. Jay, I know you've been asked this is a lot lately, but how much better
do you feel about your chances next week after this game?  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, Mike, I told you, I felt good, but I knew we're going to
take whatever the committee decides. I told you that before we came up here. I
still feel good. I still feel real good. As long as we can play, I'm going to
keep going for the next game.  
I knew there was a chance we could lose this one, and it would be a long week
at home waiting. Right now I'm not going to think about that. I'm just going
to think about Louisville.  
  
Q. Jay, along those lines, can you talk about the strides you guys have made
since the beginning of the year? What the difference has been.  
COACH WRIGHT: It's really the two guys sitting here. This is our leadership
with James Bell, and you've got a senior who really hasn't played a lot of
basketball. One of the things I'm most proud about him is he's a guy that came
from Africa, and he's a Philadelphia basketball player. He's a Villanova
basketball player. He knows the game. He is smart. He's a leader. He's playing
for his teammates.  
And then Ryan is like a senior. He grew up watching Villanova his whole life.
I'm starting to realize we benefited from that. He knows everything we do. He
comes in there diving on those balls, bleeding blue and white from day one. So
it's like having a senior because he's been around so long. We've really
benefited from his leadership. That's where the strides came from.  
  
Q. Ryan, you had five turnovers in the first half there. It seemed like you
were struggling to find things. Kind of walk me through the process there
second half when you got things going.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: They just got the pressure. I kind of left my feet a couple
times. I should have just jump stopped and made a little bounce pass. I think
I only took one or two shots in the first half, maybe three. I think I had to
score a little bit more for our team and myself. They made a little comeback.
They tied it up. They had the lead a little bit.  
Like Coach said, I just felt like I had to make a play. I made like a three
and then the pull‑up jump shot. I just felt good after that. In the second
half, I was just like, all right, I'm not going to let us lose. I'm going to
be strong with the ball and make plays for others. That's what I thought I
did.  
Eight turnovers, I was sloppy with the ball a couple times. Overall, I thought
that I kind of got some guys some shots, which was good.  
  
Q. Coach Wright, I was wondering, if you looked at the first Louisville
matchup as possibly a turning point or a springboard for getting you guys kind
of on a run, and what do you expect from tomorrow night?  
COACH WRIGHT: That game definitely was important for us in that we were
playing well, but had lost some games. We knew we were getting better. We knew
we were getting a lot better. You got to get a win to‑‑ winning is just‑‑ it
justifies everything you're teaching the guys. It gives the guys confidence in
what you're doing. So that game was big for us.  
Now, I think they were coming off a loss to Syracuse and at home and then came
into our place. I don't think they were playing real well at that time. I
don't care. I'll take it. I'll take it any time. I think they're playing a lot
better right now. I think they're really hot.  
And this team has been in this position before. I expect a great game from
them tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the last Big East Tournament, and everyone's been
discussing it. Coach Boeheim mentioned his feelings about it earlier, them
going to the ACC, you starting this new conference. What are your emotions
playing this last formation right now?  
COACH WRIGHT: Just so you all know, Jim Boeheim is a lot friendlier and nicer
guy than you think. He stopped in our locker room before the game, and he'll
never admit it, but he's a little sentimental. I know he is. He stopped in
before our game and with his wife Julie. I know this league means the world to
him. He went and hugged John Thompson after the game. He don't hug. He's not a
hugger.  
So all of us who have been a part of this, this means a lot. This is really
big to us. If not for Rollie Massimino, I'm not even a part of this. If not
for the Big East, Rollie Massimino is not Rollie Massimino. I know it. He
knows it. And if not for the Big East, no one knows about Villanova. It's been
such a big part of this. It's sad.  
But the greatest part about this is we get to come back here and keep a lot of
the original schools together. So I would lie to you if I said I wasn't very
sentimental about this.  
  
Q. Mouph, Ryan and Coach talked about this earlier, how St. John's gave you
the opportunity to beat them. Why were you up for this?  
MOUPHTAOU YAROU: My teammates are doing a great job to play. My teammates
doing a great job. St. John's was trying to stop that. So I knew, if I started
making shots, they would step up. I was hoping for my teammates. I wasn't
worried about St. John's.  
  
Q. Talk about the development of Pinkston this year.  
COACH WRIGHT: Good New York guy. Talk about Pinkston. He's come a long way.
He's been a big part of our growth and his ability to handle the ball and he
only had one assist tonight, but he only had one turnover, which is big. He's
just gotten smarter as a basketball player. He's gotten to be a guy we can go
to. He's gotten to be a much better defensive player. Just all around, he's
very coachable, a very coachable guy.  
I think he can get a lot better. He's been a huge part of our growth through
the season.  
  
Q. Jay, you mentioned diving on the floor, going for loose balls, things
like that. You guys, even when you were playing well weren't playing pretty
tonight, and that carried you through. Has that been part of the season where
the skill part isn't there, the effort always is?  
COACH WRIGHT: It has to be. The aggressiveness and toughness has to always be
there, and that's the Big East. When you play in the Big East, you talk about
the days back with Louie Carnesecca and John Thompson and P.J. Carlesimo. You
have to know, when you come into a Big East game, if you're not up to the
physical battle and the physical toughness you're not up to that, you're not
even in the game. You've got to start with that.  
Then you've got to try to win the game. You've got to be tougher and more
aggressive. I thought in the first half we weren't. I thought St. John's was
the aggressor. That has been something our guys have done a good job of. Keep
playing hard and tough and aggressive even when we're not making shots.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Villanova, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2013

  

### [Cleveland Melvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23283)

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

RUTGERS  76  
DEPAUL  57

  
COACH PURNELL: I thought that our guys came out ready. I thought we prepared
well. Mack's three at the end of the half was a big basket for him, I thought,
because I thought they made a made six or maybe even eight of their first
eight shots in the second half. That kind of gave them a little bit of a
working margin.  
I thought we got a little unnerved at that point. That happened to us so many
times this year, we felt like we were down further than we really were. We
made a little bit of a run with a pressure defense and cut it to eight with
probably seven or eight minutes to play, and we just turned it over, shot
turnovers, and just didn't do anything sound or solid offensively.  
Once we turned them over and got the tempo up and got things going the way we
wanted to, our offense let us down. I felt all game long we didn't do a good
job of‑‑ I should say their big people did a really good job. Judge and the
rest of their big guys kind of dominated inside, particularly on the back
boards, and inside as well with a high percentage.  
So their inside game, that stretch I mentioned at the beginning of the second
half, our inability to generate some sound offense once we started to turn
them over with seven or eight minutes to play proved to be our undoing.  
Again, I thought our guys came out ready. We just didn't play well enough to
win.  
  
Q. Oliver, what was different? Did you prepare differently from the last
time you saw them to this game?  
COACH PURNELL: No. Well, yes and no. They were down one guy. They were down
one of their best players this time. He played part of that game and got hurt
in our game. So that's different in terms of guarding, kind of focus in on
their two guards. We focused in on their two guards.  
Clearly, they had some more help tonight with their inside players.  
But, no, we used a lot of the same preparation as we did last time.  
  
Q. Oliver, Rutgers starts the second half on a 16 ‑6 run. Do you think that
really hurt your guys coming out there?   
COACH PURNELL: Do you think?  
  
Q. In terms of the overall pace of the game, do you think that really kind
of slowed things down, any momentum you thought you'd create in the second
half?  
COACH PURNELL: I mentioned that just a second ago as a key. The three he hit
at the end of the half to give them the lead. And then‑‑ you've got it better
than I do, but I thought they hit the first seven or eight shots in the second
half, and we answered that with probably three or two. There you have their
run.  
So no question, that was the‑‑ one of, if not the key parts of the game. That
set a tone, and I think in our mind we felt like we were down further than we
were, but that gave them a working margin. That gave them some control.  
I thought we had a chance to get that back when we turned them over‑‑ when we
were a really small lineup, turned it over four or five times and came up with
nothing on the other end. We would turn it over, shot or turnover, and that
was the next key stage as far as that was concerned.  
  
Q. Oliver, tough to think that far ahead, but where do you want to start
this off ‑season in terms of pushing things to the next level?   
COACH PURNELL: You're right. You're right. It's a little quick to be thinking
ahead.  
We've got a number of guys back. We clearly can't stand pat even though I felt
like we were really close. Being really close and standing pat doesn't work, I
don't think. So the first thing I told the guys was that we all need to look
in the mirror and see what each individual could have done better, and that
starts with me.  
So that's where I'll start, in the mirror tonight.  
  
Q. Where do you think in the off ‑season you guys want to improve most
team‑wise?   
COACH PURNELL: Defensively, we struggled there all year long. Our defensive
field goal percentage, coupled with our rebounding, which have to do with each
other, totally. I mean, tonight was a good example.  
We just weren't a good defensive rebounding team, so when we did stop a team,
we gave them a second opportunity, and when we started getting second
opportunities in the lane, the shooting percentage has a tendency to rise.  
So that was a problem all year long, and it really hurt us in a lot of close
games. We take care of the defensive board a little bit better, it finishes on
the other side of the ledger. That's where I would say is the first place you
look. That's not rocket science or anything. Defense wins games. Defense wins
championships. And part of defense is rebounding.  
  
Q. What do you think is going to go into that? Is that going to be more
focus, more emphasis, more energy from you guys to finish defensively?  
COACH PURNELL: I think experience is one thing. We got a lot of players back.
We got one senior, but also adding to that is recruiting and adding players.
And practice and working at it.  
We have a chance to work our players out for a couple of hours during the
off‑season. So we do have a chance to keep our hands on them a little bit.  
  
Q. You only spent three years coaching this team in the Big East as we know
it now. What do you look forward to doing as far as the competition level and
forging a new kind of legacy in the new conference?  
COACH PURNELL: I think the competition level is going to be pretty similar, to
be honest with you. I'm just looking forward to us being better and winning
more games and turning some of those close losses into wins and be the fourth
year of us being on board here.  
So looking at get over the hump in most of those close games and just winning
games. I think our new league‑‑ I'll call it configuration now, but it's going
to be a league real soon‑‑ is going to be one of the best. It has a chance to
be as good as this league depending on who else comes in.  
Marquette, Georgetown, resurging Providence program, Villanova. I don't see a
whole lot of a dropoff here.  
  
Q. Cleveland, when you look ahead to next year, work on defense? What do you
think? What are you looking for next year?  
CLEVELAND MELVIN: Like Coach Purnell said, a better job on the defensive end,
rebounding, crashing the ball. Just doing a better job in those areas and
crashing the ball.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: DePaul, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2013

  

### [Wally Judge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20827)

### [Mike Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19654)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

RUTGERS  76  
DEPAUL  57

  
COACH RICE: I thought for 40 minutes the energy, intensity, and the ability to
play for one another was there. First half just too careless. You shoot 60
percent, outrebound them. I think we doubled in rebounding, just too many
points off the turnovers.  
Tremendous, probably one of our best execution games and balance. This young
man beside me, this other young man beside me had tremendous balance tonight.
It's what‑‑ when I looked at this team on paper, what I envisioned.  
Came a little later than I hoped, but, again, it's nice to have balance and
nice to get a win against a very good DePaul team, well coached team.  
  
Q. Wally was 9 for 9, 20 and 10. What does his performance tell you about
him?  
COACH RICE: Again, Wally and the whole team, no matter what happened this
year, continued to work. It's not a doubt in my mind that he's improved every
single day because of it. It allowed him to have a night like this, a
record‑setting night like this. Again, shows you potential.  
It's a credit to him that he didn't hang his head. There were some rough
times, and he just kept working. His response was tremendous.  
  
Q. When you see a game like this where Wally does what you want him to do or
Myles does what you want him to do and the offense sort of did what you
envisioned, do you think what could have been this season if this had
happened?  
COACH RICE: No, I just won a game. Maybe in another two weeks. I thought we'd
have more balance this year, and for some reason it didn't work out. Some days
it did, it's just we didn't finish.  
Again, who knows the growth of a team? It may take some longer than others. I
believe in this team, the talent we had. I believed in the pride in which we
conducted ourselves. Again, it was a good night, a very good night, and we now
have to carry it on until tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mike, in your opinion, why has Rutgers been so much better in closing out
games in the last two in getting the lead and finishing strong?  
COACH RICE: Hopefully, we've learned from our mistakes. Again, understand this
may be the teams that we've beaten in the last two aren't maybe the teams that
had double byes. I'm well aware of it, but it feels good. It feels good to
understand.  
Really, guys in the huddle from the 12‑minute mark yelling don't get happy.
Don't get happy. Usually we went on a run like that, guys were too happy and
lost focus. These guys really, they didn't need to police anybody in the
huddle today. They were doing it themselves, and that was a good sign.  
  
Q. During the sprint to the second half, what was it like to see the game
start being played at DePaul's pace, very back and forth?  
COACH RICE: I like that pace. When you have two small guards and you have bigs
that can run like that, I thought our depth was good. It was Mike Poole again
showing in Madison Square Garden. I don't mind playing at that pace. I know he
doesn't. I know they all do. Something we're very comfortable with.  
Maybe at the three‑minute mark, I didn't necessarily need the alley‑oop pass
to Dane, but, again, they were feeling very confident, and they were sharing
the game.  
  
Q. Wally, this was your best game at Rutgers. What got into you tonight? Why
don't you think that was there all season? Can you do it again tomorrow?  
WALLY JUDGE: I think two things came to a factor. One, we picked up the bigs.
That's a personal shot. Whether it was me or A.J. or Kadeem, we all
contribute, and we all played hard tonight.  
As far as it being my best game, coach also said that March don't care. Not in
those words, but he said March don't care.  
COACH RICE: Yes, I did say in those words.  
WALLY JUDGE: Anything can happen. You seen Connecticut do it. You've seen
George Mason do it. Anything can happen. That's how you've got to play every
game, like 0‑0.  
  
Q. Mike, can you just talk about the effort that Jerome had to kind of fill
the whole stat sheet up in the game.  
COACH RICE: He had tremendous energy. One time in the second half I forgot‑‑
it was the 11‑minute mark, and he hadn't been out. So he kind of did it all
for us. Got a little carried away in the first half maybe with some mistakes,
but, again, when we have that floor leader and now him and Myles are kind of
sharing the duties of being that floor general.  
But he gives so much. You see his talent. You see the athleticism and the
skill. Now the purpose is coming. It's taken him‑‑ believe me, we've had a lot
of discussions about purpose and playing at your own tempo. Boy, he had a
great tempo about him tonight.  
  
Q. Did you hear the pep band chanting your name as you walked off the
court?  
COACH RICE: Myles or me?  
  
Q. You.  
COACH RICE: No. Again, I love the pep band and the cheerleaders. I really like
their enthusiasm. Again, this is their team as well.  
  
Q. Just a followup on that, just given Tim's vote of confidence for you for
next year, was it important for you personally to have this kind of game?  
COACH RICE: I'm glad he did, but, again, right now my focus completely is on
this team, preparing them for DePaul, preparing them for Notre Dame. That was
something that was needed maybe outside because the recruiting aspects and
different aspects.  
But, no, I'm thrilled with this team. I think he sees the potential in this
team. He sees the growth and development in this team. And, again, as I said
time and time again, this is going to happen. Rutgers basketball is going to
happen. It's just slower than some people like, and maybe their coach, but
it's going to happen.  
  
Q. Mike, in preparing for Notre Dame, how do you kind of get ready for them
on a short notice like this?  
COACH RICE: It will be difficult, but we'll have engaged individuals. Again,
when you're playing back to back nights, you're going to go on a lot of things
that we've already done.  
We've played them. We've dealt with a lot of situations that they may possess
and just go out and have fun. The coaches will have a long night, but the guys
will get good sleep. Again, we'll have all day to prepare.  
But it's exciting just to be there.  
  
Q. Mike, did you prepare differently for DePaul than the last time? What was
different?  
COACH RICE: Different emphasis. Our bigs were so‑‑ they weren't bad. They just
weren't in the game against DePaul the first time. Maybe they weren't‑‑ Wally,
one of his answers was because he got the ball tonight. So that's developing
our young guards, just having the trust in our bigs.  
So we really wanted to‑‑ we thought, if we had one advantage, that's where our
one advantage was, was to go inside. It started from the first play and to
almost the last play.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2013

  

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Zach Leday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24934)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SETON HALL  46  
USF  42

  
COACH HEATH: It's a tough way to finish our season. We gave the game away. We
certainly had an opportunity to close it out in regulation. I think the wrong
guys had the ball, and some of the wrong decisions were being made.  
We definitely took way too many three‑point shots for the game but especially
in overtime. We're not a great three‑point shooting team, so I don't know why
we kind of went to that as our way to finish.  
We finished strong, and we didn't‑‑ we came up short in our last couple of
games, but our last four games, we were playing hard. Any time you play
somebody and you're getting 27 offensive rebounds, that means it's great
effort out there. Maybe we didn't make the best choices, but we certainly gave
great effort.  
We've just got to learn from this tough year. We've experienced both sides. We
had a phenomenal success last year, and this year, obviously, we didn't have
the season we wanted to have. But feel get it fixed, and we'll be back.  
  
Q. Stan, you guys haven't won your first game in the tournament four years
in a row. How tough is it to go out and know that this is how you play your
last Big East Tournament like that?  
COACH HEATH: Knowing what everybody knows, this is the probably the last time
all of these teams‑‑ this great experience is going to be here. We certainly
want to go out and make noise and have success. So not having that is
disappointing. We certainly want to continue to play. I saw that in our guys
who want to continue to play but just didn't get the job done.  
  
Q. Stan, 27 offensive rebounds, and then your transition game got off to a
good start. 20 points off 14 turnovers.  
Your transition game had 27 offensive rebounds, a couple of positives on this
night. What can you take away from that?  
COACH HEATH: Rebounding has been a weak spot for us all year long. To see us
really get after it. Those are effort areas, just running the floor and going
after rebounds. Those are the two positive takes from tonight, the shooting
was just‑‑ we had some good looks too. We weren't all just bad shots. We had
really good looking shots around the baskets.  
Several tip‑ins point blank that you would think would go down. So that was a
little frustrating. I think the guys are a little frustrated too. It's like
there was a lid on the rim, and we couldn't seem to throw it in there.  
  
Q. Were you surprised in the last three minutes of regulation you guys had
to call two time ‑outs?   
COACH HEATH: I was really surprised.  
  
Q. You made a lot of ill advised shots. Was it nerves?  
COACH HEATH: A.C. (Anthony Collins) had plays in a lot of minutes. We really
wanted him to get the ball and get open. I don't know if he was fatigued. Just
seemed like we didn't have the right guys getting the ball. Some simple plays.
You run across the court, jump shot, get it to somebody, you get yourself
open. We didn't execute well. So the execution down the stretch was not good.  
30‑some games into the year, you've been in these situations before. I was a
little surprised we had to take some time off. A little surprised we couldn't
just simply get the ball to the right guys and get the floor spread and shoot
some free throws and finish the game.  
  
Q. Coach, elaborate more and talk about how you played really hard through
adversity, talk more about the character of your team during this tough
season.  
COACH HEATH: Any time‑‑ this league is‑‑ it was ridiculously good this year. A
lot of really good teams. As you look back to the course of the season, we had
several games that it was an overtime at UConn or Rutgers game, we had several
games we felt like we were right there to get them.  
And there were some other teams that we just didn't have maybe the manpower,
especially on the front line, to match up. So we had a stretch of games where
we lost, and it's tough.  
There's several other teams that went through that in this league too. It's
tough. So when you get towards the end of the year, that's what it comes down
to, what the character of your team is like. Are you going to just pack it in
and go home? We literally in our last four games, won two in a row, went to
overtime against Cincy, had that game leading late.  
Same thing in this game, leading late and went to overtime in this game.  
The stretch run certainly wasn't about the guys giving in. They show a lot of
character. They show a lot of fight. They want to win. They want to continue
to play. It was just a matter of us not getting the job done. We just came up
short, especially in some of the areas that we need to get better. We need to
be able to shoot the ball better. We have a better inside game. We're going to
address that hard over the summer and get better in those areas.  
  
Q. Coach, at the end, it seemed Edwin was able to penetrate inside, which he
hadn't been able to do most of the game. Was that a result of the three ‑point
shots leading to transition or just him stepping up his game?   
COACH HEATH: Fuquan, he's a great player. He's one of the underrated players
in our league. I thought he did a great job for 36 minutes on him. That's what
really good players do. They step up when it's time. He did that. We really
want to defend him on the three line.  
As the game went on, he started attacking a lot more and was able to finish
some hard shots. Zach was chasing some of those shots. Looked like we tipped a
couple of balls that still went in late, I think his and (Aaron) Cosby's as
well.  
He's a really, really good player. Probably tonight he was the best player on
the floor, and he took over and showed it.  
  
Q. Zach, just talk about your plight. It's easy for a freshman to be wide
‑eyed in this business. Just talk about the confidence you played with.   
ZACH LEDAY: Coach has been playing me through a lot of hostile environments.
When we went to Cincy, I played overtime there and gained some experience in
that. I played in a lot of different environments this year. I had a good
freshman year. I got to play a whole bunch of minutes and gain a whole bunch
of experience.  
So I was basically experienced. I just went out there like it was another
game, and I was prepared. I knew what my coach wanted me to do, and I knew
what my teammates wanted and expected out of me.  
  
Q. Coach, the Big East as we know it is going to end after this tournament.
What do you think the realignment means for your team going forward?  
COACH HEATH: I think we're going to have a bright future. I'm very confident
in the leadership of our university. I think that going forward, we're going
to have a great future. When everything, the dust settles and everything gets
figured out, we're going to line up, and we're going to play. We're going to
make the best out of any situation we're in.  
I'm excited about our team, our future. We've got a lot of young talented guys
right now. Some of the areas I feel like we're weak in, we've addressed in
recruiting, and we've got a good recruiting class coming in. It is what it is.
You line it up, and you play. We'll do that.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2013

  

### [Fuquan Edwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24932)

### [Eugene Teague](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24933)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SETON HALL  46  
USF  42

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions for the coach and players?  
  
Q. What can you say about the fact that guys like Fuquan and Edwin didn't
want it to end like this?  
COACH WILLARD: That's the way we've been all year. Obviously, (Haralds) Karlis
went out with cuts below his eye. We've had injuries all year. These guys have
battled all year long. All year long, they gave great effort. Offensively, we
were struggling a little bit, but I was proud the way they gave themselves
opportunities to stay in the game.  
That's why I've been proud of these guys all year. We've had seven guys, six
guys every game in this league. It's been tough for these guys, but that's why
I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. Fu in particular, what made him turn on the juice in the last minutes of
regulation?  
COACH WILLARD: Fu has been unbelievable motor. He can play 40‑plus minutes and
still go. I think he still had a little juice left in it. He wanted the ball
on the last play and made a great play.  
  
Q. Fuquan, can you talk about the last couple minutes of regulation? You
seemed to be driving hard and made a couple of layups on the last couple
baskets.  
FUQUAN EDWIN: Someone did a nice job of finding me on the fast break. I
couldn't find my shot through the whole game. Coach asked in the huddle who
wants the shot, and I told him I want it, and I made a great move. I think
that got my confidence going through the game.  
  
Q. What does it mean to keep playing, play Syracuse tomorrow?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: Syracuse is a good team. Last time we played them, we know we
just got to keep it up. Just got to build on this game.  
  
Q. Kevin, do you believe that a game where you didn't have 30 points with
three minutes to go that you would somehow win?  
COACH WILLARD: In this league, it's happened before. It's not the first time.
I think the way Stan plays, they're going to make you guard for 30 seconds. We
only had 19‑‑ really 19 shots in the first half. So we had some turnovers.  
The way they play, they're going to make you‑‑ they limit the number of
opportunities. We hurt ourself early with turnovers, and I think that's what
kind of got us in a little bit of a fog.  
  
Q. Were you worried at all that you wouldn't be able to get out of it?  
COACH WILLARD: We were worried. I kept telling these guys. We've been down ten
to Wake Forest. We were down 10, 15, a lot of times in the second half. We
keep battling. We've gotten stops and opportunities.  
Again, these guys are talking in the huddle like they've done all year. They
believe we're going to get some stops, and eventually one of our shots has to
go in.  
  
Q. Coach, Syracuse has been struggling offensively. [Inaudible].  
COACH WILLARD: I think Syracuse's struggles are a product of who they played?
We're playing the two best defensive teams in the country. Before that, after
they played us, they beat Providence pretty good.  
Again, in this conference, you're going to struggle to score. They have
terrific players. We're going to have to play extremely well.  
  
Q. Kevin, expand your thoughts on the comeback. Your guys are down eight,
2:30 to go in the game against that grinding, physical team. That was a
terrific comeback when it looked like your team was really on the ropes.  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I was proud of the big fella here because he kind of kept
us in the game offensively. He was our one constant where the ball would go in
and he'd get it. They did a much better job in the second half of fronting him
and making it hard for us to get it in.  
It was one of those situations that it wasn't like they were scoring on us. So
I knew, if we'd just get a couple of stops and get something to go our way,
maybe we could get some momentum.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you do to be able to prepare your team or be fresh for
tomorrow's game?  
COACH WILLARD: We'll get back. We'll watch some film. We played Syracuse a
month ago, so we know their players. We know they're going to play zone. We
have to go over our offense and then just kind of figure out what we did wrong
in the first game, see if we can correct that.  
  
Q. Gene, the last ten seconds, you had the block on Collins, and then Brock
had a side jumper. What's going through your head in that span?  
GENE TEAGUE: I was just trying to get us a good opportunity to win the game
and send it to overtime. After I got that block, I thought I was going to get
the rebound. After he missed, it was just‑‑ it was good that he‑‑ I'm glad he
missed.  
  
Q. For either guy, do you care that people are going to say this was an ugly
game?  
GENE TEAGUE: Oh, no, a win is a win. I'm proud that we won, and I'm ready to
play Syracuse tomorrow.  
FUQUAN EDWIN: It was just a sluggish game from the start. Just like gene said,
a win is a win.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Seton Hall, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Coach Bo Ryan.  
COACH RYAN: Good to finally get down here early in the morning. We played last
night. So if I look a little tired, I'm trying to rally. We actually played a
pretty good program, a pretty good school, in our exhibition game last night,
played UW Platteville. That was interesting.  
Matt Painter asked me out there who I was rooting for during the game. That's
my opening statement. I'm sticking to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk to a lot of the coaches about the new
defensive rules and the rules shifting and the rule changes and with teams
like you and Ohio State that have been known to play good defense, how do you
think the rules will affect you? Will they be positive for your team? Do they
have to change something that they do in practice on a daily basis? Will they
affect you at all?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I think you gotta give some credit to my colleagues and our
profession; that most of us were teachers, which is how we got into coaching.
So if a rule is made, you teach to the rule.  
So if there are adjustments to be made to the 3‑point line and to the arc to
other things in the game, whether it's a five second count here ten second
count there, you know, there's a lot of things that we've had to deal with as
coaches over the years. So this is another aspect that we'll only know once we
get a bigger sample size. We can't go by maybe one exhibition or maybe you
have a crew in from somewhere and they decide this is how I'm going to call
the game.  
I think we need more samples and just teach to the rule. So if you're not
allowed to put your hands on a player, then don't put your hands on a player.  
If you're not allowed to, as a guy, gathers for the shot‑‑ the one thing in
the rule says an airborne player who has picked up the ball. Well, the
airborne player, if you look at the examples that they showed us, he wasn't
airborne yet. There was still a foot or two on the floor, but as you gather
the ball and then go up into your shot, if the defensive player cannot move to
get into a line of defense as a help player, then you're going to have to
either get quicker players or teach them through repetition how to anticipate
a little bit better and also work on your own ball defense so that the initial
defender doesn't get beaten.  
It's easier said than done. But I really can't respond to how it's going to
play out as I'm talking to a former player of ours who plays in the NBA who
said, Coach, I hear you have new rules, but did you ever see the NBA playoffs?
Like, do they call the rules the same way in the NBA playoffs that they did
during the regular season? I don't know. Because I don't coach in that league.  
But the key will be: Are we going to be consistent all the way through the
year on how, because we're going to teach to the rule. So if you're teaching
to it and practicing it, you just hope that it's the same all the way
throughout the season. That's all I'm hoping for.  
  
Q. Looks like your nonconference schedule is loaded with a lot of big name
opponents. Is that something you're eager for or a little wary of?  
COACH RYAN: When you say "big names," like a lot of letters in the names?
(Laughter).  
I miss us not golfing, by the way. We have a very tough nonconference
schedule. And to start, it is very difficult. And I've had a long talk with
our scheduler. But it's the way it plays out. So we'll be tested early and
often. Strength of schedule will not be a problem.  
And if it's not the youngest team we've ever had since I've been there, it's
close. We're trying to get old in a hurry. We will play a lot of teams that
are used to winning, teams that are used to being on the left‑hand side when
the score comes out. So you hope that‑‑ I've always been big on preparing for
whatever conference, whatever league I'm coaching in, and get ready for the
Big Ten. So I'm sure that the opponents that we're playing nonconference will
give us the test that we need, and how we respond to them, we'll see.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo said earlier you guys shared a little breakfast earlier.
Wondering if you can tell us how that went and maybe some thoughts on his team
this year?  
COACH RYAN: I ate scrambled eggs. I watched him, he ate the potatoes and
bacon. I didn't know if it was a Northern Michigan thing or what.  
But, you know, we shared some different stories about some of the issues that
have been brought up. And Tom and I have been around quite a bit, being the
two guys still in the league from 2001‑2002 season. So we've seen things. I
was an assistant in'76. He said he was'83 in the Big Ten.  
So we've been around this league for a long time. And we've seen a lot of
things. So what he did say was he missed me at the meeting because with us
playing, he said because it was a real calm meeting. He said there wasn't a
lot of discussion about things. I didn't know what he meant by that.
(Laughter).  
No, he did say they talked over a few things. I don't know if he shared those
with you. But we know we're talking about injuries. We're talking about his
player and our player coming back from knee surgery, how long it takes, how
well you perform, things like that.  
So it's on us, all of a sudden here it is, exhibition games and the real games
and the season's here. So, yeah, it was good to share some time with him this
morning, because during this time we're all moving around different places so
you don't get a chance to talk that much.  
  
Q. A year ago you were excited about Josh as a point guard and all the
progress he made and then the next day he was injured.  
COACH RYAN: You were sitting right back there and you're the one that asked me
a question about him. So I'm not going to answer anything about Josh Gasser
with you. No, go ahead.  
  
Q. How do you anticipate using him and how is his health progressing?  
COACH RYAN: The fact that Trae, Trae Jackson did a lot of nice things by the
time the season was over, if you step back and look in at his performance, he
really did some good things for us that maybe wasn't expected simply because
of lack of experience.  
So Josh had to sit on the sidelines and watch that. And he was very happy for
Trae. So right now I'm using Josh more as a wing, but still also as the point,
because he has the leadership ability and the capability of being a good ball
handler.  
But when you're coming back from surgery such as his, the explosiveness
sometimes, whether it's consciously or subconsciously, we're not sure. So
we've been limiting the minutes, during the Canadian trip, in practice. He's
pretty much now expected and is told and he feels he wants, he's ready to go
through every drill all the time just like everybody else.  
And I think that's a big mental hurdle to get over for a player that's had an
injury like that, that now, when he comes, he knows: Coach doesn't have to
say, okay, Josh, you've done the number of possessions that the trainer wants
you to do or the doctor wants you to do. Now he can pretty much do all that.  
Now it's a matter of that confidence on a drive, the confidence on a sharp
cut. And he knows he's not the only one that's ever had the injury. But he
also knows he's the only one that can really mentally overcome any blocks, any
mental blocks that he has about his physical ability. But he looks like he's
ready.  
I think Trae getting that experience at handling the ball and running the team
a little bit, I think that's going to help us going into this year, because
our front line will be so young.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Minnesota head coach Richard Pitino.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you guys very much. Appreciate you guys coming. It's
been‑‑ since I took the job‑‑ certainly a whirlwind, as everybody can imagine.
But it all starts with just getting these guys to understand the culture that
we're trying to play with and just start it from there with recruiting every
single day and getting these guys to understand what we're all about.  
Questions?  
  
Q. I'm sure you haven't heard this question yet. Any advice from Dad about
what the transition is like to ‑‑ what the transition is like to a power six
conference and how you've adjusted to that?  
COACH PITINO: I haven't spoken to him since I took the job, so...  
(Laughter).  
No, people ask me that a lot, just about is there one piece of advice. There's
not one piece of advice. There's so many things on a daily basis, so many
little things just that as a coach you don't deal with when you're at a
smaller school, smaller basketball program to where you're at now.  
So I talked to him several times a day about the little things. So I'm lucky
to have him. Very fortunate.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this experience just coming to meet a lot of your
peers here and just kind of get a feel of what it's like to be in the Big Ten
as a head coach?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, it's pretty cool. Normally growing up I was always the guy
kind of off to the corner and made to come to these things with my dad or
whatever it may be.  
So it's exciting, and it just shows you how great this league is when you walk
down the hall and you see a Tom Izzo or you see a Thad Matta, or you see a Tom
Crean or a Coach Beilein or whoever it may be.  
Then you see all these other guys who are great coaches as well. It just shows
how strong this league is, how established all these programs are, and just
the traditions are unbelievable.  
  
Q. Most of your background, Big East and SEC. Watching a lot of tape during
the summer of the Big Ten, anything make it look different to you than other
leagues you've seen?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I mean, I think the one misconception I think is everybody
thinks it's a grinded‑out league. But I watched Indiana's exhibition game
yesterday while I was working out and they want to run.  
I've watched Michigan State. They want to get out and run. Ohio State. All
these teams really want to get out and run. I think people think it's a
grind‑'em‑out, physical league, but when I was in the Big East the first time
around it's probably as physical as it gets.  
So, no, I think they're all great styles‑‑ they're pretty similar to a lot of
the programs I'm used to. I think what happens is as you get into conference,
the game slows down a lot. I think that's just the way it works, especially
with officiate and so on.  
So it's not as different, I think, as people may think.  
  
Q. Just wanted to know what kind of an identity are you looking to establish
with your team?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I would hope when you watch our team play that it's a team
that plays extremely hard, plays together. Certainly would like to create
offense from our defense. We don't really want to slow up, run a lot of sets.
That would not be ideal for us. Like to create a lot of turnovers. That's
something that's really important, create a lot of possessions is important,
trying to get a lot of steals.  
Last year at FIU we were eighth in the country in steals. That was something
we tried to hang our hat on and try to generate as much offense from our
defense and hopefully be one of the best conditioned teams in the country.  
  
Q. Along those lines, from a conditioning standpoint, how has the team taken
to that, and are you as assiduous about body fat percentages as your dad is?  
COACH PITINO: It runs in the family. We had a kid, Mo Walker, who was 310
pounds when we got the job. He's now 260 pounds, a little bit less than that.  
Extremely important. I believe in it. I hired the strength coach who was at
Kentucky who was with my dad and with the Celtics. That's very much a part of
what we want to do.  
I believe more than anything certainly conditioning is huge, but it provides
confidence for these guys. Mo Walker now feels great when he walks on the
court because he's in the best shape of his life. That's very much ‑‑ we try
to hang our hat on that as much as possible. And the way we want to play, you
can't get tired.  
  
Q. Who are some of the coaches that you maybe know the best and maybe you've
talked to since you've been here already?  
COACH PITINO: I've known Tom Crean for a couple of years. He was at Marquette
when we were at Louisville and I know him a little bit. He's been great. Coach
Izzo, we played them when I was at Florida and we played them when I was up at
Florida, and he's always been real kind to me. And I've known all the guys.
John Groce, when he was an assistant, I was an assistant. Pat Chambers was an
assistant at Villanova when I was an assistant.  
They've all been great. I'm the young guy in the league, one of the youngest
coaches out there. They've been very receptive to me. They've given me great
advice, been guys that I can lean on, which is nice to see.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is head coach Matt Painter.  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously really excited, like all the coaches, for the start
of a new year. We had a very young team last year. Still have a lot of
freshmen and sophomores this year, but with more experience.  
We talked about returning four starters, and I really don't know who our
starters are going to be. I think it's a good thing for us. We have more
depth. We have more experience. We have nobody in our junior class. So we have
four seniors, two guys that have been with us four years, and we have two
fifth‑year guys that hopefully can bring us some stability and some
experience, some maturity, to balance out the youth that we have on our team.  
But after having a tough nonconference last year, I thought we battled to be
able to tie it 8‑10 in the best conference in America after going to six
straight NCAA Tournaments.  
But we had struggled so much in nonconference, such a tough nonconference,
that we just put ourselves in a bad position. So hoping to have more
consistency earlier in the season this year, and just simply play better.  
So like I said, I'm excited for this team. I'm excited for our pieces. Now
we're just going to have to put it together and be a good team.  
  
Q. Last year you talked about some of the lack of commitment from your guys
about getting into the gym and working hard. Has that changed? And, if so, how
has it changed?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, I think the younger guys, the guys that started, Ronnie
Johnson, Rapheal Davis, and A.J. Hammons, all those guys that have had a
better summer, they know what to expect. Terone Johnson and Travis Carroll
have done a good job of being leaders and being in the gym and being 12‑month
guys.  
We've had freshmen come in from day one who worked very hard. And they
continue to spend a lot of time in the gym. I think that's something that
happens a lot, because when you have more time in the summer, you do put that
extra time in and that extra effort, but then once school starts and you get a
full academic load, you start with conditioning, you start with weights, you
start with individual workouts, now do you put in that kind of time?  
Since the start of school we've been able to see that with guys coming in
after study table, guys coming in at night, some guys coming in early in the
morning. And I think you can see it in some of our numbers and shooting in
practices and in scrimmages, guys are being more consistent from the line,
guys are being more consistent from 3.  
I did feel that our struggles last year to shoot the basketball lied in our
skill level at times but also in our decision‑making. You have to be able to
understand what a good shot is for you, and that might be different from one
of your teammates. And kind of sometimes when ego clashes with reality, it's
hard for a guy to pass up a shot so Purdue can get a better shot a little bit
later in the shot clock. There's a part of working on your game, there's a
part of understanding who you are and having discipline and taking a good
shot.  
  
Q. You talked about the guys making more of a commitment in the offseason to
doing the work that needs to be done, but A.J. Hammons is going to start the
year with a three ‑game suspension. Is this a concern for Purdue fans long
term that he still hasn't got the right attitude?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't know if it's an attitude. He obviously stubbed his toe
and he'll have to pay for that. That question's really for him, not me. And I
understand you're asking me, but a lot of times what happens in our business,
when you deal with young people, is you get a lot of lip service. They learn
to say the right things. Will they do the right things? And I think that's
the‑‑ I know I'm not answering your question, but it doesn't lie with me.  
He's got to be able to now show action. It's like leadership. Whenever there's
some disciplinary action, you know, now when you gotta make your next step‑‑
leadership's action. Everybody says the right things in a huddle, but you go
out and do the right things as a leader, that's the example.  
Anytime there's disciplinary action, now can you learn from it now be able to
go out there and be consistent on and off the court.  
  
Q. I know it's very early, but thoughts on the Big Ten, how you see it
shaping up.  
COACH PAINTER: I think we obviously had a great year last year as a league.
How it gets shaped from a national level, there's a couple of different
factors I think that goes into it. Always want to take a snapshot how we do in
the ACC‑Big Ten challenge. You take your overall nonconference slate, which 95
to 98percent of that will be complete around Christmastime, there will still
be a couple of lingering games for a couple of schools, and then you see where
you are.  
I think with the moving parts, with like Syracuse and Pitt and Notre Dame
going into the ACC, you're talking about a league that you've had to battle
before in terms of about what's the best league in the country. That's now
different. Obviously the Big East is different. And so it's very difficult.  
But we have some really talented teams in our league. Michigan State has a lot
of guys back, a lot of experience. Michigan has a lot of guys back. Ohio
State, I think, has a potential to be one of the best defensive teams in the
country. I like the way they can put pressure on the ball and be versatile
with Craft and Shannon Scott and Lenzelle Smith and Sam Thompson. They have
very, very good players, but those guys all can guard. And then Wisconsin is
always right there. I'm going to leave out a couple of teams, probably.  
But I always try to stay traditional, if you look at 10 years, 12 years and
you run that data with the guys that are in our league, especially those
coaches that have been here forever. So I think those guys will be at the
heap.  
But I think it's also one of those deals we have teams we can get seven or
eight teams possibly in the NCAA Tournament. And that's what you're striving
to do, get as many teams in as you can.  
  
Q. There's a lot of good defensive teams in this league, as you know,
including your own. Are the new rules going to penalize the good defenses
teams, the teams that hang their hat on that?  
COACH PAINTER: I think in theory, in talking with them, it's something they
feel they're going to stay with. If you're telling me the way the games are
going to be called and exhibition games are the way they're going to call them
in the Big Ten, we're going to have a lot of good players watching basketball.
I don't think that will sit with people in this room, with players and coaches
across the country. It's definitely not going to sit with the fans. I think
there's a different way to increase scoring, if that's what they're trying to
do.  
The only thing I do as a coach is take what our officials coordinator tells us
and adjust, and then within the course of a game try to get your players to
adjust. So we're trying to be better in terms of position defense and keeping
the ball in front of us without using our hands.  
But it will be interesting to see what happens here. If the way the games are
getting called in exhibition games are the way they're going to be called in
nonconference, then the reaction from everybody.  
  
Q. You have Bryson's starting last night in the exhibition game, and also
Kendall and Basil contributing quite a bit. Have you been at all surprised by
how much these freshmen have been able to challenge the returners and move
themselves into the rotation?  
COACH PAINTER: Not really. All three came in with great attitudes. And they've
all played very hard. Basil Smotherman and Kendall Stephens, they could have
started for us last night. They didn't, but they're in the mix in terms of the
conversation. I think that competition and that depth is going to help us.  
Ronnie Johnson is our best quintessential point guard in doing the things
necessary to be a good point guard. And Terone Johnson deserved to play more
than any player we had on our team.  
But with that being said, Bryson Scott led in competitive drills in practice.
We accumulated 50 different competitive drills through our practices, and he
had the best win/loss percentage in those. I told our guys, and I told him and
I told Ronnie, that the last time I checked, we get gauged on winning. And I
just felt that he had earned that spot through his consistent kind of
competitive nature through practice.  
So he reminds me a lot of Chris Kramer from that respect in terms of just how
hard he plays and how he competes every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Tim Miles.  
COACH MILES: I'm pleased to be back here at Big Ten Media Days. I see we're
picked 12th out of 12th again. And it's not just by you guys. I see it's by
everybody.  
Like anybody, you take that to heart a little bit. I remember I was looking at
all the things, and I wanted to feel better. And I came home to talk to my
wife and she says: Why aren't you out recruiting?  
(Laughter).  
Getting no slack at home.  
I understand why we are‑‑ facts in life are really interesting. I've always
tried to ignore them. I take the Mayville State job, all these places you guys
have never heard of. They've been 2‑22, 2‑22 we win. Southwest Minnesota State
had one winning season in 13, and we find out how to win. And Colorado State
‑‑ or North Co State goes through the Division II to DivisionI transition, and
I tried to call everybody that had made the same transition, and they had all
been fired. And the one guy says to me: Are they trying to get rid of you?  
Colorado State starts and it's a debacle, we go 0‑16\. And in Nebraska we're
not viewed as much, obviously, and I just‑‑ I don't believe‑‑ I'm a dreamer. I
really do believe in Nebraska. I really do believe in what we are doing and
how we can do it.  
And I just love what the commitment is from our administration. I love the fan
support. And I believe in our guys. So I don't think we're going to end up
12th, and I think it's going to be a good thing. So I don't know how you
follow up Pitino, I'm sure he was great and really smart and intelligent, but
at the end of the day I know we have a way. I know it works. It's worked every
little place you've never heard of and some others you might have heard a
little bit about of, and it's going to work in Nebraska.  
And I'm excited to get started sooner than later. Now, this team's
interesting. You know, we're young. We're impulsive. I don't know if you ever
were young or impulsive. But these guys, somebody said, oh, they're going to
be like a roller coaster. Said, no, we're going to be like an EKG.  
I mean, it's going to be an interesting year. I like our guys, though. They
have a great appetite for work. We were lifting at 6:15a.m. all fall and we
had guys in the gym at 5:30 on a regular basis doing their shooting and doing
their ball handling, working themselves into a lather at 5:30a.m. I was up at
5:30, but I was running to the can. That's about it.  
These guys really do want to get this done for Nebraska. So I don't think
you're probably going to have many questions after that. So let's keep this to
a minimum. I'm putting in a new directive that if you're picked first, you
have to take the most questions and as you get down to be picked at the end,
you get to take the least questions. So I'm taking one.  
(Laughter).  
And there's one guy that didn't vote us last, so he can ask it.  
  
Q. You're entering a new arena this year. How has that impacted the program
from a recruiting standpoint and also drumming up local support?  
COACH MILES: The local support, you know, we sold the thing out, and just our
season is sold out in just a few weeks of opening season ticket sales. And
it's just ‑‑ the support's been phenomenal. We had an opening practice, over
7,000 fans there. And you could feel an electricity in the gym.  
Obviously it's a state‑of‑the‑art place. They just put a practice facility in
now two seasons ago that is state of the art. So it's really cool and it's
great for recruiting because the kids love it.  
But let's face it, until we win‑‑ and we do that‑‑ it's going to help but it's
not going to be why kids pick Nebraska. But I think it shows a commitment and
a progression about Nebraska basketball that the old rule doesn't apply.  
We are more than just a whatever school. And when I say "whatever," is because
you don't have to peel the onion back far to find out Connie and I are both
picked 12th. She's 12th in the country; I'm 12th in the league.  
You look at our women's basketball, has great success, and gymnastics has been
good. And obviously football has been a hallmark program forever. Our women's
softball team. Rhonda Revelle had them in the World Series last year. And
Darin Erstad was in the Big Ten championship game in baseball I think. We won
the bowling deal. I watched that on ESPN. I was going nuts. It was good. We
were good at bowling.  
So I just can't say enough about Nebraska, and it's just time for men's
basketball to do our part.  
  
Q. Chris Collins coming into the Big Ten, he's never obviously been a head
coach before. What would you say is the toughest adjustment to coming into
this league?  
COACH MILES: He's got a different setup than I do, by the way. He can talk to
his dad or Coach K and get pretty good advice. Chris is a smart dude. He knows
what he's doing on his own.  
The advice is the same. This is a difficult league, because there's nothing
easy. You never get an easy basket. You never have an easy opponent. Even
we're hard to play against.  
And I just think that there's going to be a crisis of confidence. I don't
care. When you lose‑‑ I have won 17 in a row; lost 16 in a row. Won 11 in a
row; lost nine in a row. You go through these peaks and valleys and you have
this crisis of confidence. You have to stay with it and believe in it and
never give up.  
And Chris has got a lot of expectations, but he's doing well, too. I think
he's going to be good. I think Pitino is going to be great. The coaches in
this league just keep getting better and better. I asked one buddy of mine,
What do I say? We were picked 12th again. He said, You've got them right where
you want them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Fran McCaffery. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Obviously we're very optimistic about this year's team.
Recognize the position we're in and welcome the challenge. I've not had a team
in my entire career that is this deep.  
I think we have to make sure that we're able to rotate personnel in a way that
maximizes our effectiveness. But I think we have a great level of maturity on
this team and we're really looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you kind of talk about how Devyn Marble has elevated his level of
play since really the middle part of last season? And what do you expect from
him this year in taking another step forward?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think it's critical for our team that he do exactly what
you just said: Take another step forward.  
The thing about him is he will put the time in to make that happen. Incredibly
hard worker. And that's how he worked his way out of the slump he was in
midway through last season.  
He got back in the gym. He came early. He got extra shots up. Really studied
film, and he's a student of the game. And I think at this point he's feeling
really good about himself.  
He had a great trip overseas. Played six games in August. He's been practicing
extremely well. He's been very consistent. And that's what we need from him
this year.  
  
Q. Talk to me a little bit about your offensive skill level at shooters.
You've obviously been very good defensively. What have you done to try to
develop perimeter fire power?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, it's interesting. You look at our team last year,
and clearly you look at the defensive numbers and you see that's why we won 25
games.  
The offensive numbers would not equate to that number. We were a little
surprised, because we felt like, particularly with Zach McCabe and Josh
Oglesby, doing what they did the previous year, you expect them to be around
the same numbers. They were not. I think they'll come back to something close
to those numbers. Zach was 41 as a sophomore; Josh, 39 as a freshman.  
So both those guys worked extremely hard. They're in great shape. Now one's a
junior and one's a senior. I think those two in particular will have big
years.  
I think you'll see Gesell and Marble in particular. Mike's a sophomore now,
and Marble's numbers went up from his sophomore year, so those guys will be
solid. I think the addition of Jarrod Uthoff and Peter Jok, both excellent
shooters, phenomenal shooters, both of them.  
When you couple that with Aaron White's ability to score and Melsahn Basabe's
ability to score, and pretty much if you look at the 11 guys we're going to
play, all of them can score points, all of them are capable of double‑figure
games.  
I think you'll see a completely different Adam Woodbury and Gabriel Oaseni in
the 5 spot as scorers.  
So now it takes the defense's ability away from being able to get up into the
guys that they expect to make shots.  
I think what you'll see is a much more well‑rounded offensive team, and I
think we'll shoot the ball just fine.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how Gabriel Olaseni has progressed since he's
gotten into Iowa City and how he can challenge Woodbury for some more minutes
than he may have gotten last year?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: The thing about Gabe, obviously when he came here he didn't
have a lot of basketball in his background. But when you're 6'10" with a 7'3"
wing span and maybe the fastest guy on the team, the only thing that you need
to see is a work ethic that is going to be required to reach the potential
that he has, and he has one of the greatest work ethics I've ever been around.
So what you're seeing is a guy who, as a freshman, he got some minutes. He got
his feet wet.  
As a sophomore, he was instrumental in some of our big wins. Played a lot
more.  
And I think this year what you're going to see is a much more complete player.
He's an unbelievable offensive rebounder. He runs the floor extremely well and
he can finish with either hand.  
He's also developed about a 12‑ to 15‑foot jump shot that has been very good,
which will really set up his drive because he has an unbelievable first step.  
So there's no question that those two guys, in particular, will have much
greater impact on our team, and what happens in practice every day is that
they really go after each other.  
Gabriel Olaseni has made Adam Woodbury a better player and vice versa.  
  
Q. Aside from Devyn Marble, who will you be leaning on to, A, help establish
your team identity, and, B, as a big defensive presence?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the next guy we would look at would be Aaron White.
Obviously had an amazing summer playing for the United States team and also
traveling with us.  
He's also a junior. He's our second‑leading returning scorer. You would not
have looked at him as a defensive presence as a freshman. More of a steals guy
who could rebound. But now you're seeing somebody who really understands the
game and can impact the game defensively and offensively. Truly understands
how to win. So I think he would be the guy.  
And I think you look at Mike Gesell as well. Incredibly hard worker, can put
pressure on the basketball. Can guard a 1 or 2 and can make shots in traffic,
can make shots late. I think those two guys, and the next one would be Basabe.
What we'll see with him is a guy who will have his senior year commensurate
with what we saw when he was a freshman. Sophomore year wasn't so good. Last
year substantially better. Completely different level of maturity. Physically
ready to go. And obviously we've seen the incredible talent that he has.  
  
Q. Over the last four or five years in your career, the wins for your
seasons for the teams that you've been, from Siena to now, continue to rack up
25, 26 wins a season. Was there an adjustment for you trying to build off of
the success at Siena to this past year? Is there something you leaned on from
your prior position to what you're doing now at Iowa, and have you seen a
change in yourself in maybe a coaching style or coaching philosophy that's
kind of helped you keep success where you've gone the last few years?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think it's more a function of the places where I've gone.
We went to Greensboro, we went to Siena and went to Iowa, you know, the
programs were struggling at that time. And the administration was looking to
me to sort of solidify what we were doing, build a program.  
I've never taken a shortcut approach. We primarily built it with incoming
freshmen. We believed in the guys who remained. I think so often you hear a
guy takes a job and, okay, when you get your own guys in there, things will
get better. I always looked at it like this: The minute I take that job,
whoever is there, they're my guys. Whoever I bring in, they're my guys. And
together it will build it step‑by‑step. And we won't succumb to pressure.
You're not moving it quickly enough.  
I look at it like this: There's only one way to do it, and that's the right
way. You've got to teach your guys and get them to buy into your philosophy.
Obviously we play fast. We want guys willing to play fast. But we don't play
nuts. So you've got to make sure you understand we know how to do that.  
We're going to recruit. We're going to recruit hard. We're going to involve
our players in recruiting; that's the most important thing. We'll recruit
student‑athletes who are going to compete and be able to handle the pressures
that come with competing at this level.  
What's been successful for me so far, I'm also smart enough to know that you
have to surround yourself with really good staff members. So wherever I've
been I've had smart, talented coaches along with me.  
When you have character on your team and intelligent coaches, you can usually
win.  
  
Q. What do you think of the new rules, the block charge and the defending
the player with the ball, and what effect do you think it will have on the
game?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It appears to me it's going to have a tremendous effect on
the game. It only stands to reason there will be a lot more fouls called out
and away from the basket. What I don't want to see is touch fouls away from
the basket and guys getting mugged off the ball, because that won't work.  
I've been saying for years we need to clean up those collisions at the rim. So
I think that is brilliant what they're doing there, to protect the driver. Too
many guys that were talented enough to go by their man and three guys falling
down before the guy even got to the rim.  
So I think to clean up those collisions at the rim is a great thing. It will
be interesting to see if the moves out front and the touch fouls will be
sustainable.  
I think in theory it will work. In practicality it may make the games long and
grueling, and it may have an adverse effect with regard to we're trying to
open up the game and teams may have to play more zone because you have to
protect your guys who are in foul trouble.  
So I think when it's all said and done, we really don't know what's going to
happen. But I like the thought process. I'm an offensive guy. We're going to
drive the ball to the basket. So those rules would in theory help us. So we'll
see how it ends up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Thad Matta.  
COACH MATTA: Obviously exciting time, getting ready to get started in what's
going to be hopefully another not only great Big Ten season but great college
basketball season, and I think we're all kind of in the same mode of
anticipation, nervous anticipation of how our guys are going to play.  
But that's what we're up against right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. I had a question about Aaron Craft and the way he defends. How will the
new rules impact the way he is on the ball or will it at all?  
COACH MATTA: From what I've seen thus far, I don't think it's going to affect
him. I think if they stay with what they're saying, it's going to affect the
bad defenders, because they can't move their feet as well. And I say that in
the most complimentary way to Aaron because I think the thing he does better
than anybody in the country is moves his feet.  
He's got the ability laterally to really move. He's got great lower body
strength. So I don't really see that being an issue for him in terms of he's
not a guy that grabs and holds, because he's always there with his feet. So I
think he should be in pretty good shape.  
  
Q. What's the dynamic of your offense this year? Obviously you're losing a
guy who shot the ball a lot and scored a lot last year in Deshaun.  
COACH MATTA: I think you're exactly right. Deshaun Thomas had the ability to
make difficult shots, and we gave Deshaun a lot of opportunities to score. The
thing that I've seen to this point so far is everybody on the team has made
drastic improvements offensively. And that's exciting for me.  
I think the dynamics of our offense will be very unselfish play. Ball
movement, a lot of body movement. We've got length. We've got size. We've got
different guys that can post. I think both Amir Williams and Trey McDonald
have been a lot more productive down low, which obviously adds strength to our
offense.  
  
Q. Twice in the last two years, players after games, talking to your
players, have mentioned Jeff Boals, your assistant. Could you talk about what
he brings to the Ohio State program, please?  
COACH MATTA: I think Jeff is a terrific coach. He's a guy that has great
passion for the university, has great passion for the kids, and that's
something that I look at as I'm putting a staff together. His knowledge of the
game. He's a lot like myself, have been a lot of different places and have had
the opportunity to learn from a lot of different people.  
But he's a tireless worker. He's one of those guys that truly enjoys every
phase of college coaching on a daily basis. Guys like me sometimes get real
tired of certain things. It never fazes him. And I think that's kind of the
beauty.  
And the other thing I've always said, Jeff's a very intelligent person. I like
intelligent people. And he was a biology major from OU, and just a great
family man as well.  
  
Q. What are the first couple of things coming into this season that you are
looking to establish with your team and the personnel involved?  
COACH MATTA: First and foremost, trying to figure out how the game's going to
be played. I say that coming off a deal we had last Saturday where I didn't
know what to tell them in terms of how it's going to be. I think that's going
to be an issue for everybody across‑‑ but once that's figured out, I think our
defense has got to be our staple. We've got to rebound the basketball.  
I think with our ability to score in transition, getting stops is something
that's important. We can't score when we're taking the ball out of the net.  
And then I think the other thing with the group that we have, a very hopefully
intellectual offensive team, I'm hoping with this team the ability to take
care of the basketball is a huge priority and we do a great job with that.  
  
Q. Maybe assess the way you feel the Big Ten will shape out this year. I
know it's very early, but how do you see it turning out?  
COACH MATTA: Well, somebody asked me the other day, they said, What do you
think this year? And I said, Honestly, being in the league nine years, I don't
think it's going to be any different than it has been in the past, just in
terms of the grind. And I've said this about the Big Ten. I think the Big
Ten's about having the ability to get knocked down and getting back up and
fighting again. Because it's such a great league. You've got great players.
Great coaches. Great fans. There's going to be challenges.  
You look at teams that can get on a roll. Teams that can stay healthy. You
gotta look at how the schedule plays out, who plays who, those types of
things. But I think you're looking at a lot like it's been the last couple of
years in terms of it has the potential to come down to the wire the last‑‑ I
know for sure two years, because we've been involved, and both of them have
come down basically to the last shot to determine ‑‑ an 18‑game season for 12
different teams, the title is determined on the last second of it. How fitting
is that for a great league?  
  
Q. John Groce was an assistant for you. Are you surprised by anything he's
done as a head coach? Was there anything that stuck out when he was an
assistant that you thought he could coach this well at this level?  
COACH MATTA: No, I think‑‑ I've been fortunate to have a lot of coaches go on
and become head coaches and are doing very well right now.  
But John had all the characteristics that I felt‑‑ not that I'm the judge of
it, but the things that he would do on a daily basis. And I always say to
myself, if he gets the opportunity, I think he's going to be a heck of a head
coach.  
And obviously that's what he's done. I mean from OU to now Illinois, I
couldn't be happier for him and the job he's doing. And you know this about
John: He's going to grind it out and find ways to keep the Illinois basketball
where it's been.  
  
Q. How do you think the new rules are going to affect the game, short term
and long term?  
COACH MATTA: I don't know yet. Honestly, I don't want to avoid the question.
I've gotta see it‑‑ I've gotta see it for a couple of weeks. And I want to see
it across the board, if that makes sense. And then I think the coaches that
I've spoken with, we have to take‑‑ if it's going to be this way‑‑ now some
guys are saying our exhibition game wasn't that way, it was just like it
always is. Others are saying, oh my.  
So for all of us, I think we're looking at saying, okay, we've got about a
two‑, three‑week window where we have to look at this and analyze. It may be
subtle changes, it may be big changes that we have to make just in terms both
offensively and defensively to adjust and as all coaches try to do gain an
advantage.  
  
Q. You got a lot of questions on Media Day in Columbus about who is going to
make shots for you guys. After the last three weeks of practice and the
scrimmage you had last Saturday, how are your percentages and what's your
impression of how your guys are going to shoot?  
COACH MATTA: It's always‑‑ in practice it's that double edge, because when the
percentages are high, I'm mad at the defense. When the percentages aren't, I'm
mad at the guy shooting.  
So I like the way we're shooting the ball, just in terms of percentage‑wise of
where we've been in the past going back, looking, analyzing numbers. Now
obviously you guys do it when the lights are on.  
But I think guys have appeared to this point to have a different demeanor,
different approach in terms of how important shooting is to me and the welfare
of this team's success.  
  
Q. If these rules kind of stay as they are, how can that possibly affect
recruiting moving forward as far as what kind of players you need to win?  
COACH MATTA: I haven't thought about that one. I'll go back to Tom's question,
I need a couple of weeks to figure this out. I didn't even‑‑ I gotta see it
through. And like I say, we're going to adjust to it. And we want everything
that's best for the game. And if the higher powers above believe this is going
to help the game, I'm all for it. I'd love to score 90 points a game on
average. If that was the case, then I'm going to need some offensive firepower
I guess in recruiting.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Tom Izzo.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH IZZO: It's great to be back and see you all. And I'm excited for the
season. I can honestly say that it's interesting, when you come in and you're
picked high‑‑ and we've been picked high before‑‑ and I think we deserve to be
up there. I'm not sure we deserve to be where we are, and I'm not sure anybody
does at this state and time, because of the parity that still is in college
basketball.  
And I do think we've got a good team. I think we've got a veteran team. I
think we've added some pieces. We've got some guys back healthy. You put all
those things together, I think it gives you a shot, if guys handle the things
that go with being ranked high and continue to get better each and every game.
So that's what I'm looking forward to.  
If we do that, I think it will be a good year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The additional couple of weeks that you guys get during September, being
able to start practice a few weeks earlier, John Groce talked about it a
little as well. Does that help you get to a rotation a little bit quicker?
Does that help you figure out things a little bit faster. How does that play
into being more prepared, if at all, for the nonconference?  
COACH IZZO: I don't know if it gets you more prepared at all, because one way
or another we were going to get that many practices in, whether it was
two‑a‑days or whatever you had to do to get it done.  
But with every rule there's pluses and minuses. I was in favor of going from
two hours to 10 to 15, to 20, a little more gradual into it. To be honest with
you, starting at 27 was a little shocking. I talked to Billy Donovan early and
they weren't going to start until November10th‑‑ or October10th. People did it
different ways.  
We did start then, but we took more time off, two practices, then two days
off. One practice, two days off. And that was good. And physically I think we
can control that.  
What I'm a little concerned about down the road and in the future mentally,
we're starting practice before the NBA even does, and it does make it a longer
season.  
But with every rule change, the plus is I think our kids didn't get beat up as
much because of the number of days that‑‑ I think last year we had like 14
days before‑‑ 15 days before our first exhibition game. It's been better in
that respect, and yet when the season's over I'm going to evaluate what I
thought it did mentally, physically and then try to adjust next year.  
But all in all I think it will benefit us. I don't think it will make us more
prepared, because we were going to get that done anyway.  
  
Q. What is different about the challenge in front of Gary this year because
people know him, because he's getting the preseason attention, maybe as
opposed to a year ago and just a touted freshman?  
COACH IZZO: Knock on wood, there's a couple of unique things about Gary Harris
which could make him one of the best guards I've ever coached. And one is his
mental approach to things. He's a very humble kid, and he's low maintenance.
That's odd this day and age.  
And the second thing, he's a shooter that guards people. And that's odd in
this day and age, or any age, in fact, now that I think back to some of the
guys that we've had many years ago.  
So I just think that he came back because he wanted to come back. He came back
to try to accomplish more. He stayed up there all summer, didn't go to the USA
stuff or this or that. He just wanted to rehab, get healthy and get better.
And he's a gym rat.  
So I don't see the celebrity side of it bothering him, as long as he stays
healthy, which he's had no issues at all. This kid has gotten better and
better and I think will get better and be one of the all‑time great guards at
Michigan State.  
  
Q. Just to piggyback on that question, how big is it going to be, A, to have
him healthy, and B, to have him help establish the identity of the rest of
your team?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think what he brings to us, we think we could be a great
running team. And last year, between Dawson's knee and how slow that came back
and Gary after the third game of the year, I mean, unbeknownst to me I think
he played hurt three‑fourths of the year, not at 100percent for sure. He's
just a tough kid that every time I asked him are you okay, he said yes.  
He didn't run as well. He's run so much better already that that could change
the identity of this year's team. And I think we're going to be able to put
more pressure on people. He's better with the ball. I think we're going to use
him more in ball screens and things like that.  
So his health, his growth, his offseason, I think, is going to be a great part
of who we are, and I think the fact that we can run again with both those
wings is going to make us a better team.  
  
Q. I think you said you would have more officials coming into practice,
things like that. I know you've had one exhibition game. But what are your
impressions so far about the rules changes and the effect you think they'll
have?  
COACH IZZO: If I talk to my buddies, I'm concerned. If I go off our exhibition
game, you know, and it's hard to tell when you play with the team and you beat
them handily, it's hard to tell. But we did bring in officials for four or
five different practices. And it's a little concerning.  
I think sometimes we have knee‑jerk reactions and it will take the veteran
guys to make sure they understand. I'm really in favor of the block charge
because I felt people were just running under guys and falling down like
bowling pins. And I didn't like that.  
But if we want to make this into a complete non‑physical game, you know I
worry that is that going to be longer games, boringer games, is it going to up
scoring, are people going to play more zone? There's always different things
that go with each rule change. But we'll adjust and players will adjust and
officials will adjust and our conference office and everybody I think will
come up with it.  
But a little bit of a concern that first couple of weeks since we have a
couple of big games, and I'm sure there will be pressure on the officials,
pressure on the players, pressure on the coaches, on how it's called and what
you do, and we'll see.  
Some of the guys I've talked to around the country, friends of mine, former
assistants, I've been paranoid about it because they played in games where
there's 70, 80, 90 free throws being shot. And that's a little scary.  
But I think it will balance out. It will be all right.  
  
Q. Being in Chicago, I know you've recruited this area a lot. Is there a
different dynamic to recruiting Chicago than other areas of the country?  
COACH IZZO: There's always dynamics in bigger cities, because there's more
people involved in the recruitment and that goes anywhere. That was in Detroit
when it was really hopping. It's in New York and LA and the bigger cities. And
yet, each city‑‑ it's cyclical. It moves around. Everybody has its hot few
years. I don't know if it's different in any city.  
I think there's always the same issues. But if there's good players, there's
going to be a lot of coaches around. If there's a lot of coaches around
there's going to be issues. I don't know if it's any different than anywhere
else. But I don't know what else I can say. I don't want to get slapped by
somebody for saying the wrong thing as far as talking about recruiting. A lot
of good players, players, a lot of coaches, a lot of coaches and good players.
There's a lot of middlemen.  
  
Q. You've been in the league a while and seen good players come and go. How
will the dynamic of the Big Ten looking at the whole league this year be
different?  
COACH IZZO: In a sum sort of way, I think it's going to be better. I think
what's happened is our teams like in Iowa‑‑ I don't want to single Franny out,
but I might as well put pressure on him‑‑ but those teams are teams that
weren't as good the last couple of years are getting better. Northwestern is‑‑
and it's going to be great for Chris, but I think Bill had done a good job
there. He had some key guys proffered as he could play for any of us out. So I
think those kind of teams are going to be better.  
And I think the rest of us, there's a lot of good teams. I mean, Indiana loses
a couple of good players but they've got some good players coming back and
well coached, and Michigan is going to be very good. And Ohio State, you know,
when you've got Craft and the rest of that crew, they're going to be very
good.  
So Wisconsin, I think, is going to take another step up even though they lost
some key people. Really, does it really matter who Bo has? Face it, they're
going to win 25 games either way. So I'm not even sure we have to count them.  
But I think the league, the difference in this league, when I think back a few
years ago, when we were ranked and we played one ranked team in the league,
and this last couple of years it could be seven, it could be eight teams, you
start playing seven, eight teams and you play them twice, that's 12, 14, 16
games against ranked teams, and that's pretty awesome.  
  
Q. I was curious, Tom, in general with recruiting, how has it changed over
the years when it first started and maybe what are challenges now that maybe
you didn't have before?  
COACH IZZO: I went to a press conference like this and looked out, I didn't
see 12 one‑and‑done media guys, because right now you're the only people that
aren't one and done. It's changed a lot. And some for the better. Some for the
worse. I am concerned about it. I feel bad for recruits now because I think
everybody‑‑ we've almost made the NBA like it's a right instead of it's a
privilege.  
So it's different in some ways, but I think coaches will adjust better than
players. I feel for the players. I think there's more pressure on them in a
lot of ways. But there's better players. There's guys that have developed
earlier. We've rushed the system, which is okay in some ways.  
But it will be interesting to see 10 years from now how many guys were one and
done, were two and done in the league, how many guys had success or failed.
That's my biggest concern for the game and for the players is does this
speeding‑up process where we end up recruiting on potential and then drafting
on potential, instead of doing both under performance. I think it's a little
scary and something we've got to keep an eye on.  
But the game is‑‑ a lot of good teams out there. We're ranked second, but,
man, I look at teams 10, 12, 14, I just think there's so much parity and
they've got to put a number on somebody, and I think it's a privilege to have
the number. I really do. And it's going to be fun to live up to it and it's
going to be fun to try to‑‑ we've got some big games that first week, and
that's going to be exciting.  
So I'm looking forward to it. I'm a little bit concerned about some of those
things, but at the same time college basketball is as good as it's been and
good as it's going to get‑‑ I think it's going to get better, to be honest
with you. I'm excited to be a part of it. Great turnout, and see you later.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by John Groce. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH GROCE: Thank you, good morning. We've got nine fresh faces. So we've got
a new team with five returning players. Very excited to work with them. It is
a completely different time than last year. It's got its challenges, but it's
been a lot of fun. We've gotten a lot better since the 27th when we started. I
thought the ability to work with them in the summer also helped with the new
access model that started last summer, and so not this past summer but the
previous. I thought that helped us in terms of the transition.  
And guys are competing hard. We're pretty inconsistent right now, which is
normal. But we're going to get there. I like our guys and they're up for
challenges and we're anxious to start competing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I know Joe Bertrand is a guy kind of always right there. What kind of
steps do you foresee him taking this year?  
COACH GROCE: That's a great question. We need him to take another step. And
more with his vocal leadership. He knows that, will probably allude to that as
he's interviewed here today with us.  
Great kid. Great for the program. Great for our young guys from the standpoint
of setting an example of how hard we work and how we do things in the
offseason and how we practice and how he treats his body, and Joe's a pro's
pro with that stuff.  
We'd like to see him take another step with the vocal leadership part. And
obviously from a production standpoint we need him to take a step there as
well. There will be more responsibility this year for him in both rebounding,
scoring for us, being efficient in a lot of statistical areas, but, again,
more vocal leadership than anything.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for your two freshmen from Simeon Kendrick and
Jaylon Tate this year?  
COACH GROCE: My expectation is simple for those guys. I've just really talked
to them about getting better every day, get a little bit better every day.
Fortunately for both of them they were well coached.  
They are very competitive kids. They're used to playing with and against some
of the best players in the country. So neither one of them back down from
anything, which I love. That's a great starting point.  
But they're still figuring things out in terms of our system and how we want
to do things offensively and defensively and they are a lot further along than
when they started, but they've got to continue to get better.  
  
Q. Do you see yourself running more of an up ‑tempo style offensively with
the freshmen you brought in with Kendrick Nunn and Jaylon Tate, or do you want
to try to copy what you did last year?  
COACH GROCE: I thought last year we played fast to a degree. I'd like to play
faster. I think it's a great question. To do that, I've always said, we were
able to do it my last year at Ohio where we had nine or ten guys we were
playing. I think that's ideal.  
Are we at that point now where we have nine or ten ready to do that? Players
play players. They've got to earn that. In a perfect world, have we recruited
and built ourselves more for speed? Yes, we have. So I think we're headed in
that direction. Will we get to the top of that tempo, so to speak, this year?
That remains to be seen.  
  
Q. You have talked about high plans and building, just doing it the right
way. How important is it for you to reach your goals at Illinois to shut down
Chicago to other schools coming in and pilfering recruits?  
COACH GROCE: We've never used the phrase "shut down Chicago." Chicago is a
really, really important city for us, because it's in our state. We have a
great state.  
California and New York, I believe, are the only two states that have turned
out more professional basketball players than the state of Illinois. So we've
always been very talent‑rich.  
It's one of the things that makes Illinois a great job, that our state is so
strong and we want to do a great job in our state. Chicago being very, very
important, as well as the other cities and towns in our state. We take pride
in the basketball in the state of Illinois.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how Rayvonte Rice has fit into your system this year?
I know he had a year to get acclimated, but how he's playing?  
COACH GROCE: Sure. I love talking about Ray because of the type of year he's
had sitting out, maybe the best since I've been coaching in terms of a
transfer and sit‑out year. From the amount of weight he lost, from the body
fat decreasing to how much of a better shooter he's become and to his GPA, to
his approach, mentally he's come a long way in a year and really improved big
time in a lot of areas.  
So we're very, very excited. Having said that, he had some jitters a little
bit, I think he'd be the first to tell you, when we had our first exhibition
game. It had been the first time he'd been out there in a while. He's anxious
to put on that orange and blue jersey.  
The other thing about Ray that I love is he's a Champaign native and watching
Illinois basketball since he was little, and it means something to him to put
on the jersey and play for his state school.  
We're excited for Ray and have big hopes for him this season.  
  
Q. I don't know if I've asked you this, but product of Thad Matta, you
learned a lot from some of these coaches along the way. What did you really
learn from him in you days at Ohio State about recruiting in the Big Ten and
coaching in the Big Ten?  
COACH GROCE: I've said obviously wouldn't have had the opportunity to be at
such a great place like Illinois without him and several others. But he's
meant a lot to my career, has really helped my family.  
So I'm forever grateful for that. Learned a lot of different things from him,
both on and off the court when it comes to the profession.  
So for me, it's interesting. Obviously see him frequently because we're in the
same league. And my son asked me the other day if we're still friends. I said,
Yeah, Conner, we are. But obviously we are competitive, too.  
He's a competitor. When you play one another one, two, three times a year, and
when the ball gets thrown up, at that point it becomes business.  
  
Q. Can you talk about some of the challenges that you personally and your
staff have faced getting used to all these new players coming in this year?  
COACH GROCE: Sure. I think just getting to know them. Obviously that takes
time. I wish there was a formula where you could speed ball it. And it takes
time.  
I'm not real‑‑ coaches aren't the most patient guys in the world. So I've
tried to be aggressively patient with that approach and put them in situations
where they have to deal with adversity.  
I think one of the things that helped us for sure is we did an exercise this
summer and this fall with the SEAL team, physical training. I think that all
helped. Brought us all closer together. Staff participated as well. Things
like that put them in situations where they have to rely on one another has
allowed us to get to know them better.  
But we still need to get to know them better. We did through the recruiting
process with most of them and through the fall and even this past summer, and
here the season's started. That's an ever‑evolving curve, if you will. We're
continuing to do it on a daily basis.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, you talk about kind of grading players on how they do
in practices and scrimmages. And how close are you to deciding the rotation
and who you want where?  
COACH GROCE: We're getting closer, for sure. And I'd like to get to that
earlier this year. I think we can, because, again, as I mentioned earlier, we
had the summer. We had the fall starting on September15th, which we could work
with our group in its entirety. And now we started practice on September
the27th, which is earlier than normal.  
So because of that, we've had more evaluation time, if you will. So we've been
able to define roles. We've already done that earlier than we usually would
with such a young team as normally we'd be trying to figure it out.  
I think we're getting closer to a rotation as well, not completely set but
closer.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next joining us is Tom Crean.  
COACH CREAN: We're excited for the season. I think the early start of practice
has been phenomenal. I would think for everybody, but especially for a team
that's as new as we are, because all of a sudden, after losing four guys that
scored over 1100 points, along with Illinois, we're one of the two youngest
teams in this league, experience‑wise.  
So we've had a lot to learn. We have a lot to learn. I think the biggest thing
we're trying to get accomplished right now is to get our team to understand‑‑
this team to understand what it takes to practice at a championship level and
showing the standards of last year, not necessarily who it was, but how it was
done, I think is the most important thing.  
For us right now we're trying to get to a point where we have a consistent
level of leadership and guys understand that leadership is nurturing but it's
also demanding, and to understand what that takes, and then just getting a
young team to really absorb how important it is to be as fundamentally sound
as they can be, to be as technique‑driven and detail‑oriented as they can be,
and the more you can get them to understand what caused you to lose and more
games are lost than won in so many different ways, to get them to understand
that, even with out game experience, to try to put them in as much situations
as we can in practice to have referees probably anywhere 75, 80percent of the
time, more so than we ever have to help them learn but also to get ready for
the new rules, but it's been a great group to coach, because they have a
humbleness.  
There's a real total want to and it's just going to take a while to get to the
whole how to, and that's what we're going to be in the midst of trying to get
accomplished, but love coaching our team.  
I love what Will Sheehey and Yogi Ferrell are trying to provide for us on the
sense of on the floor and in the sense of the way they're trying to help make
it even more competitive, the way they're trying to lead.  
I love the addition of Evan Gordon and the knowledge that he has of the game.
And it's a thrill to try to stretch his game to get him to go above and beyond
where he thinks he can, and then all the guys that are freshmen and sophomores
that are going to play considerable roles for us.  
So we are proud of what we've done. We've got the culture moving in the right
direction, when it comes to work ethic, and when it comes to character, and
now we've just got to understand how hard and tough and competitive you have
to be on a daily basis.  
  
Q. I guess, can you measure yet how much more you've gained because you've
had the longer preseason with this young team than maybe you would have a year
ago, two years ago?  
COACH CREAN: No, I don't think there's any way to gauge it because it's so
different. I think because the timing of it is so different. But, again,
yesterday's a great example. I mean, we're doing situation work, what we do
with a couple of seconds on the clock side out. Couple seconds, full court,
couple seconds underneath.  
And just completely speaking a foreign language. I mean, completely. And that
was something last year, we won the championship because we understood how to
play situation basketball. We were down at Michigan State four with a minute
and a half to go and down five with 55some seconds to go at Michigan, we won
both those games because our guys understood situation basketball so well.  
So the answer is no time is enough. I mean, it's great to have this kind of
time with them, we're going to need every bit of it. And at the same time you
have to balance when they need to freshen up, when they need to get a little
time off, when they need to be pushed a little harder, and how you balance it
throughout a long season.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about how special Noah Vonleh could become
if he develops as positively expected throughout the year?  
COACH CREAN: He's got a special work ethic and he's got a special humility.
And sometimes the word "sponge" can be used and it's really just a lot of
hyperbole, when it comes to somebody that really wants to learn the game and
get better.  
Not with him. He's high level in wanting to get better. For somebody with that
kind of talent and ability, it's fun to watch. He understands there's things
that he doesn't know but he wants to get them. And he wants to get them that
day. And the work ethic for an 18‑year‑old, just two months into his
18‑year‑old birthday is amazing. So if he continues to get comfortable with
the ball, away from the basket and at the basket, when double teams start to
come, when he understands all the different awarenesses that come defensively
whether you're on the ball, off the ball, he already knows how to rebound at a
high level, the biggest thing he's gotta get is, he's gotta get more demanding
of the ball. He and Cody have a similarity. Neither one of them would just
step out and really demand it with their body at times and with their voice at
other times.  
And that's something that Noah's gotta develop, he really does. It's not just
the skill set of scoring. It's the skill set of being able to drive. It's the
skill set of being able to pass. It's the skill set of being able to
facilitate for others. And I think when you can do that, you can take the game
to another height. When he gets that, you'll start to see him really start to
take off.  
  
Q. I know it's very early, but thoughts on how you see the Big Ten shaping
up.  
COACH CREAN: I haven't given it a lot of thought other than I'm sure the
predictions seem right. I haven't really looked at any of the teams that much.
I follow a little bit of the box scores. So I really don't have a great
thought on that.  
  
Q. What sort of progress have you seen from Yogi Ferrell this summer and the
first couple of weeks of practice?  
COACH CREAN: I don't think there's any question that the way the season ended
at Syracuse and the way that they played, especially off ball screens and the
zone, has helped propel him to making points, in the sense of he's going to
become a better shooter off the dribble, going to become a better shooter off
the catch and become even better off the ball screen.  
His shooting has improved tremendously. There's been nobody that has come in
that gets paid to evaluate that hasn't made a comment about his improvement,
especially on the offensive side. He's got to understand that his greatness is
going to come this year from what kind of leadership he provides on a
consistent basis, when it's not comfortable or convenient; can he get to the
basket at a high level, especially with the way these rules are.  
And that's something that he's really started to do a better job of in the
last week in practice but it's got to carry over into the games. I think the
other night shooting two free throws and two defensive rebounds, those would
be very abnormal for where he's going to be during the season. Making six 3s,
I'm not sureif that's‑‑ he's shooting the ball at a high level. He's our most
consistent and highest percentage 3‑point shooter in practice.  
But the leadership part of it, the demands of his teammates, the ability to be
more communicative on the court, both ends of the court, and being able to get
to the foul line and being able to get defensive boards, when our break starts
with him, where he's actually the one with the ball rather than getting it in
an outlet, the numbers are staggering from a year ago. And I think it's got to
be the same type of thing. But there's not one aspect of his game that I
wouldn't say has not improved.  
  
Q. How did Stan's knee react to playing in the scrimmage last week, how has
he come along since then, and what did you like from what you saw from him?  
COACH CREAN: I think he learned a little bit about the difference between
being hurt and injured. When you're injured, that's a whole other situation.  
When you're hurt, sometimes you just gotta be able to deal with it a little
bit and play through it. I think he's learned a little bit about that. He's
come back and had a couple of solid practices, where the one the time that
he's missed being on the court has affected him some in his wind and
conditioning, but not in his game. And right away he's back to being a guy
that can get to the foul line, can get to the basket.  
And still too quiet, still too much locked into his man rather than being
locked into the help defense, still doesn't know all the offensive things that
we're doing yet. But he's been a pretty quick learner.  
But I think the thing he's come back in there, has just played like he's not
favoring anything at all, really trying to play with a really strong, reckless
abandon, which is important.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Chris Collins.  
COACH COLLINS: Obviously for me it's exciting to be here, being in year one,
having an opportunity to be a coach in such a great conference like the Big
Ten, walking around, seeing some of the great coaches in our game.  
I'm looking forward to seeing what we can become as a program this year, our
team is still a little bit of a work in progress. Last year, the team was
besieged with injuries, four kids who had to redshirt, medical redshirts,
probably three of which would have been starters.  
So we're returning some veteran guys coming off injuries. We have a solid
perimeter headed by Drew Crawford as a fifth‑year senior. Certainly we're
going to rely on him to be kind of the rock for our team, an older guy that's
played in a lot of Big Ten games, has been successful at this level.  
And for us right now a lot of things are new. Certainly it's a new style, new
philosophy, a lot of new terminology. I've been very pleased with how our guys
have responded, how hard they're working. Everybody's bought into what we're
trying to do, and I'm hoping as we can continue to progress through the
season, that we can improve and get better, and that's what ‑‑ in order to be
a team that can be successful in the Big Ten we have to continue to improve
and get better. And we need each of our guys‑‑ we're not blessed with a lot of
depth. We only have ten scholarship guys currently healthy and ready to play.
But all of them can contribute and help. And we're going to need everybody as
we head into obviously a tough schedule of games this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Is James Montgomery, III, the most famous player after what happened with
the video?  
COACH COLLINS: I was going to say I don't know if that's a good or bad thing
when a walk‑on/new‑scholarship guy is the most famous guy in the program. But
certainly that was a great moment for us. Anytime‑‑ and I know it happens in a
lot of programs, we're not the only one, but it's one of the things that's
great about college athletics, to be able to reward a guy that is an
engineering major, has worked hard in the program, is a senior, has put in the
time and commitment and to be able to reward him with this in his senior year
was great.  
It makes it worthwhile, what we do as coaches. Forget about the wins and
losses, to see that raw emotion, to see him call his mom and get emotional and
that was really a cool thing.  
  
Q. What has been the biggest challenges in transitioning from the Princeton
to your offensive philosophy?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, I think to their credit and coach Carmody's credit, he
did a great job of instilling that system into the guys. But when you run a
system like that, it's so intricate, and it's something you have to do every
day. And it's pretty regimented in how you cut, how you move.  
And so to kind of get out of a little bit of those things has been an
adjustment. And really, initially, in the spring, the summer, we held off on
putting in a lot of offense because I wanted the guys to really just get out
and play and see kind of the guys I was working with, what they could be good
at. And, really, we concentrated more initially on our defense. And I wanted
them to kind of show what they could do offensively and freelance a little
bit.  
Once we kind of saw what our personnel was and what we were working with, we
kind of tried to develop a system that can be successful for our team. And,
really, to me that's what the essence of coaching is. I think coaching is
about taking the personnel you have and trying to make it successful, what
kind of defense you play, what kind of offense you play. And really I'd be
foolish‑‑ I think you'll probably see some components of what they've done in
the past, because there has been success.  
So we're trying to implement some new things but also stay true to some of the
things maybe that has been good for some of these players. So I think it will
be a little bit of a mixture of both here in this first year.  
  
Q. I've asked this to many of the other coaches in the conference. But
piggybacking on what you just said, what is the overall identity that you're
trying to establish with your team?  
COACH COLLINS: I think in year one, you know, as we're getting started, kind
of the approach I've made, whether it be good or bad‑‑ and it's not all bad.
There's a lot of good. This is a program that was four of the last five years
in the NIT and two years ago is a close loss away from being in the NCAA
Tournament.  
So there was a lot of positives as well. But whether it be good or bad, I
think what we've all tried to do is just get a fresh start. And it's a clean
slate for everyone. It's a whole new staff. A number of players are coming off
injuries. It's a clean slate for them.  
And the main thing I've tried to do more than anything is lay a foundation for
what we want our program to be about, how hard we play, how we practice, the
attention to detail. And those are things that I think carry over time.  
So I think in year one, just creating those standards on a day‑to‑day basis,
can we string two or three really good days of practice together.  
And those are kind of the small victories right now as we head into the season
that I'm looking for and the little improvements along the way. And I've been
fortunate, I have really good leadership. I have co‑captains Drew Crawford,
Dave Sobolewski, guys that have started a lot of games in the Big Ten, have
played at a high level. And I'm fortunate to have a veteran perimeter that I
can lean on as I get started in my first year.  
  
Q. How is the relationship between you and Dave developing and how do you
see that relationship working out with him having run the point for the
majority of the last two years?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, Dave and I have a very good relationship. And the thing
that I love about Dave is he's like a coach on the floor. In order for him to
be successful at this level, he's had to be smart. He's had to be tough. He's
had to learn where he can find his way. And I admire him as a player.  
You'll see physically he's lost about 15 pounds. He's gotten lighter, he's
quicker. He's had a great offseason. And I expect him to be an extension of me
and our staff on the floor.  
And all of you guys know, you can only go as your point guard goes. And every
team has a point guard that commands the team on the floor, that gets them
organized. You're the head of the offense, you point the defense. And we're
expecting him to be obviously a key guy.  
But the main role he has is to be our leader. And leadership, the leader and
the coach has to have a great relationship. And I feel good about the
connection we have, and it's only going to grow with time.  
I've only been here a few months. So the fact that our relationship can only
get stronger is something that I look forward to.  
  
Q. How do you establish yourself recruiting ‑wise in this state and city
that's so competitive for the recruits?  
COACH COLLINS: I think one of the things that's exciting about our situation
is the fact that we are right here in Chicago. I know I'm biased, being from
this area, but I've always felt like the Chicago area and the state of
Illinois is the best top A for basketball talent in the country. If you look
at the numbers, the amount of Division I players that come out of our state
every year‑‑ but not only in Illinois. I think all across the Midwest.  
And I think Northwestern, we're the kind of school, we have a unique niche. We
offer the ability to be in the Big Ten, to play at the highest level of
basketball, but also present a world‑class education. And we're one of a few
schools in the country that offer that, the best of both. And I think there's
a good buzz about our program.  
But I know it's also about getting results on the court. It's not just about a
buzz. And people are excited about us. It's been great going around town,
people looking forward to seeing what we can become as a basketball program.  
But now it's up to us. We've got to go out there and we've gotta do it on the
court. And to do that, it comes from the players. And it's my role to put them
in a position to be successful and then for those guys to go out there and do
it on the court. And we're looking forward now to have that opportunity. It's
that time of year and it's exciting to get started.  
  
Q. I know Alex Olah had a good summer with the Romanian National Team and he
lost some weight, but what have you seen from him in practices this summer?
And do you expect him to be able to provide that offensive post presence that
Northwestern really hasn't had in recent seasons?  
COACH COLLINS: We certainly have high expectations for Alex. Alex is a
talented player. And to be seven feet, 265, 270 pounds, those are some things
you just can't teach. And Alex, he's got good hands. He's got good footwork.  
I think the best thing for Alex, last year he was kind of thrown into the fire
as a true freshman as a big guy in this conference having to play against some
of the best big guys in the country.  
And he got better as the year went on. He got knocked around a little bit
early in the season. As the year went on, he started to adjust, he got better.  
I think the thing I've seen out of Alex is improved confidence. And so much
about basketball and playing basketball as a player is how confident you are.
And I sense him walking around feeling like he's a player that can be
successful at this level. And a lot of times that's half the battle. And he's
going to be our anchor inside. There's no question that we're blessed with a
lot of big bodies on the front line. And we need to establish him. He needs to
be able to give us some points, to give us rebounds and to give us that
physical presence that we're going to need as we head into our conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Coach Patrick Chambers.  
COACH CHAMBERS: What I would say is new beginnings for us, looking forward to
new beginnings. Obviously the last two years we've been working hard. Our
record doesn't indicate how hard these kids have worked. We look forward to a
fresh start, and we look forward to this up coming season. Hopefully it's a
healthy one and we keep all of our guys on the floor and being able to
compete.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. With B.J.'s development from last year, with Tim coming back this year,
how do you see them splitting it up in the back court and how do you see Tim
getting back to where he was a couple of years ago?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Obviously it's exciting to have that dynamic duo to put a Penn
State jersey on this year. I think D.J. learned so much about the point guard
position in general. And now you have two guys that can make plays for
teammates.  
You can't just focus on one or the other. You've got to focus on both those
guys. There's gotta be a lot of space on the floor for other guys to step up
and make plays. D.J. has a great appreciation for the point guard position and
what Tim does. And D.J., by the end of the year, I felt like was a very
capable point guard. I think he did some great things.  
With Tim coming back healthy, what we've done, we did a foreign tour. We've
had those guys play together since the first practice in August because
they've got to learn how to play together. And I think they don't mind if
one's a leading scorer and‑‑ they just want to win basketball games. They're
at that stage. They're mature. They're a little bit older. D.J.'s a redshirt
junior, so technically he's a senior in his mentality and approach.  
So I think you're going to see an older veteran back court that kind of has
been through a lot. One's a transfer; one went through a major injury. Tim
looks very good. 100percent healthy. Played really well in August. He's
playing well right now. I'd say a little bit rusty and that's understandable.  
But moving forward, that should be a back court that a lot of teams should
fear.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for your freshmen this year on the team?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Compete every day in practice. We're going to need them. I
haven't had much depth over the last two years, and I feel like this year we
have some depth.  
But they're freshmen. They're not top five freshmen recruiting class. They're
freshmen. They've got to come every day with the right approach, the right
mentality, to get better, to earn minutes on the floor and to push our
veterans.  
And they've done that. They've pushed Tim, D.J., Ross, every single day, and
that's what those guys want. We have healthy competition in practice. And it's
exciting to see.  
So if they can give us anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes early on and gradually
improve on that, as we start the Big Ten in January, that would make us
definitely nine or ten deep.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is coach John Beilein. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BEILEIN: Good to get to this point of the year where we're ready to
start another season. I like my team. I like the way we practiced. Different
format has allowed us to experiment with some things and give us a little bit
more contact with the players, more access.  
But it's a long season and we still have a long ways to go, even to get ready
for our first games let alone our conference season. But I do like our team. I
like the way we've approached the preseason. But we have a lot of things to
replace. We have five seniors that graduated last year that were incredible
leaders for our team and sacrificed so much for the other guys.  
Now you lose two guys to the first round of the NBA. There's obviously some
replacement to do. At the same time, there's 25 or 30 shots out there. There's
another 80 minutes out there. I think our guys are embracing the opportunities
that they have in front of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Obviously recruiting is very accelerated, Coach, but how have you seen
making it to a national championship affect recruiting since then, please?  
COACH BEILEIN: That's a common question. Recruiting is such a unique science
to it. I think there's been good things and I think it hasn't made a
difference in some other ways as well. Certainly I think we're on a lot of
people's lists. At the same time, everybody has different reasons for choosing
their next university, the university they're going to go to. So I've seen
some really good things, but at times it's maybe not the right fit. So we just
keep doing what we are doing.  
The young men we did have in recruiting probably were not the Trey Burkes and
the Tim Hardaways, weren't on the top of anybody's lists. There's a lot of
different ways to form a good team.  
  
Q. The past few years you've been here, can you sense the target on Michigan
getting bigger from the other Big Ten teams?  
COACH BEILEIN: No, I don't think about that at all. I think all the time that
we are‑‑ we're just trying to be the best that we can be. And we have enough
things to do to grow our program right now let alone worry about any target on
our back. We just keep playing and trying to improve and take each day trying
to improve, really.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of discussion about Glenn perhaps changing
positionally a little bit, moving more toward the perimeter. Is that
happening? And, if so, how is his skill development affecting the process?  
COACH BEILEIN: Really, last year he was not an inside player at all. So he's
been a perimeter the whole time. I think the biggest difference is what I just
alluded to. There's 80 more minutes and there's a good 20 to 30 shots, scoring
opportunities that Trey and Tim rightfully took upon themselves last year that
are wide open. We want him to fill a lot of those opportunities, attacking
from all different sides.  
We can play big. We can play guards‑‑ all guards. We can do a lot of things.
He'll probably be on the floor no matter what we do.  
  
Q. Regarding some of the new rules aimed toward decreasing the physicality
of the game, the Big Ten's a physical league, do you think the league's in any
way being targeted by those rules?  
COACH BEILEIN: The people that have changed the rules over time have really
had a good record at doing this. There's some experimentation probably we
would have preferred at times. But we led the country in not fouling last
year. I think we were number one or number two in not fouling. So I don't
think there's going to be a big change in how we coach.  
And the block charge, I hope it simplifies things. I do not know that it does.
We have to wait. And this is where I defer to the experts and say, okay, if
they think it will work, they've done enough research on it, we just go and we
adjust from there.  
But we've had a scrimmage and inner squad scrimmage. I haven't seen the
difference, in particular, in how the game was called against us. And I think
other teams have a drastic difference. But who knows.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 17, 2013

  

### [Aaron Craft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21919)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Deshaun Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23455)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  50  
Wisconsin ‑ 43

  
THAD MATTA: Well, as I told the team afterwards, I don't know if I've ever
been prouder of a basketball team in terms of you look at this tournament and
you look at this league, and we've gone 21 straight games, and to be standing
atop of it today, last college basketball game of the regular season,
incredible. I mean, that was a hard‑fought basketball game. I thought both
teams were exhausted. We were challenging our guys every time‑out to tell them
you've got one more gear, you've got one more gear, and fortunately for us, we
made some big plays and finally knocked a couple shots down.  
The defense was as good as it could possibly be, but great, great win for our
program, great win for our university, and I'm elated.  
  
Q. When you were down 24 ‑15 at one point before the half, how much did it
help to get that run to just cut it down to one and how much did that help you
carrying that into the rest of the game?   
AARON CRAFT: Yeah, I can't say a few weeks ago we would have responded the
same way that we did tonight. We did a good job of understanding there's a lot
of basketball to be played, and we're capable of coming back, and we have
before this year. We just tried to stick together, stick to the system, not go
solo, and we did a good job of staying to it, and fortunately enough we made
some shots, made a run, got it down to one by halftime, and that helps a lot.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Yeah, we didn't freak out. I mean, we got in the huddle, we
took a deep breath, and we stayed with our system. I know last month we
probably would have freaked out and forced a lot of things, but we stayed in
it, and we kept our head in it, and we made a nice little run.  
  
Q. Aaron, your role as sort of a floor leader on the court, going into the
NCAA Tournament, is that role even more important to make sure guys are
focused and concentrate?  
AARON CRAFT: I don't think it gets any harder. I think the past month or so
we've really looked at it as if we want to accomplish what we want to
accomplish, we can't lose again. Everybody kind of leaned on one another, and
whether it's me or Deshaun or someone else out there doing that, that's what
it takes. As long as we have someone out there keeping us all together and
keeping us focused on the bigger picture, that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Where this team was eight games ago, and I know you guys won this as
freshmen, but from where you came from, does it make this one a little
sweeter, that tournament title?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Yeah, it feels great. It's a great accomplishment. We went
through some battles through the season, some ups and downs, but we never gave
up on each other, and I think this is so special for us as a team, as a
coaching staff, and for the University of Ohio State.  
AARON CRAFT: Yeah, just where we came from and what we've been through this
year, and having no one else really on our side and no one really believing in
us except for the guys on the team and the coaching staff, it really makes you
appreciate and really‑‑ what we accomplished, it's a great, great feat, but at
the same time hopefully there's still more basketball to be played.  
There's a lot of time after the season is over to be very celebratory, but we
have to enjoy this, but at the same time hopefully we can find ways to get
better by next week.  
  
Q. Aaron, how difficult was it to try to raise the tempo against a team like
Wisconsin, and how were you finally able to do it?  
AARON CRAFT: It's always tough. They always do a great job of maintaining the
ball and things like that, just kind of going through their offense. They
don't take too many bad shots, and we tried to push up here and there to try
to get them sped up a little bit. But it all starts with getting stops,
getting clean rebounds and kind of just running with it. We got a couple easy
buckets in transition, and it always helps when you make some shots in the
half court, as well. It gets them to speed up a little bit more towards the
end, and we kind of took advantage.  
  
Q. You got off to a real slow shooting start. Did you get any encouragement
from your team, keep shooting, and about your importance?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Yeah, of course. My teammates and also the coaches always keep
my head in it. You're going to give me one shot, it's going to go down. But at
this stage right now, people know what I can do and the coaches know what I
can do. I can score, but right now it's all about winning and taking care of
your teammates and taking care of what you do out there. You have to do the
other things out there to win ballgames, too.  
  
Q. Considering what you guys lost a year ago with Sully and Will and so on,
to be able to match what you guys did a year ago, 13 ‑5 in the league and
actually do better, win a championship, how has this been able to add up? How
have you guys been able to add up?   
AARON CRAFT: It's been different. Obviously Jared and Will were a big part of
our team last year, not only offensively but defensively, and kind of just
being leaders around. We've done a great job of kind of adjusting it and
growing as the season has gone on. Obviously Deshaun is one of our go‑to guys,
but I think other guys have stepped up along the way. They've gotten the
experience they needed, and that's what it takes to be a good team and to win
big basketball games.  
  
Q. Thoughts about playing down the road in Dayton, and also did you know
anything about Iona, and did either of you watch the five ‑overtime Notre Dame
game with Louisville?   
DESHAUN THOMAS: Yeah, I know Iona, they're a good team, and they're in the
tournament. That's the only thing I know about them. I'm looking forward to
it. I watched a little bit of the Louisville game, and they played hard and
they got the W.  
AARON CRAFT: I mean, they're a great basketball team. There are no bad
basketball teams left. If you make the tournament, you know you have to be
ready to go. We know they like to get up‑and‑down a little bit, obviously they
like to score the ball a lot. Transition and things like that are going to be
very important. And playing in Dayton, you can't have anything better. We're
going to have‑‑ Buckeye Nation travels very well, especially when it's an hour
down the road.  
  
Q. Kind of a low ‑scoring defensive battle like today was, what was the
difference that allowed you to separate yourselves in the final few minutes
there?   
DESHAUN THOMAS: Well, we draw the line. Coach told us in the huddle, the
fatigue got to us, but got to let it all on the table and let it out, and
that's what we did. We got our stops and we got guys who came in and hit big
shots, and that's what this basketball team is all about.  
AARON CRAFT: I think down the stretch we talked to each other and said, hey,
shots might not be falling, but our defense is going to win us this game, and
whether it was forcing a questionable shot or grabbing a big rebound, that's
how you win big basketball games, and that's what we have to tip our hat on,
and we were able to do that tonight.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the play by LaQuinton Ross, a huge second half to
help extend you guys' lead.  
THAD MATTA: Well, I thought Q was tremendous. He did have a couple of timely
field goals for us and a couple big rebounds. You know, that's what we need
from LaQuinton at that spot. Everything he did, he really battled defensively.
We had a choice to make when they put the big fella back in, and we said,
let's go with it, we'll stay with it, see what happens for a couple
possessions. He was down there battling and really, really did a nice job.  
  
Q. You seem to be getting more and more comfortable and more and more
willing to go with a small lineup, not just to counter but to dictate as these
games go on. Why was it working or why was it the thing maybe that turned the
game your way today?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, you know, I think we talked about it at halftime, and we
said there may come a point, because field goals were hard to come. Everybody
looked dead‑legged out there, and there wasn't‑‑ look at the three‑point
shooting percentages combined for both teams, and we were thinking offense. We
were thinking athleticism. We were thinking spacing.  
I thought the guys did a very, very good job with that, and it kind of got
rolling, and we stuck with it.  
  
Q. Why have you been able to or how have you been able to put the pieces
together this year considering what you lost a year ago?  
THAD MATTA: Well, first, these guys have made that part of it easy because
they're great kids, and I think from the standpoint, we said this early in the
season, we didn't know how good we were going to be, but boy, they competed.
It's like, God, they like to compete in practice, and that was a good thing.  
We knew. I knew, there was going to be ups and downs to the season. There
always are. But I honestly think it's a testament to who they are as kids. We
talk about it frequently, just in terms of representing the university. This
team is extremely close. It's very unique to watch a group of guys come
together and what they've done, and I love that about them, and I told them
that's probably been the difference in terms of us playing our best basketball
right now when we need to.  
  
Q. Does it surprise you how they've been able to come together?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, in this league, yeah. You know, from where we were in the
games that we had to win and where we were in those games, surprised but not
shocked because they've competed, they've stuck together. I mean, you can
always tell a happy locker room after practice or a quiet locker room, and
these guys have done that. That's the beauty of coaching, when you see that.  
  
Q. Is there a certain tempo, particularly in the Big Ten, of play that you
guys feel a little bit more comfortable playing, especially moving on outside
of the Big Ten into the NCAA Tournament?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, I don't know if there's a certain‑‑ I think for us,
recognition of when it's time to go and recognition of when it's time to
execute and get the shot we want. I think that's more‑‑ say we're going to
push the tempo. We wanted to run against Wisconsin today. They're a good
transition defense team. You know, we had a couple opportunities to go. We
converted, we didn't convert, but by the same token, the message we've been
trying to pound to these guys is, okay, if it's not there, let's get a great
shot. I think that's kind of the tempo that we'd like to have of the
execution.  
  
Q. As good as the Big Ten has been this year during the regular season, what
should expectations be in your opinion league ‑wide heading into the NCAA
Tournament?   
THAD MATTA: You know, I'll be honest, I haven't looked at this thing. So much
now becomes predicated on match‑ups. I could sit up here and tell you some
teams that I wouldn't want to play because of match‑ups. I know what is
problematic to us. Every coach knows their own issues.  
And sometimes it just happens that way. I remember sitting in this building
six years ago, seven years ago, and when the drawing came up and I saw we were
playing Xavier in the second round, I was like, oh, no, that's not a good one
for us. I knew Xavier. I don't know Notre Dame or Iowa State that well.  
So I think as a coach you know, and I haven't looked at it to say‑‑ you know
what I mean? But I know this: All teams are battle tested. All teams have been
through every conceivable situation. I mean, you look at just the last month,
at the last three minutes of basketball games, and some of the things that
have happened have been crazy. I mean, today with a minute to go or whatever,
I think we're up four or five, whatever it was, and I'm saying to myself, oh,
geez, this could be another highlight moment for something, and I think that's
what this league does for you.  
  
Q. You see Ross as something of an X factor? He seems to be very confident,
and also you don't get to start at the Q this time, but you don't have
Carolina and Kentucky in the bracket when they were Carolina and Kentucky.  
THAD MATTA: Yeah (laughing). You know, I think with LaQuinton, I love his
game. I love his growth. We were just sitting in there talking, and I said,
you're so much more engaged in everything right now, from practice to
shoot‑around to film to all those things. I think that's kind of been the
missing piece of saying, okay, what do I have to do. And now he's starting to
really embrace his role on this basketball team, and he's very, very talented
and a tremendous athlete.  
In terms of going to Dayton, I'm not a big traveler so I love it. We're 1‑2 in
the NCAA Tournament and we beat Davidson and lost to Georgetown one year and
then Siena got us in double overtime. So we've got to change our luck in that
regard, and like I said, we've got to play great basketball.  
  
Q. What happened with Sam? Was it a leg injury or what? And also ‑‑ ankle?  
THAD MATTA: I don't know if he stepped on somebody, but he said he tweaked his
ankle.  
  
Q. After you were able to put him back in, it seemed to make quite a
difference on Dekker, who was starting to get off before Sam went back in the
game.  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, I thought‑‑ number one, Sam has had a great tournament up
here. He has been tremendous. He gave Evans a post‑up in the first half a
little too easy for my liking, but he's long, he's going to challenge those
shots, and he can rebound out of his area.  
And the biggest thing when you get Sam involved, he can guard, if we switch or
whatever he can guard multiple positions, and I like that.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you, did you have to talk to him or make any
adjustment? It seemed like they went after him a little bit because he was
giving away 20, 25 pounds on some of their front line. Did that force you to
do anything differently? Did you talk to him about that?  
THAD MATTA: No, not really. He kind of got caught on those guys, and I just
told him at halftime you've got to fight a little bit harder, force them out
there, and he's very gifted athletically, and I think from the standpoint of‑‑
I like as he continues to progress, Sam is starting to take great pride in his
defense, and that's very exciting to me.  
  
Q. It's such a grind in the Big Ten. I know your team is based on defense,
but do you see maybe some more free ‑flowing offense out there now that
everybody is not going to know everything you want to do and all your sets?   
THAD MATTA: You know, I don't know. I think the one thing I've learned in the
NCAA Tournament, you've got to score in the half court. The defense is as good
as what we've just seen, especially you're set in‑‑ I don't think we play
until Friday. Iona is going to have time to get us down, we're going to have
time to get them down. It shouldn't be too many secrets, but you know me, I
mean, if guys can make plays‑‑ that's what I was begging guys to do today. I
said, hey, man, just make a play. Somebody just make a play, and fortunately Q
did, and that was big for us.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 17, 2013

  

### [Mike Bruesewitz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22079)

### [Traevon Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25054)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  50  
Wisconsin ‑ 43

  
BO RYAN: Well, I thought we had a chance to run the gauntlet, but just didn't
have quite enough in us. I know our guys got them to take some pretty tough
shots for the most part. You look at a stat, and you say a team goes 1 for 16,
and you go, wow, you've really got a great chance. So you know, we tried to
get them to take contested shots. Didn't get the rebounds off of some of them.
We got beat physically inside a little bit, so I think that told a lot on the
offensive glass.  
But I really liked the way we got after it. We paid for the miscues, and we
still have to make shots, man.  
  
Q. I know today's game didn't know how you wanted it to, but overall
impressions of the weekend. Do you feel pretty good about where you guys stand
as you get ready for the NCAA Tournament?  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Yeah, I mean, we played well. You know, things didn't go our
way today. We've got some good momentum going into the tournament, and just
got to put this one behind us, kind of have amnesia and get back to work on
Monday. Go back home and get right back to it because now we've got the big
dance and we've got to take care of business there, too.  
TRAEVON JACKSON: Yeah, I mean, Mike just said it best. We didn't make enough
plays personally. I didn't make enough plays down the stretch. I didn't put
our team in the right position to score, and we only scored six points
combined for the end of both halves, and that falls on the point guard. Just
got to learn from it and move on.  
  
Q. I know you're going to have a quick turnaround to get ready, but I know
this championship, a chance to win it, meant something for you guys. How
disappointing is it to not be able to get this one in the books?  
RYAN EVANS: It's a disappointment. We definitely wanted to leave here with
some hardware, but moving forward, we've got the NCAA Tournament. It's a
bigger thing. And I'm looking forward to that.  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Yeah, you play every game to win. Just disappointing.  
  
Q. Ryan, like coach said, you guys played some great defense, forced some
tough looks. How much of an emphasis did that put on rebounding and the few
offensive rebounds that they got that really extended some key possessions?  
RYAN EVANS: I mean, every possession counts, we know that, whether it's a
turnover or offensive rebound. So there's always emphasis on those areas in
the game.  
Like I said, every one counts. They were able to get their hands on a couple
loose balls, and that could have been the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Ryan and Traevon, the last seven minutes you guys went without a field
goal. Just wondering, did you notice something change or some of them rattled
in and out, but what was the biggest difference in those last seven minutes
where they kind of took control?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: Well, I think we got some of the looks we wanted. Personally
for me I got some of the looks I wanted, I just kind of rushed them a little
bit. The shots that I did have, they were at the top of the key, towards the
top of the key, they were going in, they were going comfortable. But some of
the shots that I had at the end of the game weren't good shots. So like I
said, that falls on me. But other than that, I mean, a couple balls just
rattled in and out, and sometimes the ball goes in, sometimes it doesn't.  
RYAN EVANS: Looking back, when shots don't fall, you just try to go inside or
get to the free‑throw line, drive a little bit and maybe get something going.
Looking back, we probably didn't do that enough. But shots fell in the other
games, so just one of those things.  
  
Q. This question goes to the seniors. I know every year is different, but
can you remember this year's tournament being the most physically demanding on
your guys from the standpoint of fatigue?  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: I mean, for us personally, yeah. This is as far as we've been
in the tournament in our careers. More minutes you play, obviously the more
physically demanding it is.  
RYAN EVANS: Yeah, like Mike said, this is the farthest we've been since we've
been here, and it was definitely physical. We took down the Michigan team and
the Indiana team, so we know we can beat anyone in the country moving forward.
So like we said, we're looking forward to the selection show, see what our
seed is.  
  
Q. Ryan, following up on that, people might look at your record and say
there's 11 losses there. What do you see in this team that makes you think
that it can make a long run in the NCAA Tournament?  
RYAN EVANS: Well, just looking at what we've done. We normally get up for the
bigger games. We've got guys that are ready to play in the bigger games. We
took down top seeds all year, so it's a lot to look forward to.  
  
Q. Ryan and tray, Ohio State didn't end the game shooting particularly well
when you look at the final numbers, but how would you rate your overall
defensive performance as a team today?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: I thought we played well defensively. We switched and a lot
of things. I think the turning point in the game was when LaQuinton Ross, he
got that offensive rebound, and that was on me, and I think he really stepped
up for them. That was just‑‑ they just got the extra second hustle points and
second chance points. We played good defense, they just got the hustle points
on us.  
RYAN EVANS: Yeah, I think we played good defense, as well. They might have
played a little bit better defense. In a game like this, only 50 points being
scored by the winner, it's a defensive game. Shots aren't falling.  
So they had the edge on a couple easy possessions there on a couple loose
balls, and that's what got them the win.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about how physical this tournament was. Is it
a benefit getting this far in the Big Ten Tournament? Does it help going in or
not?  
BO RYAN: Well, unless I missed something growing up, I always wanted to play.
So play. Our guys like to play. You should see some of our practices.  
Yeah, I'm talking about practice. (Laughter).  
Yeah, we've come in and lost the first game and kind of humbly went home and
got ready for the next, and fortunately we get the third season. We got pretty
far here in the second season and not far enough, but I'd rather be playing.
Playing is good. Depends on how fast our turnaround is, where you go, that
type of thing.  
  
Q. What did you think of Frank's performance throughout the weekend? He was
pretty efficient all around?  
BO RYAN: Yeah, his numbers, some things defensively he'd like to have back, so
you guys see those numbers, I see the other. So he's getting closer. He's
still going to need better defense from him, but his numbers shooting wise and
rebounding‑‑ coaches are never totally happy. I'm not trading him, though.  
  
Q. Thad has been using his small lineup more and more the last part of the
season. I wonder if you could talk generally about how that affects the game
and also the effect that LaQuinton Ross had in the last few minutes of the
game today?  
BO RYAN: Well, he hit the three earlier. That wasn't in the last through
minutes. But tray was honest. He missed the block‑out assignment there. He had
him. So they made us pay, so that's an opportunity basket there that he took
advantage of, but it wasn't because‑‑ because of the way we were exchanging,
size for them didn't matter to us because there are times where George was
blocking out Ravenel if you remember, especially in the first half.  
So that didn't affect us. We went small, too, for a while. You know, Ben's
three off the curl and catch, and Mike's three, they were two pretty good
shots when it was a four‑point game. I thought Mike's was in. That ball was
halfway down and out. You get one of those to go, who knows.  
But I thought we matched that pretty well. I mean, you can't force a team that
shoots threes the way they do into one for whatever without working. I mean,
you have to work to make teams take tough threes, to shoot that number. But
look how much better we were than them; I mean, we were 3 for 18.  
  
Q. Going into the NCAA Tournament, what do you feel most confident about
your team and what perhaps concerns you the most about your team going into
that tournament?  
BO RYAN: Well, you know, at times inconsistency, but as I look at tapes on
everybody else, every team goes through the offensive droughts, the X number
of minutes without a field goal, the X number‑‑ and every time you have an
extended one, it usually‑‑ you usually have to pay for that. So we've caused
those on other teams, other teams have done that to us. But I feel good that
our guys defensively will at least work. Going into the tournament they picked
up for one another a lot better. They've done some really good things. I think
in order to have teammates believing in them on defense, you've got to believe
in one another to be a good defensive team.  
So then on offense we've got to execute a little bit better, get some shots to
go down. We proved in this tournament that we can make some shots against some
pretty good teams. Last time I looked, Michigan and Indiana were pretty good:
So we're going into the tournament, different opponents, different area
probably, whatever. This is when you start practice, you kind of think
conference and you think conference tournament, then you hope you're in the
NCAA based on what you do during the year. Our guys earned a trip. Let's see
what we can do with it.  
  
Q. How many Big Ten teams do you think have a chance of winning the national
championship?  
BO RYAN: Any of them that go in it. I don't know how you can say they
wouldn't‑‑ how can you say a team doesn't have a chance? Every team that goes
into it has a chance to advance to the second, to the third, to the fourth, to
the fifth, to the sixth game. So we just root for each other until we play
each other.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  61  
Michigan State - 58

  
TOM IZZO: Well, disappointed. You know, I think we had some chances, and yet
they just played a little smarter than us down the stretch. And I might as
well start out with saying it was the correct call on that play. I don't think
it was intentional. We got beat up top, and just felt like it was going to be
a lay‑up, so he reached out. And I've got absolutely no problem with the call.
I thought I could see that from where I was. I guess they reviewed it and
reviewed it and reviewed it. That's the first thing.  
Some of our players on the floor thought it was the right call, so hats off to
them. For once in my life, the officials were correct, first time.  
I thought when you look at the stat sheet, we did a‑‑ we just got in each
other's way. We did some good things. We have B.J. here and he did some good
things, missed some shots, and at least he did some things defensively that we
wanted to do and rebounded a little bit. It's a shame that Nix had such a
productive game in some ways and yet not in others.  
If you look at their team, we did a decent job on Thomas. I thought we did a
great job on him. We were guarding him, gave him a couple shots early, made
some adjustments, that was our doing, not APs. But we did not do a very good
job on Craft, and he beat us in a different way. The first time he beat us
getting to the hole. He almost never got to the hole and this time he beat us
with his jump shot. Those are about the only two guys that had really had any
impact. We did a pretty good job on Smith, pretty good job on Thompson, pretty
good jot on pretty good job Scott. I guess they did a pretty good on us.  
Just disappointing because I think we could have played well enough to win,
but we did not play smart enough.  
  
Q. Branden, Ohio State said one of the things they thought they could go
after you guys on was forcing you to make switches on defense, if they could
get their offense moving that you could make some mistakes. Was that something
you were concerned about, making your decisions and making your switches
quickly on defense?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I'd say that really wasn't something we were concerned about,
because after the Iowa game we were definitely prepared for them. We played
them twice, and we just went back to what we always worked on and walked
through it on the switching. So I would say that definitely wasn't a concern.
It was just miscommunication on certain plays, but we could have been better.  
  
Q. For both of you, what did you see as the biggest difference in the second
half in terms of offensive execution and just things being really bogged
down?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: I think we was getting the ball inside. When we get the ball
inside, Gary and Keith and our guards can knock down shots.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I would say just what AP said, definitely when we get the ball
into Nix and a lot of our guys, a lot of great things happen, especially when
the ball is in Nix's hands and he made some great plays for us. I'd say when
the ball doesn't go on the side, definitely our offense is going well.  
  
Q. Adreian, what was going through your mind on the attempted block when you
kind of grabbed the rim there?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: When I went for the block, Nix went up under me and I didn't
want to fall on my head so I grabbed the rim.  
  
Q. I imagine you heard about Bill Carmody. Thoughts on him not coming back
to NU?  
TOM IZZO: You know, I understand we're in a profession where it's win or not.
I swear to God the guy is a hell of a coach and even a better person, and I'm
not going to get into all the logistics of everything because everyone has got
to make their own decision, but sometimes fate isn't with you. I've never seen
a guy go through more injuries to key people. I hope they know what they're
doing. I'm sure they do because he is a hell of a coach, and he's really good
for our profession. You know, he's been a head of the Big Ten and I've had a
chance to deal with him. I called him this morning. It saddens me, sickens me.  
I understand that‑‑ I mean, George Perles sent me a note the first day I got
the job, you will be fired, it's just a matter of when, so understand that. I
think there's a reality and truth to that. A little different from last year's
situation for me. I understand some of it.  
But poor guy, about two or three times I thought had teams that were going to
get to the NCAA Tournament, and then the injuries just mounted up, and this
year's was almost‑‑ it was incredible. So I feel bad. I hope he stays in
coaching because he is a hell of a coach.  
  
Q. You've had teams that have won this tournament, you've had teams that
have gotten beat and made it to the Final Four. What's the secret from this
point now to next week and getting your team to move on to the next step.  
TOM IZZO: Well, I think what you do is you harp on little things. Somebody
brought up AP's thing. It was a weird deal. He didn't grab the rim for any
other reason. He kind of got undercut a little bit by his own guy, it wasn't
one of their guys. Two points ends up pretty valuable. Nix's thing at the end,
and then we almost survived that a little bit, and then we don't get a
rebound.  
I mean, I think what you do, there's the difference at one‑and‑done time. You
have to somehow find a way to make your guys understand that the mistake at
the beginning of the game is the same as the mistake at the end of the game,
and you don't get to make a lot of mistakes when you're playing good people,
unless that team happens to make more than you. But I'd rather wish on what I
do than hope that they play worse than we play.  
One‑and‑done time, some can handle it, some can't. I think the hardest thing
is that's when you really need some leadership to make guys realize that, and
that's what I'll use this game as because I'm sure I'm going to be able to
find four or five incidences in the game.  
We played pretty hard. That was an interesting question. We've never had
trouble switching, and we did today. Branden politely answered it, and we had
a few miscommunications. I think we got caught up in personal battles a little
bit, and you can't do that in these games.  
I'm going to use this a lot, and hopefully it'll pay some dividends.  
  
Q. The Big Ten is so physical and you guys beat each other up pretty well.
Do you think that'll help or hurt Big Ten teams in the tournament?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I think those that are smart enough to figure out that when
you get in the other tournament you're going to get officials from a lot of
different places that never saw you play, and I think one thing we've got to
do this week is make sure players understand you've got to learn how to deal
with the game in the first five minutes of the game. Some are going to let it
go more than others. This year was a tougher year than most in this league. I
mean, it was physical. I don't know if you saw Harris, but I think he popped
another shoulder. You could see on that one play.  
I think it helps you. I still think the toughest teams survive, and we weren't
the toughest team today. We played hard, got no problem with that. I didn't
think we were quite as tough as we normally are. We had some loose balls that
where we really needed them we didn't get, even though we out rebounded them.
But today one of the weird things is we were not the smartest, and they were.
They got what they deserve.  
  
Q. Gary's shoulder pops out. What is the status of it and how much did that
affect him and your team going forward, him being hobbled a little bit?  
TOM IZZO: Well, it was a problem because I needed him in there to defend, and
I asked him, and of course he said he's okay.  
I mean, could you see it? Did you see it when it happened? Yeah, it was
obvious.  
But he's done it before and stayed in and made a couple shots. But he had that
one wide open in the corner, and I don't know where it's at. I didn't talk to
him much about it after. He's played with it all year. It's something he has
to deal with. But tough kid. It's a shame because he just didn't get in a
rhythm offensively today.  
  
Q. For years your teams have been known as the best inbounding teams in
basketball, and that certainly has not been the case. Can you put your finger
on it?  
TOM IZZO: Well, yeah, I can. I don't think we've worked on it hard enough, and
that's my job. And then I sometimes put Lezelle in a bad position having him
take it out. I thought we had something that we saw on film, and I think we
did have it and we just made some crazy plays.  
Yeah, I think that falls on me to be honest with you. You know, you start
picking apart what you can work on, what you can't work on. You don't want to
wear people out. And I think I've neglected that area because we were one of
the best, and we weren't a lot this year. So that'll be something I'll take
into the tournament, get a couple extra days here and try to do a better job
of it.  
  
Q. Those of us that have seen Big Ten play all season have seen a lot of
those potential flagrant ones fouled, whoever it is at the end of the game,
and then not called, maybe up in the air. What is your thought on that? Do you
think it should have been in? Is that just typical at that point of the
game?  
TOM IZZO: I didn't see the replay. I must say that I am totally 3 million
percent against this head stuff, I mean, the elbow. That's not what was called
here. I am totally against that. I've seen it change games, I've seen it
change plays, I've seen it change momentum. On accidental things early in the
year, I mean, they tried to revive it a little bit, you've got guys coaching
to it. This thing is out of whack, I think personally. Just my own personal
opinion. I'm not allowed to have it much, but this is one thing that if I had
a vote for the day, let the officials do their job. If there's a flagrant foul
and they see it‑‑ but an accidental thing just because you raised your arms,
that wasn't this call. From what I saw from the bench, he went by him and he
tried to grab him and he got him up in the air, and I had no problem with the
call. I told him when he came over it was going to be that, from my view. But
sometimes the view makes it worse, sometimes better. So when they didn't and
then it came back, I just have no problem with the call. I have a big problem
with those elbowing things. I think that is borderline, for me‑‑ I keep
wanting to state me because I don't want to get anybody else in trouble. I'd
like to take trouble myself. I think it's ridiculous. Make sure now nobody
writes I think that call was ridiculous because that had nothing to do with‑‑
that was not the call here. You asked me a question about the elbow to the
head, right? Flagrant?  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
TOM IZZO: You know, I don't know how many of those. I just want to make sure
I'm emphasizing the elbowing is the one I have a major problem with. I have no
problem with the one that was called today.  
  
Q. Playing in such a tough conference and all the teams know each other very
well, do you look forward to the tournament, facing teams that you haven't
seen in a while?  
TOM IZZO: Yes. You know, my God, we built my program together, he knows it
better than I do. Some of these guys I've gone against now for ten years. It's
hard when you've got good players and even teams and you know what each
other's gum is. It's hard.  
I am really looking forward to playing somebody else, and I think all the Big
Ten teams are, and deservedly so. We've beaten the hell out of each other, and
we really, really, really have, and I think it's going to help all of us in
the end, as you asked. I really believe the toughest team is the one that's
been through the most, the one that can sit there at a pregame or at a
halftime and say we've done this, we've been there, we've played these guys.
It's going to benefit.  
Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing anybody. I'd play the Lakers tomorrow
instead of some of the teams I've played recently.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

WISCONSIN  68  
INDIANA - 56

  
COACH CREAN: We made a couple of comebacks in this game, and we did an
excellent job of that, and every time we made that ocmeback with what was
working for us, we got a way from it.  
We had some critical turnovers at key times. We had some critical second shots
we gave up at key times. The biggest story for us is we've been defending the
three the last six, seven games at an incredibly high level, and today we
didn't. We didn't. And they got some kick‑out threes and things of that
nature, but we got a way from what had been making us better. We started to
over‑help again, and tried to cover for one another when there was no need to
do it.  
Those are the things we just can't do. I mean, it's possession by possession
games. And there were times we got the pace going in a good way and there were
other times we just have to bare down and play.  
They are all correctible, because they are all things that we do‑‑ but they
are areas that we just have to be very, very consistent with. But Wisconsin
played well. They shot the ball very well. They made some open ones, and they
also made some tough ones, there's no doubt about that. And they answered the
bell every time we made a comeback.  
But the biggest disappointment is every time we had something working, like I
said, we had to come back in and we didn't stick with it enough.  
  
Q. This was a goal but not the goal; despite the loss, how do you feel going
into that event?  
CODY ZELLER: Obviously we wanted to get this win today. We'll learn from it.
We'll figure out what we did wrong. We'll make the corrections and get ready
for next week because that's what's most important.  
  
Q. In the first game against Wisconsin, you had 18 points in the first half.
What was different about the way they played you in this game?  
CODY ZELLER: Nothing, nothing too big. You know, I always want to be
aggressive. You know, they do a nice job inside of not fouling me, going into
the lane a lot. They weren't falling as well as they were.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it, you made a couple charges at the end and they
would respond right away. How frustrating is it to claw back in the game and
see them gain more separation?  
VICTOR OLADIPO: It was tough. Credit them, they did a gate job down the
stretch, and you know, we had some key turnovers like Coach said that we have
to look back and see what we did wrong and fix it and get ready for the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Victor, how comfortable are you that this team is playing its best
basketball at the right time of year?  
VICTOR OLADIPO: A little bit. Like Cody said, we really wanted to win this
one. We are going to have to go back and watch the film and see what we did
wrong, correct it, and get ready for the big tournament, because we want to be
successful in that, as well.  
  
Q. Christian, are you shocked with what Evans has done? Every time he's
played you guys he's been a great player.  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: We made some tough shots and we tried to take the ball out
of his hands and stuff like that. He made some tough shots, hats off to him.  
  
Q. How much do you think other teams are going to look at Wisconsin, the way
they played you guys, as a way to blueprint a way to game plan for your
team?  
CODY ZELLER: They have been trying to slow it down on us all year. We always
want to speed up the pace, and you know, with our pressure, if we are getting
after them on the defensive end, getting deflections, then that's how we want
to play. We didn't do enough of that and enough to speed up the pace tonight,
which is why we got beat.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the problem on offense was stagnant ball movement?
Looked like at times you were reversing the ball and then Wisconsin went after
those charges and seemed like the ball slowed down a little bit.  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: We knew what we had to do. We knew we had to move the ball
in order to be successful against Wisconsin. We just tried to force the ball
in; it happens.  
  
Q. This is 12 in a row for Wisconsin over Indiana. Is there any explanation
for that? I know you had some lean years as you rebuilt the program, but they
seemed to really give you guys problems.  
COACH CREAN: They are a very good team, extremely well coached, disciplined,
great staffs, inside‑outside scoring, great balance, and just an all‑around
great team, they are an excellent team and have been for a long, long time. As
long as he's the coach there, they will be.  
  
Q. The last time I saw you, you were turning your focus maybe a game a
little bit, your first year at Indiana, you won your first conference game and
you were struggling since then, all these years later, can you give me a sense
of why you guys are where you are right now? You come in as a very high seed
and you're probably going to have a really good run in the Tournament; is
there thing that you can point to over the years that's brought you to this
point?  
COACH CREAN: Consistency of work habits; getting better team, constantly
because the talent upgrade has been most importantly because the work ethic
continues to get better.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Victor. Are you comfortable that your team is
playing its best basketball right now?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I guess we just need to improve. Bottom line is there's
certain things we can get better at. That's an all of tough question when you
get beat today like this, but if you asked me the question yesterday, I
probably would have had a different answer. But we didn't play as well today,
so it's just a matter of going and looking at the film, making the corrections
that we need to make and moving forward.  
  
Q. How much stock do you put into winning a conference tournament when
you're trying to win a National Championship? I think in 2003, you guys didn't
win the USA tournament ‑‑  
COACH CREAN: That's a hypothetical in the sense of 2003. My mind-set is you
try to win every game and take the next one as it comes, and certainly we
would have liked to have won it.  
But it doesn't undo what we have done to this point. It doesn't undo any of
that. We have had an excellent season. There's room for growth, there's no
doubt about that. But we would have liked to have played better today, no
question.  
  
Q. You had an extended conversation with Coach Ryan, can you talk at all
about ‑‑   
COACH CREAN: I told him he's a great coach and always looked up to him and
what he's done in his program. I hope they go a long way in the NCAA
Tournament and I hope his father starts feeling better.  
  
Q. Bill Carmody got fired today from Northwestern. Like to know your
thoughts on a fellow Big Ten coach.  
COACH CREAN: First thing that came to my mind is when Rob Ryan lost his job
with the Dallas Cowboys, he said he would be out of work about five minutes. I
doubt Bill Carmody will say that, but that should be the case.  
He's a great basketball coach. He's done a phenomenal job at that university,
did a phenomenal job long before that. He should be one of the more
higher‑demand coaches, and all anybody needs to look at is what Bruce Webber
has done this year at Kansas State after leaving Illinois.  
Bill Carmody should get the same opportunity at another league, there's a lot
of prestigious leagues out there and get an opportunity to coach in, and I
would be shocked if he didn't have great success. I don't know him well
personally but I know him enough to have great respect for him. When I see on
film and going against him, I have incredible respect for him.  
  
Q. Quick turnaround and different styles you've played over the past couple
of days, how does that prep the team for the tournament?  
COACH CREAN: I think it always helps, yeah. I think it's a matter of
understanding. But we didn't do some of the things that we do on a consistent
basis today, and that hurt us as much as anything. They played an outstanding
game, but like I said at the beginning, you've got to understand what got you
there, and we did a great job coming back and then we got away from that a
little bit. But we can play better. We will play better. We have played better
and we are going to go find out next week.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2013

  

### [Aaron Craft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21919)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Deshaun Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23455)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  61  
Michigan State ‑ 58

  
THAD MATTA: Well, I thought, like all Big Ten games, that was a high powered
college basketball game. I thought our guys did a good job of keeping their
composure. It was a game of runs. They got up on us, we got up on them.  
Down the stretch I thought Aaron and Shannon did a good job of controlling the
tempo, but once again, I think our defense, especially there in the second
half, getting our hands on the balls, challenging shots, they made
adjustments, we had to make adjustments on the fly. And I thought our guys did
a good job of that. Great win for us.  
  
Q. Aaron, what sort of mentality did you come out of the locker room with as
you came to the second half and really were aggressive early?  
AARON CRAFT: Just trying to believe in myself. I think we have a lot of plays
that we can execute that either get me open shots or I can help create for
somebody else, and tonight I found some openings and was able to knock down
some shots and that definitely opened up other things for, whether it was
Deshaun or guys like LaQuinton that can knock down shots, as well?  
  
Q. Aaron, the first half the offense just looked like you couldn't get any
avenues to drive into that defense. The team settled for quite a few more
threes than you guys average. How did you guys manage to open up Michigan
State's defense in the second half to allow you to get inside?  
AARON CRAFT: I think we just needed to have that better understanding of
what's a good three and what's a three we can pass down to maybe get another
pass and really try to find ways to get into the lane.  
At times we have really good spacing that really opens up avenues and lanes
for myself and others to drive in, and those are good threes, kind of outside
looking in type threes, and knock down some pull‑ups, that always helps, as
well.  
  
Q. Aaron, when Michigan State played you in Columbus, you talked about some
things you had noticed in the first game you could exploit. Were there things
you noticed from that game that you exploited tonight or some of the same old
things you did in Columbus?  
AARON CRAFT: We definitely knew they were going to try to change the way they
guarded the ball screens in general, obviously with the number of lay‑ups that
we were able to get in the second game.  
In the first half you definitely kind of saw them plugging more, getting in
the gaps more, and things like that. In the second half, we just tried to do a
better job of spacing and getting them to move side to side and getting them
out of those gaps. And we were able to get inside of them.  
  
Q. Deshaun, everybody writes about your scoring, but it's your rebounding
the last couple of minutes, a couple of critical rebounds, and it sounds
strange, you're the team's leading rebounder and nobody ever writes about
that. Why do you think that is?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: I really don't know. I'm just being so aggressive. Coach
always preaches rebounds against this team. We have to rebound. They've got
great bigs, athletic, especially Payne, who gets a lot of rebounds. And I just
attacked the rim and was just aggressive on the boards, blocking out, and make
sure we get the ball.  
  
Q. Deshaun, a lot of what you were getting offensively in the first half was
threes, and they weren't going down. In the second half, I don't think you
took your first three until there was ten minutes left. What did you try to do
in the second half compared to the first to try to be more effective
scoring?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Really it was all this guy right here, just space out and let
him go to work. I was being patient, and coach said you're going to knock one
down, just to be patient. I got one off the dribble, pump fake, because I knew
he was supplying at me, Payne. So I got shot fake, pull up off the dribble,
and I knocked it down.  
  
Q. Aaron, I know you made a lot of outside shots against Gonzaga last year
in the tournament, but were you in the zone today? And also for Deshaun, talk
about the shot that used up a lot of rim but went down and clinched the
game.  
AARON CRAFT: I had felt pretty good today. First shot I had was an air ball so
that wasn't the most ideal start to the game. We did a good job of regrouping
and staying focused. Going down one at half, that's a good position to be in.
We thought we could put the ball in the basket a little more. It always helps
getting to the rim. And then with the way they were guarding, we got some open
mid‑range shots, able to knock those down, and it just helps our team as a
whole.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Yeah, that shot I hit, that was a great play by coach and
great screen by Evan Ravenel. It was one of those just being ready to shoot.
Listening to coach on the sideline when we were running up and down, he said
you're going to knock one down, just be patient. Finally I did, and it went
in.  
  
Q. Deshaun, everybody talks about Aaron's defense, but what does this
performance say about what he's capable of doing offensively?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: It's great. It helps this team a lot. The way he can
penetrate, make the defense collapse to him, he can kick it out to shooters.
It's very important. And by him being aggressive in a score like that can
really help. And it helps our team to the next game and the next game by his
aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Deshaun, if the game with Wisconsin was the low point of the season
earlier this year, does this give it a little more juice going into tomorrow,
getting them a third time?  
DESHAUN THOMAS: I mean, it is. It's a little juice. All we've got to do now is
study it on film. We know what we've got to do and get our rest tonight and
get ready to play. We've got to be ready from the tip off against them,
because last game we weren't kind of ready. But now we've got to be ready and
focused because we know Wisconsin is going to hold that ball and try to run
the clock to the end. Every possession is a key, and we've got to be focusing
on that.  
  
Q. Thad, your teams always look like they're ready to go at this time of the
year, which is obviously the most crucial point. What role has Aaron played in
this team's ability to hit its stride right now?  
THAD MATTA: You know, it's hard to put into words, and just in terms of‑‑ you
look at what he has accomplished thus far in his career at Ohio State and just
the wins, the big plays that he's made, in coaching you don't get to coach a
lot of guys like him just from A to Z and everything he stands for. He kind of
makes us go on both ends of the floor, obviously when he's making shots, but a
lot of people panicked when he wasn't scoring in the middle of the season, and
I'm like, I don't have a problem with it, it'll come. He loves these type of
games, there's no question about it. He's big for us.  
  
Q. At the Columbus game and this one, your players have talked about things
you picked up on in Michigan State and were able to exploit. When you talked
coming into this game, what were those things that you saw and you really hit
with them on that we can exploit?  
THAD MATTA: Well, I'll tell you, with the quick turnaround we had, it was
transition defense, rebounding, and having a flow to our offense. They were
switching a lot, we wanted to try to make them make decisions, and that was‑‑
there were other little things through the scouting. But we had to rebound,
get them back in transition, not give them anything easy and be precise in
what we were trying to do offensively.  
  
Q. The one thing you didn't mention was stopping Derrick Nix, so I imagine
‑‑  
THAD MATTA: Well, because we didn't stop him.  
  
Q. You figured that out at halftime, obviously. He had seven shot attempts
and ten points in the first half. I think he had one shot attempt and all free
throws in the second half. What did you do to ‑‑  
THAD MATTA: Well, you know, what's funny is they kicked out, and that was one
of the adjustments we had to make because he and Payne‑‑ I mean, Payne had
three assists today. They were kicking out and they hit a couple threes on us.
I think Appling had one and Harris had one. We didn't pull the trigger where
we needed to on both of them.  
But late game they went back to him, and boy, he's just such a load down there
and has such a great touch, a great feel.  
  
Q. I guess early January you're coming off a loss to Illinois, I don't think
at that point you had any wins that people would maybe describe as quality
wins and some questioned whether your team was equipped to do anything of
significance this year. Did you wonder that?  
THAD MATTA: You know, I didn't. I think when you lose what we lost last year,
okay, we've got one senior on this team, and he doesn't start for us. I
thought it was going to be a process. I thought that in some of the games we
played early in the season we had some great stretches, but we weren't able to
put it all together for‑‑ I don't know if anybody plays perfect for 40
minutes, but we were playing 22 minutes‑‑ at Duke we played a solid 32
minutes, but we couldn't get the last eight minutes. Even Kansas we had some
great runs through the stretch there.  
And I think that was my biggest focus, like if this team can put it together I
think we've got a chance to be pretty good.  
The hard part of going through 18, now 20 games in the Big Ten is it beats you
up. I mean, this is as brutal as I've ever gone through. But very proud of how
these guys have finished and understood, and they've gotten so much better in
practice and paying attention. They've gotten so much better in watching film,
just the questions, that sort of thing. And as a coach that always gives you
hope like, okay, I think they're getting it.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
THAD MATTA: I don't know. I think that when we stay connected, both
offensively and defensively, when we don't panic, when things don't go well‑‑
I think we can play with anybody in the country. I mean, to win whatever we've
won in a row right now in this league and some of the things we've had to do,
I thinkthat's probably the thing that I'm most proud of, and we're not done
yet, I know that. But as I told them when our backs were against the wall,
you've answered the call for a while here.  
  
Q. You've had some battles with Northwestern lately. I imagine you've heard
that Bill Carmody was let go.  
THAD MATTA: They told me that before the game, yeah.  
  
Q. A few thoughts on him not coming back?  
THAD MATTA: Well, I'll tell you, I've said‑‑ two things: Number one, I think
Bill Carmody maybe has the best offensive mind of any coach I've ever seen in
my life. And the second thing is, knock on wood, I think he could be the most
unlucky with the injuries just in the time that I've been nine years in this
league. It is amazing to see the things that have happened to his teams, and
they happened in such a timely fashion. I mean, I think we were No.1 in the
country a couple years ago, and John Shurna runs into a basket support and has
a concussion, can't play against us, we go down to the wire, and he was
playing at such a high level.  
You look at who could win and keep coaching those guys and stay competitive
with what he lost this year, it's mindboggling. I think Bill‑‑ you get to know
guys, I think he's one of the greatest human beings, and like I said, I think
he can coach as well as anybody.  
But unfortunately that's kind of, I guess, how this business goes. But I hate
to see it. I hate to see that happen to anybody.  
  
Q. One of the first things you mentioned at IU was the points off turnovers.
The margin was just about as great tonight. Was that a decisive thing?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, the great thing is first we didn't turn it over and give
them opportunities. Yeah, I think our ability to take care of the basketball
was probably the difference. I know we had a couple‑‑ looked like the keystone
cops running around down there in transition. We had two turnovers in
transition. We've got to clean that up.  
But that was something that was huge. Aaron's steal on the inbounds going down
lane and up was big. We needed to convert when we had numbers, that's for
sure. Aaron made a great read on that one. He went back to his football days.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

WISCONSIN  68  
INDIANA - 56

  
COACH RYAN: I just again can't tell you how proud I am of the defensive effort
on a very good offensive team. So every guy that went in there, was pretty
much sticking to the rules and trying to force Indiana to make some tough
shots. I thought our guys accomplished that, and then we had streaks where we
were hitting them. Fortunately made enough free throws at the end to keep that
separation.  
Again, it's nice to be able to play in a championship game. I know our guys
are looking forward to that, so are we, and we'll see what happens here in the
next game.  
  
Q. Ryan, you were struggling to the point at the free throw line where you
were starting to take jumpshots. How did you keep looking forward and not
allow that to affect your confidence and your overall game?  
RYAN EVANS: This man here. He gave me the courage to go up here and try
something new. I think it's been effective to this point. I'm no longer
shooting 40 percent. So I mean, it's a good thing right now, and I'm going to
stick with it for now.  
  
Q. Mike and Jared, first, can you talk about Jared's overall play,
especially on the defensive end? And then Jared, you had not even looked to
shoot a three ‑pointer until the one that you had open from the wing; what
made you take that one at that juncture?   
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Worked extremely hard, everybody talks about Cody Zeller and
he's a great player, he really is. He puts up numbers and there's a reason
he'll probably be a lottery pick. But Berg (ph) did a great job, he set the
tone early, knocked a couple balls away. Forced him into some tougher shots
early, and just kind of made life miserable for him.  
And when he knocked down that three, he shot it and I knew it was cash. I was
excited when he shot it, because I was like, he needs to start knocking these
down because he's been doing that for the last three or four years, just
finally come to fruition.  
JARED BERGGREN: You think I wasn't looking? I was looking, just biding my
time. Just picking my spots. I mean, you know, it was open a couple times, my
teammates told me, keep looking for it. Coach told me be aggressive, knock
that down. I was just waiting for a good one, a great shot, not a good shot.
You know, teammates caught me wide open and finally knocked them down. Felt
good.  
  
Q. Ryan, what's the key to you guys being able to slow Indiana down?  
RYAN EVANS: Defense. I mean, I think we played great defense. You know, that
forces them to take better shots, or if they want to go and take bad shots and
play fast, that's on them. But I think it's the defense, defensive side of the
ball.  
  
Q. Mike, there was a sequence in the game, I think Sam had the seven ‑point
run, but a sequence when you guys were beating them down the court and beating
them on the fast break. What do you think people watching the game, watching
you beat them in transition were thinking?  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Hey, those boys are athletic. (Laughter) That's all I got for
ya. (Laughter)?  
  
Q. Ryan, can you just talk about your overall day and how effective you were
and how important you felt like that had to be for this team to get going
early for you to be successful?  
RYAN EVANS: I was just trying to start off inside, guys finding me. Trae
making sure I get the ball.  
Then, you know, really feeding off of kicking it out and guys like Mike and
Sam coming in and hitting threes, and that's a lot that we don't talk about is
guys like Frank and Sam coming in and stepping up, how big that is for us,
guys off the bench. That's needed if you want to win a championship in any
tournament.  
  
Q. Ryan, you blocked Oladipo's shot three times today. How hard is it to
stay in front and play defense on a guy as quick and athletic as he is?  
RYAN EVANS: He's a great player. Reminds me a lot of Russell Westbrook. I just
have a lot of respect for him. I've seen him work his way up, up the ranks.
They really start at the bottom as a team, and him as an individual, and he's
really worked his way up. I was just trying to stay in front of him the best I
can, and you know, I was able to do that this game, not always, but this game
I was successful at that.  
  
Q. Mike, give you another hanging curve over the plate. Indiana is
considered a team that can win a National Championship. You've beaten them
twice. What do you think it says about this team ‑‑  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Just means we have a bunch of guys that want to play and play
hard. Kind of how college basketball has gone this whole year. I think we have
had numerous times a change in No.1, and I think it's going to make for a
great NCAA Tournament, because I don't think a whole lot of 1‑seeds are going
to be making the Final Four. If they do, it's great, but it's a wide open
thing and anybody can beat anybody on any night. We have to make sure we bring
our AGame otherwise we might be one of those teams.  
  
Q. Jared and Mike, could you talk about the energy Ryan provided on the
offensive end tonight and how important that was to staying in pace with
Indiana throughout the game?  
JARED BERGGREN: Yeah, he was huge for us. We were getting him a lot of touches
inside and kind of running our offense through him a little bit. Same thing
yesterday, too. Yesterday he had a lot of big plays where he was either
scoring or finding teammates. He had a lot of assists.  
Again with four assists today, that's doing a good job of finding teammates
and helping make plays for others, so it was a good job by him.  
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: Ryan, yeah, he just stepped up, he's been making plays and
when he does that we are a much better team. And same thing with everybody,
Sam, Trey has been playing better‑‑ we are playing our best basketball at the
end of the season and that's what you want to do.  
  
Q. Mike, that prediction that there won't be a lot of 1 ‑seeds, are you a
practice bracketologist? Is that based on intensive study?   
MIKE BRUESEWITZ: I'll let you guys decide all that. I was just giving y'all a
quote. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Jared, do you have more confidence coming into this game knowing that you
have this streak of 11 in a row?  
JARED BERGGREN: We don't really think about that. We just take it one game at
a time. We wanted to come down here to try to win a championship. Indiana
happened to be the next game, so we just take it one game at a time.  
But I mean, you know, we knew that we were capable of having success against
this team; if we stuck to our rules and played our style of basketball, we are
were able to do that today to come up with a win.  
  
Q. How has Ryan been able to continue to play with confidence?  
COACH RYAN: Well, it was A, B Or C. A was the jumpshot, Hal Greer‑style. Hal
Greer had a little jump. It wasn't quite as accentuated, for the older people
in the room, as Ryan's is. Ryan's is his game jumpshot. Hal had a little
jumper, mini‑jumper.  
B was Globetrotter, kick the ball in. Drop kick, you drop it down, you kick it
up. And third was underhand. So it was A, B Or C. Ryan chose A. He's okay with
it. His numbers are up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Frank's contribution, particularly in the first
half?  
COACH RYAN: Well, on the glass, I thought he did a pretty good job. Zeller is
a very good player. I'm glad we had two bigs to be able to operate in there. I
was glad we had two bigs yesterday. I'm sure we'll be glad‑‑ we'll need six
tomorrow, no matter who we're playing.  
But he stayed within himself. He didn't try to do things that he couldn't.
Good ball fakes. Took care of the ball. Got on the glass. Played D. That's all
we ask for. And if you can hit some shots while you're doing all that, that's
a bonus.  
  
Q. Just going back maybe to yesterday real quick, you guys came in at
halftime yesterday ‑‑ hitting shots, but I still got the impression Michigan
was in a load of trouble. There was a lot of offense in this game and still
got the same feeling that Indiana was in trouble. Help me get my head around
your team. Why is it you are able to neutralize whatever they have been doing,
the way you've been, regardless of your offensive putout?   
COACH RYAN: Okay, but I'm not sure what you're referring to‑‑  
  
Q. I still got the impression you were in the flow regardless if you had
points on the board or not ‑‑ the contrast between the two days.   
COACH RYAN: It's still points per possession, and sometimes teams will shoot a
little quicker and sometimes we'll shoot a little quicker if we have an open
look.  
So much is made about pace and everything else, you know, I never heard one
fan at the Palestra when Penn would hold the ball on Villanova in the 50s tees
and 60s, there's no shot clock, there's no anything, I saw a lot of pass and
cut, pass and cut‑‑ I'm sure if you get some footage on that, send it to me,
because I don't have any; pass and cut, move. And if a shot opened up right
away, you take the shot. If it doesn't, you work for the next one.  
So the game wasn't any different here today than any team I've coached. You
take advantage of what you can. You try to take good opportunities every trip
down. You try to limit another team's good opportunities, and it's that
constant clash. And the game never changes. And my guys understand that.  
I've never out‑coached anyone. I've never out‑maneuvered anyone,
out‑strategized anyone. I've got to be careful going much further, Barry is
here, but I get to coach and work with these guys and teach, and with the
assistants. You know, as long as they keep listening, keep working, we'll keep
doing the things that we do, just try to do them better all the time. There
aren't any secrets.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Mike's play, he's kind of a thorn in the side of
India narcotics the stat line does not pop off the page, often doesn't for him
but he made all the hustle plays. What did you think when he made that steal,
to me that kind of sealed it for your team.  
COACH RYAN: He's 'Johnny On the Spot.' He's a guy that's always opportunistic.
He is so happy to be playing this year after what happened earlier. You give
somebody a second lease on his basketball life, so to speak, and he's not
going to waste a minute of it.  
It's not like he doesn't play like that before last year, but he's just a guy,
high energy, and he's going to try to make good things happen without going
outside of himself and hurting his teammates behind him defensively or
offensively.  
  
Q. I don't know if you heard but Northwestern announced today that Bill
Carmody is not going to come back. Your thoughts on that?  
COACH RYAN: Well, first of all, I know administrators have a profession, the
university officials have a profession, and coaches have a profession. So
whatever decisions are made in that profession, I'm not going to get into.  
I can tell you this: Bill has not forgotten anything about the game. He knows
the game. His system is so tough to prepare for, and, you know, he did a lot
of good things. I know he's very well respected in the coaching field and I
know he's a guy that has done our profession a lot of good and he's made us
proud.  
All I can say is I wish Bill the best of luck because I have a hell of a lot
of respect for him. Whatever decisions are made are made by other people, but
you won't find a coach that won't tell you that they respect Bill Carmody‑‑
that they don't respect; they all do, top to bottom.  
  
Q. What is it about your team that makes it so tough for opponents like
Indiana to beat you seems like it's been a consistent thing, especially when
you get to the tournament.  
COACH RYAN: When we scored those‑‑ we had 10‑points with about, what, two
minutes to go yesterday; I don't think anybody was preparing that kind of a
question. You see what I'm getting at.  
There are just things in this game where no matter how you try to explain
them, they defy explanation or reason. And other things are because the coach
is so obstinate he's only going to accept certain things. So maybe it's a
combination of that.  
And you have players that are willing to listen, willing to work and willing
to buy in. So there are guys that know a lot more in this profession than I do
that have their teams go out there sometimes and look like they have never
played together before.  
We have had moments where we looked like we never played together. You just
have to play the percentages, you've got to keep driving, you've got to keep
working it, and when you're surrounded with good people, it sure makes it a
lot easier. It's never easy, just makes it easier.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Shavon Shields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25003)

### [Brandon Ubel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21854)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

OHIO STATE  71  
NEBRASKA - 50

  
COACH MILES: Congratulations to Ohio State. I thought we had a good start.
Just couldn't get the clock to run fast enough to get out of that first half.
But have to credit Ohio State. That defensive pressure made all the
difference.  
  
Q. Brandon, was the turnover thing kind of puzzling? You know they play good
defense but you guys have just not had those in clusters like that, was it
confusing or puzzling?  
BRANDON UBEL: It was definitely something that that's kind of what the game
came down to was us not handling the pressure well. You know, kind of being
loose with the ball at times; it ended up costing us the game.  
Obviously it's frustrating when you're turning the ball over and they are
turning that into buckets on the other end. We just weren't tight with our
games, and you know, kind of let that pressure get to us a little bit.  
  
Q. Shavon, Ohio State in the second half only missed five shots from the
floor. Is that one of those cases where they were just red shot, or was it a
combination of you guys having some lapses on defense as well?  
SHAVON SHIELDS: I just think it was our turnovers, like Brandon said, our
turnovers, they were getting wide open shots. Once you get on a roll, or once
they get on a roll, they are hard to stop.  
So if we would have eliminated turnovers, I think we played them well in the
halfcourt. But once they got in transition, that kind of killed us.  
  
Q. Brandon, maybe just reflect a little bit on the season and what you guys
were able to accomplish. A lot of people didn't expect a whole lot; do you
feel as you leave the program you set a really good foundation?  
BRANDON UBEL: I hope so. Our goal this season was to exceed other people's
expectations. Obviously we expected more out of ourselves. We believed in
ourselves in the locker room, but you know, we wanted to prove everybody else
wrong. We did that I guess to a degree, but we definitely had higher
aspirations than what we came out with.  
But I think as the season went on, we were playing better and better
basketball. You know, everybody on the team came to practice every day and
wanted to get better. I think you saw that as the season went on. Hopefully
that will carry on to the next season and the next season, and guys like
Shavon will kind of carry the torch and keep building on what we started.  
  
Q. Coach, Ohio State got those three free throws at the end right before the
half. Did you feel like that could potentially be a turning point in the game,
especially with how Ohio State came out to start the second half?  
COACH MILES: Yeah, we had Shavon with two fouls, so we didn't want to risk a
third.  
So we put a young guy in there, and he went down and he traveled on one end
and I think he was trying to make up for it on the other end and just have to
let that play go, just have to have amnesia sometimes. That was a critical
play; it hurt us.  
But at the same time, we kind of did it to ourselves to start the second half.
Their ability to get in transition and hurt us off their defensive pressure
was the key to the game.  
  
Q. When you look back at the entire season, is it safe to say your team
exceeded expectations, your expectations?  
COACH MILES: I want what the seniors wanted. Those guys wanted to play in the
postseason, and it's that simple.  
You know, we have to build our own tradition, our own expectation. If we sit
here and say, oh, it's okay, we had a pretty good year, because everybody
thought we maybe exceeded expectation, we are just digging our own grave.  
We don't live in that world. That's not our language. We are going to build
our own future, our own tradition. And those guys wanted to play postseason,
and like Brandon said, we fell short.  
  
Q. The fatigue factor, mentally or physically or both, was that evident in
the second half?  
COACH MILES: I thought the Ohio State factor was a bigger factor than
anything. Those guys are really quick. They can put a lot of pressure on you
and make it difficult for you to play. I think that was the deal.  
  
Q. If you wouldn't mind, just talk about the year you got from Ray and his
emergence, in a lot of ways, he became the Big Ten's 'Ironman.'  
COACH MILES: He did. I think he's ready for any triathlete in the world at
this point in time.  
Ray, I just kept saying, take him out, but he never looks tired. I always
found somebody else that looked a little tired.  
But Ray just competed as well as he could. He gave us everything that you
could ask for. He's a great kid. He wants to do so well and just he'll miss
two shots in a row and just breaks his heart.  
You see it in his eyes and his body language, and yet we are making him, you
know, raw screen constantly, guard some of the best players in the Big Ten,
and do it without any breaks and don't make any mistakes while you're at it,
right. That's a lot to expect out of a young guy.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the conference itself, the calibre of play, the
style of play, the competitiveness.  
COACH MILES: Well, I just glanced at it, so don't hold me to the math, but it
looked like today, if you didn't include the Huskers, the average win was
about 24 wins out of these teams. That's pretty impressive stuff with seven of
those teams‑‑ that's a lot of wins. You know, we were holding down the mean.  
But it's a phenomenal league. I think it's only getting better. I watched
today, and I was just ‑‑ Sam Thompson. I think he's just developed and
improved. He didn't look as good shooting the ball earlier in the year as he
does now; every time he jumped up, it looked like it was going to go in.  
And when you look at that athleticism and that quickness and those things, and
now you throw a great three‑point shooter on top of it, and if he can develop
that consistently, and put up more volume; his numbers are solid, buy doesn't
have a lot of them to go by, wow, what an element a guy like that has. And
he's, you know, an elite player on that team in a way, so pretty amazing
league.  
  
Q. You often hear this time of year coaches talk about how they can hardly
wait until next season when their season comes to an end. As you sit up there
tonight, is that your mind ‑set, just going with the fact of what you saw here
towards the end of the year?   
COACH MILES: I'm excited about our future, there's no doubt about it. I think
we've got some talent on the way.  
But, you know, we've got a lot of work to do to replace the heart and soul of
this group, and that's what we lost with Dylan Talley, Brandon Ubel, André
Almeida mean, and we lost a lot of veteran leadership.  
So we are going to have to develop some of that. That's going to take some
time, and it could come at a cost, I don't think there's any question about
it. But I'm looking forward to improving our program and I think we have guys
that are really invested.  
One neat thing I thought you saw in a lot of Husker home games this year is we
had three guys red‑shirting at the end of the berth up cheering every play and
up into the games and want to go support their teams and they gave us their
best shot in practice too, and we needed that. There's some bright things but
we are going to miss these guys, too.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE  59  
IOWA - 56

  
COACH McCAFFERY: I've been doing this a long time. I've coached in a lot of
games. I've coached in a lot of tournaments. I've coached favorites; I've
coached underdogs. This team deserved a better fate tonight.  
  
Q. Devyn, just talk about the last possession, last shot.  
DEVYN MARBLE: We were trying to get Josh the ball. He kind of got stuck in the
corner, so thought dribble handed off to him, probably would have faded
out‑of‑bounds. It was a position I didn't want to put him in. So I just turned
and knew I had to get the shot over Keith, he's like 6‑0, 6‑1\. It looked
good, and sometimes they fall and sometimes they don't.  
  
Q. Just asked the Michigan State players; how physical was that game
compared to the Big Ten and other games you've played in your career?  
ERIC MAY: Yeah, Michigan State is always a physical game. We knew that coming
in. The key is to match their physicality, and I think we did a good job of
that. They are a tough team, but you have to really sustain that the whole
game, though.  
DEVYN MARBLE: I played this team freshman yearin the Big Ten Tournament. That
was the most physical game I'd ever been in until today with the same team. So
usually when we play each other, it's a very physical game.  
  
Q. Seemed like Michigan State kept coming up with dagger after dagger, big
plays, turnover, and you came back and responded late in the half. What was
going on in the second half and what was your mind ‑set like as they kept
seemed to get a nail‑in‑the‑coffin‑type play over and over?   
DEVYN MARBLE: We just tried to keep our poise. We knew they were going to make
a run, they are a really good team. The goal for us is to try to limit the
runs and cut it to like 8‑0 runs and like that, you don't want it to go 12‑2
and 14‑0, stuff like that, so just try to limit their runs.  
Plus, we had the lead so all we had to do was keep our poise and try to make
plays down the stretch, also. But they knocked down the shots and we didn't.  
ERIC MAY: I mean, kind of like Coach said, they made some big shots, and we
had some shots that looked like they were good, but the key is to just stay
calm. I don't think we ever‑‑ there's maybe a minute or two we got a little
riled up but we held our composure and had a chance there.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't know your fate until Sunday in terms of the
tournament, but you were so close to getting this one, one shot short.  
ERIC MAY: I think we deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament. I'm really proud of
my team. We are a really good team and we have fought all season long.
Whenever we are playing, we are going to play our tails off next week,
wherever we are playing.  
  
Q. Not sure how much you do want to talk about this, but the play where
Harris got a foul call, was able to go to the line for a free throw, is that
what you're talking about with deserving a better fate?  
COACH McCAFFERY: Yeah, that's part of it.  
  
Q. I'll take that onus off you about the referee; I saw what you saw, as
well. Is there another reason that stuck out in your mind why this happened
tonight beside that?  
COACH McCAFFERY: We turned the ball over too much. We had 19 turnovers. We
feet like coming in, we needed to turn it over less than we did the last time
we played them; we turned it over 18, and turned it over 19 and we needed to
limit their offensive rebounding and they got 16.  
So the two areas didn't happen like we had hoped. But, I thought our defense
overall was really good. And I thought we were able to run. Thought our
execution was pretty good. In the second half, we had a little more difficulty
running our stuff, a little harder. But overall, you know, proud of how we
kept fighting.  
  
Q. You led for most of the game, did you sense maybe your team's youth
caught up with them down the stretch?  
COACH McCAFFERY: No. Had nothing to do with it. Absolutely nothing to do with
it. Nothing at all to do with it.  
  
Q. Seemed like some of their shots were short, do you think there was any
fatigue today having to play back ‑to‑back days, or no?   
COACH McCAFFERY: I don't think it was that, no. I think there were other
factors involved.  
  
Q. When Appling, hit the 3 to give them the lead late going into that time
‑out, what did you say to the team in that time‑out right after they took that
lead?   
COACH McCAFFERY: You know, I just challenged them. You know they are going to
make some big shots. They are good players. They have a really good team. We
were still right there. It was not time to panic. There was plenty of time
left. Just don't panic. We have got to get a shot, get a stop, okay.  
You turn the ball over against this team and it's usually two points. So it's
get a shot, get a stop, is really all we were trying to do.  
  
Q. Might be off my number, are there 48 teams better than Iowa?  
COACH McCAFFERY: No, not at all. I think when you analyze it, you look at all
of the factors involved. Starting with the quality of our league, which is
phenomenal, top to bottom. You're seeing that this week. You've seen it all
year long. You've seen it with the number of rankings we have and the way we
have played against all the best teams, how we have fought when we've lost,
how we've fought when we've won, how we've continued to improve. I think it's
clear with what we have done that we should be in the NCAA Tournament.  
I respect the job that the committee has. I know it's difficult. I know there
are a lot of other folks that feel the same way. But I think, you know, when
you look at all the numbers, I think they bear out that we should be in. I
think if you want to lock into any one particular number, you look at all of
them. I think if you do that, you'll see where we stack up.  
  
Q. After a game like this, what do you say to your team? Tom Izzo sat up
there with you are sitting and said Iowa deserved to win the game; we stole
the game. What's your message to your ballclub after a game like this?  
COACH McCAFFERY: That would be hard to say right now.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Indiana  80  
Illinois  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach.  
TOM CREAN: We're excited about the win. We thought we defended at a very high
level to hold a really good shooting team and a high scoring team when they
get their offense rolling the way they're capable of, to hold them down in
this game.  
Our whole focus was getting ready to play our best basketball today and
hopefully we play even better basketball tomorrow. Never to look ahead and to
stay totally locked into the game at hand.  
And I'm excited about the way our guys played. They should be too. And because
they started off in a great way, they continued to play at a high level, and
we closed the game the last seven minutes, not only defending pretty well, but
scoring very well. That's the key. To go 21‑24 from the foul line, to rebound
the ball the way that we did, those are big, big things for us. So we're
excited about the victory.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Victor and Cody, obviously you guys have been the subject of a lot of
national headlines, but how important are some of the guys like Christian and
Will and Jordan and some of the other guys on this team?  
VICTOR OLADIPO: They're huge. It takes our whole team to win. When guys off
the bench step up and when Christian and Jordan step up, it's huge for us.
They're very capable of that. Without them, we can't win.  
CODY ZELLER: It's great. The guys that we have on this team are great as far
as everyone is humble, no one's ‑‑ there's no jealousy at all, which makes us
a tough team to beat just because we're such a close group. Whether it's me
that has 20 or Will or Jordan or anyone else, it doesn't really matter to any
of us, as long as we win.  
  
Q. For any of you, I think it was 60 ‑52 coming out of the under eight
timeout and obviously a lot of people were kind of thinking about the game at
home. What was it that just allowed you to close the game out. You hit them
with a five point burst and they called timeout and from there you just kind
of had control.   
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: We learned from that game. We looked at the film last night
and we looked at some things. We know we shouldn't have done some things. We
let one get away. We knew what they do and we kept grinding it out and kept
playing.  
  
Q. For Victor, you spent a lot of time on Brandon Paul tonight. He was 2
‑13\. Just talk about the job that you did on him to help your teammates and
the pride you take defending the other team's best player.   
VICTOR OLADIPO: It was huge. But again I couldn't have done a great job
without my teammates. Cody did a great job of blitzing. And I wasn't the only
one, Will guarded him and Remy as well. He's a great player and we tried to
slow him down. He takes a lot of shots in order for them to win. So when you
go against someone like that you got to force them to take tough shots and I
think we did a great job of doing that.  
  
Q. For Christian, what's the season been like for you as the team's added so
many new players, so much young talent?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: It's been great. We got a lot of guys that can score. Any
time that you have a team like we have, it's definitely been a fun year for
me.  
  
Q. Victor, at what point did you decide to go 360 on that dunk and is that
the best one you got?  
VICTOR OLADIPO: I know I was going to do something when I caught it, but I
don't know, it was just a last second thought. I thought about it while I was
in the air, so I just kind of turned around when I was in the air. And, no,
that's not my best one.  
  
Q. Cody, in the first half it seemed like for a time the ball got into you
in the paint almost every single possession. How much of a priority was that
in this game?  
CODY ZELLER: It's a priority for us every game, whether it's me or Christian
getting it inside. They were double teaming, so I was trying to find the open
guy. But even if I don't score it, it opens up a lot of things for our
shooters on the outside. And I thought we did a nice job of that and it opened
up a lot.  
  
Q. You guys were really pushing the pace at the beginning of the game.
Obviously that's a priority for you guys in most of your games, but how much
more of a priority was that with this Illini team?  
VICTOR OLADIPO: It was huge. By watching film we know that when we do that we
can excel on both ends of the floor. So they're a good team and we know
they're going to make tough shots, so we were just trying to run it down on
the other end as fast as we can to change the tempo of the game, because we
like going up‑and‑down.  
  
Q. Victor, talk about Jordan, he only had two points, but he played a really
good defensive game. Talk about the role that he played. And also couple words
about Sheehey coming off the bench going 4 ‑4\.   
VICTOR OLADIPO: Jordan, he went 0‑2, but he had a great defensive game and he
also had seven assists. So he helped us win. He does a great job of that. He's
one of our leaders, he's one of our seniors, and he's very capable of changing
the game as well with points. When we can win and he only has what? Two points
and seven assists? It just shows how deep our team is and how capable he is of
still playing defense at this time.  
And Will Sheehey, he's just Will Sheehey. He's a sparkplug. He comes off the
bench and he plays defense. He makes tough shots and he rebounds. He's one of
our leaders as well. So when they play at a high level, our team plays at a
high level.  
  
Q. For any of you, what did you do better defensively? What did you feel
better about just in terms of just game plan today?  
CODY ZELLER: I thought we were very active, especially on the ball screens.
Sometimes, especially for me, it's, we're trying to blow out their screens and
I thought we were aggressive overall.  
We had a lot of deflections, which is always a big key for us. I thought we
were just active. The beauty of that is it leads into our offense I thought it
really got our offense going.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You may return to the locker room. Take questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Same question I had for Victor and Cody, obviously those guys have been
the subject of a lot of headlines, but how important are the veterans on this
team, guys like Christian and Jordan in terms of the success y'all have had?  
TOM CREAN: I think we have a team like we have had that's answered the bell
all year long. Responded from tough games. And sitting where we're sitting,
the team has been the headline maker. Because these guys are so unselfish and
they're so selfless with one another and the way that they work, the way that
they share the credit, the way that they play offensively and defensively.  
We have been in the top percentages of offense the entire year and we have
been anywhere in the Top‑20 with the defense. I don't think that happens if
you don't have a team committed to both. I think it showed again today in five
guys in double figures, Jordan Hulls with seven assists, no turnovers inside
the game with tough assignments, great looks. Jeremy Hollowell coming in and
playing solid, Remy Abell playing, making some big plays, Will Sheehey we
consider a starter and he played that way. So I don't think it's anything
uncharacteristic for us.  
  
Q. Your ball reversal today and also having that rudder of Jordan to where
he's not scoring, but he doesn't get frustrated and try to press.  
TOM CREAN: I think we're the kind of team that if you take somebody away from
the game, and you don't want them to be the one that scores, there's still so
many other guys that can play, because of the ball movement, because we
understand that when we're at our best we're a ball reversal team.  
There's certain things we want to get early, there's certain things we want to
get late, but everything in between is about that ball spraying all over the
court and reversing, being reversed.  
  
Q. What specifically were you doing on defense? It seemed like you were
really blitzing the ball screens and getting your bigs out very
aggressively.  
TOM CREAN: I think they were aggressive. I think that's very important. We got
guys that can cover a lot of ground when they step out. So there's certain
things that, whether we're blitzing or switching, these guys have done a good
job all year of being game plan specific, being very, very concept driven in
how we guard. So we don't have to spend a lot of time on something to prepare
for a game. And they're good at it. But they want to play an aggressive,
attacking style and that's, that was the number one key on the board today is
attack on both ends.  
  
Q. Almost regardless of what happens going forward you're probably going to
be the only team in the country on Selection Sunday with at least nine Top ‑50
wins and no losses outside of the Top‑50\. Do you think that's enough to where
you've already secured a No. 1 seed regardless of what happens tomorrow or
Sunday?  
TOM CREAN: I haven't thought about that as much, but I was asked ‑‑ well not
just like that‑‑ after the Michigan game‑‑ but much the same. I would think
that we have‑‑ I would hope we have done enough. I think when you have the
league the way that it is and you win it outright the way that we did. And I
think one of the bigger things is the way we played on the road and the only
home losses that Ohio State, Michigan, and Michigan State have are to us. And
that says a lot, because those are three teams that can win a national
championship and have been considered that way most of the year. So I would
hope that we have, but that just remains to be seen.  
  
Q. You talked about the defensive effort in particular. What did rebounding
do for you guys? I think you controlled the boards most of the game, you
finished plus 12 in that regard. How important was that?  
TOM CREAN: The key was that we had our rebounding going from the beginning and
we were 26‑10 at half and we were getting some putbacks. And where we had our
lull in the second half is we weren't rebounding the way that we totally
needed to. Then we got that in order and we really closed the game right in
the last seven minutes and had our biggest lead of the game with one minute to
go.  
So rebounding is a huge part of that. We kept stressing it all week, we had 53
rebounds in the Michigan game and if we only get 52 we might have lost the
game. So everyone of those rebounds matter. I think our guys really, really
understand how important rebounding on both ends are and specifically how
important guard rebounding is.  
  
Q. What did you guys do so much better this time than the first meeting in
getting Cody established?  
TOM CREAN: We closed the game better and we established him early. We kept it
going late. He's a better player, we're a better team, they're a better team.
But we played a much better time and score situation this game. These guys
have seen the last seven and a half minutes of that game numerous times. It's
not the buzzer beater, that was what obviously was the result, but it was the
last seven and a half minutes of that game at Illinois that really hurt us.  
And we didn't start the game great. Eight of their first 11 were off
turnovers.  
So we went back through and as we did after that game and we watched the
beginning of the game and we watched the end of the game, but we watched the
30, 35 things, clips where we really did go a great job. Because you don't get
in games against these high level opponents without doing a lot of really good
things.  
So our guys understand fully and when we don't get away from it, we're really
good. Where the ball needs to go early, middle, late.  
  
Q. Do you feel like that the Big ‑10 obviously would be the best conference
of the year, do you feel like eight teams is a possibility for them for the
NCAA?  
TOM CREAN: I would hope so. Yeah. At least. I mean, I think Iowa's a NCAA
tournament team. I have all year. I think Minnesota is. I'm not sure, I
haven't read any bubble forecasts or anything like that. We just played one.
We just played a high level team.  
So I don't think there's any question that Iowa and Minnesota are highly
deserving of being in that. The other ones are probably pretty much givens.  
  
Q. Jordan hasn't been known for his defense that much. But today he did a
terrific job on D.J. Richardson. It was a big turned around from the first
game. Talk about how important that late development is.  
TOM CREAN: We made some adjustments. We have been making some adjustments in
our week, all week long, it was to really make sure that we knew what we were
doing when the ball's being penetrated and driven. And you cannot let somebody
like D.J. Richardson loose.  
And in the first game against us they both, they were, I believe, 14 of 29.
And today we were able to hold them to 4‑23\. That's the story of the game.
It's not just one person, when I look at this and how this is Victor's second
straight double double and Jordan has the seven assists and Cody and Will and
all these different guys, but it's a team. It's team defense.  
I think that there's some individual matchups, certainly, but when that ball's
being penetrated, it is team defense and I thought our guys did a really good
job of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

OHIO STATE  71  
NEBRASKA - 50

  
COACH MATTA: Well, we got off to a slow start. I thought once we focused in
and got our minds where they needed to be, we were very effective, especially
with the defense. Second half, shooting 77 percent, we had a better pace to
our offense, which was what we needed.  
You know, I thought our bench did a great job coming in and getting us ready.
Our contributing, Shannon was good at the start; Q came in, banged some shots
there. And honestly, just a great team win for Ohio State.  
  
Q. Coaches Miles from Nebraska mentioned last night after their game that
one of the good things they have done this year is not turn the ball over much
and I don't think that you guys turned them over a lot in the first two games
this year. Why was there such a difference tonight?  
AARON CRAFT: After that first four minutes where they were kind of shooting
any shot they wanted and knocking any shot down, we just went back to playing
Ohio State defense and that's when we are at our best.  
When we can keep guys in front us to make them make more decisions than they
are used to and normal to, I think that's when guys tend to make poor
decisions, kind of throw back passes and things like that, that always helps.  
  
Q. Deshaun, Thad said, once we got our minds into the game, in the first
time ‑out, he was really doing a lot of screaming at you. Did you not feel
like you were into the game maybe the way you should have been at the start?
  
DESHAUN THOMAS: No, it was ‑‑ I don't think I was. You know, I took a bad shot
early. Didn't run a play all the way through, and then I scored on. But Coach
grabbed me, took me, out and my teammates and my coaches‑‑ just calm down, get
your mind right and things going to come to you and just relax.  
And in the course of the game, everything was flowing. Got a couple easy
buckets down low. Teammates got a couple passes; hit Craft on a three, and
that's when you have your game right. Your game right you got stops and steals
and our offense got clicking.  
  
Q. Deshaun, what was going through your mind when you were sitting out that
early? You haven't been benched that early in a long, long time.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Actually, I was just cheering on my teammates. Sam got an easy
bucket to the lay‑in and I was just thinking about getting my mind right,
that's what I was thinking on the bench, and that's what I did, and cheering
on my teammates.  
  
Q. Aaron, what happens to the other team when Shannon checks in and all of a
sudden seems like the temperature in the building goes up about 80 degrees? Do
you see a different look on their face or do they get panicked when they have
to go against both of you out there?  
AARON CRAFT: I don't think you see too much but you can definitely tell the
energy level rises. I hope I did it‑‑ that's how I was when I was a freshman
when I was doing it but I don't think I was doing it as well as Shannon is.  
He did a phenomenal job coming in and really getting us going. It wasn't just
the defense either. He hit a big bull up and hit another big three which
really got us going and that's awesome and that's something that all great
teams need, that little lift off the bench to get us going.  
  
Q. Aaron, you always hear people say, they would be great ‑‑ get a couple
days off when you see that first time‑out and‑‑ get the impression that's not
really something that you think is a consideration? I'm just wondering, is
Thad's demeanor during these games, is that one reason why you guys are really
successful in this tournament?   
AARON CRAFT: Obviously that really stems from the top and comes down. Coach is
one of the biggest competitors that I know. Whatever it is, if we are in a
game, we are going to play as well as we can hopefully and we are going to try
to win. We are not here to just kind of have fun and be in a new city.  
We try to come in and prepare just like any other game, and we want to‑‑ you
know, this is an opportunity to hopefully put another banner up in the gym and
that's the way to look at it, trying to take it one game at a time and
hopefully we can be there at the end again.  
  
Q. This isn't the first time Coach has had to light in you guys to get you
guys kick started; why is it that it maybe takes you a few minutes to get
going?  
AARON CRAFT: We are just trying to make sure that Coach is into the game
really. (Laughter) We don't want him to be sleeping on the sidelines early,
either, because we know if we can get him going, he's going to get us going.
That's really worked out well for us. (Laughing).  
But no, it's on us. I think we have done a better job recently of getting
ourselves ready to go and it's been a while since we've played in a new
environment and things like that. But we don't have any more excuses.  
We have a big game tomorrow against whoever we play. It's going to be a tough
battle. We can't afford to not be ready to go at the beginning, otherwise,
maybe we won't be able to come back.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, it was mentioned coming in here that I don't
think Illinois has played on this floor in this shooting environment. You guys
didn't have a chance at a shootaround, you were out early but you couldn't
touch the balls until an hour before tip. What did you think, did it take
getting used to, and when you shoot 77 percent in the second half, I guess you
like this place now.  
DESHAUN THOMAS: Well, I mean, you know, we didn't have enough time to get in
early to shoot. But I mean, we are all basketball players. We know we've got
to take our shooting really serious and we feel kind of comfortable.  
The one thing that we did out there, we shared the ball as a team and we hit
the right spots and we knocked down the jumpers. Q came in, Craft had one at
the top. Sam Thompson had a great shooting night. But we feel kind of
comfortable. This is what we love and we take shooting very serious.  
  
Q. With the way that Shannon comes in and impacts games five minutes or
whenever you choose to put him in, obviously there are a lot of people
identity there that wonder why you don't start him. Do you just like ‑‑ do you
think it's more beneficial to you guys the way he changes the tempo in
midstream rather than trying to set it from the beginning?  
COACH MATTA: I do. And I had kind of used Shannon as a starter in terms of‑‑
especially the way he's played over the last month. I love having something
coming in that, I don't want to say is game changing, but it's a different
look for Ohio State. There's a different pace. There's a different tempo.  
You know, he's really settled into that position here lately. And you know, he
has a great understanding of what he needs to do when he comes into the
basketball game. I think one of the biggest things I've seen with Shannon is
just his communication skills in terms of he comes in, he feels like he's
running the team and couldn't be happier with how he's playing right now.  
  
Q. How does the Big Ten Tournament prepare you for the NCAA Tournament and
your thoughts on just the conference this year and how dominating they have
been?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think the biggest difference between the Big Ten
tournament and the NCAA Tournament is you have so much familiarity with who
you're playing. If Iowa would knock off Michigan State tonight, we only played
them once this year but our guys still have a pretty good understanding.  
A lot of the tape that you watch leading into games, it's all Big Ten tape, if
you will; where you get to the NCAA Tournament, if you don't know your
opponents very well, now you've got a little bit more time to prepare. We
didn't know until last night who we were going to play.  
In terms of the Big Ten this year, I think it's as good as I've seen it. I
think you've got great players, you've got great coaches, you've got great
fans. When we finished on Sunday Sunday, I was exhausted after 18 games. It
wears you down. But it's exciting when you walk in and you know that you're
going against the best.  
I think that's kind of the beauty and that's why I don't ever look too far
ahead. Our next opponent, I don't know who we play through the season, because
just I don't want to get freaked out thinking about it.  
  
Q. Going back to the first time ‑out, what was going through newer mind, you
looked pretty angry.   
COACH MATTA: Yeah, it was déjà vu. We have notoriously started our first game
like this, and the thing is, I would try the best that I could to warn our
guys that this could happen.  
You know, I felt like we needed a time‑out to say, hey, this is what I was
talking about last night in the final meeting; it's what I talked about this
morning after the film session, if you're not ready to go, you're going to get
embarrassed and we were getting embarrassed out there in terms of ‑‑ and quite
often, it was just the little things that we weren't doing that was bothering
me.  
We had 18 hours to prepare and these things were important and we didn't do
them to start the game. Our body language wasn't good. Guys were complaining
and you know, it just‑‑ we're not good enough to play like that.  
  
Q. Is this team different than some of your other teams? You've had a few of
these, isn't the first time you've had to get these guys going, or is that the
same with all your teams?  
COACH MATTA: It's probably the same. I mean, I can take you back stories of
Big Ten tournaments of screaming at Greg Oden one time; to screaming a
time‑out, my gum landed off David Latte's (ph) leg which kind of broke the
mood of what I was doing. But I say that, you know, it's at that stage.  
And what happens I think is guys sitting in the hotel all day long, and they
look and there's games going on, guys that are analyzing every single
situation. Maybe they get filmed a little too good and they forget what they
are good at and that was probably the gist of my time‑out in terms of just
reminding them of who we were and how we have to play.  
  
Q. You started on that 26 ‑5 run there at the start of the second half. The
importance of that separation and giving the guys‑‑ the fact that they didn't
have to play a full 40 minutes?   
COACH MATTA: That's one of the things we talked about at halftime. We felt
like trying to start the second half, with as much as we have‑‑ because we
knew Nebraska, you look at from where they have started to where they were to
end the season, Tim has done a phenomenal job of bringing this team along. He
made some changes, and we told our guys at halftime, they have got to come at
you. You know, it's all on the line for them. Let's answer the call.  
And I thought the start of the second half was big for us.  
  
Q. I just wondered, with Sam coming back to his hometown, if you had any
inkling he was going to shoot like this tonight.  
COACH MATTA: I did, because we drove him by Whitney Young High School today
right by the gymnasium and everyone pointed to it for him. It was on the way.  
I don't know, Sam has been a steady this season, and I've always said this,
when he takes his shots, he can leave out of Ohio State as one of the greatest
that ever played here.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  68  
Michigan  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from coach.  
BO RYAN: I'll just keep it short and sweet. We got to get these guys down and
get them some rest for tomorrow. But just a great team effort. Guys picked
each other up. They didn't get frustrated when the shots weren't going down in
the first half and they took care of that in the second half. They continued
their hustle on defense. So they're the ones you need to talk to.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For Traevon and Ryan, how do you guys do this? You're playing teams that
have five star guys, NBA guys and yet you continue to win these games. How
does this team do it without the quote unquote talent that some of the other
teams have around this league?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: I think that it's collective. When we play together as a
team, we can beat anybody. And you say the five stars, yeah these guys are NBA
guys, but we believe in ourselves as well. We got a really talented group of
guys and when we come together, we can beat anybody.  
BEN BRUST: The old cliche, defense wins championships. We understand that here
and anything we can do to slow those guys down and get our shots is what's
going to move us forward.  
  
Q. Ryan, in the second half you kept getting it dumped into the post and
then you would back in a little bit then dump out to someone on the wing.
That's been working so well. Was that part of the plan of attack coming out of
the locker room after the first half?  
RYAN EVANS: Yeah, Tre called a couple plays in the post for me and Jared and
we wanted to go inside out and that's how we started off the half. I started
off with the bucket and they had to collapse and we were hitting our 3‑point
shooters, Mike and Ben.  
  
Q. For Ben and Traevon. You guys have gone through stretches where you
haven't shot the ball that well this year as a team, but how do you explain
going from 17 in the first half to 60 percent in the second half?  
BEN BRUST: When we got together at halftime Tre did a good job of figuring out
what we needed to do in the second half. He called some good plays to get
established down low. We got some early buckets down low and it opened up some
stuff from the outside. We knew the ball was going to go down. We talked about
it. We made shots before, so just hit them when the time came.  
TRAEVON JACKSON: I think in the first half we had a little too many threes,
like off the dribble, like contested threes. I told the guys like, hey, the
threes will be there. They'll always be there. Let's get the ball in the post
first and see what happens from there. We got to get our big men going.
Because our offense runs through them. Defensively it runs through them too as
well. So better looks through kickouts and collapsing and luckily it went in.  
  
Q. For Traevon, Trey Burke had 19 points. It took him 22 shots to get it.
What did you do to make life difficult for him today?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: Some of his shots looked good, his floaters and runners. They
just didn't go in. But just tried to just contest everything. Because he's
that good of a player to where you really can't stop him, because he can make
tough shots. You just got to hope that he misses and make him take tough shots
every single time. But he still carried their team. He hit big shots. But it
was collectively a team effort. Big men helped me out a lot on the screens.  
  
Q. Being the Big ‑10 tournament, for all three you guys, what's it been like
playing in this conference, how good it is, how great is this conference?   
RYAN EVANS: Best conference in America. I think it's been the best conference
for the last three years. But this year it's even better. So it's been just
amazing. Every night's been a memory in this conference. How many buzzer
beaters have you guys seen? You got to come ready to play every day. You got
to come focused, whether it's practice or the game. And that's going to get
you the win at the end of the day and that's why we have been able to be
consistent until this point.  
BEN BRUST: If you just look even from the games here it's just a replication
of what you have seen all year in the regular season. It's fun. Obviously, now
it's you win or lose or you stay or you go home, so it's a little bit more
added pressure, but that's why I think a lot of us chose to play here because
you knew you were going to get a challenge every night. And that's fun for us.  
TRAEVON JACKSON: It's just a lot of fun playing against the top guys around
the country. You look forward to that. It's really a blessing to be able to
play on these big stages and it are just feels good to win the right way and
to win as a team. That's the best part about it. I think that throughout the
conference you got talented players, but we got a really, really good teams as
well.  
  
Q. For Traevon or any of you, how much do you guys believe in building
momentum here and what does the buzzer beater last week do to not only secure
the bye, but to build something forward into this tournament?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: I don't think it really did anything for us, really, because
I think that we got to bounce back regardless of what happens. This is the
second season, we were looking forward to going right into the second season
for us. It didn't hurt us. It definitely didn't hurt us. We take advantage of
it and take that bye day off and get ready for the next couple games. But we
just got to keep moving forward, taking one game at a time from here on out
and good things will happen.  
  
Q. For Ben and Ryan, Bo mentioned picking people up. I think Jarrod picked
up his third foul, but when he went out you actually extended the lead. Is
that an example of one of your better players goes out and it doesn't affect
you guys, at least today?  
BEN BRUST: Yeah, Frank did a great job coming in and producing, got a couple
big shots. Couple at the end of the shot clock. And he was big for us. He
knows that if his name's called he's got to contribute. He's done that at
times for us. And when he contributes, when Jarrod is on the bench, it helps
this team.  
RYAN EVANS: We know Frank's a talented kid and he comes in tune every
practice, so he understands what we're trying to accomplish defensively and
also offensively. He has a great offensive game. So this was a great game for
Frank and he really lifted us up. So it was a good feeling for all of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellows, thank you very much. You may return to the locker
room. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. On paper you're matched up against these teams that have four and five
star kids that your roster lacks, but you've been able to sustain success over
the years. How have you been able to do that in this league and nationally?  
BO RYAN: When the guys come in, I take those little stars you lick, and I take
and I put four or five stars on each locker. "Hey, you're a five star guy.
You're a four star guy."  
(Laughter.)  
You know, it's what that star shines like when you're finished with your
career. So I'm always looking for guys who are willing to come in, work hard,
have talent, and it's about us, not individuals. But individuals can thrive.
If you're good, you can get to do a lot of things.  
So I don't want to sell my players short, I've got good players who are much
better as a result of playing together.  
  
Q. Simple question: What happened, what was the difference on offense in the
second half compared to the first half?  
BO RYAN: We had post feeds and I know that these guys aren't always used to
breaking games down, but we had post feeds in the first half. We came away
with almost nothing. 13 shots in the paint or whatever it was and we weren't
finishing. Okay. Guys had a little better feel.  
Michigan had 40 minutes under their belt on this court, in this setting, in
this environment. Okay.  
Let's just try again going through the post. It isn't like, all of a sudden,
it was a revelation at halftime, "Oh, let's go inside." When the players see
it work it's a revelation. Then, "Oh, yeah, look, this works." So maybe we can
do some more of that tomorrow and the next game and whenever, wherever and
whenever we play.  
So, but when the ball went down a few times and we either drew a foul or got
an easy bucket, it's like anything else. I'm not the smartest guy in the
world, but my grandfather, when I fished with him, always took me to the hole
where we caught fish before. So I don't think it changes. And I'm a city kid.
I don't know much about fishing, but I do know and he knew that I'm a very
impatient guy, and if in five minute I hadn't caught a fish, I was leaving.
And we would get one. Within five minutes.  
  
Q. You mentioned about going into the post, but it seemed as though the team
really got he energized when Mike hit those two threes back to back.  
JOHN BEILEIN: You do get energized on defense. It's not like we played lights
out defensively. Michigan really attacked harder and made some shots too. But,
yeah, when you score, it does change your frame of mind. We're human. Anybody
that's ever played the game or any kind of game where success doesn't get you
going a little bit more, get your thought process a little more acute and
intense and much deeper focus.  
But when you are scoring, you can't forget about the other end, because you
know the other team's going to be shooting it a little quicker, making a few
more, running a few more specials, trying to take advantage of a guy being out
of position. So I felt both teams offensively did some really good things in
the second half. We just happened to do a few more.  
  
Q. Jarrod was in foul trouble at the end, you stuck with Frank. Was that
just a matter of sticking with what was working?  
BO RYAN: Frank was loose. Frank was into it. He had that look in his eye. So
keep going. I never want a guy with four, Jarrod's not used to playing with
four, so Frank was doing just fine. We believe in our guys. Our guys believe
in us. They believe in each other, which is even more important.  
  
Q. Talk about the last minute of the first half. Really turned the tide of
the game. You guys were down eight. Able to get it down to three at halftime
and that kept you in that game. Kept you close.  
BO RYAN: I was waiting for somebody to recognize that. How about seven of our
points, right? Wasn't it, we had a three with‑‑ yeah. You're probably
thinking, why didn't I call that stuff in the other 19 minutes or 18 minutes.  
They didn't get down on themselves. Did you see a look on our guys eyes like
we can't score or we're frustrated or we're this or that? Our three seniors,
it was mentioned at halftime, just mentioned, that they were 2‑13\. I'm not
saying by who or whom, but we needed a little help from the seniors. And I
think they did that.  
We needed help from everybody, but sometimes when it is your last go around,
Big‑10 tournament, NCAA tournament, in the conference, whatever, are you
squeezing yourself a little too tight? Are you just ‑‑ you know, just play. So
I thought our guys did a much better job of that and it happened to be the
younger guys who got that spark going.  
  
Q. What's it like being a coach in this conference and especially this
season the way the conference has played?  
BO RYAN: Ryan made a great point, there's great players on great teams and
their systems, every school has a system that they rely on pretty much. Now,
sometimes that system I know people will say, how many points did we score in
the second half? Hey, coach, you don't score 51 in a half normally. Well, with
the clock stopped, how many points did we score with the clock stopped?  
So people can say whatever they say, but if you're playing with a little bit
of a lead and you're getting fouled and there's more possessions, it's still
points per possession that really end up telling the story.  
So I thought we ‑‑ I'm not sure where we ended up, we were too rushed for me
to ask. Was anybody keeping points per possession? Mike, were you keeping it?
We were 1.65. What for the game? 1.1? 1.04. Yeah, I figured it was close to
1.1. Michigan was .96 probably. .9 even. Okay.  
  
Q. Looking ahead until tomorrow, how have you been able to dominate Indiana
over the years since you've been at Wisconsin?  
BO RYAN: I never, I don't know about anything that you're talking about. We
just ‑‑ what would I know about that? I don't listen to anything, I don't go
to anything, on my cell phone, you know, you're looking at a guy that just is
looking at film with the sound down, I never listen. And I'm not saying that
the announcers should be cut in pay because I don't listen, I just don't
listen. When they do tapes for me, DVD's, there's no sound.  
So when you say anything about records or anything like that, Patrick's the
guy that has numbers. I don't. I don't even think about those kind of things.
Never have. And people that know me will tell you that. You know me.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Trey Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22847)

### [Tim Hardaway, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21925)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  68  
Michigan  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
JOHN BEILEIN: I want to congratulate Wisconsin and Bo and his team. They
really played a particularly great second half. They made ‑‑ their run of
threes there in the second half was a huge part of this game.  
Part of it is our defense, part of it is their great offense. But it was ‑‑ I
was proud of our guys. We fought back and we had some chances to take the game
back over and get back in front, we just couldn't do it.  
So a lot of that has to do with as we develop as a team and a lot has to do
with how talented Wisconsin, talented a team Wisconsin really is.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tim, what did you do to your leg in the first half and how do you feel
now? How did it maybe bother you did your during the game?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: When I was in the back getting looked at in the locker
room, they showed the replay. I went to go shoot the shot on Bruesewitz and I
think he fell. And then his foot got under me when I was landing and then
twisted my left ankle. And I went back and got looked at.  
I'm fine now. It was hurting for a little bit. When I came back out it was
hurting. But it loosened up while I was playing on it and it got better while
the game was going on.  
  
Q. For Trey, how difficult is a game like that to play against Wisconsin
where every possession, every basket seems hard to come by and then they
started hitting them in the second half?  
TREY BURKE: It's difficult. Especially when we shot the way we shot as a team
in the first half. We had some really good looks, just didn't fall. Wisconsin
did a really good job executing down low and kicking the ball out and they hit
some big shots when they needed them.  
  
Q. Tim, early in the second half Ryan Evans kept backing down you and Glenn
in the post. How effective was that move and was that maybe something you
hadn't seen from Ryan Evans on film?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: We seen it in film. He was just doing a great job of just
taking what the defense was giving him. And he does a great job of, they all
do a great job of just landing on two, pivoting through pressure, and finding
ways to get to the basket. And that's what he did today. He did a great job of
executing it and when we helped, he found his big men and they scored.  
  
Q. For both players, with the week before the NCAA tournament now ending on
this somewhat sour note, what is the main thing you guys think you have to
work on and deal with this coming week?  
TREY BURKE: Just continuing to grow and continuing to grow as a team on
defense. I think that today we didn't have the best offensive game, I think we
got to really, got really a lot of good looks. So it wasn't really our
offense, it was really just playing team defense and sticking together when we
needed each other. We fought back to the end.  
And they had some rolls, some bounces on the rim that dropped for them. I
think we just got to continue to get better. We got to refocus, regroup. We
can't continue to make the same mistakes, because sooner or later we'll be
done. So hopefully we'll learn from this loss and get better.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: The shots weren't falling for us in the first half. We were
taking wide open shots and they just did a great job of just staying in the
game and just trying to stay in the game throughout the whole entire game. So
Trey said it all.  
  
Q. Trey, in the latter part of the first half, beginning of the second half,
you had a hard time getting things to go. Was it anything Traevon Jackson was
doing or Wisconsin defensively was doing to stop that?  
TREY BURKE: No, not really. I got really good looks, good five foot to seven
foot jump shots, and I was open on a lot of them and they just weren't falling
today. That's just something that I have to play through. I have to continue
to play through and try to get my teammates going.  
And I think we did a good job of fighting back towards the end, but we didn't
have the best shooting game today as a team and maybe next game those shots
will fall.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You may return to the locker room. We'll
take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Sort of the same question that I just asked them for you. Heading into
the tournament now, there are some things we have seen that have recurred,
some of the defensive lapses. What is the main thing that you want to impress
upon your team going forward?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Just we really got to grow defensively. You look at the game, we
couldn't make shots in the first half and we only scored 20 points. Then we
put, get 40 in the first half or almost 40 in the second half. So that's not
the issue.  
It's just we have so many ‑‑ there's so many things you have to continue to
get better at and all it takes, a team like this, it isolates you so much, it
takes one breakdown here or there and they're scoring points. The second half
they scored at will. So that will be the big thing.  
We'll fix it the best we can. We have been trying all year long. There's a
process that we all have to go through to get better at it and hopefully we
can shore up enough to continue playing for a long time.  
  
Q. Frank Kaminsky hit a shot as the shot clock expired with about two and a
half minutes to go. Made it a two possession game. How much do you think that
changes the tone of the next two possessions both on offense and defense?  
JOHN BEILEIN: There was some really big moments in that game. That was one of
them. Kaminsky, they were really out of luck and he got an angle to drive to
the basket that I'll have to look at the video, but all of a sudden he was
driving by us. And so that was a big play. But there were other big points.  
I thought when we went zone Jackson hitting the long three, I think it was
Jackson, Bruesewitz stepping out and hitting threes. We had a couple 20
percent guys that were really shooting the ball well. There were many moments.
But that one's going to be striking for a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2013

  

### [Keith Appling](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23399)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Adreian Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25068)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE  59  
IOWA - 56

  
COACH IZZO: Well, I've been through a lot of tournaments, a lot of
tournaments, back in our National Championship year, we had a couple of Final
Fours that came many here and won at the buzzer against Penn State, won at the
buzzer against Northwestern.  
I thought, I have to blame myself, because I made a big deal about us showing
up for 31 times, and we didn't show up today for the first half and that
really does fall on me. These guys did great job this morning. We had a
shootaround here.  
It was kind of a weird day, just because we had never shot here. I had one
player that never played here, so that I thought it was important to get him
up at 7:00 and that was probably a little bit of mistake, because is this
general, Iowa out‑worked us three fourths of that game and deserved to be in
the position they were in.  
In saying that, after a disappointing halftime where I didn't believe we were
responding, these guys kind of took over, Branden Dawson, even a guy like
Travis Trice, every one of them made a hero's play at the end, and wasn't just
one guy. These guys spear headed it but every guy made a big play. And we
found a way to luckily, luckily win.  
  
Q. In 75 percent time of the game, there were a lot of turnovers and you
were undisciplined, and something happens with about ten minutes left before
you made that run; how did you switch gears down the stretch of this game?  
KEITH APPLING: We just had to focus in. You know, we knew we made too many
mistakes and we just had to come together as a team and start picking up our
play.  
ADREIAN PAYNE: What he said was right on. We wasn't playing that well. Like
Keith said, he told me we weren't losing the game, and he stepped up and led
us.  
  
Q. You guys have been involved in a lot of physical games over the years,
where would you place that one? How does that compare to other physical match
‑ups you've been involved in?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: This game was very physical, as you can see I got busted in the
lip all four times. You know, it was just a physical game. They made really
hard and aggressive.  
KEITH APPLING: You know, that had to be one of the most physical games I ever
played in. Those guys were all over the place each and every possession.
Luckily we were able to pull it off at the end.  
  
Q. Even when Keith wasn't playing his best in the first half, he continued
to hustle, continued to work hard; what does it mean to this team, he's your
captain and point guard and when he's not playing his best, he's stilling
hustling and you can't fault effort at all and worked out for him in the
second half.  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, you know, Coach always said, if the head dies, the body
lies. Keith is our head, and he didn't die. He just kept on playing. He
brought a lot of energy and he led us, really his body language, and
everything showed.  
  
Q. Seemed like they were getting a lot of bounces, did it seem like
everything that was going off the back iron for a while was falling, just one
of those nights? And what allowed to you decide to not pack it in and go home
and play for the NCAA Tournament?  
KEITH APPLING: That's the character of our team. We have a lot of guys with
the will to win, and we just didn't want to go home. We fought as hard as we
could and the second half, tried to pull away a little bit.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about the dunk that you had, Keith, can you remember
having a dunk like that before? And what do you think it took for you guys
having so many of those big ‑type plays to sort of get you guys back with the
right energy?   
KEITH APPLING: Those plays really helped the momentum on our team. I feel like
they helped us pick it up on the defensive end, and once we picked it up, we
started to get stops and get it in the basket on the offensive end. Getting
those plays really helped us.  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Yeah, it just felt like we had our feet in the quicksand and we
just didn't get out, and with those type of plays, Keith just brought a lot of
energy and gave us a little bit more fight.  
  
Q. Why were they able to do that? Why were they able to push you guys around
a little bit in the first half?  
KEITH APPLING: You know, they just came out with a little more energy simple
as that. They got all the 50/50 balls and like I said, they were all over the
place. But the second half we picked it up and changed our mind‑set and were
able to come out with the win.  
  
Q. You guys talk about how you got pushed around a little bit, but in the
first half especially you guys really cleaned up the offensive glass and
really made up for some poor shooting in the first half. I guess what were you
doing that made you so successful in the offensive glass to get those second
chance opportunities?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: You know I have to give all the credit to Branden Dawson and
the guy next to me. They fought as hard as they could to get around those guys
and make extra plays on the offensive end.  
KEITH APPLING: You know, it was very physical, but you know, our teammates and
our team, we fought, as you can see on the board. We out‑rebounded them. So
you know we have got to give some credit to our team and we've just got to
bounce back when we can what we have slow starts like that.  
  
Q. There was one point late in the first half, you made a hustle play, and
Keith still wasn't his best ‑‑ can you talk about the fact that he continues
to fight and play hard which has maybe not happened early in his career when
he was struggling?   
COACH IZZO: Keith is one of the toughest kids I have, and that's what I said
earlier. You're all right. You've evaluated him very well, the 50/50 balls,
the loose balls, Keith got some of those. But his dunk was a big play. It did
kind of get us going.  
And so I did say if Keith isn't playing well, it's hard for us to be good. He
doesn't have to be great but he has to be pretty solid and steady and tonight
he did a pretty good job defensively.  
We just, I don't know‑‑ I loved Adreian's comment, quicksand. Gary the first
half, I think he was nailed to the floor. I don't know why. The last time I
saw that was in Germany.  
So maybe I'm not appreciating these young guys some of them getting a little
bit‑‑ four turnovers, maybe that's some of it, and I hate to say it. But it's
good to have a rock and he's my rock. He's a tough kid and he hung in there.  
And the other thing somebody mentioned, there were some bounces, too, that one
that almost hit the ceiling and came back through, and there was one that went
right in the crotch of the thing and fell in. I mean, they earned their way
because Franny is a hell of a coach and did a hell of a job but there were
some bounces that went their way, too.  
  
Q. You talk about your scheduling every year but tonight is why you schedule
the way you do the beginning of the year; correct?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think definitely‑‑ at halftime, of all people, the most
vocal guy in our locker room was Branden Dawson. You know, he talked about the
long road and we're not losing, and then Keith jumped in. I said very little.  
This was my time to say, okay, guys, going to see if you're going to take your
team over a little bit. And they did. It was slowly, and then we came back,
cut it to seven and made a couple more‑‑ hate to use this word, but dumb,
foolish, idiotic‑‑ if I could four‑letter it‑‑ we did them all.  
We are solid and we are steady and all of a sudden we are double‑teaming the
center at the top of the key and they give the guy a wide‑open three. We just
did so many things that I just‑‑ it's not characteristic of us, and that's
what I'm going to have to live with tonight.  
  
Q. Most say that this loss will keep Iowa out of the NCAA Tournament; do you
agree?  
COACH IZZO: I don't, and I'll tell you why I don't. A couple reasons; we can
talk about their non‑conference schedule and I think people have done that.  
I've been in this league when we have played one or two ranked teams, the
whole time. I've been in this league when it was that way back, eight, nine
years ago.  
So, you know, when we are playing those tough schedules, then all of a sudden
we're playing with five, six, seven teams ranked in the Top‑25\. That's still
a lot more than a lot of teams are. So the non‑conference schedule wasn't as
good; they won seven out of nine. They took, supposedly, the Top‑10 team,
which I'm not sure they were, but they took us to the wire, probably deserved
to win.  
I'm not begging for it, but I just think he's a hell of a coach and I think
that is a very good basketball team that's gotten better. And Marble, getting
better each day has helped them. I look at some of the teams around the
country they say they are getting in, and Iowa, on their mettle, I hope they
do get in.  
  
Q. When your team was unravelling in March, did you have a moment where you
had to step back and let them figure it out?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I was here‑‑ the Zen master did that. I'm not the Zen
master, I can promise you that.  
At halftime I did for the first time in a lot, a lot of years. I just said,
where are we going to go. So I just leaned up the wall and asked whoever
wanted to talk, and that's when Dawson said some things and that's when Keith
said some things and Nick said a few things. It was kind of an emotional, not
a rah‑rah or yelling emotional, just a down emotional thing.  
It was interesting for me, because I had done that once in 2000 with Cleaves
and Peterson (ph), and it was one of the better things I had done. Embarrassed
to say I didn't have any answers at halftime, but I'm proud to say that I let
them make the decision and maybe they grew up a little bit.  
  
Q. Just out of respect to you, I'm not going to ask you a question about the
reffing tonight, but I will ask one question ‑‑ last time I saw you a few
years ago, you didn't win the first game and I asked you then, and I said, is
it because of a team with your ranking, did you need it and you said, I hope
we're better than that. How did you go into the locker room tonight and get
them to do what they ended up doing in the second half? I just assume‑‑ from
your standpoint, how is it different for you, or is it the same thing every
time?   
COACH IZZO: No, it was different, because this was the first time with team
that I just shut up. I didn't say a lot on the sideline. I just said, I've
never seen Gary Harris be like that, you know, except first game of the year
where it just seemed like he was‑‑ and I know he cares.  
So at halftime, when I say I didn't do much, my (indiscernible) will probably
be met, didn't earn my money at halftime. I've got a saying: Learn to listen
and listen to learn; I just listened, tried to learn something about my team
and tried to see who was going to step up, and to my surprise, of all the
people that stepped up for us was BJ, and it's not in his character, you know.  
So I think that was kind of cool for me. I don't know how it worked, but we
didn't need a loss. Disappointed because now I can't say we went 32 games not
showing up, because we didn't show up the first half.  
But I can say 98 percent of this year, we've shown up every game, and I'll
look at this as an out‑of‑body experience and get ready for Ohio State.  
  
Q. Having gone for games like this for two months, what does that put into
this team and all of the Big Ten teams that might mean something starting next
week? Is there a payoff from what you've had to go through?  
COACH IZZO: Oh, I think there is. I think there is, because Charlie Bell once
said back in 2000, you know, to be the best you've got to beat the best and
I'm sure a lot more famous people than him said it, but that was in our group.
I think about that all the time. It does build character.  
It builds character what we did and some people wonder, will it wear everybody
out. It will wear the weak ones down but the strong ones are going to keep
moving forward and the strong ones are going to be able to sit in the locker
room before a big game, and who knows who we are playing in the NCAA
Tournament, and they will say, hey, we played this team, this team, this team,
and you've been there before and done it at halftime or two minutes to go in
the game, I might be able to use this event as, you know what we found a way
even though we were not playing good, to be honest with you, to win three
games in a row or six games in the NCAA Tournament, sometimes you have got to
find a way.  
Now we didn't play good, but I'm telling you, you have to give Iowa a lot of
credit for that. They made our life miserable tonight. His kids played so
hard, I can't even tell you; as hard as anybody said, as most of them told
you.  
But I think these games all help us. It makes you stronger. It makes you
better. It's hard. It's hard. You can't get up for every game, you know. You
have to have one of those letdown games, and boy, we haven't had many games
where we could just play average and win, and tonight, we deserved to get
beat, we found a way to win. I take it as a steal and try to play Iowa State.  
I definitely believe Iowa is a team that deserves to be in this tournament
because of how they have played and what they have done and how they played
last night and how they played the last eight, nine games.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Indiana  80  
Illinois  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead with an opening statement from coach.  
JOHN GROCE: I think it was a tale of two halves. I thought our defense was
really, really good in the first half. In fact, if it wasn't good, I don't
know if I have ‑‑ I told these guys after the game‑‑ you're playing a team
that's been ranked number one in the country more than any other team in
college basketball and you shoot 27 percent and 16 percent from three and turn
the ball over eight times, and you're down 14.  
Had they not showed the resiliency and toughness that they did in the first
half, we would have been down a lot more. I thought our defense was really
good.  
Second half it flipped. I thought our offense was really good and defensively
we weren't able to stop them in the second half. I thought they got too many
layup's, they got baskets in transition.  
Obviously, we opened up the floor as a staff because we felt like we needed to
increase the number of possessions there. So we started pressing, which opened
up the floor for their athleticism. They got a dunk or two. But offense good
second half, defense good first half.  
When you're playing Indiana, you got to be good in both, on both offense and
defense, both halves. So I give them a lot of credit. They made a lot of
plays. I'm really proud of our guys' toughness and resiliency, their ability
to keep playing and not tie their defensive effort to shot making in the first
half, I think probably made me the most proud. Questions for the players?  
  
Q. For both players, you had played in a really tough conference all year
and made some comebacks, but how prepared do you feel from these experiences
just going into the NCAA tournament now?  
BRANDON PAUL: How prepared do we feel coming into the tournament? I really
don't know how to answer that. We play in the toughest conference in the
nation. If we play anywhere else I feel like we have a chance with anybody in
the nation. Obviously we have won some tough games. We came back.  
But right now we're just excited for Sunday to see ‑‑ we had a goal going into
the season, so we're excited for Sunday to see what happens.  
TRACY ABRAMS: I agree with Brandon. We definitely play in the toughest
conference in the country, so we'll just wait to see what happens Sunday.  
  
Q. Brandon, defensively what were they doing that was bothering you and D.J.
to combine for 4 ‑23?   
BRANDON PAUL: They get into you. Obviously Oladipo is a great defender. They
play hard. They're scrappy. That's something I got to get better at. We missed
some shots, but at the same time I was trying to get to the free throw line.
And I think I did that well tonight. But some shots just got to fall. They
fell yesterday, they didn't fall tonight. That's just something that happens.  
  
Q. Tracy, you guys have had sort of a pattern of you kind of ease into the
offense. Again today it was sort of a battle a little bit early and then in
the second half it really got going. What's the difference when you guys are
clicking on offense?  
TRACY ABRAMS: I would say if anything our guys just playing together and
trusting each other and trusting the system. Execution, we definitely got to
put two halves together. Just execution and executing the game plan and
trusting the coaches and the players.  
  
Q. Can you go into a little more detail, Tracy, on what started working for
you in the second half?  
TRACY ABRAMS: Just being aggressive and just playing under control. I talked
to Coach Ford and he just said, just slow down a little bit and just play
under control. And I definitely took that advice and I would say things
started going my way then.  
  
Q. Brandon, what do you take away from these couple days here at the
tournament? I know you guys wanted to be playing on Sunday. Obviously
disappointing. But just sort of the overall feeling when you come up short.  
BRANDON PAUL: The takeaway is if you compete at a high level, you can compete
with anybody in the country. I felt we came in with the mindset that we can
win all these games. We went through some rough stretches throughout the game
and I felt like once we put two halves together we'll be in a good position.
Sometimes one half our defense might be off or the next half our offense might
be off. Once we put two halves together we're going to be a force to recon
with.  
And I think we still, we're going to continue to look forward to Sunday,
because I feel like we have a lot of basketball left.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. You guys can return to the locker room. Questions
for coach.  
  
Q. John, I would like to expand on that very question that you were just
asked. It seemed like for a time maybe 10, 15 minutes that the team just
couldn't get going and then all of a sudden everything clicked. What's the
difference?  
JOHN GROCE: I think in the first half a couple things. They were really locked
on our shooters. I mean heavy. And I didn't think that ‑‑ I thought that was,
that took some time for us to get adjusted to, even though we encouraged them
to do that, calling some things and trying to take advantage of that. I
thought it was good on their part. I thought they defended well.  
Then I think the second part to that is we missed five lay‑ups in what we call
the own the box area around the rim in the first half. You might miss one,
maybe two. But you want to beat Indiana, you got to go 3‑5, 4‑5\. I mean they
were crips. They were right there. You can't draw up a play to get a better
shot than those four or five lay‑ups. We got to convert them.  
We convert those, maybe instead of being down 14 we're down seven.  
So I thought that was the biggest reason why our offense wasn't very good in
the first half. I thought in the second half we got into a little bit of a
rhythm. I thought Tracy settled down. I thought Brandon was pretty consistent
with what he was doing offensively. Griffey made some plays. We got some
things on some ATO's out of timeouts and we executed pretty well and got some
in transition. But at the end of the day we just weren't able to stop them
enough. It's 60‑52, we have the ball with 7:50 to go. We're right there. In
fact, that's better shape than we were in, in the game at home. But we just
weren't able to stop them enough down the stretch. Our offense was good enough
in the second half, our defense wasn't.  
  
Q. You mentioned Tracy's improved play in the second half. In the first half
is he trying to do too much or is it mentality?  
JOHN GROCE: Sometimes I think he is. Trying to find that balance. I thought
that we wanted him to be aggressive, but we wanted him to be aggressively
patient in trying to find that balance. That's not the easiest thing in the
world when you're wired like he is, to be very aggressive, which I like. I
would rather a guy be that way and try to reel him back in than trying to drop
kick him in the rear end all the time. But I thought he settled down and
played at a much better pace in the second half.  
  
Q. On your offense a lot of times we focus on where the guys are making the
shots on the perimeter. But as you go forward how do you feel about what
you're getting inside?  
JOHN GROCE: I would like to get more. People ask me, I've had a chance to be
involved with offensive play calling in my previous stints and when I was at
Ohio State we ran a lot of plays for Greg Odom. We ran a lot of place for
Terrence Dials. I think some of the guys we have have got to develop down
there. And they can get a little bit better, but at the end of the day some
guys have knacks for scoring. Like Zeller can score down there. You get him
the ball down there he's going to score. Dials could do that. David West could
do that when I was at Xavier. He would come to the bench and say, "Coach, just
recycle the first three plays."  
It's an unbelievable luxury to have when you have that type of paint attack
and you have guys that demand double teams or demand the attention of the
perimeter defenders. It really opens up some things.  
I do think Nnanna's gotten a little bit better down there. Griff and Hen are
kind of Griff and Hen. So we got to kind of develop some of what we have
already down there. And then, to be honest with you, we have got to add some
things with our program moving forward through recruiting.  
  
Q. You had mentioned that you were even in better shape this time around
than you were when you pulled off the upset. Does that frustrate the team a
lot when they kind of fail where they had succeeded before?  
JOHN GROCE: I don't think so. These guys are hard to frustrate. I think the
staff does a pretty good job of staying positive. We played pretty good. I
told the guys when we were talking, we won seven of our last 11 games. Losses
being at Michigan, at Iowa, and at Ohio State. And we were 51‑51 at home. And
today tot Indiana, who is really good. We have got six, Top‑25 RPI wins. The
only two programs are Duke with seven and Indiana with eight.  
We played pretty good basketball. We're capable of playing really good
basketball. But I like Brandon and Tracy's mindset. I could hear them talking
to the team in there after the game and they said, hey, we need to play two
halves. That's great. It's one thing for me to say it, but when peers are
saying it to one another, that means even more. These guys care a lot about
one another and they care about Illinois and about our team, about doing well,
about playing well. This time of year that's really important.  
But the thing I appreciated the most about them is their resiliency. I thought
we were really resilient today. Because the offense was not very good in the
first half and as I mentioned at the outset here, it could have been really
ugly had we not defended like we did. That's a sign of being mature, that we
didn't tie our defensive effort to how things were going for us on offense in
the first half.  
  
Q. You played Oladipo twice now and he's a guy that's had a breakout year.
What do you see in him as potential with his ceiling and where do you think
he's at right now?  
JOHN GROCE: Obviously he had 12 and 11, double double. But I don't think the
stat sheet tells the story with him. It tells only part of it. I think
defensively he is terrific. He, as Brandon said, he gets up into you, he takes
things away, he reads things well. You can tell he's really intelligent
defensively. He's as good a defender on the perimeter as we played against all
year.  
Now you add his things he brings to the table from an offensive scoring
perspective and his rebounding and that makes him even more potent.  
  
Q. Joseph Bertrand has struggled lately. Talk about his game today.  
JOHN GROCE: He did some good things. He did some really good things. Had five
field goals. Thought he was active. Thought he played really hard and
competed. Which Joe does that most of the time anyway. I thought he was good.  
I thought he had two really solid games here in the tournament and hopefully
that Will continue to give him confidence moving forward, heading into next
week.  
He looked great today. Those guys did a great job. Those trainers did a great
job. We probably could have tried to play him last Sunday, I just don't know
if that would have been in Joe's best interest and our team's best interest
moving forward. So it is what it is. But he looked good today. He looked good.  
  
Q. When Indiana was in here people were talking about all the contributions
from other guys. And then when you, even here, we're not hearing a whole lot
about Cody Zeller, but how good was he today?  
JOHN GROCE: He was a load. He's a terrific player. There's a reason he's on
all those magazines to start the preseason. First team All‑American candidate.
Probably a National Player of the Year candidate.  
He's a terrific player. He's very versatile. One of the things he does really
well exceptionally well for a guy his size is run. He can really run. Really
run. I thought he was good.  
But I thought their other guys were good too. I thought Abell gave them
positive contributions, made a couple jumpers, which typically doesn't do
that. Those are big plays.  
Sheehey makes two, 3's. He's, whatever he is, 32 percent 3‑point shooter.
Those are two big shots.  
Watford made a couple and he's been really good all year from three. He buried
a couple. The last one was a real dagger that he made. So he contributed.  
I thought Ferrell was really good. Great defensively. Oladipo gets a lot of
credit for his defense on the ball. I think Ferrell's really good defensively
on the ball. And he really pushed the pace and the tempo and got them some of
those lay‑ups and easy baskets when we couldn't quite get our defense set.
Especially in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Shavon Shields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25003)

### [Brandon Ubel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21854)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Nebraska  57  
Purdue  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach.  
TIM MILES: Just happy that I poured my drink in this big cup and didn't miss
like we did our free throws the last five minutes. I was watching these guys,
it didn't go so well.  
It was a good win for Nebraska. It was a good program win. I thought these
guys really committed to a defensive game plan like they have all year. It
wasn't an excellent finish again, but we'll take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Brandon, I know you didn't play in the game against Purdue in Lincoln,
but Terone and his brother, Ronnie, have made a living off getting into the
lane and shooting those floaters. It just seemed like it wasn't there for them
all day. Just talk about the strategy and obviously your being back helped.
How did you stop that weapon they have had?  
BRANDON UBEL: We came in with a game plan of keeping them out of the paint.
They get downhill on just about everybody. So we wanted to hard head hedge
those ball screens, not really let them attack the bigs and not get too
extended with our guards. It was five guys stopping that.  
As soon as I would retreat back to my man, a wing or somebody else would be
sitting in the lane waiting for them. So I think we just did a really good job
as a team of just keeping them out of the lane kind of at all costs.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, there was talk coming into this tournament that
Purdue was the hot team and that they might upset someone of these Top ‑10
teams. And when stuff like that is said it always seems like people are almost
overlooking you guys. I wonder if any of you heard of that talk and was it any
motivation.   
SHAVON SHIELDS: They were hot. They beat Wisconsin, played Michigan tight and
everything. A lot of, like almost everyone didn't expect us to win this game.
So we had to match their intensity and excitement around them and win the
game.  
  
Q. For either of you guys. Talk about the last month talking about building
up momentum for this tournament to try to make a run at post ‑season. Was this
kind of a culmination of the last month or so, I guess, do you think?   
BRANDON UBEL: It's the start of it. We're not done with what we want to get
done. Because if we want to play post‑season like we want to, we got to come
out tomorrow with the same intensity, same focus, same excitement, and try and
win another game. Because the night's over, we got to look ahead and try to
keep winning.  
  
Q. Brandon, it's well known you guys were picked to finish last on 23 out of
24 ballots before the season. What's it feel like to be up here with a W and
walk out of that place celebrating a little bit?  
BRANDON UBEL: It feels good any time you win. Obviously when you're going in
picked last, you kind of feel like nobody believes in you but ourselves. But
we don't need anybody outside to believe in us, because if everybody in that
locker room and on the coaching staff and everybody believes, then we'll be
fine.  
That's what we did. We came into this game, we believed we could win, and we
had a good game plan. I thought we executed the game plan pretty well. It
feels really good to do that.  
  
Q. Shavon, talk about the game you had tonight and did you feel you were
heading up to a career night similar to the one you had at Penn State?  
SHAVON SHIELDS: No. I was just within the offense curling and things like that
and my teammates were screening and finding me open. So if it wasn't for them
screening and getting me open and that and playing as a team, I wouldn't have
got those 19 points.  
  
Q. For you guys, a big win, but you got Ohio State tomorrow. Talk about
enjoying this for now and shifting focus for tomorrow.  
BRANDON UBEL: Coach told us after this game, he said he'll give us until
dinner to celebrate this one. And we all kind of laughed, but it's true.  
We got to get in the film room, got to really focus in on what they do well.
Try to take away those things. Try and contain Deshaun Thomas, Aaron Craft
whose been playing really well lately too, and hopefully we can come out and
execute that game plan as well as we did tonight.  
SHAVON SHIELDS: We need to enjoy it until dinner, have a good film session
tonight and things like that. Figure out what they do and figure out a way to
win the game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, fellows. You may go to the locker room. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Only six turnovers. Talk about how you were able to protect the ball so
well.  
TIM MILES: Well, I think we're in the top three or four in the league in
turnovers and it's important that we don't, because we don't make a lot of
shots. So we need as many possessions as we can.  
Our kids are almost too careful with the ball because we don't get to the foul
line very much. But at the same time the way this team's got to function and
operate like that to be good.  
  
Q. Did you think Shavon going off in the first half kind of got them a
little scattered. I don't know if that was part of the game plan. But touch on
that a little bit.  
TIM MILES: I think they were aware of what Shavon can do. And I think Shavon
had a really good game. They did a nice job on him after the first 11 or so
points. Everything he got after that was hard earned. But maybe they got the
matchup that they wanted, but at the same time, you have to credit him,
because he really carried the load for a long time in that first half.  
  
Q. Talk about the free throws, the issues you had there. Talk about what
happened there. And then on that final possession, defensively, what were you
guys trying to do?  
TIM MILES: We were trying to survive. All right. So that's just the truth.
Trying to keep it in front of us and just see what we could do. But the free
throws, that's just hard to replicate in practice. That's part of learning how
to win. Free throws are mental toughness. It's like a golf skill. It's
something you have to stand up there and do. It's mental.  
Usually, technically, by the time you get to a junior and senior in college,
you know what you're doing. That's what those guys who are shooting or missing
or making were. And it's just one of those positions that we have to continue
to get better at. We're going to have limited opportunities here at the end of
the year, but at the same time, hopefully tonight will help make us feel a
little more at ease tomorrow night.  
  
Q. On that last possession, did you expect them to try to set up that curl?
It look like you were set up for a curl.  
TIM MILES: We wanted to try to eliminate that cut for him, but still it was
only a 2‑point game. So you want to win the game. I'm not happy just going to
overtime.  
We were playing five and six guys is all, so at that point we had not played
Andre the second half, I don't believe, and we wanted to win the game. You
knew that Byrd might get a look. We also know that Ronnie and Terone can drive
the ball too, those guys scoring the ball. But the offensive rebound, too,
because any shot at the rim is a good shot.  
So they had plenty of options to me and I thought we just did better at
getting in there and fighting. And they got two looks at it, I believe, but
Ray came up with a big rebound to end the game.  
  
Q. You mentioned that it's a program win. Maybe just elaborate on that and
the significance of this victory for your program.  
TIM MILES: I think to build off the point earlier that was made, we were
picked dead last by everybody but my mom. We at least out performed that
expectation. Sometimes you got to creep to crawl to walk to run. And that's
where we're at right now.  
So I think that the idea to bring a team in, understand the process, what it
takes to win, it's important for us. Especially since Purdue's playing great
basketball. And so to be able to beat the hottest team in the league,
probably, was a good accomplishment for this group.  
  
Q. You only took three, 3 ‑point attempts the second half. Was that by
design or more because of their defense?   
TIM MILES: We didn't really‑‑ I felt we were‑‑ the way their quickness is,
they chase you off the line pretty good. So we really didn't talk about it.
Just keep attacking the defense, take what the defense gives you. And I just
didn't recall being very open from the 3‑point line. So I thought Purdue just
did a really good job defending the line.  
  
Q. Last time you played Ohio State out at your place you scared them there
in the second half. I wondered if just doing that, does that give your players
some belief and confidence tomorrow night to do it again?  
TIM MILES: I think you stole my post‑game talk. That's what we told them was,
hey, that game was a game down the stretch. And we were right there. And a few
other things go our way, we could have come out on top. And that's what you
have to cling to. That's what you have to build your case on.  
Our guys will be ready to go. I think they will be locked in and their hearts
are fresher than their legs, but I think that's going to be all right. We'll
just play a low possession game and see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Austin Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24981)

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Illinois  51  
Minnesota  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
TUBBY SMITH: It's disappointing. I thought we did some things after we over
came the first half. We fought and gave ourselves a chance. But in the end we
just didn't get the stops that we needed.  
You got to commend Illinois. They kept their composure and they made a big
shot at the end. And that's what it be takes.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes right here.  
  
Q. For Andre, do you guys go into Selection Sunday feeling like you're in
the tournament or do you think it's a situation where you're sweating it out
and feel like you could have done a lot more than that?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: It's not a feeling that you want to go into the Selection
Sunday feeling. We haven't played our best basketball in the past three games.  
I mean, we want to have faith. We have a pretty good resume. We have a good
RPI. So we're just going in ‑‑ it's not a feeling that you like to go in with
on a loss.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I think Andre said it best. It's not a feeling you want to
have going into it, but you have to stay confident and hope that we can get
in.  
We still feel like we can, with our RPI, our strength of schedule and
everything. But it's out of our hands at this point.  
  
Q. On the last possession, do you feel like you were fouled on the side
there?  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I thought maybe I got pushed a little bit, but I can't, I
can't say that that caused anything. The game went the way it did. It was out
of my hands what happened the rest of the way. Whether they make the call or
didn't. And we just got to move on.  
We were in there throughout the whole game. There were some calls that should
have been called or shouldn't have been called on both sides, so.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student‑athletes and take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, out of bounds play at the end of the game. They said Austin
stepped on the line. How does your team respond when something like that
happens? It seems like defensively they could have made a key stop and
extended the game.  
TUBBY SMITH: You're right, we had many opportunities there to kind of put the
game, not necessarily away, but, you know, three or four offensive rebounds
there when they made the three.  
We ran a shot out of bounds play that we were hoping to get the ball in the
hands of a better shooter and Trevor was screening across for him. They took
away the pass. They did a good job of putting a big guy on the ball there.  
So you got to search and fake and try to find a way to pass around it. And
what happened was, looking back on it, I think Rodney, I mean Austin, came
open earlier, but by the time he got closer to the sideline, it was a little
late.  
But we also had some other people coming back to the ball and that didn't
happen. But, again, you got to be strong with the ball.  
He's right, I haven't seen the replay, but obviously when you come to the
ball, you want to come and do a jump shot and be strong with it, be physical.
It didn't happen. We turned it over 19 times and we just had a real issue with
taking care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Same question I asked of the players, at this point do you feel like your
team has done enough to be in the tournament?  
TUBBY SMITH: We'll be wondering and hoping. We have had our chances to, for
the last three games, and we really haven't shot the ball well. That's been
one of our problems.  
Even in this game, we do a good job defensively, we shoot 40 percent, they
shoot 32 percent, hold them to 24. So we just got to find some offensive
firepower.  
But I think we, as I said, we have a good resume. We haven't played well of
late, but when you look at the entire body of work, I think we have done
enough. But it's not up to us. It will be interesting to me. It will be a
sweat it out type of thing.  
  
Q. Obviously with Austin he had one of his best games. Did you say anything
to him personally after the game?  
TUBBY SMITH: Keep your head up. I don't know. I didn't know what happened, and
like he said, there are a lot of things that ‑‑ the one play doesn't cost you
the game.  
We had a number of opportunities in that previous possession when Illinois
had, I don't know, it might have been like three or four offensive rebounds
and they finally made the three to tie it.  
And then we just couldn't seem to handle the ball very well, as we had the
whole game. When you turn the ball over 19 times, it puts a lot of pressure on
you to stop people. And it was too much pressure for us defensively, I guess.
Because of our offense, our lack of ball possession, ball control, and
execution.  
  
Q. Do you feel like that this game kind of embodies the team, the way they
have been this year? They come out with this aggressiveness and then don't do
much at all in the first half.  
TUBBY SMITH: We have‑‑ one of the things we were hoping from the beginning of
the season is that if we had a deeper bench, that we would be able to use it.
It would be very, very productive for us.  
And that hasn't been the case lately. We got quality minutes out of Andre and
Austin though. It kind of epitomized what we, the way our play has been so
erratic, so up‑and‑down, so inconsistent. We have been taking care of the ball
better the last few games and we tried to simplify our offense today and be
more of a ball possession type of game. And just like you saw, the guys
fumbled the ball a little bit. I don't know what was happening. Rodney fumbled
a few. It seemed like we just couldn't ‑‑ and you're right, this is what has
been going on for the last ‑‑ for awhile.  
I know they want to play well, they want to play together. We got a good group
of guys. We just haven't had that take charge, I got it under control, I'm in
control here type thing, type person.  
We have to do it collectively too. We had some real breakdowns out there. But
today we over came that from a standpoint that we shot the ball better in the
second half. But, yeah, that's kind of the way the season's been. This game is
kind of typical of that. Not finishing. Same thing happened at our place. We
had a possession there and we turned it over against Illinois.  
  
Q. The first half you got into a situation again where there was foul
trouble and you had to sit some guys for the entire half.  
TUBBY SMITH: We were going to put him back in. But Austin, I mean, Austin was
in foul trouble too. It was just a bad, bad foul. He finished with three
fouls, so Austin only finished with two. We wanted to get him back in the game
for the defensive aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Did you think about putting Austin back as well? I mean, you obviously
told him, you know, he's one of the star players.  
TUBBY SMITH: We probably could have put him back in there and stopped the
bleeding. But again, I have faith in our guys that are coming off the bench, I
have faith in them, but belief in themselves is two different things. We got
to continue to work on that. Looking back on it, I probably should have played
them both.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

### [Brandon Paul](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22116)

### [D.J. Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20660)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Illinois  51  
Minnesota  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with Illinois. We'll start with
an opening statement from coach.  
JOHN GROCE: Obviously a tale of two halves here. I thought that defensively we
were really good in the first half. Maybe as good as we have defended in a
long time. Thought we were really locked in.  
I thought they then flipped that switch on us in the second half and were able
to get stops, kind of get us out of rhythm a little bit. Certainly credit them
for that. They made some plays.  
But at the end of the day, and I've always said this, at tournament time you
got to try to grind and guys got to make plays. You have to have some
toughness.  
Obviously Brandon's shot was a big shot. And then the possession where we got
multiple offensive rebounds that led to some opportunities where D.J. ended up
making the three was just as big as well.  
So our last two possessions there we found a way. It's fitting that two
seniors in Brandon and D.J. made those plays. But the offensive rebound effort
was also tremendous by our guys on the possession that led to D.J.'s three. It
put us in a position where we had a chance to win the game.  
I'm happy for these guys and obviously now we get a chance to move on and play
a really, really good Indiana team tomorrow at 11 okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of Brandon and D.J. Raise your hand.  
  
Q. D.J., can you take us through that second to last possession and what was
going through your mind?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: My teammates found me. I kept shooting. I'm a shooter, I keep
shooting. That's what coach wants me to do. I didn't think about how I was
shooting, I just thought about how it was going to fall. I knew it was a big
shot for us.  
  
Q. Brandon, was there any thought of passing on the last play?  
BRANDON PAUL: In those situations you got to see what the defense gives you.
I've been in those situations before where the defense is flexing me, I hit an
open jumper to win the game and stuff like that. But basically letting them
come out, I saw I had some space, so I let the shot go with the buzzer winding
down.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BRANDON PAUL: We knew they were going to make their runs. We didn't want our
offense to affect our defense. There was a stretch where we weren't playing
any defense, but we were scoring. So we were trading baskets back and forth
and that's one thing we can't do is to trade baskets and expect them to miss.  
So we got it up on the defensive end and we had some good offense. Our bigs
were there keeping the ball alive and they got us the shots.  
  
Q. 25 points on 10 ‑16 shooting, your mindset going in this game today?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: I didn't want to lose. We worked too hard. This team has so
much character and the coaching staff, they got us right for this one, as they
do for all the games. So my mindset was to be aggressive. Coach talked to me
to just stay aggressive. And I was aggressive the last few days, the last game
at Ohio State. Coach Groce let me know.  
So I basically wanted to attack on offense and at the same time do other
things such as rebound. And I'm more excited about I didn't turn the ball over
today. So that's another step moving forward.  
  
Q. D.J., can you talk about the staying confident when you're missing shots
going through the game. You started out 1 ‑12 and then you hit some big ones.
Talk about what's going through your mind.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: I've been in situations like that my whole career. I don't
let it affect me. I'm going to keep shooting and make plays. I did a good job
on defense. I didn't let that affect me on defense and I made some good plays
on defense. But I'm going to keep shooting no matter what. That's my role for
the team. And it worked out that I made a big shot for us.  
  
Q. Brandon, how important is it for you guys to have that edge right now?
You're probably in the tournament already, but to have that edge right now in
this tournament to kind of prepare for that.  
BRANDON PAUL: We're preparing for the next game. We got Indiana next and we
have a mindset that this is it for us. Especially for our seniors, we got to
play, go out with a bang. So we, our focus right now is on the Big‑10
tournament and our next opponent. So we got to fuel up, get a lot of liquids
in us, and just get ready for the next one.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BRANDON PAUL: We didn't want to come in and lose three in a row. And I think
we fought the whole game. Our mindset was that we finished everything. So
obviously we had a good start to the first half, got a little sloppy with it,
guys started getting more fancy. So coach got into us and let us know that
it's not over yet. We have been in those situations. We went down at halftime
down nine and we came back.  
We knew they were going to make their run. And we knew we had to continue to
stay poised and make plays. And that's what the Big‑10 tournament is all about
is making plays.  
  
Q. D.J., talk about Sam's defensive play in this game. Obviously he forced
the turnover to set up the game winner?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Sam does a lot of things that don't show up on the stat
sheet. He's been doing a great job on the offensive rebounds. He can guard one
through five. He's been doing a good job for us the whole year.  
That was a big play for us. It set the game up. Some of our seniors made some
big plays down the stretch. They gave us the opportunity, they gave Brandon
the opportunity to make that last shot. So Sam made a big play for us also on
the defensive end as well.  
  
Q. Are you excited to get another shot at Indiana?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: I'm ready to keep playing this tournament. I'm blessed to
play against these type of teams. There's a lot of good teams in the Big‑10\.
We don't ‑‑ we're going to treat Indiana like we treat the rest of the teams
in the Big‑10, take it one game at a time. We'll have scouting tonight and get
a lot of fluids in us and get prepared for tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BRANDON PAUL: My parents mean a lot. They told us that they were going to head
out to Darius's game. And I love them with all my heart. They do a lot for us.
And I'll probably see them again tomorrow. They're super parents.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You had two timeouts there at the end, chose to just let Brandon go. Talk
about that decision.  
JOHN GROCE: Well, Dustin and I were talking about it there on the bench. I was
about 50/50, to be honest, whether I was going to call one or not. But at the
end of the day I kind of knew what I wanted to go with there. And so we, I
didn't want to give them a chance really to make any type of defensive
adjustment. We just decided to ride with it.  
The big thing that we were trying to do there is make sure he didn't go
between five and seven on the game clock. We wanted to make sure that we got
the last shot and worst case scenario go to overtime. Obviously he made a big
play.  
  
Q. This series was a tale of three different games. You won at their place,
they won at your place. What was neutralizing factor today?  
JOHN GROCE: Well I thought for us‑‑ it was interesting, I was really worried
about the glass and they did a good job on the glass. They got us, they were
38 for 26 in the rebound margin.  
But if you look at the offensive rebounds, they had 11, we had 12.  
And then we had six turnovers to their 19.  
So that was the huge thing going into the game was not to try to lose the
possession battle, because that's where they're really good. They're great on
the glass. His teams are always very aggressive. They force turnovers. They're
good on the, as I say, good on rebounding.  
When that happened, making an extra possession, we were doing the best job we
could to limit that. But I thought our ability to take care of the ball was
probably the difference today.  
  
Q. In the second half I think it was 8 to 1 fouls. You guys had 8, Minnesota
had 1. You had a pretty long conversation with one of the referees during the
timeout.  
JOHN GROCE: It wasn't really about that, about the number. Those guys have a
job to do. If they see a foul, they call a foul. Their job is not to even
things out. We have great officials in our league. Mine was more about a
specific play I was talking to them about.  
  
Q. The Gophers turned the ball over four times on inbounds plays in the
second half. Did you see something coming in that you thought you could
exploit?  
JOHN GROCE: We work on that a lot. That's something, it's a very important
part of our system. And there in special situations, inbounds situations, late
in the game, I thought our defense was as good or maybe better than our
offense on those inbounds situations. So I thought ‑‑ that's a very astute
point. I thought that was a huge part of our ability to ultimately win the
game.  
  
Q. Heading to Indiana what can you expect from that game tomorrow and how
they're playing tomorrow?  
JOHN GROCE: I'll know more with when I get with Dustin. Dustin has the
scouting report. He can inform me what they have done between when we played
them last and now.  
But for us right now total focus was on today's game. And D.J.'s exactly
right, we have taken it one game at a time. We have not tried to advance our
thought any further than that. So here in the next couple hours I'll maybe
have some more thoughts on that game specifically.  
  
Q. How much poise does your preparation and your seniors give them in games
like this?  
JOHN GROCE: I think it's huge. Obviously we played an against a lot of really
good basketball teams in league. I thought we played a tremendous
non‑conference schedule, played some really good teams there. Home, away,
neutral.  
We have been in so many different types of environments. You add that, the X
factor of experience, because we play a lot of seniors, I think that's helpful
as well. And I do think that helps in terms of being poised. Kind of staying
the course and trying to play the full 40 minutes and I thought our guys did
that today.  
  
Q. You guys were the aggressors most of the first half. Second half
Minnesota stole that. Take me through what you saw at that point, possession
‑wise?  
JOHN GROCE: I saw great effort, guys making plays, keeping the ball a live,
and then D.J. makes the big shot. But I would agree with you, I thought that,
certainly not to take anything away from them, but I thought we were the
aggressor in the first half. I thought they had probably a little bit of an
edge in physical disposition in the second half.  
We had some possessions on offense that were not what we wanted, but I'll give
them credit. They defended their tails off in the second half. They did. It
was hard to get good shots against them.  
Fortunately, late in the game, we were able to make a few plays late in the
game.  
  
Q. 16 seconds left and the timeout before the inbounds you put your hand on
Sam's shoulder and had a conversation. What was that about?  
JOHN GROCE: That's between me and him. Just encouraging him. We were doing
something defensively there once it was in bounded and I wanted to make sure
that he and I were on the same page.  
  
Q. You said throughout the season that the seniors try hard every night.
What does it mean coming in, meeting these guys, forming relationships with
them, to see them go out like this?  
JOHN GROCE: Well, obviously, we have still got basketball to play. We're going
to continue to take it one day at a time.  
But I was happy for them. They made plays. D.J. ‑‑ and Sam made a huge play,
forcing the turnover on the sideline.  
I'm happy for those guys. They have been through an awful lot. And I'm really
proud of their resilience. I said that as soon as season two ended. That
they're aware that some people had written them off. I think that put a chip
on their shoulder. It does, if you're a competitor.  
And they responded very well in the second half of Big‑10 play. And today I
think that their mindset of being poised and the way they talked to one
another in timeouts, our body language was really good. Those intangible
things mean as much as anything in terms of being able to get the outcome we
got today. Now you're able to make some of those plays because your mind is
right.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
JOHN GROCE: Thank you.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Iowa  79  
Northwestern  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach.  
FRAN McCAFFERY:  
I thought to want our defensive intensity at the start of the game was
absolutely critical. I think it really got us going. They didn't score for
awhile. We got great play from a lot of different people which is really
typical of our team. Great to have Mike back in the layup. We knew they were
going to come back. Bill Carmody coached teams come back. They're going to
keep coming, executing, keep making it hard for us. And we had to fight to the
very end. We executed pretty well against the 2‑3\. Missed some shots, but
execution‑wise it was very good. I'm truly proud of my guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How does feel to get back playing in a game.  
MIKE GESELL: It felt great. It's tough having to sit out and watch the guys,
but at the same time I was just trying to do what was best for the team. And
when I was out, I was just cheering the guys on and it felt great to be able
to come in and play some minutes and make some contributions to the team.  
  
Q. Mike, from the beginning of the season just out of high school, freshman
year, does it feel like it kind of slowed down for you at this point or has it
made any difference since early in the season?  
MIKE GESELL: I would say it has. One of the differences was the physicality
and the speed of the game when I made the jump. The coaches do a great job of
preparing us and battling against my teammates every day in practice. It's
just helped out a lot. It's expanded my game a lot.  
  
Q. Eric, kind of talk a little bit about some offensive rebounds you had in
the second half. It really seemed to keep possessions alive and then of course
your dunk in the first half. Describe what you were feeling.  
ERIC MAY: I got to give credit for the way he opened that right up, and he
would be mad if I didn't give him a shout out. So he gets the assist on that.
But in the second half it was offensive rebounds, those are huge. Key to the
season with us is to keep the clock turning and at that point running the
clock was on our side. So, doing that was big time. That's what I tried to get
after.  
  
Q. Question for the three of you. Each of you made a pretty big three down
the stretch every time Northwestern would get close. Talk about how that kind
of kept you ahead, a distance ahead that you would ascribe to the 3 ‑point
ball.   
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: There was some big shots for us three. Can't really remember
the play, but, yeah, we made some big shots. All of us were struggling to get
the ball in the hole midway in the second half. We all were able to come up
and knock down some shots. So that was good. I thought that we could have made
about five or six more free throws out of those 32, but at the end of the day
I was proud of our performance and now we got to get ready for the next one.  
ERIC MAY: Northwestern's tough. They don't go away, like coach said. They're
always in the game. They can shoot the ball so well. Those threes kind of
answered their call, that was huge for us to keep that lead and keep that
distance from those guys. Because they're dangerous when it gets down like
that.  
MIKE GESELL: I would say in some of our close losses this year down the
stretch, we just weren't playing as confidently as we should. Even though each
of us had missed a few shots, we shot it with confidence and that's what you
got to do down the stretch. You got to play to win. You can't play not to
lose. And those are the shots that you got to take when you're open and we
were able to knock them down.  
  
Q. You didn't get to play against Michigan State the first time. You're a
Michigan guy are you looking forward to tomorrow's game?  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: It's another opportunity for us to get a big win. I'm not in
that phase any more of having to go against home teams. That was probably cool
the first time around as a freshman, but now I'm older and more mature, and I
understand what's really at stake. So I'm just looking at it as another
opportunity to get a key win.  
  
Q. For the upperclassmen, there are a lot of people who are Iowa fans who
are saying tomorrow night's game is the biggest Iowa game in a long time. How
do you players view it?  
ERIC MAY: I'm glad people are getting excited about this. They should be. I
think we're giving them reason to be. It is a ‑‑ every game this season has
been a big game. Especially in the Big‑10\. So for us to be in this position,
it would really be‑‑ for people to be excited and just how much things have
changed is really encouraging. It shows what we have been doing and the work
we have been putting in and the results we're getting from that work.  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: I think it's a big game just because it's the next one. But
I think, like Eric said, we have come out and had a pretty decent, good
season. But giving people reason to be excited about forthcoming games, and
all we have to do is go out there and not disappoint.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIKE GESELL: Just to come to an atmosphere like this, it's a little bit quiet
in there just because it's such a big arena. So you got to continue to keep up
the intensity and I think we did a good job for our first game out there of
taking care of business. We just got to stay focused and take one game at a
time.  
ERIC MAY: I don't think we get too caught up in all that. At any point in the
season if you're a bubble team, you go and win your conference tournament.
We're coming in here to win a tournament, win a championship. The rest will
take care of itself the post season play.  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: I think that whatever a lot of people are thinking, we're
just here to win a championship and that's been the goal and the task at hand.
And tomorrow's just another chance and opportunity to keep going towards that
goal. Today was a stepping stone, we took care of business and now it's on to
the next.  
  
Q. Mike, how did it feel to be back out there with your teammates playing?
And also wonder if any of you others could comment on that also.  
MIKE GESELL: It felt great. Every time I get to go out there and compete with
these guys, it's a lot of fun. I love all my teammates and they're fun to play
with. We have a very unselfish group and the older guys have done a great job
of helping me through this season, through the ups and downs of being a
freshman. It's been a fun season so far and I'm just looking to keep it going
with these guys.  
ERIC MAY: It's great. Mike's a great player. He makes solid plays and he's
another killer from 3‑point range. He can knock down shots. It's just huge. He
brings energy. So we're really glad to have him back and really going at this
full force.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You can head back to the locker room. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Fran, 48 ‑31 on the boards and a lot of second chance opportunities. Were
you pleased with the way you rebounded in this game?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I was. But in reality I think you got to look at what Bill was
doing. He was putting a team on the floor that was going to be hard to guard.
He had four guards out there a good portion of the second half and he was
driving a little bit more. They were into the bonuses, they got into the
double bonus with time left. So that creates opportunities to get second
shots. We were substantially bigger at times.  
  
Q. The team has come quite a ways a couple seasons from where they were when
they first got here. Expectations you had with this team, are they about where
you thought they might be coming into the second round of a tournament and how
far away are they if they're not?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: It's interesting because you go back to early, even before
October 15th. We worked the guys out a little bit, just a couple hours a week.
And I watched all summer how they fared and how they put extra time in on
their own. I felt like this team had the ability to do something special. So
I'm not surprised to have 21 wins. I think for us the more impressive thing is
looking at our losses. We have got some big time wins, but we have had some
losses where we were right there. We got drilled once this year. That's why
when you look at our rating it's always so high. They take that into
consideration.  
We have a very good team. We have, as Mike points out, a very unselfish team,
we have got tremendous character and we have as much depth, if not more depth,
than most teams I've seen. And it's amazing how often different lay‑ups have
come into the game and been so effective for us. And you can't predict what
lineup's going to be on the floor at the end of the game when you play us.
That makes it that much harder to scout and prepare for. I really like where
we are. We've got an unbelievable challenge tomorrow. Everybody knows that.
And that is, in some respects, almost the gold standard for what teams want to
become. Tom is one of the premier coaches in our game, without question. So we
know what's in front of us, but we welcome the opportunity.  
  
Q. Speaking about tomorrow night, do you feel tomorrow night's a must win
for your NCAA tournament hopes? And also, how pleased are you to hear your
players talk about this is more about they want to go out and win this thing;
They're not really concentrating on getting into the tournament?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I think that's important. I'm not foolish, I hear what
everybody's saying about that particular game. To me, I am very comfortable
with where our resume is right now. I think we deserve to be in. But, there
are so many factors and I respect whatever the committee decides. There are a
lot of other really good teams. The only thing that we can control is how we
play tomorrow. That's how we're going to approach it. It's not something that
we even talk about.  
  
Q. Talk about how you're able to keep them at bay in that second half.
Seemed like they couldn't get past about an eight point deficit?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: We had timely baskets. We had a couple of opportunities where
we got the ball to the high post, and sort of got it to the rim, back a couple
times, Woody a couple times. But they made the right read. They turn and faced
and they missed short shots that they would normally make. We got to the rim
one time and Woody had a chance to finish, didn't finish, he'll learn from
that. The key is to go back and guard people. And we did that. We got some
opportunities after that. As we pointed out, we made some big threes. Three in
particular that each one of these guys made, but the other thing is we got
some second shot opportunities and we got ‑‑ we had a chance to make some free
throws too to put the team away.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Iowa  73  
Northwestern  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach.  
BILL CARMODY: We got off to a bad start and turned the ball over probably in
the first five minutes about four or five times there. Maybe in the last six,
seven minutes of the first half. For the rest of the game, we didn't turn the
ball over too much. We had nine turnovers for the game.  
But getting in a hole like we did, it felt like we were trying to claw back
for most of the game. But we did a pretty nice job of going in ‑‑ we tried to
play man and 1‑3‑1 a little bit and then we sort of found what we thought was
a pretty good defense, that 2‑3 zone.  
We knew they would get the ball in the high post a little bit, but we just
thought that guys were in a little different position there and it seemed to
be pretty effective for us. Even though they got a few. They got seven or
eight there. And I don't know if we had one more turnover, like in a fast
break situation.  
And then I think Eric May and Marble just started making 13 or something like
that. And we weren't able to get back in it. I thought we defended actually
pretty decently. But, you know, that rebounding as far as our defense at the
end of it, we just didn't get as many rebounds. We went small. We took Kale
out and it seemed like the physical nature of the game was a little rough for
them initially. And then we were in this hole.  
So I think that's a pretty good team and they played pretty well for most of
the year. I have these two guys next to me who are seniors and I just told
them in the locker room they will never have any regrets, either one of them,
or any of the other guys too. Because they will never say, well, I wish I had
done this or practiced harder or dribbled to my left better or shot better or
worked at it more, because they both did. And they're both guys who have class
and they carry themselves with dignity.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For either of you, what do you feel like was, were the problems in the
slow start when you got down 15 ‑2\.   
REGGIE HEARN: I think at the beginning we weren't executing our offense very
well. We had some guys out of position, we weren't communicating well about
what the play was and our offense was kind of stagnant and I felt at times
when we're not going on offense it affects our defense. And we obviously
weren't playing defense well initially and we just got in a big hole.  
  
Q. Reggie, talk about your rebounding. You lead the team again for the
second straight game. Talk about what's changed for you since Jared left. Do
you feel you have more pressure to kind of pick up some loose rebounds?  
REGGIE HEARN: I wouldn't say it's pressure. But I realize it's something I
have to do. Sometimes I feel like, aside from Olah or Mike Turner, I'm like
the second biggest guy in there, so I just have to rebound if we want to win.
And our rebounding margin was still minus 17, so I didn't do near well enough
in that department.  
  
Q. Alex, after you guys used your final timeout what was said in the huddle
that brought you guys out with more energy?  
ALEX MARCOTULLIO: We knew we had to give it our all. We had one last run in
us, maybe a couple. We just said to each other, are we going to leave it all
out here or are we going to give up? And it seemed like we came together for a
few minutes there and we brought it back to seven, like coach said.  
And a couple missteps here and there and then they increased the lead. So that
was kind of deflating. But I'm proud of the way we fought. Just a few things
that we needed to clear up and we didn't take care of really early.  
  
Q. Alex, the way this program is going you guys are building up and things
are really starting to look brighter. How difficult was it to endure the way
everything went down?  
ALEX MARCOTULLIO: It was really difficult, especially for the senior class.
But that's basketball. You're going to have to deal with injuries and it's
really tough for us being our last year and having all these little fluke
things happen to us. But it's no excuse. We just went out there and practiced
hard every day, played hard, and just tried to come out with victories and
play as hard as we could for each other, the coaching staff and the
university.  
  
Q. Alex, talk about how Coach Carmody was able to handle all the speculation
about his future and did it influence his coaching?  
ALEX MARCOTULLIO: I said this over the last couple weeks, with all the
speculation, I think he's done a terrific job with the cards that have been
dealt. He's put us in a situation to win and the rest of the coaching staff
have done a great job with the scouting reports. And we're the players out on
the court and we have to make plays. And, yeah, they put us in the right spots
and we just haven't been able to execute as well as we should have.  
  
Q. Reggie, how tough is it for you guys to know there was that, you know,
people talking about your coach like that. Talking about changing this
program. Just to play with that over you.  
REGGIE HEARN: Yeah, it was tough. I didn't know there was that much
speculation going on until I got asked by a reporter maybe a week ago or
before practice one time. I wasn't really aware of it. And I think that Coach
Carmody and the coaching staff has done a great job of not really letting it
affect the way they coach.  
Like I said, I wasn't aware of it, I don't know about the other guys, but I
didn't even know until a weak ago and they kept coaching as normal and it was
fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You can return to the locker room. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk about what the week's been and kind of the emotions tonight and what
it was like in the locker room after the game and the uncertainty from your
situation, does that add to the emotion at all in the locker room
afterwards?  
BILL CARMODY: I tried to keep it very short. I really just mentioned a few
things to the younger guys about what they have to work on; and then really
just talked about the seniors, the three seniors and what they meant to the
program. How they have worked and how they have carried themselves.  
So, like Reggie said, we didn't really talk too much about the whole
situation. And if guys knew something, fine. And if they didn't‑‑ of course,
Reggie was probably studying, so he didn't read your articles.  
  
Q. Where's this program now compared to when you got here?  
BILL CARMODY: Well the talent level is measurably better. I thought it was
going along pretty nicely and then just this year it's sort of, when a couple
players went down it changed everything, basically playing with all guards and
freshmen. So it got harder for our guys.  
Alex said that the coaching staff has put them in positions and they have to
execute, but they executed to their abilities. I think that it wasn't that
they didn't execute or didn't run the game plan or anything like that. They
shouldn't take anything from it, because it was just real hard, the situation,
arguably a couple of your very good players going down.  
  
Q. With you having to start so many of the underclassmen, how is that going
to help them in coming years, despite the adversity?  
BILL CARMODY: I hope it helps. Guys get better and sometimes they don't. I
would like to say that we're playing all these young guys so they're going to
get better and we have to take our lumps now. But sometimes they get better
and sometimes they don't. And for the most part we have had a pretty good
success rate with guys developing, but you never are sure. I certainly think
Olah has improved in the last month. You can see it. But there's no definite
measure.  
  
Q. Talk about Dave, he had an off shooting night. He's been shooting a
little bit worse from the field in the later part of the season. Do you think
he's a little bit too tired or do you think it's just one of those slumps?  
BILL CARMODY: People said that last year that he was getting tired and that
really affected him. Maybe that's true. But I don't think that was necessarily
true this year. I think that he was affected by guys being injured and stuff,
because he's sort of a facilitator and trying to help other guys. And when you
throw it to a guy who isn't as productive as ‑‑ if you can throw it to Drew,
he's going to make it about 40 percent of the time from outside. And someone
else might not. So then he has to do some things that maybe are
uncharacteristic, where he has to stretch his limits a little bit.  
  
Q. Are you surprised that they're talking about your future given the
injuries and the academic suspension this year and all the different things
that have contributed to where you guys finished that were out of your
control?  
BILL CARMODY: Well, it's just the way it is. Jim Philips and I will discuss
this the next couple days and we'll go from there. We evaluate each year, so,
I mean, it's no different than any other year as far as how we go about our
business.  
  
Q. You kind of just answered this. Do you have a meeting scheduled yet with
Jim finalized or is it something that you're going to be doing going
forward?  
BILL CARMODY: We'll get together soon.  
  
Q. Talk about your desire to be back, especially given that next year's
roster will be promising. Talk about that, as something that you really want
to be back.  
BILL CARMODY: I don't think that this is the time for that. I'd just as soon
have a discussion with Jim and then we'll go from there.  
  
Q. How would you evaluate ‑‑ it's been such a, I don't want to say
up‑and‑down, tenure at Northwestern, because you've done some great things.
But how would you evaluate your time here so far?   
BILL CARMODY: Everyone's goal is to get in the NCAA tournament. So we haven't
been able to accomplish that. But in a hundred years we haven't been able to
accomplish that. And there's not that much different now about what
Northwestern offers than it was when Kevin O'Neil was here and Birdsong and
Bill Foster and all those.  
So everyone knows, people have talked about it, it's sort of like an arms
race. So the gap might be widening that way. But I feel like we have done a
pretty good job of bringing in some pretty good players and getting better.  
So, in that regard, the goal of the staff and the players all along has been
to get to the tournament and I think the administration knows that we have to
sort of move ahead. A big step is being made with the Lakefront facility and
the money coming in is fantastic. Down the road it's going to help us.  
  
Q. Football's obviously gotten a big uptick and I'm sure the fund raising
‑‑  
BILL CARMODY: In what?  
  
Q. In wins and attention and I'm sure in money.  
BILL CARMODY: Well, you know, football and basketball are apples and oranges.
We have been in the post‑season, the NIT, all that kind of stuff. And football
raises. Football‑‑ money comes in from football. People said 85 percent is
football and basketball is like 15 percent. And our administration knows that
and they're going to do something about that.  
And it's just a question of you have to pick something first. And I think
we'll benefit from some of the things that are in this Lakefront facility,
academically and the training facilities and then we have to move on to the
future.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [D.J. Byrd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23433)

### [Ronnie Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25032)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Nebraska  57  
Purdue  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead with an opening statement from coach.  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously a very tough loss for us. I thought we did a better
job of taking care of the basketball. We out rebounded them. We just didn't do
some simple things especially well in the second half.  
We really played pretty good basketball here the past couple weeks and with
that we did a better job with our shot selection and making decisions in terms
of taking a good shot.  
We had to battle back, I just thought Nebraska was a step quicker than us most
of the night. But we battled back and got it to two possessions. And then we
went about four straight possessions in the middle of the second half where we
took two horrendous shots and had two turnovers. That was a key time of the
game, even though we got back into the game and had a chance to win the
basketball game, those four possessions in a row really hurt us. And then we
had some breakdowns and missed some free throws. And then had the one rebound
on a missed free throw that everybody seemed to box their man out and not go
get the basketball. And that crushed it.  
But you have to give them credit, I thought Shavon Shields was great in the
first half. He played like a senior, played like an experienced guy. So give
him credit. If you would have told us that we would have took their two best
shooters and they would have had nine and five, I would have said we would
have won this game. But obviously we didn't. But give them credit. They
outplayed us.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you, to start the second half you pulled within two right at
the end of the half and they got off, I think and scored the first nine points
of the second half. What at both ends did you see went wrong in that stretch,
because you were playing uphill the rest of the way because of that 9 ‑0 run.
  
D.J. BYRD: Offensively I just thought that we could have got some better
looks, took some better shots down the stretch. But we just had to run the
offense. And you didn't really know if they were going to switch on some down
screens on some of the guys. I guess give credit to them. They made it tough
on us. But that 9‑0 run we had to be able to crack down and get some stops and
we didn't.  
RONNIE JOHNSON: I thought we were digging ourselves in a hole pretty bad. They
were scoring and then we were throwing up bad shots. So that's not what you
want when you're trying to win.  
  
Q. D.J., this team has played so well the last three weeks and then you got
back into this one, but you fall short. You're two games under .500. I know as
a senior you talked about wanting to continue to play basketball. It's not in
your hands now, but do you feel like this team is still deserving of some kind
of post ‑season opportunity?   
D.J. BYRD: I believe so. The way we played the past couple weeks, Michigan and
Minnesota, and we had some good games and played hard. And we came up short in
some big games too. So for me, I always want to play some more games, but it
would be great if we could.  
  
Q. Ronnie, in the game out in Lincoln, you and Terone were able to get in
the lane and get some of those floaters. Terone had an especially good night.
And they talked about how they were able to plug that up this time. Did you
sense from early on that it was going to be more difficult with Ubel in there
for you and Terone to penetrate and get those floaters like you've been doing
so often lately?  
RONNIE JOHNSON: I thought so. They guarded the ball screen a bit different
than Wisconsin did. They had a hard hedge, whereas, Wisconsin, you could get
in the lane pretty easy. And they kind of stayed on our hands instead of my
left and my brother's right. So it was just kind of hard to get in there and
make those plays.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, guys. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Same thing, so much ‑‑ you talked about this year, good things happen
when you're able to get into the paint. It just didn't seem like it came as
easily tonight. From a strategical standpoint, talk about what they did that
made it so difficult tonight to get in there?  
MATT PAINTER: Really not anything different than what other people do. They
packed it in. When you face different teams that do that, you just have to
show some discipline and put them on defense and break them down.  
We didn't do that. We were too eager. I didn't think we did a good job of
moving. I thought we had to move them more. Any time you move them more, you
usually spread them out more. And we just didn't have good ball movement, we
didn't cut hard, we did too much watching. That's something we really worked
on this past month. And it's a shame that you get in a close game like that
and you can't do a better job of disrupting their offense.  
  
Q. You went with Sandi at critical times in the second half. What did you
see from him tonight that you liked?  
MATT PAINTER: I thought he played hard. He gave us a spark there. He had six
rebounds in 14 minutes. And obviously A.J. scored the basketball.  
But in that one stretch A.J. had the turnover and then he had a couple shots
right there at the basket and he had already been out there about three or
four minutes. So it was just a natural rotation where I was going to sub him
out anyway and Sandi went in and got rebounds for us and gave us some energy.
So we stuck with him.  
He's done a really good job for us. A lot of times when guys get out of the
rotation they get down, they get a bad attitude, and Sandi's had a great
attitude when he got out of the rotation and he's kept fighting and he's
really helped us here the past couple weeks.  
  
Q. That final possession turned into a scramble. Who were you hoping would
get that shot away?  
MATT PAINTER: We were doing‑‑ we did the same thing we have been doing before
with Byrd getting those shots, except that Terone, we wanted him to get in the
paint, because we didn't need a three. We wanted him to get in the paint and
try to draw a foul or get to the rim. And we didn't get a good ball screen.
You go back and watch the tape, he didn't get a good ball screen right there.
He got a contested shot.  
Obviously, he got it back and had another contested shot there. You would like
to get a little better look. But we had the ball in the right guy's hand.  
  
Q. You talked at Illinois in the game about a month ago how you were tired
of hearing that you're a young team. What do you take from this last month
moving into next year with your team being so young?  
MATT PAINTER: I thought that the improvements we made here in the past two,
three weeks, I thought that should have been where we were in late December,
early January. It just took us a while to figure it out.  
Then when things don't go our way‑‑ the Wisconsin win was a great win,
obviously, but we were down 13, 14 points in the game and came back and won.
So you see it in games like this right here where we get down, we really
struggle to handle adversity. We have done a better job with it, but the
missed free throws, the missed opportunities, the breakdowns, they didn't
actually answer the question about the start of the second half. It's just an
immature approach to coming out in the second half. And maybe some shots don't
fall for you, but you still do your defensive assignment, you don't get back
boarded out of the corner, you stay tight on a screen. You do what you're
supposed to do. They make tough shots, you shake their hand.  
We had some mental breakdowns. We weren't ready to play. I wish I could blame
it on our young guys, but we just didn't have a group that could stay in it.
It was great to see how they improved at the end of the year, but this right
here we had too many situations, opportunities where it seemed like we were
backing down from where we played most of the year, especially against good
competition.  
  
Q. I asked D.J., you said on Monday you would play exhibition right now.
Tonight's a little bit of a bummer for you, but do you still hope that
somebody will come calling next week for some post ‑season opportunities?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, sure. But it's also one of those things where I want our
guys to be in the right frame of mind. Because I want to do it, but I don't
play. So they can say what they want, but you got to be able to give your word
that you're going to go out there and fight and take it serious and go out and
try to win the game if you get that opportunity.  
  
Q. This is the first time in awhile that you're not looking ahead to the
NCAA tournament . Where do you go from here? How critical is it looking ahead
into the summer going forward?  
MATT PAINTER: It's like any other year. Obviously, it's disappointing that
you're not going to play the NCAA tournament. But we go back and we assess
where we are, evaluate each guy, evaluate our team, do our best to evaluate
what's coming in. Because we need to recruit and try to get some things fixed.  
We just have to be more into it in terms of having 12‑month guys. You can't
get in situations ‑‑ we got to get a more skilled guy, in my opinion. The year
before we weren't as talented as we were before, but we took care of the
basketball and we always gave ourself a chance. And this year we didn't do
that at times. And then you got to be able to make free throws, just do simple
fundamental things.  
So when you have guys that are 12‑month guys that put in a lot of time, that
area is going to improve. You just got to do a better job there. I got to do a
better job there.  
  
Q. You talked about assessing everybody individually. Sandi went from
starter to DNP back to a critical role player. David Washington went from a
starter at different times to now where he's at. What didn't he do to earn
playing time?  
MATT PAINTER: I get to this a lot of times when you guys ask questions about
that, about guys, and you got to understand they're college students. You
know. He got beat out. It's real simple. Rapheal Davis beat out all those
guys. He's not a traditional four. Rapheal Davis shows up every single day, he
comes early, he stays late, he works on his game, he watches extra film. I'm
going to migrate to those guys.  
I'm not going to migrate to guys that come in, when practice is at 3 o'clock,
right at 3 and it ends at 5:30, they leave right at 5:30. I'm always going to
be that way.  
I tell my recruits, if you work on your game and you care and you love it, I'm
your guy. If you go through the motions or whatever, I'm not your guy.  
The guys who didn't play tonight, outside of Travis Carroll and Dru Anthrop,
they got to get in the gym. Dru Anthrop, Travis Carroll, they overachieved.
They worked their asses off to be here and they care. The other guys are good
guys, but you got to show up with a passion and a commitment to what we're
doing if you want me to trust you.  
I think that's what it comes down to. I don't trust guys that I don't see. You
live in that gym, I start to trust you. I think that's an important thing in
college basketball. Period.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Sasa Borovnjak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24995)

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [D.J. Newbill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24994)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan  83  
Penn State  66

  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead and get started with an opening statement from coach.  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Proud of our kids. They competed. They played hard. Last
month has been a lot of fun being right there, being so close.  
Give Michigan a lot of credit. That second half run that they made on us, we
couldn't respond and we couldn't get stops. Their bigs did a tremendous job
today. I think that was really the difference. The bigs finished. They hurt us
on the offensive glass as well.  
I love this team and I'm really proud of these players and the way they
competed to finish the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For either guy, what happened in the second half when they started
getting on a roll. How difficult are they to stop with all their offense?  
D.J. NEWBILL: I think that they got stops. They got out on the break, they hit
shots, they rebounded the ball really well. I think that that led to them
getting on their run.  
SASA BOROVNJAK: It was really tough. They crashed the offensive glass all game
long and we didn't do a great job of rebounding and that was the difference.  
  
Q. D.J., Coach Beilein just had some really good things to say about
potential for you guys next year with Frazier coming back. Talk about what you
learned this year and the potential for next year.  
D.J. NEWBILL: Just learning to keep battling. No matter what adversity
strikes, just keep battling. This upcoming season, we can't look too far
ahead, we got to get in the gym and work hard. This offseason we just got to
put in that much more work.  
  
Q. Can one of the players talk about the difficulty about getting inside
against them?  
SASA BOROVNJAK: My teammates did a great job of finding me today. I was just
trying to find open areas to help my teammates down low. But again, like their
bigs did a great job today. I give them a lot of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, fellows, you can return to the locker room.
Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned the play of the bigs. You look at the rebounding it was
pretty even but you look at the second chance points and they had 28 ‑15\. How
big was that, their ability to cash in on their offensive rebounds?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: That was the difference in the two games that we played them
we did a pretty good job for the most part. Mitch McGary set the tone in the
first half. He had a double, double and he had 10 rebounds in the first half
alone.  
Again, Horford did his job and Morgan did his job. Those guys I thought were
huge today. Because they know how we were loading to Tim and their shooters
and Trey. So those guys had to catch and finish and they did.  
As a matter of fact, they caught, they finished, and they got to the foul
line. They're back breakers. 3‑point plays are absolute daggers. And they did
a good job.  
  
Q. Talk more about the last month and how much fun you had and does this
kind of make it feel like you're closer to getting over the hump this year?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: We got a lot of work to do. We're in the Big‑10\. It's the
best conference. Over the hump? I'll let you know when we get there next year.
I told the guys‑‑ and I said this after the game against Wisconsin, we lost in
that buzzer beater‑‑ I really enjoyed coaching them. I love coaching them and
I want this season to continue.  
We're starting to get better, they were starting to mesh. And the cohesion out
there, it was great, the chemistry and the trust. You could just see it over
the last four or five weeks. We were really starting to come around. It's a
shame the season has to end.  
  
Q. You must be pleased with only having eight turnovers against that
pressure defense.  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Yeah. I'm pleased that we only turned it over eight times.
I'm not pleased that they only turned it over four times. We took care of the
ball over the last month for the most part. One game here or there we didn't
do a great job. But took care of the ball, we got shots.  
We didn't shoot the ball particularly well from the three today. They took
away our threes, which was huge, because we made 10 threes against them at
home last game. But we took care of the ball and our assists skyrocketed
recently, which is good. We're starting to share the ball a little bit more
and hopefully that can continue into next year.  
  
Q. Was there ever a point this year where you had to warn them that you
can't just fast forward to next year and get Tim back. Was there every any,
wait until next year you had to get out of their heads?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Well, there's no doubt. Every time we were in a press
conference, every time we had media in it was all like, man, you guys are
going to be good next year.  
And I was trying to tell them to live in the moment. Take each day as it
comes. Stay here, be right here, right now. Because we can still win games and
get better. We have a choice. Make the right choice. The choice is to continue
to work hard. And they did.  
There's no guarantees next year either. There's always injuries, there's
always something that's going to happen. So we have to continue what we laid
out over the last few weeks and use that as we go into spring and summer.  
  
Q. With Frazier out, he says he's on point with his rehab.  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Doing great.  
  
Q. What did he learn this year being a student coach?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: He was awesome. He totally gets the coaching aspect of it.
Totally see things when I get angry and upset during practice and games. He
sees the game differently. He's very mature now.  
It's going to be challenge for him. It really is. Because he became a coach.
Now he's got to go back to being a player and he's got to demand that respect
and that leadership. And leadership never takes a day off. And I think he's
looking forward to the challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan  83  
Penn State  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started and take an opening statement
from coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
JOHN BEILEIN: Really proud of this team. From the way they ‑‑ we had a really
disappointing loss on Saturday. Bouncing back is always a difficult thing to
do. But then you get down 14‑3, we could have pointed fingers at each other,
we could have lost our composure. Within no time it was a tie game or we were
ahead by one.  
So really proud of the way they showed great composure to come back and then
win the game going away.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Mitch, Jordan struggled a little bit. Did you feel the urge that the team
needed a spark to kind of get things going?  
MITCH McGARY: Coming off the bench I wanted to provide a spark. We were down
14‑3 and I know we needed to pick up the intensity on the defensive and
offensive glass and I was able to score a few buckets.  
  
Q. For any guys, how much motivation did you derive from the last time you
played them and what happened?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: It was a lot of motivation coming into this game. We knew
what they did to us at Happy Valley and we really wanted to do a great job
just going into the game, sticking to the game plan, and just playing Michigan
basketball.  
We knew we came off a loss against Indiana at home and once we got up with 12
minutes to go in the second half, we just reminded everybody that they can
still come back, they can knock down threes, Marshall's a threat. Everyone's a
threat. So we wanted to make sure that we went out there and just played
basketball.  
  
Q. For Tim, you face a Wisconsin team that you guys had a very difficult
loss at their place. What lessons did you learn from this game and are you
eager to get a chance again, since you only played them once.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: It was a tough loss. The second time that's happened to me.
And it's tough just to go on a stretch like that and then come up short.  
So we just have to make sure that we watch the film, see the things that we
did wrong during the game, and just try not to make the same mistakes again.
So we just got to go out there and just play ball, like I said, and just stick
to the game plan.  
  
Q. Trey, at the 10 and a half minute mark you were up 15, which is the same
thing when you were ahead at Penn State. Couple of guys were coming out
smiling, but I think that the mood of the team was still we got business. Was
that what you saw as well?  
TREY BURKE: Definitely. I think it's important for us to go out there and have
fun and at the end of the day I think that's when we're our best when we go
out there on the court and are having fun.  
It was obviously in the back of our head that we were up 15 points with 10
minutes left at Penn State and that they're capable of coming back and winning
the game. This is a team that's playing for pride, a team that's been through
a lot this year. We just had to make sure we did what we needed to do to pull
out the win.  
  
Q. Trey, talk about how Mitch kind of saved you guys a little bit there in
the first half with everything falling apart. He was huge.  
TREY BURKE: Definitely. That's Mitch McGary. That's how he is. He's able to
come off the bench and give us a spark. Once he comes off the bench and gets
the crowd into it‑‑ he does that a lot. But that gives us energy. Him being a
freshman, that goes a long way. That goes to show that, hey, he's definitely
going to be a future captain on this team and that he has the ability to bring
the spark to this team, not only at the offensive end, but on the defensive
end. I think he had six or seven rebounds within 10 minutes. And that just
goes to show how much effort and intensity he plays with.  
  
Q. Trey, you guys talked about the slow starts and again this is another
one. Is that part of the trend or do you think the way you guys rebounded from
it makes it not as important?  
TREY BURKE: Well, I think that is just something that we're still continuing
to get better at. Just coming out with a lot of intensity. We came out and we
had some really good looks that we missed and they executed off the good looks
that we missed. But we just continue to give each other encouragement and
confidence out there. Once we kind of relaxed and got through the first five,
seven minutes, we just were able to come back as a team and we were able to
stick it out.  
  
Q. Tim, there was a stretch in the second half where you hit a couple of
shots, Horford hit a couple of shots, and at that game at Penn State that was
the drought that opened up that come back. But tonight you guys really closed
it out. What was the difference offensively that you guys were able to execute
tonight?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Our point guards recognized that they were in zone and they
did a great job of recognizing what defense they were in and just called our
zone plays, called our man plays. And I was able to get inside the paint and
move without the ball and just get open looks. And that really opens up, not
only for myself, but when I get the ball, me being a good threat to shoot, but
to pass as well. So our bigs did a great job of finishing down low and it just
helped us get the game to open up.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. You may return to the locker room. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. With Jordan struggling early and Mitch playing so big in the first half,
Jon played so big in the second half, do you consider changing that at all,
given the last 48 minutes or whatever it's been?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We talk about the roster and rotation every day. We'll probably
do that again. But a change, I'm not going to say we're going to do it or not
going to do it. Sometimes a guy, if we do make a change, maybe Jordan will
play more relaxed coming off the bench and make some of those shots he missed.
It will be up in the air, if I decide it's up in the air. Right now it's too
soon to make that. I will watch some film and talk and see what ‑‑ again, look
at our matchups for the next game and decide what we're going to do.  
  
Q. You had a wink at Mitch there. What kind of leadership and I guess an
overall spark off the bench has he provided this year, especially tonight?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think it's very similar to his game. It's developing. He has
got a lot of potential, as we all can see. And he's trying to become more
efficient with his game. He's trying to become more efficient with his
leadership, with his practices, with all the things that could take him to,
make him a very, very talented player and, frankly, when his basketball
career's over, make him talented at anything he wants to do in life, because
he's so blessed.  
So that's what I'm winking to him about, because he's got a load of potential
in more ways than just basketball. As long as Brady Hoke stays away from him
he's got the potential to do anything. And Brady is messing with him right
now. I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. Coach, you sense any extra motivation with your team after what happened
last time with Penn State?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Let me say this about Penn State and Patrick Chambers and this
thing. I'm watching this thing, there's seven gays, they have been playing
together ‑‑ after they lost Tim Frazier‑‑ huge change in their game. And I'm
telling you, if it was anybody, even Michigan, besides Michigan, in that game
today, it probably would have been the same.  
They are playing so well together. They got a great scheme. And this game
concerned me greatly. At our place we couldn't get away from them. So I think
our kids were motivated and I think it's probably the silver lining that if we
had beat them twice, let's say we make our foul shots, we don't turn it over
at their place, we would have looked past them.  
That is going to be one heck of a team next year when Frazier is back with
those guys. So that's, I just, I think Pat's done a wonderful job. They're
running things offensively that had us, our minds were just, like the last
night, were very concerned about how we could stop them.  
  
Q. Penn State shot 48 percent from the field. What was the reason for that
and how do you prevent that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think that they have two guys, Marshall and Newbill, that can
get about anywhere they want to get to on the court. I don't care who is
guarding them. They can get to there.  
Now what happens is they end up attracting help or they get their own or
people get rebounds or they get dropoffs. Those two guards are the second or
the leading scoring guards in the league, between Tim and Trey. They're two of
the best guards in the league. And so that's a pig part of that.  
At the same time, they're running some really good stuff that, if you blink‑‑
it's like Northwestern, there's different stuff, but off the ball screen,
maybe I'm stupid, but we haven't seen a lot of that action that they're
running right now.  
  
Q. How good is the Big ‑10 right now and how dangerous will the conference
be, in your estimation, come tournament time?   
JOHN BEILEIN: As you can see, I think it says a lot that we're playing the
5‑12 game and people think so much of us, rank us so highly in the country.
It's tough for me, because you get so into your league. I love watching
Illinois and Minnesota play. Those are some terrific basketball teams that
have showed it off the court and showed it in other leagues.  
So I think ‑‑ I don't know what our number is for bids in the past when we
were the Big‑10 or the Big‑11 or the Big‑10 that's got 12. This could be a
year where you have eight or nine now. I think they're worthy of it. I
sincerely think they're worthy of nine bids. Depending upon how this all plays
out.  
  
Q. You got up by nine in the first half, they made a run and it was a throw
up ball game at halftime. You made another run in the second half. This time,
no run. What was the difference in the two halves do you think? Did your team
crank it up a little bit?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We got more comfortable with the action that they're running.
After you see it over and over again‑‑ and we're growing in so many areas,
every game. And sometimes it's game to game, timeout to timeout, and sometimes
it's half to half.  
And as our team looks at this, as they continue to grow as a team, they're
recognition is quicker and they recognize it quicker and are able to defend
it. So I think defense was key and then our bench was key. It was big. For Jon
to come off the bench and what Mitch gave us was huge.  
  
Q. Wisconsin tomorrow, obviously a team that you guys are familiar with.
What do you expect from that game?  
JOHN BEILEIN: One thing that you can expect is the same old winning, don't
beat yourself, style that we have seen over and over again. We're the victim
of two buzzer beaters against them as well as about 10 of shot clock time over
the six years I've been coaching against them.  
They're not going to beat themselves. They're going to have big guys. You're
not going to get too many offensive rebounds. They're going to stay very tight
with their formation.  
We're going to have to make shots. We're going to have to make tough shots.  
On the other hand, we're going to have to be very patient on defense. They're
not going to turn it over. Be very patient with our defense and solid with our
defense. Make them score over us, without giving them second opportunities.
Same speech I've given any time. A really well coached, really good team.  
  
Q. How good are Penn State's guards going to be next year?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I was talking about Tim Frazier before the game. And I told him,
when Tim is in there, Newbill‑‑ the good thing with Newbill right now is he's
learned to play with the ball and to be a point guard.  
So you put Frazier, Newbill, and then Marshall in that back court, that will
be as good as anybody. I don't know if Sasa has another year, but if he has
and comes back for another year‑‑ I think he might have one‑‑ but if he does,
Sasa is a really underrated player. And Travis is really, I love the way
Travis plays. There's a whole bunch of coaches that would love to have Travis
as well. He's a really good player.  
So this should be, this past two years, what Pat's gone through has been
difficult, but he's got the makings of a really good team.  
Another reason is because I like the character of that team and how they play
together. He's really got a team that I think that we would want our team to
play with that much togetherness, and I think we do, and I think his team
does. Just not enough depth or not enough experience yet.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Dayton  82  
California  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Coach Archie Miller.  
COACH MILLER: Obviously, three games, three days, every team here is battling
it. I give our kids a lot of credit. It was a sting after that Baylor game
last night. Very, very important that our players responded with great
maturity.  
Thought our guys were ready to go very quickly after the game, understanding
that you can lose two in a row very quickly if you're not ready to play. We
talked a lot about it late last night that our depth was going to be the
number one thing that would get us through the finish line today. I look at
our 52‑8 score, and I look at Kyle Davis and Jalen, and two guys that
completely changed the game. Kyle Davis, I think was a part of two runs that
may have been 23‑0 when he was in the game. That's what it's about. He didn't
play a lot in the first two games. He's mentally ready, a great teammate, and
I think that's across the board for our team. So hopefully we can take this
trip and build on it and take it to the next game.  
  
Q. Coach, Cal cut it to two and your team responded with a nice run. Talk
about your team responding to Cal's run and taking control of this game?  
COACH MILLER: It was a very big run by Cal. Obviously Justin Cobbs went crazy
there for a while and he started to take over the game like a terrific player
does. I thought when we were able to get a bucket call quick timeout and
regroup there for a minute. We had to think about some things. We started the
second half not playing the right way, and it got in the way.  
We had some selfish plays on offense, and defensively we let him do what he
wanted to do, and that's what happened. But I thought we responded. Again, our
bench and substitutions helped us. Third game in three days, you're not going
to be able to play at the same level 30 minutes a game. So we needed it. We
had a lot of different guys come into the game and play, and thought it was a
great to obviously D‑Mo is doing a great job as a senior. He's by far and away
the biggest glue guy we have. He's doing a good job leading these guys off the
floor when we're not around as well.  
  
Q. Devin, can you talk about today's game, today's win after the
disappointment of last night?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, it felt good. Obviously we were down after the game
yesterday, kind of felt like we let one slip away, but it was really good to
see ourselves as a team come back with the mentality to get out of here with a
2‑1 record. So it was good to get the win.  
  
Q. Your team only had four turnovers today, so talk about your team's
ability to hold on to the ball?  
COACH MILLER: It's a miracle. It's a miracle. I mean, we talk about it all the
time. If our team can take care of the ball and get extra possessions,
obviously, it's to our advantage. But sometimes we just throw the ball like
they have mind to mind reading. They don't even have to look at one another.
They just throw the ball at one another and they're not even looking for it at
times. We've got to clean things up. It's evident we're not on the same page
with execution and echoing calls and everybody being on the same page. In
particularly in transition we have to take care of it a little bit better.
It's pretty much the biggest key to the season. If we don't turn the ball
over, we'll have a chance to be successful, and that's a big thing. But to
their credit, four turnovers in 40 minutes is an absolute great job.  
  
Q. There is a lot of talk about the teams being tournament teams at the end
of the season. Is that something ‑‑ I know with a tough end season, you want
to do well in the non‑conference?  
COACH MILLER: No one's in the tournament until they announce the tournament on
Selection Sunday, so there is no real reason to talk about it.  
  
Q. Jalen, the bench as Coach mentioned had a great game. So talk about the
guys coming off the bench and being ready to play and contributing to this
team?  
JALEN ROBINSON: Yeah, our bench was a big part of today's game. Last night
Coach told us just to be ready and our depth would take us a long way.
Everybody who came in off the bench came in and was very productive and played
together as a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some final thoughts on the Maui experience?  
COACH MILLER: Privileged to be here. It was awesome for our fans to take over
the civic center and our games. It's what I don't think a lot of people
understand how well we travel and what a great job they do of supporting our
team. But most importantly for our players I thought they came out here with a
business‑like approach. They knew this was going to be a very difficult trip.
We left last Tuesday for Atlanta to play at Georgia Tech and still haven't
been back. It seems like we've been here for a month.  
But when you're here, it's something you remember forever. These guys as
players will never forget it. I know as our coaches being able to coach
against the quality of competition that we did and it was just a privilege to
be here. I hope we're back at some point in time. And Coach Odom and everyone
from the management all the way down, it's first class. It's the premier
exempt event that goes on in the fall, and to be part of it is something truly
special.

## November 27, 2013

  

### [DeAndre Mathieu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26127)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Minnesota  83  
Chaminade - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Richard Pitino, Malik Smith, and DeAndre Mathieu
coming in. Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH PITINO: Probably surprised to hear this, but I'd probably say that was
the most proud I've been of the guys so far this year because we had so much
to lose, they had so much to gain. We were battling so many obstacles, and
certainly every team does. But travel, we were tired, and it's just the time
change. It was all very, very difficult.  
Today it felt like this was the first time playing at 9:30 that it felt like
9:30 in the morning. Yesterday it didn't feel that way. I don't know if our
bodies just adjusted. Really, really difficult. Want to definitely thank our
fans. They saved us. They were awesome, and I am very much proud of these
guys. They were very gritty and they toughed it out today.  
  
Q. DeAndre, just talk about at one point in the second half you guys were
down nine. You're playing a Division II team. Did you feel like, hey, this is
it. We have to make a run here otherwise we'll get upset?  
DeANDRE MATHIEU: No doubt about it. Coach lit a fire under us to come out at
halftime with the intensity. We came out kind of slow. And the guys in the
huddle, the team came together, it was like we've got to make a run now. It's
now or never. If they would have gotten a bigger lead, it would have probably
been over. We just decided to fight.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see at the end with the press that changed things so
much?  
COACH PITINO: The guy sitting two seats to my left finally started to defend
like a fast point guard. Sometimes he gets a little passive. I think it's that
Southern mentality. We're trying to get that out of him. But it was all him.
That's what he needs to be. He's got that ability. I don't know if he's pacing
himself a little bit.  
But when he started to turn up the heat, everybody else fed off of him. He was
a huge part of this run. 35 minutes he played, and doing that in the press, he
saved us. He was tremendous tonight, this morning. Whenever this is, whenever
we are.  
THE MODERATOR: Maui, and it's about ready for lunch.  
COACH PITINO: Yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, the rebounding battle was at 38 ‑all. Was that the most
disappointing statistic on the stat sheet for you?   
COACH PITINO: Not really. I'm telling you right now, I'm extremely proud of
these guys. There is nothing I'm really disappointed with. Chaminade's a good
team, and again, that's their National Championship. They live for that. He's
a great coach. They play very loose. They play very hard. We were undersized.
There is not a whole lot I'm disappointed about in this win.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about finishing off the tournament this way? I'm sure
it was disappointing the first two days, but finding that motivation this
morning like you've kind of touched on some of those adverse situations?  
COACH PITINO: We've played six halves, three games, six halves, and I thought
we played really well for four halves. I thought we played very hard
regardless who scored against Syracuse. I thought we played great the first
half against Arkansas. They just outplayed us the second half. Today we were a
little lethargic, but we finished out strong.  
Obviously, you'd like to play a perfect game. We're still learning; we're
still growing. But, again, I've got to give our players so much why for just
finding a way to win this game in a very tough situation.  
  
Q. For Malik, how did you feel about the team's energy coming into the game?
Was part of that really your body adjusting and feeling like it was a 9:30
a.m. game?  
MALIK SMITH: Yeah, it really felt early today compared to yesterday because
yesterday we were playing an SEC team. It really wasn't hard to get up for
that game. Today we were playing a Division II team that had nothing to lose,
like Coach said. We came out slow. In the second half, we picked it up and got
after it.  
  
Q. What does this win do for you guys moving forward? You come back, you
play Florida State in a little bit here. You lose this game and then there is
a lot of confidence issues going into that game, but now, how do you feel?  
MALIK SMITH: I think the biggest thing is it gave us a little bit of
confidence back. After losing two games, your confidence starts to leave you a
little bit. After today's win, we got a little bit of that back.  
DeANDRE MATHIEU: It shows us how hard we have to play. Every play has to be
like that second half when we went on a big run. Like Malik said, it would
have been rough practices for us. So it just gave us confidence, and it
stopped the rough practices.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you say you're happy with how they ended it. But what does
the team have to learn from the first half to the second half?  
COACH PITINO: Probably that anybody can beat us on any given night. That just
showed us. If mentality‑wise we don't bring it every game, we could lose.
Conversely though, it shows us if we go in with the same mindset that
Chaminade has, we can beat anybody.  
Again, I can't overstate enough that I'm really proud of these guys. I'm very,
very thankful. We wouldn't have won that game if we didn't travel as well as
we did with great fan support from our Minnesota fans. They were phenomenal.  
  
Q. With Andre Hollins, he had a really big shot down the stretch, but do you
feel like he's maybe a little bit not quite himself in the last couple days?  
COACH PITINO: No, I think today was just foul trouble. That was his big issue
today; he had four fouls. I thought he had a good tournament. He did a lot of
things good defensively, showed great leadership, so, no, I don't worry about
that at all.  
This was, for me, I thought a once‑in‑a‑lifetime experience. Hopefully one
time we'll be invited back by Coach Odom. But this was unbelievable for our
basketball program. These guys got treated so well just by everyone in this
tournament. Our guys really loved it. Hopefully they can enjoy a little bit of
today because we're not leaving until late tonight.  
Lot of fun. We really appreciate being invited. Hopefully we'll be invited
back at some point in the future.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what's coming up for you guys and how much
this week is going to help with that immediate future?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I think the biggest thing, when I got the job, I called
Brad Stevens, because they played in this last year. I said what advice would
you have travel‑wise, because you don't know what the right thing to do is. He
said get out of there as quickly as possible. He said get in early as
possible, and get out as quickly as possible, and I would probably schedule a
Division III team first game back. I said, well, we don't have that choice.
We're playing Florida State. So we're going to get out of here right away.
We'll get them off tomorrow, and we've got to get the rust out of them Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Get their body back to normal time zone, so that is
the biggest thing.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2013

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Kevin Pangos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23513)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Gonzaga  91  
Arkansas  81

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH FEW: Well, it was just a terrific job of executing the game plan by my
guys. And I'm really, really proud of them for how they competed, how they
fought, and how they stepped up against a very, you know athletic, relentless
team. You know, we really haven't played anybody like that in a while. With no
time to practice, we walked through some stuff on the tennis court this
morning. So for them to absorb what we're trying to do and the approach we
had, just a fabulous job by the guys.  
  
Q. Just talk about what you were trying to do offensively, because they
tried to get you to do some things you're probably not comfortable with. But
what did you hope to accomplish?  
COACH FEW: Yeah, again, they were going to make every catch difficult and make
every advancement of the basketball up the floor difficult, and in the half
court. They're going to make you be uncomfortable. For the most part I thought
for the entire game I don't know that we took a bad shot all game. We got the
ball where we wanted to at the right time and we had the right mentality when
we did have it, whether it was our bigs making strong moves or the guards were
very assertive, and they weren't trying to hit home runs and they'd take it to
the rim when it was there, or they set up a teammate when it wasn't.  
So I thought that was just a very impressive aspect that our guys were able
to, again, absorb and just basically overnight with no practice.  
  
Q. Then there was a stretch later in the half there where you had three
starters on the bench with two fouls and you bought a lot of time there?  
COACH FEW: We did, but we had some great efforts from some people who haven't
really gotten a whole lot of minutes. I mean, Luke Miekle came in and gave us
great minutes. Because, again, in this tournament we've been in some pretty
severe foul trouble in every game.  
You know, this was a different experience for us. I mean, to be kind of in
that breakfast bracket really challenges who you are and what you're all
about. You're still playing good teams and you've got to look deep inside
yourself. I like how our guys fought through it.  
Looking back on this tournament, we basically played pretty darn good except
for about a five or six‑minute stretch in that Dayton game where we couldn't
get a rebound, couldn't get a stop and just had a couple of turnovers. Other
than that we had a good stretch of the 120 minutes we played over here.  
  
Q. Coach, we kind of missed it yesterday, obviously shot lights out. You
shot really well again today. Coach Boeheim mentioned that a smaller gym may
be easier to shoot in. Coach Montgomery mentioned some soft rims, but it seems
there are some really good shooters here, especially in the last couple days
for you guys?  
COACH FEW: Well, we've been shooting it like that all year. When we came in
for practice, I was disappointed. Those are the softest rims I've ever seen in
a Division I game. So to me that's kind of the great equalizer. These guys can
shoot on outdoor courts with the mushroom shaped deal, and the rim ratcheted
down so it doesn't even move. So I prefer that when you've got a team like
this. These rims have made‑‑ hell, I think I could shoot 50% from three on
these rims.  
Thinking about it, one of the assistants said, hey, you want to get more
scoring in the game, just loosen the rims all over the place. But I think
that's a big thing.  
Again, we've shot the ball well for seven games now, and that's kind of what
these guys do.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about the shooting conditions in the gym and the
rim?  
KEVIN PANGOS: Yeah, at first I felt like the shots were just falling. You hit
the front rim and it just absorbs it as he says, and we've been shooting like
this all year. But as a shooter, you feel more confident putting up knowing
there is that extra bit of chance it's going to roll in or get a good bounce,
even floaters and that sort of thing up close, you know, touch helps with so
many different shots. Every team is the same way, they use the same rims, so
who knows who has the advantage.  
  
Q. Coach, at the beginning of the tournament you talked about how a lot of
these teams were tournament teams. After playing Arkansas today, do you feel
they'll be a tournament team?  
COACH FEW: I do. I feel like the physical entity that they have around the rim
is something that's very impressive. The way Bell shoots the ball, and as
Portis gets more and more experience. He was finishing everything around the
hoop today. I just the depth they have. I thought we did a nice job on Harris,
and he ended up shooting 17. I thought they shot the ball better. Qualls
continues to make shots out there. They've got a nice looking team. So I
really do.  
I told Archie, I think Dayton's the guy really good team. Watching Cal, I
think Mike's doing an awesome job with his crew, and Syracuse is who they are,
and Baylor has those big long guys. There are a lot of tournament teams
lurking around over here.  
  
Q. You had 11 turnovers, which is probably acceptable with what you faced
and a ton of different guys brought the ball up. How nice was that to have?  
COACH FEW: Yeah, again, we talked about this a little bit or maybe not, maybe
on the radio show or something. I've got guys that played point guard in high
school or college, with Kevin, Gary, Stocks and Dranginis. That's quite a
luxury to have against a pressing team like this. I don't know. We might have
had one or two turnovers or maybe three that were press oriented or pressure
oriented. Then we just kind of had the usual post‑up fouls or
away‑from‑the‑ball fouls or kind of bone head turnovers.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your immediate future and where you go from
here? How much this week will help with that immediate future?  
COACH FEW: Well, our immediate future, a great day for me, is we're going to
the beach tomorrow all day and hanging out and playing with our families and
diving off Black Rock and hopefully getting a couple hours of surfing in. Then
we'll have an awesome Thanksgiving dinner with just the players and families
where we can really share and talk about what we're thankful for. I don't know
what the heck happened with us. We usually are pretty leery of playing a game
after this and wait until Tuesday. But we have a game on Sunday. So we have to
hustle back, put this away and get back to winning games.  
We need to buckle down. Our defense needs to be better and our rebounding
needs to be better. Our offense is probably as good as anybody in the country
right now the way we're clicking. But we've got to get back to being tougher
and nastier which all of our teams have been in the past.  
  
Q. Coach, impressive show from your fans as well. Can you just talk about
having that support and the loud gym?  
COACH FEW: Yeah, that's just how‑‑ I mean, Zag Nation travels. If you watch
our conference tournament, pretty much the whole arena in Vegas is filled up
with them. If you watch us in New York City or on the road in the NCAA
Tournament, we have a big following. They absolutely just love coming over
here just like I do. They're always asking me when is Maui, when is Maui? And
you have to explain to them you can only come every four years. They think we
can do it every year. But we travel great, and I appreciate all they go
through to make it here.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, I wanted to give you an opportunity, you've made some
nice comments about being here in Maui and participating in the tournament.
But if you could make some closing comments about the experience for your team
and your program being here this year?  
COACH FEW: Well, yeah. It's been great. The fact that we've learned a lot,
even though I have a lot of returning guys back, we're having to play a
different way because we lost some key guys to the draft and to the NBA. So
we've been pushed three different ways, had to, whether it was playing in a
breakfast bracket game or playing against a press or playing against a really
good Dayton team.  
So I think that's been good. The other thing that gets lost in this, your team
really comes together over here. It's not a cliché. It's real, you know?
They're hanging out. They're doing things on the floor. This is our first road
trip of the year. So you really begin to get some camaraderie. You go through
some adversity, and you've got to learn how to power through that and then you
can't knock the cultural thing. There is probably a large percentage of my
team will never be back to the islands. So to experience this is something
special.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2013

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Cory Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25305)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Syracuse  74  
Baylor  67

  
COACH DREW: Obviously, there's not much time to work on anything. But I'm
pleased with our players, how they battled pleased with the leadership of Cory
and Brady and Gary. I was pleased with the rebounding tonight for the most
part. He either got his turnovers or points off turnovers with 24 to 8, and
that is an area hopefully we can work on and improve. Syracuse is a great
team; Coach Boeheim does a great job, think C.J. Fair down the stretch was
really big.  
I know the toughest thing is not having enough time to really prep and come up
and prepare with things that I wish I had prepared better on the offensive end
for the zone but down the stretch, you've got to give them credit. C.J. made
the jumpers. He's a good player. As a coach, you can lose to guys and improve.
Syracuse is a great team. Coach Boeheim does a great job.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to congratulate you guys and your team on such a great run
in this tournament. You've proven that you're one of the best teams in the
nation. But for the players, you guys, how do you feel you can build on this
experience? You lost a very good Syracuse team, but you beat some very good
teams throughout this tournament as well. How do you feel you can build on
this experience?  
CORY JEFFERSON: There's always room for improvement. Win or lose, no matter
what happens, we just need to go back and watch film of the game over this
whole tournament, and the things that we did wrong, go back and improve them.
I think one of the greatest things about this team is we adjust pretty well.  
COACH DREW: Thank you guys for a great tournament.

## November 27, 2013

  

### [Justin Cobbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25039)

### [David Kravish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26111)

### [Mike Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13959)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Dayton  82  
California  64

  
THE MODERATOR: From California, we've got Justin Cobbs and David Kravish. For
either player, do you want to give your thoughts on the game?  
DAVID KRAVISH: We came out and they were just busting our butts from the
git‑go. They were playing way harder than us from the beginning. I think we
recognized that toward the end of the first half and we started playing harder
and got it marginally closer, but in the second half they kept the tempo up
and they were beating us up and down the floor. Getting easy lay‑ups, our he
rotations were bad on defense. That's all on us. We had some tactical error
that's we were making consistently on both sides of the ball. You've got to
credit them because they took advantage of everything we gave them, and they
were playing really hard. It's a great team.  
THE MODERATOR: Justin, you want to give your thoughts on the game?  
JUSTIN COBBS: Oh, no, I think David got it.  
  
Q. Justin, the rest of your team was struggling offensively. So at the
beginning of the second half, did you want to take it upon yourself to lead
the team back?  
JUSTIN COBBS: Just wanted to win. That's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks on the game?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, hat's off to Dayton. That's a good basketball team.
They were obviously very well prepared. They were fired up. I think they were
probably a little bit upset with yesterday and losing and giving up a lead.
They were the better team today and clearly the more aggressive team.  
We just had problems in a lot of areas. We haven't played against a man team
yet, oddly enough, in the six games that we've played. So‑‑ it's seven games,
I guess. We've seen so many zones. I think it was just a learning experience.  
Dayton does a great job in their man defense. They were very well‑prepared.
So, you know, tough Midwestern kids. Had a chip on their shoulder, came out,
knocked us back, took us a while to respond. Had Justin not come up big, we'd
have been in really big trouble. They were finishing around the basket. Way
more physical on the glass. We were picking the ball up eight feet from the
basket, and instead of taking it to the basket and going strong, I don't know
how many times we went in there and missed balls at the basket. Fell down, and
they got numbers running back at us. So that was a very good Dayton team, and
hat's off. They beat us and deserve to win.  
  
Q. Did you give Cobbs the green light to try to light a spark for your
team?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: He was the only guy that could do anything, so I felt like
Dayton probably either whether it was because they were up on their toes and
aggressive and fired up was probably quicker than we were across the board at
every position. We couldn't get anywhere as far as getting open or getting by
anybody. So Justin's the one guy athletically that could and figured that out.
So he ended up being the only guy that could score the ball. At some point if
you look at it, they outscored us 52‑8 off the bench. I'd just as soon they
left their starters in to be honest with you. They killed us off the bench.
They had 15 fast breakpoints; we had zero. You cannot win a basketball game if
you don't run a break and get some things off the break. Problem was we
couldn't rebound the ball cleanly so we couldn't get out and run.  
So those are two very glaring statistics that show up in there. But, yeah, for
Justin to have to take 20 shots, I thought David Kravish had a good
tournament. I think he probably wore down. We typically had two big guys in
and with losing Richard and David was the sole guy inside. David plays much
better off of Richard as a four man. But he hung in there and did a pretty
good job.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, do you want to give some final thoughts on the Maui
experience?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, I will probably go out and see the water for the first
time now. So I guess I'll know more later. It's a tournament. Tournament has
changed over the years. It's gotten bigger. It's obviously a venue that's
gotten really good teams and has hospitality that's been great. They pretty
much covered all the bases. So it's a great tournament to come do. You've got
to be careful at this thing. You can get spanked in this thing and go away a
little disappointed. I think beating Arkansas was huge for us in that first
round game because we just needed that. So that was a quality win.  
Thought we played tough today, but just didn't have it, ran out of gas. It's
been a great tournament, and I think it will continue to be. Every team wants
to come and be a part of this thing.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Trevor Cooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26112)

### [C.J. Fair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23639)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Syracuse  74  
Baylor  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Boeheim, C.J. Fair, Trevor Cooney in for postgame
press conference. Coach, you can open up with some comments.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought the difference is we finally got our defense going
after they made those first four threes, we got our defense going. We were
much better with the shooters. They really shoot the ball well from the
perimeter, and we did a much better job against that.  
But, you know, the key was offense. Our offense has been really good here.
C.J. got us off to a great start, and then Jerami had a great stretch, and
then the last four plays, and the new play we put in for this tournament, I
guess we'll keep it in there. It worked pretty good.  
C.J. got some good looks, and we had to keep scoring. They were making a run,
and they're really a good rebounding team. We were spread out to watch their
three‑point shooters, can they were getting in the lane. We forced them to
miss, but they tipped them in.  
So they're a good team. A really good team. I think this was a great
tournament for us, particularly our young guards. I think it was very helpful
for them, and figuring out, you know, how to make plays three nights in a row.
So this was a really good tournament for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Syracuse has a 9‑0 record at the EA Sports Maui Invitational
now, having won championships in 1991, '98 and now 2013. C.J. Fair was the
tournament MVP with 24 points in the final game. We'll open it up for
questions for Coach and players.  
  
Q. C.J., you played all but four minutes of your team's total minutes
played. So how do you feel now?  
C.J. FAIR: I'm still in the moment. So I'm good. Tomorrow at practice it's
going to really hit me.  
  
Q. Coach, is there a secret to doing well here, as Palmer said, 9 ‑0?   
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, we just played well here. We beat Indiana in the finals
first two times, really good Indiana teams, and we beat a really good Baylor
team. This was a struggle for us. In Minnesota we were two points up with, I
think, less than two or three minutes to go and the game was in the balance.  
C.J. made a runner in the lane that really got us the win. Then Cal was really
difficult and we shot made crazy shots, really difficult shots and got the
lead. And our defense was better tonight. But normally it's our defense, but
it's hard in this gym. People are going to score here. You're not going to
score here. We did as good a job as we can reasonably expect to do against
their offense.  
  
Q. C.J., how do you feel you matched the intensity level that Baylor brought
into tonight's game?  
C.J. FAIR: I mean, we knew coming into this game they were going to be a
physical team and they like to pedal the backboards. The main thing we just
had to compete with them, and when we did get the ball, we had to push it for
the fast break because they sent a lot of guys to the boards.  
  
Q. Coach, would you like to bring another of your teams out here again in
the future?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've retired from Maui; that's what I will tell you. I'm very
happy to go into the sunset. The next time I come to Maui, I'll have my golf
clubs. I did not have this time. But I'm going to go outside tomorrow morning
on the beach for the first time.  
  
Q. C.J., you hit a lot of big buckets down the stretch. So did you just want
the ball basically in crunch time?  
C.J. FAIR: I mean, yeah. I knew that the team was looking upon me to make
plays, and once I seen a couple of my jumpers go in, that kind of gave me
confidence and teammates confidence to keep getting me open and finding me,
and it was a team effort from there. And coach kept running the play, and we
were doing basically one play the last ten minutes, but we had different
options off of it. And I think all the options kind of worked.  
  
Q. Trevor, Coach said this tournament was good for you and Tyler. In what
ways do you think this tournament helped you two?  
TREVOR COONEY: Being young guards that we are playing against three really
good teams and three different teams, every night was different for us. Every
team was different, and all three were great challenges for us. And I thought
we stepped it up every night and brought it. I thought that was great for us.  
  
Q. Trevor, how do you feel you transitioned from each game providing points
for Syracuse?  
TREVOR COONEY: I just kept moving on offense. When I'm moving, I feel like our
offense is moving. If guys are going to take me away, take my shot away, it's
going to get a lot easier for my teammates, and that's what I've got to keep
doing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Boeheim, maybe you can make a few closing comments about
the trip to Maui?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, it's a great trip, obviously. Unfortunately, right now
I'm thinking about Indiana; I'm not thinking about this anymore. So I really
can't‑‑ I never enjoy these things for very long. But we wanted to get into a
tournament this year, and we do every year. We want to play in a tournament
that's going to test us. And usually you get an easy game in a tournament; we
had four ridiculously difficult games, and the most difficult one was the
first one before we even got to Maui. We barely escaped with that first game.
Every game here has been difficult.  
I think, again, that's good for our team. I think we've grown a lot, we've
learned a lot, and we've seen a lot of things that we can improve on. But it's
been a great trip and certainly it's a beautiful place. I'll try to enjoy it
tomorrow morning before we go home.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2013

  

### [Lee Bailey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22850)

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Frankie Eteuati](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26126)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Minnesota  83  
Chaminade  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bovaird, an opening comment?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, like the Baylor game, we had about 30, 32, 33 minutes of
really good basketball. We had a stretch there between media timeouts that I
don't think we scored, and we had a substantial lead going into that and ended
up tying it up and going ahead through that stretch. One bad stretch really
killed us, one bad four‑minute stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, were they doing anything particular to you guys over that stretch
changing their pressure at all or encouraging bad shots?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Without a doubt they turned up the pressure. We had trouble
getting into our set plays that we wanted to run. I mean, they were really
getting after it. They had a couple of guys that were really good defenders.
20 turnovers for us is just way, way too much. We had six assists, 20
turnovers, and we're a much better team, ball handling team than that.  
  
Q. Do you feel Christophe is trying to do too much on his own?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Maybe a few times. Sometimes he drove in there. He knows when
he makes those mistakes too. He always says that was my bad. Yeah, he was
probably trying to do a little bit too much. He took a few shots I haven't
seen anybody make since Reggie Miller that we'll work on them. We'll get them
back on track.  
  
Q. At one point you guys were up nine in the second half against a Big Ten
team. Talk about the confidence you guys had and feeling like you were going
to pull off the upset?  
LEE BAILEY: Well, yeah, when you start getting up, you can kind of see them
getting a little rattled at the time too. So obviously the upset was in the
back of our mind, but I know at least for myself, I know just because this is
my third Maui now that being up at any point in time doesn't mean you're
guaranteed the ups.  
It almost makes it harder because the teams, and the coaches are all in their
ear. They don't want that on their plate and everything like that. But I mean,
we definitely thought we had a chance just from the way we were playing and
the things they were doing, just like Coach said, a couple minutes really hurt
us there.  
THE MODERATOR: Frankie, you can comment, if you'd like.  
FRANKIE ETEUATI: I was also going to say it's a lot more stressful when you do
have that lead because you have to continue to play to win rather than play
not to lose. And you know the other team doesn't want to be upset, so it does
add extra pressure.  
  
Q. Can you talk about where you guys go from here and how much is this week
going to help with that?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, our ultimate goal is to win the Division II National
Championship. Fortunately for us we have this magnificent tournament that
these teams have the ability to expose a lot of weaknesses, so we'll get back.
We'll take tomorrow off, but we'll get back very soon and analyze all three
games. It's going to make us a much better team. Our conference run starts
next Monday. So we need to prepare and begin our journey on that.  
  
Q. Lee, you have to go against their ball pressure pretty much the whole
time you were in there. What was that like kind of just trying to break that
consistently?  
LEE BAILEY: Yeah, I mean, it's tough. It's just like having little gnats
around you all day. Even if they're not stealing the ball the whole time, it's
something you have to always be conscious of. I think their pressure is
definitely going to cause a lot of Big Ten teams try to run a lot of set plays
and things like that.  
I think their ball pressure will definitely make it more difficult for teams
to get into their setoff ends and run the plays like they practice, because
you can't mimic that ball pressure. They have almost four to five guys that
could play in 94 feet, tough defense the whole time and really not get beat
all the way to the basket.  
Yeah, it was tough. I think it wore us down a little bit at the end of the
game. Definitely hurried us up a little bit. It's tough. I think their ball
pressure will definitely help them in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Frankie, in a lot of ways this is your coming out game. I know it's been
a while since you've been on the court. Talk about what kind of started this
fire?  
FRANKIE ETEUATI: It was nice to be on the floor on a big stage. It's been a
while since Cal State Northridge, and I haven't been playing up to my
capabilities, so I'm gradually easing my way back into it. I just try to
rebound as much as possible and keep my man off the boards and take the
occasional shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, maybe you could do a closing comment about the
tournament overall and being in Maui. I know it's a much shorter trip for your
team than some of the others coming from the main land, but overall
perspective on what this means to your program and your school?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, it's an incredible experience for these guys. Most of us
grew up watching this tournament and to have a chance to be here and be a
major part of it is something special and something they'll cherish the rest
of their lives. It's incredible, everything for us. As far as recruitment to
helping the school out in all different kinds of ways, and it's what
Chaminade's really known for across at least the basketball world. It's an
unbelievable experience, well‑run, just a lot of fun.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2013

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Bobby Portis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26122)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Gonzaga  91  
Arkansas  81

  
COACH ANDERSON: Firstly, congratulations to Mark Few and his team. They did an
outstanding job of coming out and just put on display of shooting the
basketball. You have to take your hats off to Pangos. This guy played 39
minutes, man, and it seemed like he played perfect basketball. You shoot the
basketball, and they did a good job of finding him, and he did a good job of
getting to the basket.  
But I won't take anything away from our guys. I thought they gave great
effort. But it goes to show we don't shoot the ball well. We're 4 for 20, 1
from the three‑point line, and they played the zone. They played against the
zone. The thing about it, we've executed so well against zone, but maybe the
games, three games in three days may have caught up with us, I don't know. But
hat's off to them. Our guys refused to quit. And that to me, we'll use that as
something we can build on.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about both of your young big men. They both had a solid
tournament. Talk about how they can use this to build on?  
COACH ANDERSON: That's what we said, we'll build on this experience for the
whole basketball team, but more so for them and the nation. We'll got a chance
to see that we had some young, talented young players.  
Bobby, fought each and every game, he got better. He got better, it was really
on display today. How about Moses? Last night you thought he played well.
Well, he built on that even more so in our game against a very good basketball
team in Gonzaga. So he shows no fear. With that, you can work with that. We'll
get better from this tournament. We'll other use this experience, not only for
him, but for all of our players, including a guy like Alandise. This is three
games against three darn good competition, good competition. Teams that you'll
probably see in the NCAA.  
So that tells me we're not that far off. We'll go back, work, and get better.
We got exposed on some things and we'll work on it. But it's nice to see some
guys with some size that can play the way we want to play.  
  
Q. Before tipoff I saw Coach go up to you and say something along the lines
of, get tough or something like that. What's it mean to you for your coach to
have that much belief in your ability and trying to pump you up before the
game today?  
BOBBY PORTIS: Coach always tells me to be aggressive on offense and defense.
So I tried to go out there and play as hard as I could from both ends of the
floor.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the season you talked about finding your core guys.
Do you feel like after this tournament in Maui you've found those core guys
that you can go with?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think we're horning in on some guys. You saw some guys out
there probably a little longer period of time that we went with. So to use
these games, we'll go back, my staff and I and sit down and evaluate and see
what these guys have done in each and every game. How they perform. That will
be a great indicator of who those guys are going to be.  
But that's not to say that the other guys won't be called upon. Just like a
guy like Moses. He's sitting there just waiting his turn, and all of a sudden
an opportunity presents itself, and now he puts himself in a great, great
position. I knew we were going to need him, and I'm just happy to see him come
on a lot faster than most people thought he would.  
  
Q. When you see a team that goes 80% from the three ‑point line in the
second half, how do you keep the spirits going? They just seem like they can't
miss a shot?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought they made runs. We made runs. That means we have to
take it to another level defensively. I thought there were a couple times
where Pangos did a good job of running off some screens. We had a chance to
possibly switch to stop that. Good teams make adjustments. I think we'll learn
how to make those adjustments. But they're on fire. It's amazing. Even Dower
there in the second half, any shot they had open, they made it. But now you've
got to contest those shots, move those guys off the mark. Not only that, as
you move them off the mark, I didn't think we did a good job of protecting the
rim. I thought that's why you probably saw those shots. In the first half they
were attacking, missing lay‑ups, and in the second half they stepped out and
made the three. We didn't make one in the second half, and they made like six
or seven or something like that. Hat's off to them. They shot the ball well.
We didn't shoot it well. End of the ballgame.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Anderson, would you like to make a closing comment about
the trip here to Maui and the impact on your program and your team that this
trip has made?  
COACH ANDERSON: I tell you what, it's been a while since we've been here. I
think it was in '91 that we came. It's been a great experience. I was telling
Dave, one thing about our fans, man, they're loyal. They travel. They're
looking forward to coming to different places, and they showed up. I'm sure
everybody got a chance to hear the hog call. That's like the National Anthem
there in Arkansas.  
But it was a great experience for me and our guys. I tell you, the hospitality
from where we're staying at to all the way around, the people here at the
Lahaina Center, wherever we went to eat in restaurants, you name it. It was
warm. Arms were opened up to us. It's one we look forward to coming back. It
was a great experience. We didn't come out like we wanted to in terms of
champions, but I think we did get better as a basketball team. We had them for
this period here, and that's what you want as a coach. We had an opportunity
where they don't have any distractions and now they just came to hopefully get
better as a basketball team.  
Thanks to the people on the island and go Hogs.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Devin Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26117)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Baylor  67  
Dayton  66

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, go ahead and make an opening comment.  
COACH MILLER: Okay, obviously heck of a game. We knew we had our hands full. I
thought our guys really battled. For the most part we really did what we
wanted to do, you know, with the game plan. Just disappointing probably about
the last eight minutes defensively. I thought we took our foot off the pedal.
We lost our ball pressure, we had simple breakdowns on blockouts and that's
the name of the game when you play against a team that's as good as Baylor.  
They've got great front lines, and they're very hard to score against in the
paint, some second shots, some timely threes with us not being totally locked
in in that back eight minutes defensively. Just kind of came to the end for us
tonight.  
I'm proud of our guys. We're playing against high‑level competition. I think
our guys right now are as good as anybody. To be in that championship game is
what we wanted. It didn't happen, and now obviously you've got to take the
good with the bad. You swallow it, be mature about it, get focused and ready
for the third game in three days, and I believe we play Cal. Once we get done
with tomorrow, third game against a quality team we play, we'll know a lot
about ourselves, and that's what it's about right now.  
  
Q. Did you think that tip in at the end was going in?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, I did. I was right there at the rim. I don't know how I
missed it.  
  
Q. Baylor took a couple of timeouts before that final play. Did you actually
go and change the play after they took the timeouts?  
COACH MILLER: No, we didn't change anything. We had our set ready to go. We
assumed a switched ball screen. We put the ball in Vee Sanford's hands, our
best guy, just in terms of getting his own shot. You know, I don't know if it
was perfect or not. I know Vee got to the block, and he got a rainbow which
he's capable of making. He's made it a hundred times. It is a good look, point
blank shot, got a second chance by D‑Mo's effort, and didn't go. I told those
guys, it doesn't have anything to do with the last play. There are so many
things that can happen in the course of a game that can impact winning. I
thought for 30 minutes in that game all guys looked about as good as any team
in college basketball looks on television against that type of environment.
For whatever reason back eight minutes, back six minutes, that intensity level
that you need against the best when they're trying to come back, we just gave
them too many opportunities to slice into us. I give them credit. They're a
good team now. They've got good players. They're a team right now that has a
chance to play for a championship in Maui, and I would think that they're
going to have a terrific, terrific season. They've got great talent inside.
Hard to score on and around the basket. Just looking at our stat line, we're a
team that really prides themselves on getting to the foul line. We were only
able to get to the foul line nine times in the entire game. Probably a lot to
do with their length. The other thing, they outrebounded us by ten. We're a
very good rebounding team. Today for whatever reason, we weren't able to ante
up on the backboard. At the end of the day, that was our doing. Our second
shot mounted in the back eight minutes.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Austin Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24981)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arkansas  87  
Minnesota  73

  
COACH PITINO: Tale of two halves, certainly, when it comes to the defense. Did
a good job the first half, did not do a good job in the second half, but
you've got to give Arkansas all the credit. They just beat us, especially in
the second half in every facet. They did a great job. We give them all the
credit.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like with the defense, especially in the second half,
was it more an issue of aggressiveness on your part, or was there something
that you guys were seeing in particular from Arkansas that was just really
tough to stop?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Plain and simple, they just out‑toughed us today. We fought
well in the first half and we came out in the second half and they punched us
first, and we tried to beat them to it, but we didn't play as hard as we
should have.  
  
Q. Austin, can you just talk about at what point did you feel like it got
away from you? Obviously you guys fought it until the very end, but there was
a point there where Arkansas made that run.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I mean, like he said, we started the second half, Andre said
they punched us first. They went on a run in the second half. We dug ourselves
in a hole and we were trying to dig out of that the second half.  
  
Q. Just talk about their defensive pressure, and since you guys are both
guards, talk about what it was like facing the pressure, especially in the
second half when they had the momentum going.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: You know, we just had a lot of careless turnovers. It's not
something that we're not used to. It's something we do every day because we're
a pressing team, as well. The pressure didn't really bother us as much. We had
a lot of careless turnovers.  
  
Q. For Coach, obviously the team's interior defense looked pretty good
yesterday, and now an extra body in there, but what did you see differently
from that crew?  
COACH PITINO: I thought yesterday I think people gained a little respect for
us yesterday with how hard we played. We were physical, we were tough, we were
scrappy, and I think we kind of set the tone for the way that we wanted to
play, and they basically‑‑ Arkansas beat us at our own game. They were
tougher. They were scrappier. They started the second half, and we talked
about it because we didn't start the second half for Syracuse very well, and
we talked in the locker room about not letting them get off to a good start. I
believe they started on a 10‑0 run. We were up five and then we were down five
right away.  
I didn't like the beginning and the middle of the second half, just our
intensity. I thought we just backed down from them. We didn't fight like we
did last night. And you're going to get beat, and I think that's the way it
goes.  
  
Q. With Mo, how long do you think that's going to take for him to shake that
rustiness off?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, we talked about Mo. You can't think you're going to come
in and be fresh. This time of year you're preparing so much, so he's not
really in on the preparation part of it. You know, so hopefully he gets some
more minutes tomorrow, and then by the time we get back we can really rely on
him.  
  
Q. For both of you, with one more game left before you hit the rest of the
non ‑conference season, what do you hope to‑‑ obviously a win, but what do you
hope to gain to have some momentum going into the Big Ten?   
AUSTIN HOLLINS: I mean, like you said, we want to win, so we've got to come
out and play better than we did today. We're trying to get better every game,
and we didn't play to our full potential today. Tomorrow we want to come out
with a lot more effort, a lot more heart.  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, like Austin said, got to come out, got to learn from
these two losses. We definitely don't want to go 0‑2 or 0‑3, so we have to
come out and play intense. We have to come out and play our brand of
basketball.  
  
Q. For Andre, the team shot really well as a whole in the first half and in
the second half that dropped quite a bit. Do you guys feel that's kind of a
product of defense really driving the team, and when your defense suffers you
see your offense suffer, as well?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Yeah, it was just we gave up too many easy baskets. They had a
lot of dunks, and they were just more aggressive than we were. That led to
them getting the momentum and getting their juices flowing on defense. It kind
of bothered us. We've just got our work to do.  
  
Q. Coach, did any Arkansas player jump off the page in your mind?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, a lot of them jumped off the page to be honest. They've
got perfect players for the way that they want to play. They play hard,
they're athletic, they're fast. So I thought top to bottom, they came in with
some guys off the bench, Kingsley with seven points and four rebounds in just
10 minutes, brought great value. They do a really good job of recruiting to
their system, and I think they have a really good team. They'll be a tough
team in the SEC.  
  
Q. Loose balls and deflections ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: I didn't get it, sorry.  
  
Q. And Maverick, is he available and healthy?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah.  
  
Q. For either of you, talk about playing with Malik. Seems like he's been
playing pretty well. At the same time to try to get the consistency from the
guards in general, how would you do that moving forward?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Malik brings great energy, that senior leadership, off the
bench. He played great this tournament. He's great to come in if I was having
a bad night, Austin is having a bad night, we always have that extra weapon.
He's doing a great job.  
  
Q. Seems like you guys really had turnovers under control at the beginning
of the season, and then the last couple games you've had quite a few again. Is
that just a matter of ‑‑ I don't know, what are your thoughts on that?   
AUSTIN HOLLINS: Well, I mean, a lot of them are unforced. I think it's just
being careless with the ball and not a matter of‑‑ there were a few turnovers
that we had due to the press, but I think a lot of it was just not being smart
with the ball.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Gerard Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26123)

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Kevin Pangos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23513)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Gonzaga  113  
Chaminade ‑ 81

  
COACH FEW: Well, today was about responding, and we needed to respond. We were
obviously very disappointed with how it turned out last night and the way we
played some aspects of the game, and in a situation like this you've got about
12 hours, so there's not a whole lot of Xing and Oing going, it's about kind
of looking inside yourself and stepping up against a team that can kind of
frustrate you with banging in threes and spreading you out, and for the most
part we did a really, really nice job.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your game plan against Christophe Varidel and what
you feel like you guys did successfully there?  
COACH FEW: Well, our guards did a great job understanding how good a player he
is and how much freedom he has. When you play against somebody that has that
amount of freedom, that's a really, really hard guard. He can pull up three at
any time over half court and use as many dribbles as he needs to and as many
screens.  
So I thought Kevin and Gary did a great job. They've done a real good job in
the past on guys like that and kind of tag teamed him and did a really nice
job.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit, is David struggling a little bit? He didn't
make a shot yesterday, didn't make his first shot until late today. Are you
guys concerned at all, or that just the way David plays?  
COACH FEW: You know, David's game is about‑‑ he's a phenomenal passer and a
great decision maker, and he's one of our tougher guys, and so it's not about
his scoring, it's about him making the right plays and giving us kind of a
tough, hard‑nosed, scrappy entity that kind of needs to be the face of the
program a little bit. That's what it's been through all these years.  
I mean, I'm not concerned. He kind of comes and goes on the shooting or the
scoring. The other night he didn't score great, but he had nine assists and no
turnovers, and those are the games we need out of him.  
  
Q. Mark, just some thoughts on Arkansas, what they present with that defense
and athleticism.  
COACH FEW: Yeah, again, they're off the charts athletic and long and we have
not done a great job thus far keeping guys off the glass, which is usually a
strength of ours. In less than 24 hours we're going to have to really solve
that and then we're going to have to be really strong and have a fortitude
about us mentally and physically to take care of the ball and to stay in
attack mode.  
But we do have basically three point guards out there and almost four when you
add Dranginis. That's a lot of good decision makers, but again, they just
bring something that we don't face. I don't even think we saw anything like it
last year. You know, I was just talking to Coach Montgomery and they had all
week to put in a bunch of press breaks. We don't have that luxury, so we'll
just kind of go with what we have.  
  
Q. Kevin, what was it like guarding Christophe? What was going through your
mind? Did you ever think of trying to expect what he was going to do? What was
your mindset?  
KEVIN PANGOS: Just try not to let him get it really because he can shoot the
three, catch and shoot, he can do stuff off the dribble. If I didn't let him
get anything, he couldn't do any of that stuff so that was kind of my
mentality. Coach just said to face guard him in certain situations and that's
what I was trying to do without fouling.  
  
Q. Same thing for Gerard and Kevin, Arkansas probably wants to speed you up.
How do you avoid falling into that trap?  
KEVIN PANGOS: Just taking shots in our turn, whether that's getting it to our
post players inside or not rushing things and taking care of the ball,
whatever that means. We know our game and we know each individual strength of
ours, so just do that and control the game that way.  
GERARD COLEMAN: Yeah, the big thing is to not panic against the press, take
your time, just make the right reads and just be smart pretty much, don't let
them speed you up in turnovers.  
  
Q. Kevin, do you want to maybe comment on the quick turnaround from last
night to today and you were shooting pretty well today, too.  
KEVIN PANGOS: Yeah, it's one of those things, even Coach said you can't get
down on two more wins, it's a long season, so our team just tried to respond
that way. Come out hard, it's a new day, and fix the things up we didn't do so
well the first game. I thought we did a pretty good job of that and were
pretty energized. Same thing tomorrow, quick turnaround. Even if the shot is
not falling you've got to find a different way to do things and play as a
team. It's not going to be one guy throughout the whole thing so we've got to
play as a unit.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Justin Cobbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25039)

### [David Kravish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26111)

### [Mike Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13959)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Syracuse  92  
California  81

  
JUSTIN COBBS: I'd just like to say I'm proud of my team. I like the way we
fought without our big guy, Richard Solomon. I think we played hard and gave
them everything we wanted. Just couldn't pull it out at the end. Felt like
they got a few calls on their side which helped the game. But all credit to
them. They played hard. I'm just proud of these guys and we'll bounce back
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach Boeheim said he feels that you guys are a much better team than the
one that played Syracuse last year. Would you agree with that? Can you expand
on that a little bit?  
DAVID KRAVISH: Yeah, I agree a hundred percent. We've got a fire and tenacity
in us this year. As opposed to last year where we were taking a couple games
for granted where we had a few in a row. I think we are ready and focused on
each individual game and where is this bringing in all of our energy and all
of our heart. It's really encouraging today because we had some freshmen who
plays who haven't normally played, so, when you're going up against No. 18 in
the country and you're playing some freshmen who haven't been playing, you
might expect them to really step up and play great. So it's super encouraging
and really looking forward to the rest of the season.  
  
Q. How tough was it today playing without Solomon?  
JUSTIN COBBS: First and foremost, I think without Richard, I think we had a
great chance to win this game. Like Dave said, I'm proud of these freshmen who
usually didn't get the opportunity to play. They came in and stepped up,
weren't afraid, and played with a lot of heart and confidence.  
Like I said, I'm proud of these guys. But, yeah it did hurt us. It got us
averaging the double‑double, and doing what he does and bringing the
intangibles that he does, without him on the floor, of course it's going to
affect our team. We did miss on the night but it doesn't give us an excuse to
why we lost this game, but, yeah, it did bother us that Richard wasn't on the
court.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, Justin and David did a fine job making some comments and
answering some questions. Wanted to hear from you, if you could make some
opening comments. Folks would like to ask you a couple questions.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, it's disappointing. I thought we played really, really
hard, really pleased with the effort. We had some lapses of things and I don't
think in that level of game you're going to be able to win if you have lapses.
They killed us on in‑line out of bounds, scored a whole bunch of points.
Cooney kept coming off the baseline, couldn't get out to him. We knew he was a
great shooter and that's obviously what he likes to do is come to his right
shoulder from left to right, and we kind of, we're there, but we have to drive
him off the lane. We played a man short.  
Initially we thought we've got to zone it, but came out and played man because
I didn't want to lose our aggressiveness. I wanted to stay aggressive, and the
kid did a great job. They hung in there and they battled right down to the end
getting David with two and Ricky with two in the first half obviously hurt us.
And we kind of came and pressed at the end, and maybe we would have had a
chance. I thought David's foul was critical in terms of having to steal 7
points to go to 5.  
But I'm proud of our guys. There are some things that I really like about this
group in terms of their fight. We just have to understand that you have to be
better than a team like this. You're not going to get even up and win. So
you're going to have to be better, and they played pretty well. We did a
decent job on Fair. He's quite an athlete. Their two guards really hurt us off
pick‑and‑rolls, and that was a little inexperience with our big guys in terms
of how to handle it. With one day prep, we probably weren't able to do the job
we needed to do.  
  
Q. There was a sequence in the second half where Cooney hit a three
‑pointer, then Ennis stole the ball off the inbounds and they got five points
in a very short time. How much did that take out of your team at that point?
  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, it was careless on our part to have the steal to start
with to make it a five‑point play. Cooney did a great job coming off those
baseline screens, as I say, coming left to right. Basically in the zone that
we were in, that's an area that should have been covered. You have one, if not
two people there. But he really gets a rhythm coming to his right. But then we
probably lost our focus momentarily, and just kind of turned and got careless
with the ball and he steals and gets‑‑ so it goes from 5 to 10, as one of the
coaches, I don't think I even saw it to be honest with you. The radio guys
felt like they gave them a basket they didn't get. I don't think our radio
guys saw it. So it happened pretty quick, so that was big.  
  
Q. Yesterday you spoke in detail about attacking their 2 ‑3 zone based off
the tournament in March. Now that the game is through, how do you feel you
guys did in that regard?   
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, we had 81 points, which is not bad. We shot 51% from
the floor. If you look statistically, obviously there were some things that
happened pretty well, 52% from the floor. We're missing too many free throws.
I thought we weren't very patient sometimes, but that's kind of something
we've got to get better at. We had some ideas of what we wanted to try to do.
It's a good zone. I mean, it takes away certain things. One of the things that
obviously hurt us is where they're vulnerable on the baseline, if you could
get it to the high post. Didn't think we did a great job of getting it to the
high post and going low. David got a couple shots inside. Ricky got one. But
that would have been an area that I thought we could have exploited had we
been a little bit bigger consistently which we weren't able to be without
Solomon.  
But, again, statistically, it looked pretty good. I think the problem was we
had some lapses just in terms of defense. I think as much as anything, the
in‑line out of bounds hurt us as much as anything. They probably scored 15
points on in‑line out of bounds in the zone. So that probably hurt us as much
as anything.  
But, again, the statistics say we did a good job. The numbers say we didn't do
a good job defensively, but I thought we did for most of the game.  
  
Q. There was a play in the game where Jerami Grant had a really big tip slam
and the crowd went crazy and Syracuse fans went crazy. Do you remember that
play and did that shift momentum in the game at all?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: No, it's a dunk. Lot of people dunk in college basketball.
He's obviously a tremendous leaper, so made a great play. We didn't block off.
I think had they made the lay‑up below the rim, it would have counted the
same, but I wasn't too concerned about that.  
  
Q. Coach Boeheim talked about shooting in a small gym like this maybe
favorable. You guys were both over 51% in the game preceding Gonzaga with
69.7%. Do you agree shooting in a small gym is better?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: I don't know small. He plays in a real big one, so they're
probably used to that back drop. The rims are a little bit soft. I don't think
there is any question about that. When you're a kid and you played at the YMCA
the rims were typically soft, these rims are soft, so they'll hold a lot of
balls. They're not hard rims. In some places you go, they're really hard rims
and boy it really has to almost go straight in. Here the ball will keep the
ball in. I'm sure that's a factor. I don't think there is any question about
that. I don't know if it has anything to do with the size of the gym other
than maybe these kids grew up playing in gyms like this, so they're more
comfortable with it, but I think the rims being soft probably contributes.  
  
Q. Was Tyler Ennis more aggressive with the ball and looking for his own
shot than maybe you guys had expected?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Yeah, I think he's a really good player. As a freshman we
felt like maybe he was trying to defer a little bit to the veterans. I don't
think we did a great job of getting him squared and making him shoot over the
top of us. I thought we got a little lazy on the pick‑and‑rolls. Obviously we
had to stay attached to Cooney. When he got to the basket, I think sometimes
maybe the big guys were a little bit reluctant to come over. That's where
typically Richard Solomon is very good at coming over and maybe getting some
of those shots out of there. But I think our guys were a little bit reluctant.
One, David got in foul trouble, and Kam, not going to do that. So, yeah, he
was more aggressive and better, and obviously was a huge factor.  
We felt like their offensive rebounding, we felt like the guards, thought
maybe we could contain. When you look at it, there were 51 points between
their guards. That's probably not what they're normally used to. Fair, I
thought we did a decent job on him. Obviously, Christmas and Coleman, some of
those guys, didn't get as much done. So switch to the guards and they did a
heck of a job.  
  
Q. Tyrone Wallace and Justin Cobbs are two of your better players, and they
were going up against C.J. Fair and Tyler Ennis, two of Syracuse's better
players. Do you think those match ‑ups were key in this game on defense and
offense?   
COACH MONTGOMERY: They had 51, we had 27 if you just want to look at it
statistically, we didn't do a good enough job. We played man, and you have to
contain the ball, which is our objective on Ennis, and we didn't do that. For
us to win in a game like that, Justin has a really good game. He ended up with
decent numbers. He was 1 for 6 from three, and they shot the ball a little bit
better from three than we did. So there were key match‑ups across the board. I
thought Ricky did a really nice job on Fair, again, just battling. Fair is a
tough match‑up for a guy 6'6" because he's taller and can shoot over the top.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Kenny Chery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26125)

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Cory Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25305)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Baylor  67  
Dayton  66

  
COACH DREW: I think everyone that watched this game it was a great game to
watch. Typical Maui type game. I thought the atmosphere was tremendous and you
had two teams that really battled all the way to the end. Really proud of how
our team hung in there, and I think we led 1‑0, and finished leading by 1, and
everything else was chasing Dayton.  
Really credit them for how hard they competed and how well they executed and
played. They've got a really good team. Just proud of how we competed and
stayed in it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach and Kenny.  
  
Q. Doesn't get any easier tomorrow facing Syracuse, but this one had to show
you a little bit about this team's character.  
COACH DREW: No question. It's really hard to be down the entire game. I mean,
credit Dayton. They made plays, made shots, and some of it was tough because
scouting report, we wanted certain guys we played them for drives and they
knocked down shots. So credit them for making them. But some of those nights
it's real easy for you to panic, start pressing, taking bad shots on the
offensive end and letting an 8‑point deficit become a 15.  
Now that's really hard to come back from. We didn't do that. I thought we had
great leadership, great poise. I thought Kenny second half only one turnover.
Really handled the pressure well. Very pleased how he was able to mature and
stay in the fight. Again, just really pleased with our guys.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you just talk about the second half? You guys made that run at
the end of the first half to close 17 ‑5, I think. Then they came out and kind
of opened it up again to about 10. Can you just talk about the way the team
hung in there and pulled it out at the end?   
KENNY CHERY: Our game plan was as a team to stay together. We just wanted to
be tough. Our mental toughness was in question, so as a team, we just wanted
to stay together and be tough and try to pull one out and that's what we did
at the end of the game today.  
  
Q. Dayton was 11 for 20 from three?  
COACH DREW: Yeah, I saw all of them.  
  
Q. What can you do when a team is just draining those?  
COACH DREW: First you have to give them credit for making shots. We tried to
move up on them. Changed how we guarded some actions and guarded some things.
But really credit them. Devin Oliver was 1 for 9 coming into the game for 3.
He was 4 for 4 and looked like none of them hit the rim.  
Jordan's been on fire. We knew that coming in, probably should have taken away
one or two and made it a little more difficult for him. But, again, those are
great players making great plays.  
  
Q. Cory, can you just talk about the last putback? You're right there and
nobody's blocking you out and there is the ball.  
CORY JEFFERSON: Yeah, we do it in practice all the time. Go where you think
the ball's going to go. I shot one up and it looked like it was about to be a
little short, so I went to the other side of the goal, and it happened to be
short, I got it, and put it back in.  
  
Q. For either of you players, I saw you guys taking in the Syracuse game at
the end there before you guys came on. What kind of stood out to you about
them and what will be the challenge facing them?  
CORY JEFFERSON: We just know they're a great team. If you know anything about
college basketball, you know the name Syracuse. So we know that's going to be
a battle as soon as we step on the court. We'll have to rebound and do
everything else defensively.  
KENNY CHERY: The same thing. Syracuse is a great team. They're well‑coached,
so we know first thing we're going to do tomorrow is step on the court and be
aggressive. We can't let down, and it's going to be a great game for you guys
to watch.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Trevor Cooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26112)

### [C.J. Fair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23639)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Syracuse  92  
California  81

  
COACH BOEHEIM: First of all, we saw just a different team. I thought watching
Cal yesterday that their team this year is much better than last year's team.
I just think Bird is one of the better freshmen composure‑wise that I've seen.
And he gives them a really steady guy. It's just such a different team. I
thought they battled their tails off, and it took a long time for us to get a
solid run out of the offensive end. Those were unbelievable today. I didn't
even know how good until I looked at the stat sheet. I knew they were pretty
good, but they were better it was a really good battle. These two games out
here have been great games.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for both Coach and players.  
  
Q. There was a sequence when your team went on the run where Cooney hit a
three ‑pointer, and I think it was Ennis who stole the ball and hit a lay‑up.
Just talk about that and how your team was able to gain control after that
sequence?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, the first corner jumpshot he hit off the out of bounds
was really difficult. The second was harder, which is hard to believe. Then
those are tough shots. The guy was right in his face; Kreklow was right in his
face. You make those shots and there is no defense for those shots.  
Tyler made‑‑ it's a nice play to be able to get a basket on a play like that,
but we made a good run because we made those couple shots, and Jerami Grant
was really good, got on the boards and made a couple of really good plays.
Made his free throws.  
We played very, very well the second half is really the best we've played all
year by far offensively. Defensively I thought we really are struggling
defensively. Part of it is these courts, these smaller courts are great places
to shoot in for both teams. There's just going to be more points scored, I
think, in these kind of buildings. That's always been my experience that way.
But defensively we've got some work to do.  
  
Q. After a couple of games earlier in the season, you said you wanted Tyler
to be more aggressive and look for his own shots. Tonight it seemed that he
was really being more aggressive and getting in the lane.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, I guess he was. I guess he was. Well, their face guy in
Trevor, and they're playing C.J. really hard. One time we just spread it out,
and Tyler just went right before the half to try to get a 2 for 1. Just go to
the basket. And then playing these other guys so tight that there are lanes
there to get to the basket. They're just virtually face guarding Trevor. I
mean, he doesn't get many shots. The ones he gets, he's knocking down.  
  
Q. If calculations are right, I think you're 45 of 51 from the free ‑throw
line?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Oh, good. Let's not talk about it and maybe it will stay that
way.  
  
Q. You did have that session at practice ‑‑  
COACH BOEHEIM: No, that had nothing to do with it. We're going to make free
throws. We've got to let guys shoot the free throws. They called the three
best players and those guys are going to make free throws.  
  
Q. For both players, if you guys could talk about what coach mentioned about
shooting in a small gym like this, do you like it? Is it better?  
TREVOR COONEY: It's different. The deep back drop is totally different for us.
But the gym is warm. Your legs get going, and you can get into a good rhythm
here and that's what we've been doing.  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, I'd say the same thing as far as these favorite shooters. Not
saying they're favoring Trevor, but he's been on fire the last few games. So
just once you see the ball going to the rim a couple times, it gives you
confidence, and you get them in that shooter role ale times, and that can kind
of work in your favor.  
  
Q. For the players, could you talk about (Indiscernible) dunk and how that
felt for you guys?  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, I think Trevor shot it, and I was going for the rebound
opposite side, and I just see Jerami almost jump over my head. That was a big
play for us. It got us momentum and then we turned it up from there on
defense.  
TREVOR COONEY: Yeah, plays like that just kind of get you pumped up to go down
in defense and get that next step and keep it going momentum‑wise.  
  
Q. Trevor, I know you've only had a couple games with Tyler so far, but you
guys seemed to have a lot of chemistry in the back court passing back and
forth. Can you talk about that chemistry?  
TREVOR COONEY: He's a very talented point guard. His head's always up his eyes
are up, and he's going to come down and make the right play no matter what it
is. Whether it's a kickout or a lob to one of the big guys or just giving the
ball to C.J., that's what he's going to do, and that's what he's done the
whole year.  
  
Q. C.J. and Trevor, when the game started out really intense, really tight
score, is there a way you think about playing a game differently? Are you
going to try to go for a fast break and try to make that big play so you can
build up momentum for your team or would you rather stay back and try to get a
three and that will boost your team's momentum?  
C.J. FAIR: Early in the first half we were trading baskets a lot, and we
weren't really getting stops. We were good offensively, but going into the
half we knew we had to get some stops so we could win the game and pull it up
because Kyle, they were hot from the outside. They basically were doing
whatever they wanted and we were doing whatever we wanted opposite. So it was
coming down to who was going to stop who.  
  
Q. Your opponent was shorthanded inside today with a player out and another
player with foul trouble, so did your team really want to try to exploit
inside?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, our centers really exploited that.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Lee Bailey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22850)

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Gonzaga  113  
Chaminade ‑ 81

  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, I guess there's a reason why they're ranked No.11 in the
country, at least coming into this tournament. They've got some skilled
shooters, that's for sure. Man, it's tough to play against a team like that
because they can isolate you on the block with their big guys and then they
have four shooters standing out there. They can get the shot off quickly and
make them. They're a dangerous team.  
We usually don't play against teams that we have to double‑team, so we don't
work on that kind of stuff all the time. Usually our big guys can just handle
the other team's big guys. We've had two tough nights back to back with some
really good big guys.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your game today after Christophe had his game
yesterday, and then obviously not quite up to that standard today? How much
were you kind of feeling it today?  
LEE BAILEY: I mean, I came in and hit some early shots, so that always helps,
mentally just getting your first one, seeing the ball go through. We don't
really have anyone on our team who every night is just going to go off. So
today I hit a couple, Christophe wasn't obviously feeling it like yesterday,
which would have been amazing if he did.  
Yeah, I just saw opportunities, sometimes saw mismatches off the switches on
screens, so I was just trying to take advantage of that when it presented
itself.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Christophe today? Obviously a little bit for
difficult for him and what Gonzaga might have been doing to get him off the
ball?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, well, it's a combination of things. The poor kid is
suffering from some severe tendonitis right now, and he obviously, at least to
me, wasn't quite as quick in his movements and everything, and that plays a
factor. But Gonzaga played great defense. You know, they came out and denied
him the ball, and any time we set a ball screen for him they were really
trying to get the ball out of his hands as much as possible.  
We're going to see that through the year with these two guys. People are going
to give these two guys, Lee and Christophe, special attention, and we've got
to be able to capitalize in other areas.  
  
Q. Lee, Coach Few was talking about he's got two or three guys, Stockton,
Pangos, and I think No.0 who can basically be point guard guys. Did that make
it tough for you today?  
LEE BAILEY: Well, it was just a different look between Stockton and Coleman I
think is No.0, because Stockton from the jump I kind of thought I had a size
advantage over him so I thought I could get to the basket and Coleman is a
more lengthy, athletic player. So it's different looks, and you just have to
do different things. Changing the defender does make the game more difficult
because you can't get in the exact same rhythm.  
But yeah, I think their ability to be able to switch and be able to guard and
push the ball with different people will definitely be good for them
throughout the season.  
  
Q. Stockton, that's a pretty famous name. Were you thinking about that at
all today?  
LEE BAILEY: No, I wasn't thinking about that. It's kind of cool just to know,
but no, that didn't play a part in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on taking on Minnesota tomorrow?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, they're going to be a very angry team, I know that.
They're going to come and play really hard.  
They're good. Right before they came to the tournament they went to Georgia
Tech who's ranked and beat Georgia Tech on the road. They're a really good
team. It's going to be a challenge. We know it's going to be a challenge.
They'll come ready to play. I'm hoping we do, too.  
  
Q. Christophe early in the game had defenders rotating around him depending
on Gonzaga, they switched. How did you two as a coach and as a player game
plan around that, the multiple defenders switching around?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, we kind of knew that. We talked about it in pregame. We
knew good teams like that make adjustments, and we knew that they were going
to be double teaming, hedging a little bit harder, just trying to get the ball
out of his hands, denying as best as possible. There's going to be some things
we need to work on. He should be the best screener in the country. Nobody
wants to switch off of him and stuff like that. We've got to be able to use
him in different ways, also, and not just coming down trying to get a shot up.  
Our guys, we'll watch it on tape, but I know that our guys what we call
slipping and rolling to the hoop got to do a better job of opening up and
looking for the ball and taking advantage of two people on one here. That just
means somebody is open somewhere. We've got to be able to find them.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2013

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Alandise Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26121)

### [Bobby Portis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26122)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arkansas  87  
Minnesota  73

  
COACH ANDERSON: First of all, I thought it was a hard‑fought game. For a 9:00
a.m. game, it was two teams that really got after one another, played with a
lot of energy and it took two halves. The first half I thought we came out and
really competed with a toughness that I know that we have.  
We didn't play I thought in the second half against California. It was a
three, four point game at halftime, but I felt pretty good about our guys in
terms of where we were. We come out and‑‑ we're a team that plays with a game
of runs as well as Minnesota, and we had that 30 to‑‑ I think it was 30‑10 run
in the second half. That was huge.  
But we got off to a good start from an offensive standpoint. We had some guys
that didn't start out yesterday, and we inserted Alandise in the lineup and
he's our leading scorer, so it doesn't surprise me to see he's our leading
scorer in this particular game. But the one thing he brings is he brings a
level of toughness that can‑‑ I think really just kind of transcends into your
whole team.  
It was a good win for us, especially after a disappointment last night against
California. Short‑term memory, that's what we talk about. But I was proud of
our guys, the effort, and the way they finished off the game in fine fashion.  
  
Q. Alandise, can you talk about pressuring Minnesota's guards? Seems like
with Syracuse they were able to speed up the tempo to have success and today
they had trouble with that.  
ALANDISE HARRIS: We just tried to get after them, put a lot of pressure on
them and get it in the ball handlers' hands.  
  
Q. For both players, how tough is it to get up and play a basketball game at
9:00 a.m.? Local time, obviously, I know it's different than what you guys are
used to, but 9:00 a.m. game, especially after the disappointment Coach was
talking a little bit about last night against California.  
BOBBY PORTIS: It felt like an AAU game because in AAU basketball you get up
early and play two or three games in one day. I just feel like it's all
mental, it's all in your brain. You get to rest the night before, then you'll
be good in the morning.  
  
Q. When you open the second half with that first run, is that one of the
better stretches that you've played this season?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think so. I think we came out and we defended. I thought we
had the ball coming out, and we quit attacking the basket. I thought we
attacked the basket with purpose. Their zone to me really made us run our
offense to tell you the truth, and I thought we got better. We played against
the zone last night and even today we started attacking and getting to the
basket, and all of a sudden now our heads go up in terms of defending.  
But the key as Alandise alluded to was keeping the ball out of Matthew's
hands. He was a big part of what took place. But our guys scored, whether they
scored or got to the free throw line or get a field goal, enabled us to get on
our defense. And then our bench, a guy like Moses Kingsley who's been sitting
there, we talked about having toughness, having some men with some athletic
ability. He gave us that when he came out. He gave us one of those pops.  
Madden came up and gave us some big, big minutes. To me it was just a total
team effort, and when you talk about a team that plays on runs, you don't know
when it's going to come, and hopefully we have some more runs in store for us
like that when we're playing the right way.  
  
Q. Coach, are you surprised at all how well Moses played?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, he's just waiting his turn. He just got an opportunity to
go out and do what he do. He does it in practice each and every day. He's
going against these guys each and every day, and I just had to get smarter to
put him out there on the floor. Today was one of those days where I told him,
last night, we need you to go out and play and give us some quality minutes.
Again, to get these guys, to spell these guys for a little bit, that's the
thing about our team, you don't know who it's going to be. You look at the
scoring today, it was much more balanced today. We had four or five guys
almost in double figures. To me that's playing the fastest 40 minutes in
basketball. We had 19 assists. We created more turnovers for them and we
shouldn't have had as many as we had. We got to the free‑throw line. We
flipped the script in terms of they shot a high field goal percentage in the
first half, the second half, now we're doing it. But how are we doing it? We
have great ball movement, we have a lot of lay‑ups, we got some attacks to the
basket. It's a fun game when we're playing it that way.  
  
Q. Bobby and Alandise, how proud are you guys of the production of Moses
today? And just comment on how proud you are and also how much he's going to
mean to you leading into the rest of the season?  
BOBBY PORTIS: I think I was very proud of Moses because the first four games
Moses hadn't been in the game. Moses never complained about playing. He just
came in the game and tried to affect the game as much as he can, keep our
energy and effort.  
ALANDISE HARRIS: Yeah, I was proud of Moses, too. Like Coach said, he just
waited his turn and we all know the ability Moses got, just if he get in and
use it.  
  
Q. After watching Minnesota against Syracuse yesterday, were you guys
expecting a little more of a fight, especially maybe defensively?  
BOBBY PORTIS: When I watched the game, I seen that‑‑ I seen that Minnesota
runs like a 2‑2‑1 defense, so I thought like the whole game they would play a
2‑2‑1, but that didn't really affect us really.  
ALANDISE HARRIS: I was just watching the game just thinking we've got to
rebound and attack. We just can't keep passing the ball, we've got to attack
it.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is it that your two guards combined today to only
turn the ball over two times in 40 minutes?  
COACH ANDERSON: They did a good job of taking care of the ball against the
zone, more than that they made shots. We got some inside stuff going. Fred
actually was the guy that actually got us going. He made his first two shots,
then he hits a big three, goes 4 for 4. I think that's critical. That's
important. And hopefully it's something we can build on.  
I thought our guards really had an effect on wearing Minnesota guards down.
That's what took place, when you talk about the second half what took place,
they wore down. As they wore down, I thought we got much more energy, and I
think our bench really provided it. In the first half, if you look at the
bench points, it was drastically different, but at the end of the game, that's
what I always preach to our guys, it's a 40‑minute game, not a 20‑minute game.
Sometimes teams may have their fun in the first half, but if there's a half
you want to win, it's that second half. But I thought our pressure defense had
an effect disrupting what Minnesota wanted to do.  
  
Q. What did you learn about your team overall today?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I think they answered the call. I put a challenge in
front of them. I thought the toughness, especially going to the glass, loose
balls, and competing for 40 minutes. I thought we did that. The first game, I
attribute it to nerves. But not only that, you've got to remember now, we
scored 64 points off our bench yesterday, and so now look what took place now.
Now I think we've got the guys that have been in place for the games we've
already played. Hopefully it's a sign that we're maturing, we're growing, and
understanding what it means to be a team and to play as a team.  
  
Q. It seems like in the second half towards the end, you guys went on a
power run. You guys continued to use fast breaks and just run. Would you
comment on that?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, our defense, our pressure defense. We took what the
defense gave us. I thought our defense, we created some‑‑ we were in a
scramble mode. We were making them take rushed shots. We were getting the
loose balls. We were getting some steals, and we want to attack you on
defense, but we also want to attack you on offense.  
Minnesota was playing a zone press, too, and if they're going to press you,
you've got to make people pay for it. It's something we do every single day,
and we were fortunate today to come out on the right side.  
  
Q. Coach, first half, Malik Smith, 13 points. Did it take you by surprise a
little bit?  
COACH ANDERSON: Yeah, well, it didn't catch me by surprise. What caught me by
surprise was our guys not getting to him. He's a guy you've got to put on the
floor. My guys are laughing because I always say, almost don't get it done,
guys. So we were almost there. What he did, he almost torched us, but we did a
much better job in the second half of making him handle it and not necessarily
just spotting up.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Dayton  84  
Gonzaga  79

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Archie Miller, Devin Oliver, and Jordan Sibert
coming in. Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH MILLER: Well, obviously, a heck of a game. You know, Gonzaga's a
terrific team. We had a lot of respect coming in for them. You know, obviously
the game kind of swiftly changed in the second half early on. It's a credit to
some of these guys sitting right here, guys weren't panicked at halftime at
all.  
Very simple couple things that we talked about. Our guys were able to do that.
Once we started to make a few shots and get a little confidence, obviously, at
that point in time it was a 50‑50 game.  
At the end of the day, the way we rebounded the ball and made timely shots,
that's what college basketball is about. Players make plays. Just very, very
proud of our group. A very together group right now. Believing in one another
is something that we talked about. They're having an opportunity to do it on a
big stage, so hopefully they'll continue to keep believing in one another.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the difference between 10 for 31 in the first
half and 17 for 28 in the second half?  
COACH MILLER: We did miss some good shots in the first half, some open ones.
Maybe we were a little tight. There were some around the basket that didn't go
in that maybe led to some tightness. But just thought in general, our ball
movement and our confidence against their zone, our confidence just in general
of trusting one another. We didn't move the ball, we didn't execute.  
At the end of the day, I'm not sure we got great quality shots. Second half,
guys were ready to play the right way. Got off to a really hot start. And I
think from that point forward, we were the team that we wanted to be.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about your crowd support tonight and just how loud and
how vocal you found them supporting you guys?  
DEVIN OLIVER: It was amazing, man. You know, we had so many people out there
before we even played. We were told that we sold the most tickets out of all
the teams at the tournament. To have such a powerful fan base means a lot to
us as players. In such a smaller gym, it's like being at home. They stuck with
us even when we were down, so it was great to have them here.  
JORDAN SIBERT: Just to piggy back off what he said, it was a home game for us.
To feel the energy and whenever we made a run to feel the crowd behind us, it
was able to give us more energy to be able to go out there and play our game.
It was definitely great to have our crowd behind us.  
  
Q. That was a tough one to close out when you had that one ‑point lead and
it looked like things might shift the other way. How did that change? You guys
came up big at the foul line at the end?   
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Yeah, that's a big thing that I love about our team this
year. Even when it was really close, we stuck together as a team. I think
that's something we've been doing really well this year. We just knew in our
minds that we were going to win. We just had to stick together and execute
down the stretch. It was good to see guys like Dyshawn Pierre and Khari Price
hit those big free throws at the end. So it was good.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We've supported each other all year regardless what the
situation has been. Missed free throws and missed shots, we've looked at each
other and told them next play. Don't worry about it. We'll pick you up next
play. Even me missing my two free throws, Dyshawn looked at me and said don't
worry about it, you've got the next one. Just Khari came up big with his
free‑throws and we did it together.  
  
Q. Did you guys have any idea of the pictures of the faces of the gentlemen
behind your bench? They were holding up four different signs of four different
guys. I have no idea who those guys are. Do you have any idea who they are?  
COACH MILLER: That was our president, President Dan Curran, I did see that
one.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I didn't even see the faces.  
COACH MILLER: I saw President Curran. In general, when we play an event, a
pre‑season event, our fans take over the town. Doesn't matter if it's in Maui,
Orlando or in Charleston. Gonzaga is maybe one of the most passionate fan
bases you'll see. They had their work cut out for them in there tonight.  
As the games continue to go, they'll continue to be the most boisterous, most
positive fan base in the tournament. We have one of the best fan bases in the
nation.  
  
Q. I saw a great game in 2003 when you guys won the whole thing. I think
Dayton beat Arizona that year. This tournament is known for its great games.
What do you think? Do you think you can get to the finals?  
COACH MILLER: It's one step at a time. We'll figure it out here. Tonight we
have Baylor that presents a lot of challenges, obviously. Great size, great
talent. But these guys right here are pretty to compete regardless. We fight.
We have guys that play really, really hard. If we play together hopefully
we'll give ourselves a chance.  
But we've got to get those guys home. They've got to get off their feet and
you've got to take care of yourself here in this tournament. One player with a
cramp can cost you the game. Our staff does a great job. We'll be ready
tomorrow.  
  
Q. This definitely was a game of a tale of two halves here. I'm wondering,
Coach, specifically, what did you tell your group going into halftime? Did you
say something specific to motivate them? Because they came out playing
completely different. In the first half it seemed they were just hesitant?  
COACH MILLER: No, I thought we were pretty calm at halftime. I thought the
guys were all kind of chin up so to speak. They weren't down. To be honest
with you, we could have been down 16 or 17, and we got that thing under 9
which to me maybe changed the perspective at halftime a little bit. We had
ball coming out, and a couple quick directions, spacing, movement. Couple guys
willing to make a couple tough passes. Once we got off to a good start in that
first four‑minute segment in the second half, you could just tell at the
timeouts we were going to be in it for the long run.

## November 25, 2013

  

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Malik Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26113)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Syracuse  75  
Minnesota  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Richard Pitino and Andre Hollins and Malik Smith.
Coach Pitino, opening comments?  
COACH PITINO: Certainly a hard‑fought loss, but I'm very, very proud of our
team. I thought today and I told them this, when you're building a program and
you're at the early, early stages you want to show you're going to compete on
every single possession. Our guys did that tonight. Tough game to be
undermanned with Walker and Elliott in foul trouble. We just had to make it
work. When Mo gets back, that's going to be a big help for us.  
But very proud of these guys. They really fought hard and showed, I think,
that hopefully we're not going to be an easy out night in and night out.  
  
Q. Andre, or both of you guys really, how are you thinking generally pretty
satisfied with how you were able to attack the Syracuse zone tonight?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Yeah, going in we prepared well for it. You know, we had
Coach prepared us for it and we had some lapses where the games got stagnant,
and I think we handled that well. It just came to a few plays. We knew we had
that game. Like Coach said, we fought really hard. We played every possession
hard, satisfied with the effort. Just got to tighten up the little things.  
  
Q. Malik, can you talk a little bit about there is a certain point in the
game there where you had a steal lay ‑up and you got kind of excited. The
toughness factor of this team no matter what the circumstance? Can you talk
about that a little bit?   
MALIK SMITH: We just tried to compete night in and night out like Coach says.
Tried to work hard every day and tried to transfer that over to the games. We
were just trying to do anything possible to win.  
  
Q. Coming into the game, a lot of people counted you guys out and said you
were huge underdogs. At what point did you feel like, okay, we can hang with
this team? It seemed like at some point in the second half there, it was a two
‑point game late in the game you felt like you could pull it out.   
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Before the game even started we don't come in thinking we're
going to lose. Doesn't matter what others think. We're going to come in
extremely confident and it's a game. We come in and play. We prepared well,
and it was a good game.  
  
Q. For either of you guys again, just watching the big guys, Elliott and
Joey King especially battling against that front court, just effort that they
put forth. On your end, how did you guys appreciate that?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: It was tough. Those guys are big. The Syracuse bigs are
really big. It's hard to simulate their length in practice and we wouldn't
have been in the game without those guys. Elliott, Oto and those guys in there
banging, we wouldn't have been in there without them. So we really appreciate
their effort.  
  
Q. Joey King didn't play the last game. He had the jaw injury. Just talk
about his toughness out there? There was a point where he was on the floor
almost every other play, but he kept bouncing back up and playing hard.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Yeah, I think Joey King is the epitome of what this program
is about, his toughness, his fractured jaw, he came in and played his heart
out. Started out the game really well. Hit some big shots for us and competed.
That's what we're about. We're going to play hard every possession, and that's
the type of player he is.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2013

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Gary Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26115)

### [Cory Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25305)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Baylor  93  
Chaminade  77

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we have Coach Drew from Baylor along with Cory Jefferson
and Gary Franklin.  
COACH DREW: I was very pleased with our team in the second half. I thought
defensively we were much better holding them to 29%. First half I kept
thinking of that word Maui Magic because Christophe was definitely on fire and
Chaminade always has a good team. They always compete, they always do well and
got a great coach. Got to know him the last couple of days, and really like
him and respect him. I know we'll be pulling for him the rest of the year.  
Proud of how we battled back and played much better basketball second half,
liked our depth. Different people stepped up, and proud of the leadership of
the guys not to get rattled.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked about you'd have to guard Varidel. Has there ever been a
guy that scored 31 in the first half against you guys ever or in a long time?
Can you recall?  
COACH DREW: Well, I've been at Baylor 11 years, and I don't remember. Cory,
you've been five, Gary four, do you guys remember?  
CORY JEFFERSON: No, I don't think so.  
GARY FRANKLIN: No, I don't think so.  
COACH DREW: I think when we told the guys on the bench he had 31, we were like
we knew he had a lot, but that's crazy.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about getting different contributions with a lot of people?  
COACH DREW: I thought it started with our leadership, Cory, Gary, Brady, they
do a good job of putting the team first. I know Gary and Brady were really on
fire early on to allow us to stay in the game. I thought guys moved the ball
to get them open shots, and I thought we did a better job getting it inside
and getting them some easy ones.  
Cory, Rico, Isaiah, did defensively really helped the second half as well.  
  
Q. Did you do things or talk at halftime to the guys about strategically
doing something differently with Christophe Varidel? Did you talk to them
about maybe going inside more because, like you said, especially in the front
court in the second half you guys were more effective in?  
COACH DREW: Well in the first half we shot 61% and had 50 points. So all game
long we were trying to get easy ones, but every coach will take that offense.
I think we put different people on him. I think the big adjustment was we kept
mixing around guarding how we guarded ball screens until we got something that
worked. I think probably between Kenny, Brady, Gary, Royce, Ish guarding them,
I think they wore them down. I thought our bigs did a good job giving them
help in the second half as well. But I think that might have had a play into
it a little bit.  
  
Q. Cory and Gary, did you guys when you were practicing, did you figure out
or guess that Christophe and Lee and Kevin and these guys on Chaminade were
going to get buckets and continue to score? Did you guys plan for these guys
anyway differently than you would have any other game?  
GARY FRANKLIN: Absolutely. We saw on film that they shoot the ball really
well. We wanted to get out and contest every shot. We didn't expect at all as
many shots as he did. But we made the adjustments that we needed to to win.  
  
Q. Cory, are you going to let that answer stand?  
CORY JEFFERSON: Yeah, like Gary said, we watched film, and we knew the kind of
players that they were they were going to get shots up and we were ready for
that. Defensively I think we started out and we had to make some adjustments
throughout the game. I think we ended up doing pretty well with that. But like
Gary said, we didn't expect anybody to go for 40.  
  
Q. You have some really highly regarded inside players. Do you think your
guards may be a little overlooked perhaps on this team?  
COACH DREW: I think that's what makes you a good team is having balance. If a
team tries to focus on the interior guys, we've got unselfish guys and they
can definitely be more capable of knocking down shots and making plays. I
think our perimeter opens it up for inside guys as well and that's why they've
been able to be successful.  
Can't win unless you've got a good balance, and we feel good about our
balance.

## November 25, 2013

  

### [Sam Dower, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26116)

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Kevin Pangos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23513)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Dayton  84  
Gonzaga  79

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Few, an opening comment, please?  
COACH FEW: Hey, we knew we were going to be in a dog fight tonight after
watching tape on these guys, and we were. It's been a while. I can't remember
when, at least since I've been the head coach, we've given up 18 offensive
rebounds. That's something we take a lot of pride in. And they just handed it
to us on the glass.  
Those offensive rebounds led to a lot of those kickout threes and the extra
possessions that kind of stemmed the tide and put them out in front all the
way to the end. Off free throws, off tough shots and all of that. They just
kept getting extra possessions.  
  
Q. What did you feel was the difference? They shoot 10 for 31 in the first
half, and they're 17 for 28 in the second half.  
COACH FEW: I thought they got a lot of great looks again off offensive
rebounds. That's a great time to shoot a three. They had the right guys
stepping up and taking them. I think we did a good job of limiting the looks
from three. Sibert made one right there near the end of the half, and that was
the only three they had in the first half. We did a good job on price. In the
second half, they got back to attack and got in our gaps a little bit and we
had to help, and that leads to kickout threes. We were battling foul trouble
all night long, so we had some kind of strange lineups and scenarios out
there.  
But Dayton did a great job of just staying with the game, and staying with the
game and then took it to us physically there.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding and the foul trouble and how that
impacted things?  
SAM DOWER, JR.: Yeah, they definitely rebounded us tonight. We really focused
on that, but tonight they wanted to rebound us I guess. I got in foul trouble
early. And I was a little tentative on defense, and I got a few stupid fouls
early that got me into foul trouble.  
  
Q. Kevin, it seems like you were just really in a zone there down the
stretch. Were you aware of four fouls? Did you think about letting somebody
else take that foul near the end with 20 seconds or so to go?  
KEVIN PANGOS: Yeah, early on I knew I had four fouls and I just kind of
blanked there. I guess some of the coaches were telling me, and that was my
fault. I should have known and known the foul situation. I wasn't‑‑ if I knew
I wouldn't have gone for it, but I just kind of blanked, so...

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

California  85  
Arkansas  77

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any opening comments?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: I'm obviously pleased coming into this thing you look at the
field and your first thought process is, gosh, can we win one? Now we've got
that one, we feel pretty good.  
We started off the game and I thought we were nervous, frankly. We worked
pretty hard on handling pressure and we kind of got away from what we worked
on all week. Fortunately it didn't hurt us too much. They were probably
nervous too, but we hung in there and got some great contributions off the
bench, because Richard Solomon got in foul trouble early and had to get him
out.  
Ricky Kreklow, of course who played for Mike Anderson at Missouri, came in and
really played well, then he got two fouls. Had some freshmen kids come off the
bench and contribute. So once we settled down, and frankly, Arkansas as well,
once we both settled down, we got kind of in more of the flow of what we
anticipated the game being.  
They're quick. They've got a lot of guy that's can really shoot the ball. I
thought going back and forth zone‑man some helped us. When they got a rhythm
in zone, we kind of went man and tried to change the rhythm a little bit. Then
we came back to zone.  
But, boy, they can shoot it. Bell, Qualls, they can shoot the ball. As soon as
their big guy Portis gets a little experience and stronger inside, they've got
some guys that can play. But we've got a fairly veteran club. Obviously,
Justin as a senior now has the ability to run the club and do what we need him
to do demanding some of these young guys.  
Kravish had a great game. Kind of his type of game where based on the way they
were playing with quickness and getting out after it left David some lanes to
the basket, and as a result, he was able to have a really nice game.  
So we're pleased. We think Arkansas is a really good team. Mike Anderson is a
terrific coach, and I'm sure they're going to have a great year. So now we get
a chance to play in the semis. Maybe it will be the same style again certainly
we've prepared for that, or maybe it will be that zone which is the last loss
in the NCAA.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up questions for Justin or David.  
  
Q. Justin, at the end of the first half you had your shot blocked and I
guess you thought it was goaltending. Also, it looked like you were arguing
with the refs there for a second and there was an incident in the second half,
whether it was a jump ball and things got a little chippy. Do you think you
bring a fiery type of attitude to this team?  
JUSTIN COBBS: That's not really my intention to bring fire to the team. But
just like anybody else, I'm a competitor. I love this game, and I'm just going
out there trying to win. I just thought it was a foul. He blocked the shot,
made a great play on the ball so give credit to him. I was just asking the ref
if it was a foul or not. We exchanged words and we talked at halftime and
everything was fine, so that's water under the bridge.  
But the loose ball, that's like I said, everybody's being competitive. He had
the ball, I dove on the floor, got the ball, and he's just a basketball
player, so nothing more than that.  
  
Q. Justin, talk about Arkansas's pressure on defense. It seems like in the
first half you were a little rattled, but you settled down in the second half
to control the game?  
JUSTIN COBBS: Yeah, it was something we haven't seen all year. They did a
great job of running and jumping and making quick passes. So, yeah, it's a
little early on they made a few passes. Being loose with the ball, whereas a
point guard I talked to Coach and talked to the guys and just settled down and
made better plays. I'm happy we put up the win.  
  
Q. David, could you talk about stepping up and rebounding today especially
with Richard's foul trouble and what you had to do in there?  
DAVID KRAVISH: Yeah, Richard and I take it upon ourselves to really try to
control the glass and bring it. When he goes out of the game, I feel like I
really have to step it up. So when he was in foul trouble, I had to step up my
game and keep playing physical, keep playing hard and grabbing every rebound,
so that's what I did.  
  
Q. Justin, you had a leap pass to Solomon, a one ‑handed leap dunk. Did that
energize your team and give your team energy?   
JUSTIN COBBS: That's what Richard loves to do. Richard loves dunking and it
gets him going. So myself as a point guard, I know that's big for him. It gets
his energy going. And he starts grabbing every rebound. I know it started
turning things around. The bench got going, and the crowd got going. So I
think it did get a little energy.  
  
Q. Coach, if your opponent turns out to be Syracuse tomorrow, can you talk
about planning that 2 ‑3 zone in the tournament last year and what you guys
might try to do this time against them?   
COACH MONTGOMERY: Anything other than what we did last year would be a
starting point. Last year's zone that Syracuse played, because I played them
more than once, I thought it was the best zone that I've ever seen them play.
They had tremendous length on the perimeter and obviously the game plan, they
know what they want to do. We're going to have to attack it a little more
intelligently. We'll have to be more aggressive it seems. Our perimeter guys
will have to be more confident with the ball trying to drive the seams. There
are openings in it. We have to capitalize on those.  
But you have to be patient. You can't get frustrated. You can't turn it over
for run outs. We did that a little bit. We have not played against much zone
this year, so, frankly, we didn't prepare as if we were going to play Syracuse
specifically. We thought that would be‑‑ so we worked against pressure. So
we're not going to have a long time to prepare for it. That's where Syracuse
has an advantage. They don't have to prepare anything. They just play the
zone. It's a very good zone and it's obviously proven to be very successful
over the years. There are weaknesses. We know where they are. We've just got
to exploit those.  
  
Q. Justin, in the first half you called ‑‑ I believe it was the first half
when there was a scuffle for the jump call and you called timeout. When do you
know to make those quick decisions to call timeout there?   
JUSTIN COBBS: It's just a basketball play. They had the ball, and I wasn't
sure what the possession was there, so I called the timeout to make sure we
had the possession. But the possession arrow was our way.  
So in that case, you just let it go. But you see a guy dive on the floor and
another guy dive on the floor, call timeout and make sure you secure the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, you played a lot of zone in the first half. Did that have to do
with you trying to slow the game down or did it have to do with Arkansas and
their lack of shooting from previous games and previous seasons?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: No, it was more tempo. One of the things they'll do is take
it out of bounds to anybody and throw it to pretty much any of the five guys
and run at you. So trying to cover back in man where maybe the center has
leaped out early and the match‑up is such that he's gone and maybe a guard had
to pick him up. We just didn't feel that was in our best interest. We felt we
could recover it at spots in the zone and at least slow down the tempo a
little bit.  
They almost got to us when we were up 13. They tried the last ten minutes is
important to them where they think they can wear you down. They had a little
bit of a run. Fortunately I think Kreklow made a play or maybe Justin where we
got it back in double figures and it could have gotten dicey for us. The crowd
got energized a little bit. So we wanted to control tempo by recovering the
specific spots and making them take more time. We tried to play man late when
they were shooting the ball, but they blew right by us and took no time off
the clock. So we had to go back to zone to hope they at least took time off
the clock before they got a shot.

## November 25, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Trevor Cooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26112)

### [C.J. Fair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23639)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Syracuse  75  
Minnesota  67

  
COACH BOEHEIM: This was probably as good a win as we've first had in a
tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about (No Microphone)?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, they had a very tough defense. They pressured the guards,
and then they forced you into the bigs, and their bigs were playing solid,
strong, Big Ten basketball. We just had to fight through it. We had to adjust
how the refs were calling the game.  
  
Q. C.J., can you take us through that play where you got the blood on your
cheek?  
C.J. FAIR: I forgot who passed me the ball, but I cut down a lane and I went
up for the dunk, and I felt like I hit my face. Then as I came down I seen
blood on my hand, and then from there I knew it was something bad.  
  
Q. C.J. and Trevor, it seemed like the dunks, C.J. yours, and then Christmas
about three minutes later with about a minute to go in the first half, I think
it was Christmas. Talk about those two dunks and then about four minutes into
the second half the next big dunk. How much energy did that give you guys?  
C.J. FAIR: I mean he is efficiently getting dunks and threes; they're big
momentum shifts. And Trevor started off hitting consecutive threes, and then
me and Rakeen got a couple dunks to get the crowd into it, and I think we set
off the crowd from there.  
TREVOR COONEY: Yeah, when you get dunks like that, it just pumps you up on
defense and gets you motivation to get that next stop and keep going.  
  
Q. Can both of you just talk about Minnesota in general? I mean, coming into
this game a lot of people considered them huge underdogs.  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, yeah, they were definitely‑‑ people say they're the underdogs
towards us, but we knew coming into this game was going to be a tough game
because of the style of defense and the pressure. But I mean it was a good
test going forward. We can still keep getting better.  
TREVOR COONEY: Yeah, anyone that's going to push up on you for 40 minutes is
going to be a tough game. I thought that was a good challenge for us today,
and we responded well and beat the pressure, and we were able to get some easy
baskets that way.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your experience and just knowing
what's coming up in the next couple days here specifically?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, I think the danger is obviously when you get pressed for
40 minutes. It's a difficult bounceback. Many times you'll come to a
tournament it's a 50‑point game, 60‑point game, and it doesn't take a lot out
of you. This game is going to take a lot out of us, but we'll be ready. We'll
bounce back. Certainly the pace of the game, how difficult the game was is
something that you have to take into consideration. But we'll have to play a
couple other guys and look for some more minutes tomorrow. But that will be a
challenge.  
I thought Cal was‑‑ I watched a lot of that game, and I think they're much
better than they were last year, a much better team. I really was very
impressed with how they played. It will be a tremendous challenge for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about two players, Malik Smith, and then Joey King, both of
these guys maybe not on a lot of scouting reports. King didn't play the last
game.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, we didn't talk about King. We had talked about him before
and knew he was a good player. He had good numbers for them, and he hit a big
three today and made some steals. He's a really good player. I thought that we
knew Smith shot it every time he got it from wherever he was.  
So we wanted to get up on him. The last two he was a good ten feet behind the
line, and after that we just moved up further. I don't think he got another
look after that. But he has some kind of deep range. They can shoot the
basketball as well as anybody in terms of their whole team. You've got five
guys that can shoot threes and they can put the ball on the floor and get to
the basket as well.  
Again, I think Richard has done a tremendous job putting that system in in a
very short period of time, and they completely understand it and they handle
it, and they really are good at what they're doing. The key to the game, we're
fortunate. We tried to drive at the big guy. We wanted to get him in foul
trouble, and when he was out, we made a ten‑point run. He's a big difference
maker when he's not in there. When he came back in, we couldn't get to the
basket the couple times we had before.  
But that was a big key to the game really being able to get him in some foul
trouble there. He's a really good player, good passer, very good defensive
player. They've got a very, very good team. I'd be shocked if they don't have
a tremendous year in the Big Ten.

## November 25, 2013

  

### [Lee Bailey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22850)

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Christophe Varidel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26114)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Baylor  93  
Chaminade  77

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bovaird, some opening comments, please.  
COACH BOVAIRD: I thought we played really well for about 33 to 35 minutes of
the game. Obviously, you guys know there was a stretch in the second half
there where we couldn't buy a basket and that kind of put us in the hole. We
were able to battle back a little bit there towards the end, but that one bad
stretch, I don't know the exact minutes, but we had a hard time scoring. They
were advancing the lead.  
Proud of the guys. They played tough. You know, there's definitely 7'1", 6'10"
guys that are probably NBA players that were really tough to guard. And they
were the focus for us the whole past two weeks on how to stop them as much as
possible. Our game plan was to make them make outside shots, and besides
Heslip, we were trying to get everybody else to shoot the ball. Wouldn't you
know Franklin stepped up and made, I don't know, what did he make? Five or
six? That was a struggle for us.  
  
Q. Coach, we saw Christophe go back in. Did Dave Odom come over and tell you
about the scoring record?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, yeah. About the scoring, but also the three‑point record.
Christophe's a great kid. He's a great player. You know, this is a great
tournament, and you think about the history of the 30 years. For one of our
players to have a shot at a record like that, I wanted him to have a shot. As
soon as I‑‑ I didn't realize he was that close or any idea what the record is.
But as soon as I found out I looked at him to see if he wanted to go back in,
because he's had a little bit of issues with tendinitis, and as much rest as I
can give him‑‑ I didn't take him out until then. I wanted to try to give him a
little rest. But it's an honor for him to break a record like that.  
  
Q. Christophe, first I'd like to congratulate you on your honor. It's pretty
cool to amass that record. But how do you deal with Isaiah Austin and Royce
O'Neale? Two really big guys. How did you deal with those guys inside and
coming around and making shots?  
CHRISTOPHE VARIDEL: I made a lot of points, but unfortunately I didn't think I
got a lot of rebounds. I didn't know if I was down there too much today. We
tried to do our best as a team to contain them. But when they jumped, I think
their head was above the rim, so it was pretty hard.  
I think really what messed us up is the amount of free throws they had. Not
only the big guys, but even the guards. So I don't think it's only a matter of
the big guys, we just gave them too many free throws today.  
  
Q. Christophe, unbelievable in the first half. You made six of your first
seven threes, 7 for 10 in the first half, all those points. Have you ever been
that kind of hot even on the playground or anywhere? Have you ever been like
that?  
CHRISTOPHE VARIDEL: Oh, yeah, yeah. I played in Geneva until I was 18, and
that was pretty much my role over there. I had to change my role when I came
to America, but you know, one of the reasons why I transferred here is I knew
the way Coach Bovaird made us play would fit me, and that is really the reason
I chose Chaminade.  
  
Q. Did they do anything differently against you in the second half or
perhaps were you a little bit worn down from running so much to get open in
the first half?  
CHRISTOPHE VARIDEL: They were a little bit tougher denying the ball. They
didn't let me get the handle with Lee on the first half. I think I had at
least three or four shots on just the hand off. But of course I was a little
tired. You can feel the legs after 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Lee, could you just talk about what it was like trying to set him up for
some of those or just keep him going or what it was like from your perspective
to see Christophe go off like that?  
LEE BAILEY: Christophe is an aggressive shooter. He doesn't need much space to
get his shot off. Really all I was trying to do is make his defender take a
step or at least in the hand off make him have to brush around me so he could
get that half a second to get his shot off. He make it's really easy,
obviously, hitting all kinds of fades and deep balls and things like that.  
But I just try to do anything I can to make a defender commit towards me or at
least not be able to face guard him, which I think they did the second half.
They just put one person on him and kind of did it like that. Other people had
to step up, but he did a great job getting himself up and coming off screens,
and I was just trying to find him when he came off.  
  
Q. Coach Bovaird, was it the game plan to let your best player go out there
and let him do his thing? Or was that the game plan rather than to go straight
up?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, not necessarily. You'll see as the tournament goes on and
as our season goes on we've got some really good players on the team. On
different nights we have about seven or eight guys that can lead us in
scoring. He just happened to be the one that's really, really hot tonight we
play another game, and it could be Lee, it could be Rhys or anything like
that. He was definitely feeling it tonight. Obviously he's a good player. He's
proven himself in the NCAA Division 1 tournament. I think he might. Do you
have the school record? So I mean, he's a good shooter.  
  
Q. Coach, what point did you realize Christophe was nearing the three ‑point
title and then the all over points record?   
COACH BOVAIRD: Soon after he checked out. I had no idea what those records
are. No clue. As soon as I found out that he was close to a record I just
looked at him and said you want to go back in? And he said, yeah, sure. He
very easily could have said no, my knees are killing me.  
But, hey, that opportunity to set a record like that, if I think about all the
players. I've watched this tournament for years and there have been some great
shooters and he's up there with the best of them.  
  
Q. Christophe, could you talk about what Coach was just talking about being
one point off the scoring record here in Maui and setting the three ‑point
record and just what that meant to you in the end?   
CHRISTOPHE VARIDEL: I wanted the W tonight, that's for sure. But I'm really
thankful to play for Coach Bovaird because I know he has a huge confidence in
me, and that's something I don't think I had in my previous years of college
basketball. I was always, you know, the coach always told me not to dribble
too much or just catch and shoot, and not more than one or two dribbles. I
always knew I could do a little bit more. But Coach Bovaird has confidence,
and I know he does. So it's really easy to relax and just play my game.  
Also it's really nice to play with Lee because we really understand each
other. That dribble handoff I think is going to do some damage during the year
because we really understand each other on the floor.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2013

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Anthlon Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26109)

### [Michael Qualls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26110)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

California  85  
Arkansas  77

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, can you make some opening comments?  
COACH ANDERSON: First of all, congratulations to California. I thought their
experience showed and our inexperience showed in a game of this setting.
Playing in a neutral setting, I thought Cobbs did a good job of setting the
tone.  
In the second half, they really did a good job of exposing us on the glass. In
my mind, I know we're much better rebounding basketball team, but for some
reason we didn't have the energy to finish it up.  
As I told our guys, I'm 0‑1\. I'll take the blame for that. I didn't get them
in the position they needed to be in a game of this magnitude. But at the same
time, I think California had a lot to do with that. It seemed like they made
big play after big plays, after we even made runs at them. But we'll learn
from it. That's what this trip is all about, getting a chance to learn and
really, really hone in on the thing that's we've got to get better at.  
  
Q. It's the first loss of the season. How does the team feel after this
loss?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: They feel like any team would feel after a loss. I can't
really put it into any more detail than that. Just got to, you know, forget it
and come back and focus on the next game.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We've got to come out and play harder. We've got to put it
together for two halves. Coach always says it's the second half, and we've got
to learn by experience.  
  
Q. Guys, I know Coach said he put it on himself about the rebounding, but
they were banging the boards really hard in there. What can you do as a team
to get yourselves in better position to get on the boards?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Rebound something by effort. We can't just rely on two, we've
got two or three guys that have rebounds, the whole team needs to be making
rebounds.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Sacrificed‑‑ I'm disappointed. I feel like I could have
gotten more boards. So I'll put that on my self. Talked about having quality
minutes yeah, man, in a situation like that, we've got to come together. We
can't have one guy kill us and that's what it's about.  
  
Q. I think you guys were 1 of 12 from the field, is that just their defense
or a combination of both?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I feel like lack of movement on the basketball. Coach doesn't
like one player to have the ball in his hand, constant pounding, because you
know we get good ball movement, and we have players catching it in rhythm, and
they can knock the shot down. So, yeah, we're very stagnant.  
  
Q. This next question is for both of you. Given that you guys can come back
right away and put the mistakes behind you tomorrow, how do you guys plan to
do that as far as the quick turn around? You have the 9:00 a.m. game tomorrow.
Could you care to comment on putting this game behind you, getting up in the
morning and coming back to rewrite the wrongs and play better?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We have to come out and play hard in that game as a team too.
We're just going to try to get it by ourselves at times when times got hard
and they made a run. But we've got to come together as a team and try to get
the W.  
THE MODERATOR: We can open it up for questions for Coach as well.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about why both Michael and Anthlon didn't start
today?  
COACH ANDERSON: It was the team meeting. They were late for a team meeting.
Even as I talk to those guys, that's part of building your team. They've got
to learn from it. Knowing that they're a big part of this team, so you can't
be late for team meetings. So we've dealt with that and now we can move
forward.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the pace? The pace seemed to slow down in the second
half?  
COACH ANDERSON: Yeah, well, they did a good job. They were in control. I
thought they controlled the line. If you look at the points in the paint, that
is the big difference. If we get those rebounds now, we've got the game going
up and down the floor. In the first half you asked about the 1 for 12, we had
some good shots, some good looks. We missed a bunch of point blank shots. My
two leading rebounders get two rebounds between them. You're not going to beat
many people like that. Just think, we end up losing the game by eight, so
we've just got to do a better job by committee of rebounding the basketball
and paying attention to detail. But let's give California a little credit for
that. I thought in the second half the pace was to their liking. They did a
good job of attacking us, but good teams make adjustments, and that is one of
the things we're going to learn. Their experience showed.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you shortened the bench a little bit today, no
Kingsley at all. Did you think you would get him in there and the size?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, we'll get him in there. We'll address that. I think he
brings a level of toughness we need to have. When you look at how it boils
down to the energy and the toughness. I thought California had a little bit
more in them today, this day. Now tomorrow's going to be a different day. But
we'll get them involved. We played quite a few guys. But he certainly will get
out there, because I think he'll give us a size guy that can rebound the
basketball. He's got some beef on him.  
  
Q. You played more of the three guard lineup today instead of going with the
three fours like you did in previous games. Was there any reason you did
that?  
COACH ANDERSON: You have to remember now we started off out of the gate, we
had guys that didn't start out. So from that standpoint, that kind of set the
tone. I was disappointed in what took place, but as I said, we'll move forward
from it and we'll learn from it.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: Rich Pitino is next. Head coach of Minnesota in his first year,
just his second year as a head coach. Was on the cusp of making the NCAA
Tournament last year with Florida International. He's only 31 years old. He's
been around the game of basketball his entire life. He's been on the coaching
staff, obviously, with his dad at Louisville. He's grown up around the dinner
table and NBA locker rooms. He's very, very comfortable in who he is as a
31‑year‑old head coach.  
He also served under Billy Donavon and in my estimation Billy Donavon and Rick
Pitino are two of the top 10 coaches we have in our game today. There is a
heavy influence of what you'll see from his ballclub from both how his dad's
teams play and how Billy Donavon's teams play.  
He's completely changing the culture of Minnesota basketball. They're going to
get up and down that floor. I'm pretty sure they pressed the flight attendants
on their flight over. That is who they are now. And it's now my pleasure to
hear a few words with you as well from Richard Pitino, the head coach of the
Minnesota Gophers.  
COACH PITINO: Very excited to be here. My last time being here actually Jeff
Brassow tipped in a lay‑up against Arizona I believe in 1993 with Kentucky. So
that was the last great memory of Maui Classic, and I'm excited to certainly
be a part of it. Normally you watch as a spectator, and this is really the
pinnacle of preseason tournaments. Unfortunately, we have to play Syracuse
first game, and got to go against Coach Boeheim who has about 900 more wins
than I, do whatever it may be.  
Going to be difficult. They're always very, very good, and certainly
consistently one of the best teams in the country. Somebody asked me did I
watch any of Louisville's film against them from last year, and I was trying
to see what they did. They had this kid Montrezl Harrell on the baseline and
they threw it to him and they'd go up and dunk it, and we said we can't do
that. So we're going to try a different game plan. I asked my power forward, I
asked can you dunk like him? He said no. I said, okay, we're going to try
something else.  
I have so much respect for Coach Boeheim and my family has known him for a
long time. My mother loves him. I'm not sure if she'll be rooting for him or
for me tomorrow, but it's going to be really exciting. It's an unbelievable
opportunity. Great coaches, great programs, and we'll try our best tomorrow to
see how we stand with them.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Mike Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13959)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: Thank you, Coach. To his left is Mike Montgomery, the head coach
of California. He's been at the Division 1 level as a head coach and in the
NBA for over 30 years. I observed his practice yesterday, he loves to teach
the game. And I don't know if I've had that conversation with him or not, but
he's a terrific teacher, and you can tell that it's probably the most
important two hours of his day still is working with young people and teaching
them the game of basketball.  
He's in his sixth year as head coach of California. He's had only one losing
season in 31 years at the Division 1 level. He is the ninth winningest head
coach, active coach, in Division I basketball right now. He returns four
starters from an NCAA team last year. They will be one of the teams that will
battle all season long for the top of the Pac‑12\. Mike Montgomery.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Thank you, Jimmy. I've been in this tournament a time or
two. One of my least favorite memories was the losing season that Jimmy
alluded to where we played Chaminade in the 9:00 o'clock game on Wednesday,
which was not the highlight of my college career, I can tell you that was no
fun. I have mentioned that to my team a time or two. That's not a place, not
that Chaminade would be there, because they're awfully good, but that third
place, 9:00 o'clock game on Wednesday is not where you want to be.  
We spent this week on the track running 40‑yard dashes, trying to get back on
defense to prepare for Arkansas. Needless to say, we are all undefeated. I
don't know that everybody had quite the rigorous schedule that we had in our
first four games at home, but they're games we probably should have won and
almost didn't win. But we have a lot of respect for Mike and the way he plays.  
We know we're up against it. No way we can simulate the kind of athletes we're
going to face in this tournament specifically tomorrow. So it was a difficult
prep trying to get the guys on the bench to be about three steps quicker and
about two inches taller and run about five steps quicker than they do. But we
tried. So it's a great challenge for us. It's always fun to be here. It's not
quite as far for us to get here, but it's still a pretty good trip.  
We hope we can compete with this field. The coaches, I know most of them
pretty well having been around a lot respect and good friends. We're excited
about being here and hopefully we can compete.

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: Seated to his left is head coach of Dayton, Archie Miller. He's
in his third year as head coach there. He led the Flyers to the NIT tournament
in his first season. He spent time as an assistant coach in Western Kentucky,
NorthCarolina State, Arizona State, Ohio State, Arizona. His brother is a head
coach, Sean, in case you don't realize that. That's why that last name sounds
familiar to you.  
Terrific point guard, played 122 games for NorthCarolina State in the late
'90s and early 2000. They're coming off what I think is a really good road win
at Georgia Tech. They had some concerns going into that ballgame. He has a
deep, talented, tough, veteran ballclub. This is a team that I think is going
to have really a terrific shot at being in that NCAA Tournament this year,
very good defensive ballclub.  
You watch his brother's teams play watch him play, you can see they want to
get after you on the defensive end and do it without fouling. So, Archie
Miller from Dayton, the microphone is yours.  
COACH MILLER: Thanks, Jimmy. It's great to be here. University of Dayton has
been very, very fortunate to participate in the Maui Invitational already two
times with winning it in 2003. This is something that everyone looks forward
to. I know as a player when I played and as a coach, this is the one you dial
into when you're not in it and you wish you could be here.  
It's the premier event, and we're obviously very humble and excited to be
here. Spent one other time here my first year as an assistant at Arizona when
we took over there with Sean. We were in the Maui Invitational in 2009, and
the guy next to me took home the title that year.  
I can remember being at the tournament watching Gonzaga how they operated in
the tournament, not only on the floor but off the floor, and walking away from
it saying that's what it's about right there. That's a true program, great
staff, unbelievable players and tremendous chemistry.  
Again, I guess four years removed as we get ready to tipoff against them, it's
so much of the same. So we have a great deal of respect for Gonzaga.
Excellence all across the board. We're very, very excited to compete in the
field. I think this is one of those things that a month down the line, maybe
two months down the line, this really improves us fast. So, again, thanks for
obviously having us. We're very excited to be here and we're looking forward
to playing.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: Our last coach means as much to Gonzaga basketball as Jim Boeheim
means to Syracuse. Mark Few is in his 15th season at Gonzaga. He led the zags
to an NCAA Tournament bid every year since he's been named head coach back in
1999. Prior to that he spent nine years as an assistant at Gonzaga, and every
year his name comes up for whatever job is out there, and every year Mark Few
is very happy and content to continue to be a Zag.  
He led his program to a new record last year, No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament and overall No. 1 seed. They won the 2009 EA Sports Maui
Invitational. He spends time here. This is one of his favorite places. I'm
probably getting ready to say what he's going to talk about. Maui is one of
his favorite places. He comes here every year in the off‑season with his
family to surf and enjoy what's going on. He's a family guy. And again, great
description. You look up talented coach, low maintenance, it's Mark Few. Mark?  
COACH FEW: Thanks, Jimmy. I just want to kind of, again, say this is like a
great place for the Zags. This is our fourth time here. We've had some
fantastic memories if you think back to a triple overtime game against
Michigan State with Adam Morrison, which is probably 8 or 9 years ago to the
last time we were here. We brought a team we didn't know much about, and we
were able to play very, very well, which Archie was referencing and get out of
here with a championship.  
Having been in four of these, I can say much like Jimmy started this
conference with, this is probably as balanced a crew as I've seen, and I
really truly believe that I think we're going to see maybe six or seven teams
in the NCAA Tournament starting with Archie's team next to me.  
Just watching film on them the last couple days I'm unbelievably impressed
with how hard they play, how tough they are and they've got a great plan. You
know, looking at this table hearing the descriptors, it seems kind of weird.
Because now we're talking about Archie and Richard. It doesn't seem that long
ago that I was theoretically the young guy in the group, and now that's kind
of depressing in a way.  
But this is the premier tournament, and we play in all of them, and this is
the one we put on the map every year. We talk about it in recruiting. Our fans
talk about it. Our players talk about it. It's a great place. Your family's
come out here and hearing the stories on the families on the way out here, as
I was listening to that at any moment here those are my two kids playing
football out there and I was about ready to go collar my 13‑year‑old for
cheap‑shotting my 11‑year‑old. So that is kind of the balance we have as
coaches on this trip. Fortunately, I think they just quit.  
So, anyhow, I think it's going to be a great tournament. I'm very, very
impressed and nervous about what we've got with Dayton here, because I think
they're a terrific team, and I think Archie is doing an unbelievable job.
Should be a fun week.  
JIMMY DYKES: Again, just want to let you know how important this event is to
ESPN. How much we appreciate what Dave Odom and all you folks here do for us,
and the entire island just rolls out the red carpet for us year after year.
It's a special event because of the people that are behind it. So from ESPN, I
want to say thank you to all those folks that make this happen. With that,
I'll turn it back over to Palmer.  
PALMER MOODY: Thank you very much, Jimmy, and thank you very much coaches.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: Scott Drew is the head coach of the Baylor Bears. Had their
opener this year against SouthCarolina in our 24‑hour marathon, and he has a
very talented team. He took over a Baylor program that was completely in the
ruts when he took it over. His second or third year they didn't even get to
play games until conference season. Had he to completely rebuild the Baylor
brand of basketball, and he's done an outstanding job with it. Won the NIT
championship last year. It's a program that's used to winning, a high
percentage winning rate in the month of March.  
He spent ten years as an assistant at Valpo, and one season as the head coach.
They'll be in the hunt for the Big 12 title this year along with Kansas,
Oklahoma State, Iowa State, Scott Drew from Baylor.  
COACH DREW: Well, I can tell you when I was an assistant for my dad I always
tried to‑‑ he put me in charge of scheduling. We went to Hawaii for several
different tournaments, but this is the one I always wanted to get into. We
weren't able to because obviously everyone in the country wants to play here
because it's the premier tournament. I know when I got to Baylor this was the
first thing I tried to do. I think finally Coach Odom got tired of answering
my phone calls and put us in here.  
So this is a bucket list thing for me personally. I know our team is very
excited. You have great coaches, great programs. I agree with Coach Boeheim,
there's going to be numerous teams in the NCAA Tournament. To come in
undefeated with the parity in college basketball just speaks very highly of
not only the fan support and the basketball programs and coaches and players,
but also for Coach Odom and his staff bringing in this field this year.  
So, unfortunately, I know we all can't leave here undefeated. But we're all
going to learn more about our teams while being out here, and we'll be better
teams which will help us the rest of the season. Thank you for allowing us to
be able to be a part of this. And I think all of us agree we definitely don't
get this kind of weather or hospitality back home.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: To my left is Eric Bovaird. He's the head coach of Chaminade
University in his third year. They upset Texas last year in the EA Sports Maui
Invitational. They play a brand of basketball at their level that is very
similar to what Minnesota likes to do and Arkansas. They come at you. They
pressure you and they get after you. Sometimes in this field he has to scale
that back a little bit because of the size of athletes that he's up against,
but he's an excellent coach.  
He led Chaminade last year to the 2013 Pac West championship game. Prior to
being at Chaminade he was an assistant at West Liberty, and they hung a lot of
points on folks. He's an assistant there for seven years. I feel like he has
probably one of the better Chaminade teams I've had in the seven years I've
been out here. So Eric Bovaird and Chaminade will tipoff Monday. Coach, give
us a few words.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, you'd think after three years of being here that I'd
remember to bring my sun glasses. We're always facing the sun. But I see Coach
Few and Coach Pitino are the only smart ones out of the group.  
No, I'm really happy with our team this year. It's a great honor to play
against the level of competition we're about to play. These teams have the
ability to definitely expose some weaknesses. Our ultimate goal is to win and
to get to the Division II National Championship and win that. This is a great,
great opportunity for our guys to learn about ourselves and it really helps us
throughout the season. Last year's win versus Texas was huge. Not many
Division II programs get the opportunity to lead Sportscenter, so hopefully
we'll be on there again this year maybe.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2013

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
JIMMY DYKES: I talked about a group of highly talented, low‑maintenance guys.
To put that in perspective, on the flight out from Dallas to Maui it's about
an eight‑hour flight. I was in first class, thankful for ESPN for providing
that for me. My wife and 8‑year‑old daughter were in coach class. I went back
to check on them a couple of times and my 8‑year‑old daughter finally said,
dad, I want to sit up in first class with you. It's too crowded back here, I
don't like it. I leaned in and said, Listen, Jim Boeheim the head coach from
Syracuse is right behind you. I don't want to hear another word, do you
understand? And that's who Coach Boeheim is. He's hanging with his guys.  
But he is Syracuse basketball. He has poured his life into that university in
more ways than just the basketball program. He is the second winningest head
coach in Division I history right now with 924 wins. Went to the Final Four
last year. He's won the National Championship in 2003, he's a Naismith
Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer.  
He is unbeaten in Maui. Won both trips both times he's been here. They've won
it. They've gone home with the championship trophy in 1990 and 1998. Made a
major impact in basketball across the globe with USA Basketball. He's just a
terrific person. Does a ton of work for Coaches Versus Cancer. A lot of these
guys are involved in that, but he's as respected as there is in the game, Jim
Boeheim.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Wow, thanks, Jimmy, I appreciate that. A long time ago I had my
wife and children in coach like you did, and I paid‑‑ it was about three years
before I got the payback completed from that. So you do have to learn these
things over time. I'm a little disappointed to be here today. It's six inches
of snow and 20° in Syracuse today, and I hate to miss that.  
But you know we're happy to be in this tournament. I had forgotten that we had
won this tournament. Anything before 2005 I can't remember anymore. I do
remember Richard being born in Syracuse, and I hope that he remembers that,
that we were nice to him coming in. Had a little baby shower and everything.  
But we're excited to be here. This is as good a tournament as I've been here
in 30‑some years in terms of the field. We've played in a lot of tournaments,
and this is a tremendous field. I think there's going to be five or six teams
coming out of this tournament in the NCAA Tournament at the end of the year.
And it's just a privilege to be here.  
It's as well run as any tournament that we've ever played in, and we're
excited about the opportunity. There's going to be some great basketball here.
It's important at this time of the year you learn a little bit about your team
and this is where you do it. So we're really happy to be here. It's a classy
tournament.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
PALMER MOODY: I'm Palmer Moody, media relations director for the EA Sports
Maui Invitational and on behalf of the tournament, I'd like to welcome
everyone and thank you for joining us here today. I'll give a quick rundown of
what's going to happen here, and then turn things over to our emcee, Jimmy
Dykes. First, we'll hear from all eight head coaches, then after that we'll
head over to this area over here for the surfboard photo op. Then we'll begin
the charity free‑throw contest which will be set up over here by the
basketball hoop. Then after that we'll have 15, 20 minutes for media round
table one‑on‑one interviews. So, media, we ask that you hold your questions
until that one‑on‑one time period. We'll have coaches make some comments here
in just a few minutes.  
I'd like to introduce Jimmy Dykes right now who is going to host our coaches'
comments here. Jimmy is beginning his 15th season as a college basketball
analyst at ESPN, and this will be his sixth EA Sports Maui Invitational that
he'll be covering. Jimmy was a three‑year letterman at Arkansas, and he went
on to become an assistant coach for the Razorbacks and he's also coached at
Sacramento State, Appalachian State, Kentucky, Arkansas‑Little Rock and
Oklahoma State. He was also a college scout for the Seattle Supersonics.
Please welcome Jimmy Dykes.  
JIMMY DYKES: I got fired at every one of those jobs and kept moving along is
what happened. It's a pleasure to be here. One thing they left out of my
resume there was as a three‑year letterman at Arkansas I'm in the record book.
I think Mike Anderson knows this, I'm the only player in the history of
Arkansas that when I finished my career, my overall grade point average was
higher than my overall point per game average. I was not a 4.0 student so that
tells you a little about the kind of player I was.  
My sixth year to be here. Seven years ago I was at the Great Alaska Shootout.
That's when they changed me from the Great Alaska Shootout to Maui, it was a
no‑brainer. Picture‑perfect weather here, a terrific field in the 30th
anniversary of the Maui Invitational. As balanced as I've seen since I've been
out here.  
I was telling Coach Drew a few minutes ago it seems like every year I've been
here there's been a favorite coming in, a Top 4 or 5 ranked team, and this
year it's a very wide open field, a highly competitive tournament awaits us.  
I'd like to recognize from Chaminade University, the president is with us this
morning, Bernie Ploeger, Brother Bernie Ploeger is here. Thank you for being
here and for all that Chaminade University does for this tournament.  
We're 18 days in, 19 days into the college basketball season, and there are 56
undefeated teams remaining in Division I basketball. 7 of those 56 are here on
the island with us today. Chaminade is not Division I, they're also unbeaten,
so these schools represent an overall record of 30‑0 to begin the tournament
on Monday. That gives you an idea of the quality of basketball we're getting
ready to see.  
There is also a brand‑new, refurbished floor. When I walked into the Lahaina
Civic Center yesterday, that was the first thing that jumped out to me was a
beautiful floor.  
David Odom and the tournament Selection Committee and his committee that runs
this thing, they do an unbelievable job of making this, in my opinion, the
premier event in all of early season basketball. It's a primary property for
ESPN. We put major importance on how we cover it. We bring in the best of the
best. Not only in terms of our production crew, but all the people that work
behind the scenes for us here that make the job for Jon Sciambi and I, and Jay
Bilas and John McDonough, that make our job easy.  
This is a highly important part of our season, the Maui invitational, when the
eyes of the college basketball will be upon us. There are three National
Championships represented up here, Arkansas, Syracuse, and California have won
it 18 final fours, 79 conference championships, and 132 NCAA appearances. We
have coaching spectrums at both ends. Jim Boeheim is the second winningest
coach in the history of our game. No one has more respect. His imprint is all
over the game of basketball from his time with USA Basketball to what he's
done with Syracuse, on the other end we have Richard Pitino who is in his
second year as a head coach, and he's been right there beside his dad and
Billy Donavon for a lot of years. And that's an interesting match‑up right off
the bat.  
All the coaches up here, I will say this, and I would not always say this
about a bunch of guys that I'm around at this level, these are all highly
talented guys in my opinion. They're also low maintenance. There is not a lot
of those‑‑ there is not enough of those in the game of college basketball.
These guys up here know what I'm talking about. There are a lot of highly
talented coaches in the game. But also a lot of guys that can be difficult to
deal with, they're high maintenance, and these guys are not. That's a salute
from me to them. Everybody likes to coach a player like that as well.  
With that, I'm going to open it up to the coaches. We'll go down the line. Our
first coach you're going to hear from is the head coach of the Arkansas
Razorbacks, Mike Anderson. He's in his third year as head coach of the Hogs.
His third year at other stops prior to Arkansas at UAB and Missouri have been
turning moments for him. NCAA Tournaments at both of those schools, three
times for Missouri, three times for UAB. He was an assistant for Nolan
Richardson and Arkansas when they won the National Championship. He's brought
back a style to basketball that the Arkansas fan base was really starved for,
Bud Walton Arena is now one of the most difficult places to play in all of
college basketball.  
With that, I'd like to hear a few words from Mike Anderson, Coach?  
COACH ANDERSON: All right. First we're certainly excited to be here on the
island of Maui. I mean, can you imagine these conditions? I think back home
right now it's about 30°, 40°, so with that being said, we're excited to play
against a great California team. Mike Montgomery does a tremendous job. A lot
of teams here now are finding out more about their teams as we up the
competition. What better setting to do it than in a tournament format where
you play game‑in and game‑out.  
But we're excited about our team. We've addressed some issues from last year.
We didn't have any size. Now we've got some size that we feel can play the way
we want to play and that is up‑tempo basketball.
