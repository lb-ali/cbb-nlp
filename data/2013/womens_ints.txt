_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS - 47  
FORDHAM - 46

  
COACH GAITLEY: First of all, I want to congratulate St. Joe's. It was a
hard‑fought game, two very good teams battling. It's a hard one for anybody to
lose, but again, breaks go a certain way at the end.  
So again, credit to St. Joe's and for their kids. They have had an outstanding
season.  
  
Q. What did you see on the last play with Cloud for the foul?  
ERIN ROONEY: I mean, I saw her posting up. Not to sound bad, but I didn't see
a foul at all. So I mean, we are all pretty shocked and disappointed, and we
just tried to stay focused on finishing the game strong. But it was a tough
call.  
  
Q. Erin, what broke down on the final possession?  
ERIN ROONEY: Was that one where she was pressing up‑‑  
  
Q. The final possession, the final play, off the basket ‑‑ went off the
baseline. What broke down?   
COACH GAITLEY: We were looking to isolate Erin and then because we switched,
you we saw the guard was covering Sam. That's when she looked inside. So we
were going to take ‑‑ if Erin was switched on by a big, we were going to
attack; if they switched and we had Sam, and we could go inside.  
  
Q. Marah, on a night when you're struggling shooting, is there any doubt or
hesitation to keep going at it and keep putting up shots?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: I think in a game like this, it was a tough game, so you
can't have any hesitation. You just have to go out there and let it fly no
matter what. Coach is really confident about us taking our shots, so just
trying to stay focused on defense and just continue to take the shots that I
need to take.  
  
Q. Erin, the last time you guys played St. Joe's, you missed a couple free
throws late that led to them getting into overtime; were those free throws in
your head at all when you missed one of your two?  
ERIN ROONEY: Obviously after that game I needed to work on my free throws and
I have been practicing and so I went up to the line fully confident that I was
going to hit them. I didn't.  
  
Q. We talked a couple weeks ago about the turnaround in the program; just
what it means to be one possession away from making the NCAA Tournament. Just
put the season in perspective, 24 wins and just how exciting this year has
been so far.  
MARAH STRICKLAND: I mean, I just have to say how proud I am of this team and
how hard we have been working since day one‑‑ and just how proud I am of the
girls coming out ‑‑ to be able to do what we did, the girls worked so hard to
turn around Fordham women's basketball, so really proud.  
  
Q. What did you see on the final possession? Did you think that the foul was
warranted?  
COACH GAITLEY: These are tough situations, especially when you're a veteran
coach, because I've never lost a game in this situation. I always believe that
the kids should determine the outcome and that's what's so disappointing; let
the kids determine the outcome.  
Again, I'd have to look at the call again. The frustrating thing for me is I
had been arguing at the other end doing the same thing. So for it to go
against you on the last play for a championship and a chance to go to the NCAA
tournament ‑‑ it was hard to say, because I haven't seen the film. But the
look was for Erin to attack, and I think when Erin recognized they switched,
she went inside to Sam. So, tough time, you have to bite your tongue and suck
it up.  
  
Q. This team has been as resilient a team all year what do you tell the
girls after that resiliency just isn't enough at the end?  
COACH GAITLEY: Just that you are so proud of them. As you saw Marah and Erin,
just such a wonderful young ladies and I think they are great representatives
of Fordham.  
We are fortunate, Fordham is extremely committed to being successful. It's
just got great administration, starting with Father McShane on down, and I
know that we have taken a huge step and we are a team to be reckoned with and
here we are on national TV playing for a championship.  
You know, I think this group of kids, right now is hurts too much for them to
recognize what they have done. I think in a month or so, they will be able to
reflect back and see the accomplishments because we kind of are just in the
moment so to speak for the last couple months and we just try not to look
ahead and as we refer to, win the day as people, win the day as students, and
win the day as players.  
  
Q. Would you comment on the Barclays Center as a venue for the final.  
COACH GAITLEY: I also want to thank the Atlantic 10. I thought it was a
first‑class event. I thought the crowds on both sides were terrific. I thought
that was a great statement of women's basketball for Barclays.  
I think everybody was nervous on what the turnout was going to be or what the
venue was going to be because it's so big and such a beautiful, beautiful
facility. But again, the Atlantic 10 did a terrific job putting on a
first‑class event, and I think it was a hard‑fought game and I think we
represented Atlantic 10 basketball very well.  
  
Q. You started off on a 12 ‑0 run, did you think the team became complacent?
And what changed in the second half where St. Joe's went on that 12‑0 run to
duplicate yours?  
COACH GAITLEY: Both teams were a little tight. A lot of games that happens‑‑
whether it was 12‑0, we knew it was going to be a game of run. The last time
we played them we were up by nine at the half and we knew by means the game
was not over. They were shooting 20percent in the field, and that obviously
got reversed in the second half; we shot 28 percent and they shot 52 percent.  
So I don't think it was complacency as much as, you know, I think St. Joe's
was a little tight. I thought they didn't knuckle down.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the play of Natasha Cloud? Last time you had a hard
time handling Van Grinsven; this time around, you handled her pretty well.
Cloud seemed to jump out early in the second half.  
COACH GAITLEY: Give all the credit to them. Different nights, different people
step up and that's kind of been the story for our team.  
I thought if we were going to have somebody beat us, we wanted to make sure we
were going to dictate who was going to get those shots. I think St. Joe's
capitalizes; the one time we gave a little breathing room to Erin Shields, she
knocked down that big three. So there was a couple turnaround points that I'm
sure if we had it back, we would run the play a little differently.  
Ace had no idea it was her fifth foul, and a lot is just having an awareness,
but because they play so hard, and you know, you can't blame her for that.
It's a tough situation and it's just been a terrific group and you could point
to a bunch of different plays that kind of game to the end of that.  
  
Q. When they finally took the lead and got up four, what was the atmosphere
in the huddle amongst you guys being down for the first time all game?  
COACH GAITLEY: Calm. It's a game of runs. We talk about that all the time. We
work on special situations every day. So you know, it was a very calm time and
like, all right, they make our run, we make our run. We know it's a game of
runs. We know the game wasn't over when we were up 12 and we knew the game
wasn't over when we were down four. Abigail hit some big threes to keep us in
a situation where we could have pulled it out at the end, but as we said all
along, the one operative word is resilience. It's a very resilient group, and
it's hard, as I'm sure you all know, you have all been in athletics, to walk
away from a championship game and lose the game by one. It's hard to sit here
and talk about it, but it is what it is, and hats off to St. Joe's and we'll
do our best to play some really good basketball from here on out.  
  
Q. This season so far what it meant to the program and turning it around,
Fordham to being a winning program?  
COACH GAITLEY: I think once I get away from it all, to really reflect and see
where we are with it, because to be honest, I have tried not to reflect on it
because then I think you kind of stop living in the moment.  
Once I have time to reflect on it, I think it will hit me first what we were
able to accomplish. Then, you know, you can't do it without having support. We
have great support with our administration. And we just have a great product
in Fordham. It's an easy sell. And I often wondered when I was head coach at
St. Joe's why Fordham didn't win.  
And having now be there and being part of Fordham, I realize it has all the
pieces to be successful. It just is matter as any coach will tell you of
getting players, and getting the three additions we had along with last year's
players, it was great chemistry and very unselfish group and a we before me
attitude and I think that's what carried us through.  
  
Q. Do you think this team earned an at ‑large bid?  
COACH GAITLEY: It's a tough thing. Obviously, you know, when we made our early
season schedule, we made it not knowing Marah was going to be eligible. So we
made it thinking, trying to build, because you have to learn how to win first,
and Fordham had not won.  
So when the mind‑set was made, it was made in the sense of, all right, let's
get some wins and learn how to win. You know, we have learned obviously lots
from this. St. Joe's did a great job with their schedule. I don't think they
had any bad losses and they had some great wins.  
I think we are one of the best teams left because of the way we are playing
right now. You know, so I think we have a strong case. But you know, it's a
difficult situation.  
  
Q. Obviously when it comes down to the end like that, it doesn't matter if
you're playing St. Joe's or UCONN; what's it like to face St. Joe's with
stakes like this?  
COACH GAITLEY: I mean, we spent the whole season facing the name on the
jersey. It was a blank jersey for us. Everybody stood between us and what our
goal was.  
So when we went into that last game we knew it was a hard‑fought game the last
time we played St. Joe's, so we looked at it as a blank jersey and looked at
somebody standing between us and going to the NCAA Tournament.  
It's obviously emotionally tough, because I had coached there; four of the
people on the staff there, I coached. So it was tough. But they are a
well‑coached team, a very well‑rounded team and a very strong program and you
know, I had a lot of great experiences there.  
So I mean, it's bittersweet, obviously, because it was for a championship, but
that's what happens when you play the game.  
  
Q. St. Joe's shot 52 percent in the second half after shooting just 20 in
the first. Is that as simple as their shots starting to drop?  
COACH GAITLEY: I think it was shots starting to drop because they started off
pretty cold. It was a matter of their shots started to drop and any time we
had any type of little let‑up they capitalized on it. When you keep a team in
the 40s, you have done a really good job defensively. Offensively we got out
of rhythm a little bit and got down to the shot clock too much but again we
didn't shoot particularly well in the second half. But on different nights,
different people step up and unfortunately we fell two points short.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS  47  
FORDHAM - 46

  
COACH GRIFFIN: Wow, what a game. Started out obviously down by 12 points I
think it was, and the kids fought back and give Fordham a lot of credit. They
really came out strong.  
But our kids were very resilient today, determined today, had a lot of desire
today, and you know, just down the stretch we made plays when we needed to
make plays. They believed it. You know, things did not always go our way. The
ball did not always bounce our way but these kids believed that they could win
and we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Ashley, we have talked in the past you being the senior on the team, the
fourth ‑year senior, playing another game, playing another game, and now the
realization that you have the Atlantic 10 Championship, what does that mean to
you?   
ASHLEY PRIM: It means a lot. I'm so excited for my team, and for myself, as
well. Just helping this team, being a senior point guard and trying to get us
on the right track, everybody stepped up when they were supposed to and we did
it. We did it. And this is what this year is leaving off to the next class,
and I'm just so excited. I'm so excited.  
  
Q. Ashley, being a senior, you guys came out down 12 ‑0, and you hit those
free throws to have that break‑out run. What did you tell the team after the
time‑out to get them to rally around? At halftime when there was a big
adjustment I guess was made, you were on a 12‑0 run, what did you tell them,
to keep your heads up and keep your team in the game?   
ASHLEY PRIM: It was a combination of myself, Natasha, Erin, everybody said we
need to step it up. We are not going to leave here with any regrets. We have
to do what it takes to win, because we have to leave it all on the floor and
we weren't going to leave this gym without a win.  
  
Q. For Chatilla, things were not going well at the beginning, obviously
could not score but you were doing other things, rebounding, how important was
that to try to get the ship righted?  
CHATILLA VAN GRINSVEN: I think great defense always is getting us back in the
game, especially for this team and it shows really the fight that we have in
our team and determination.  
I think we really showed that on the defensive end and of course making the
plays, people like Natasha and Erin and Primmy making plays, great plays and
great minutes just when we needed it. Took us back in the game but definitely
started out with defense. Eventually, of course, I wish I was more effective
on the offensive end, but today was not the day for me. But I think the team
did great and you know, we pulled it out.  
  
Q. Talking about offense, Natasha, you were aggressive at the beginning, you
came out cold and you started pushing the momentum, even though you did miss a
couple of shots what was your mind ‑set?   
NATASHA CLOUD: I mean, Coach and the team has been harping on me being more
aggressive as a scorer this year, because it's never really been my go‑to.
I've been more of a defensive player.  
But everybody just kept telling me to shoot the ball because Rooney was so far
off me. Just my team having confidence in me, the coaching staff having
confidence in me made my have confidence in myself, so I was just putting up
the shots.  
  
Q. Ashley, what does it mean when you hear NCAA Tournament and St. Joe's is
going now?  
ASHLEY PRIM: We are excited. We just have to play, because it's one and done
now, so we have to play without any regrets. But it's just a great
accomplishment to make it there and to win the Atlantic 10 Championship.  
So we have to take the same thing, one game at a time, because we are one and
done. So we've accomplished this so we can get as far as we can in the NCAA.  
  
Q. Your overall reaction to being named most outstanding player?  
NATASHA CLOUD: I was surprised. I'm not really the one that usually has the
points, but I mean, my teammates‑‑ I give the credit to my teammates because
they found me and they got me the award. So my teammates get an award, too.  
  
Q. What do you have to say about Fordham as a program?  
COACH GRIFFIN: Coach Gaitley has done an unbelievable job with that group.
They really play well together, and they play with five or six kids and they
can interchange them in so many different ways.  
You really have to be able to defend multiple people, and you know, they came
out really strong today, and did an unbelievable job. You know, we were very
happy that we were able to beat them today because they are a very good team.  
  
Q. Nice piece of neck wear you have, I don't think I've ever seen a coach
coming in wearing a net post game. What does it mean to get St. Joe's back to
the NCAA Tournament for you?  
COACH GRIFFIN: It's been a long time coming. I think with the win over Dayton,
you think you have it, you know, but today was solidified with it. We are
going to enjoy Monday night. We are going to enjoy knowing that we are in and
our ticket is punched, and I'm going to enjoy seeing St. Joseph's across that
ESPN line, at least for 24 hours, anyway. It's unbelievable that the players
that we had were able to step up.  
And this isn't just for the players that are on our team now. I feel as though
it's for the players that have preceded them and had gone to the championship
game and maybe came up empty a little bit. Half of them or more than half of
them are in the stands right now. So to be able to celebrate not only with our
present team, but our past team, is really special.  
  
Q. Erin going into the second half had not attempted a shot, was there an
adjustment to get her more involved in the offense? The first possession, she
takes a jumpshot and finds Ashley Robinson underneath. Seemed like the offense
started to go through her the second half.  
COACH GRIFFIN: We knew she needed to get shots and we knew they were going to
focus on her along with some other kids. So we did go to her early in the
second half just to get her some more touches. You know, she made things
happen. That big three there late was huge. She's a terrific player. You know,
we should get her the ball a little bit more.  
  
Q. What did you learn from the first match ‑up with Fordham, and in
particular, being able to limit Erin and Marah scoring‑ and shooting‑wise?   
COACH GRIFFIN: We learned that our two best defenders needed to be on their
two best offensive players, and that's really what it was. We did a good job
for the most part on those two kids.  
Natasha and Primmy had that responsibility throughout most of the game. We
watched a lot of film. They were very focused today. You know, the score is in
the 40s, so there was not a whole lot of offense going on at either end.  
  
Q. Early in the game when you went down, do you think it was the defense
that got you back into it, until the offense finally came around?  
COACH GRIFFIN: I do. I think like a lot of teams, I think we score in bunches,
and that was a big bunch there in the beginning. I knew if we started to chip
away, that we would be able to‑‑ we would be able to make a run at it, because
our defense is solid.  
You know, we depend on that when we are not making shots and not making the
shots we were usually getting. Natasha was struggling, we couldn't get Erin
the ball. Primmy came up making some plays there, just chipping away and
chipping away. And you know, I just think this team has a lot of resilience
and a lot of determination. Refuse to lose.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  75  
Iowa State  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey and
student‑athletes Odyssey Sims and Brittney Griner. We'll go straight to
questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Especially after yesterday, how good did that performance feel?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely felt better than yesterday. We came out just
quick. It showed throughout the game in the first half. We came out the second
half still doing the same thing we did in the first.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It felt good. I felt we came out with a lot more intensity. We
jumped on it from the start and never let up.  
I don't know what was going on yesterday. Coach got us on the shoot around. We
picked it up. We acted like we're juniors and seniors.  
  
Q. Odyssey, looked like, particularly on offense, more passes trying to make
that extra pass to get somebody open?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: In the zone yesterday was kind of too much. We didn't have a
leader. We didn't have anybody cutting. We was looking for BG when she was
standing still. Just caused everybody else to standstill.  
Today we worked on moving the ball, penetrating, opening up the zone so BG
could get more shots.  
  
Q. I know the biggest prize is still ahead of you with the NCAA
championship. Doesn't seem to ever get old for you celebrating. Talk about the
relief of getting it done.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Winning never gets old, especially this one. I think I speak
for the five seniors. We definitely wanted to get this win. We wanted to
celebrate this, everybody did. This is our last go‑around with the Big 12.  
Meant everything to us.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It means a lot. We won it three years in a row. I'm really happy
about that. Just keep playing. We got a great team. We have a lot of depth.  
Celebrating is always fun. Like Brittney said, when we win, it's always fun.
You never want to lose.  
  
Q. Brittney, if you could play for any WNBA team, which one would you play
for?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just a chance to play, you know. I'm just glad there's a
league for us to go play in. Just a chance to play, it doesn't matter where.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you mentioned winning three years in a row. You've won the
regular season Big 12 and the conference tournament three years in a row. You
know how tough this league is. To do that, what does it say?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I guess it sends a statement. It's always good to send a
statement going into the NCAA tournament.  
Like I say, we're just out there having fun, taking it one game at a time, not
overlooking past anybody. We have a great team and we're able to come out and
beat everybody, I guess.  
  
Q. Anyway you can compare where you are now versus where you were after
winning the tournament last year going into the NCAA?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I think we're where we need to be, especially with this game.
If we can play like we played tonight, anything's possible. I think we're on
track, just like we were last year.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: There's really no difference from last year. Our defense is the
same, our offense. We're just doing a better job of knowing where each other
are on the court, understanding each other's roles, being able to help a
teammate when they're down, working together.  
  
Q. Now that there's going to be a couple weeks before the tournament starts,
how do you prepare yourself and make this time go faster?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, I mean, coach, I'm sure she's going to give us maybe a
couple days off (laughter).  
But, you know, just rest and get in the gym, tune‑up some little things that
we need to work on, polish some edges, just keep doing what we're doing.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: We're a great team. There's always something to be corrected. I
think, like Brittney said, hopefully we get a couple days off. Whenever we
start practicing again, we'll get out there, nothing will change. Working on
the basics, working on Baylor things that we normally work on, getting
focused, our main goal.  
  
Q. Odyssey, defensively was that the best half maybe that y'all have had
that first half?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I think so overall as a team. Like coach said, I think we're not
as good defensively as we were last year. But we're picking it up. Coach is
staying on us every day in practice, reminding us it starts with me and
trickles down. When I don't play defense and push the ball, everyone doesn't
do their job.  
I'm trying to do a better job of staying focused, pressuring the ball more,
focusing our team to play better defense.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Your third straight Big 12 tournament title. First time anybody in the
Big 12 has done that. Put that into perspective and where does this one
rank?  
COACH MULKEY: They all rank the same. You got a job to do. These young ladies
completed another part of their goal board. Their goal was to win a Big 12
championship, win a tourney championship, and they've done that. It's fun to
watch them be able to celebrate and do it with a lot of family in the stands.
This is an area that is basically home for most of our players. Those that
don't live in the Metroplex, you had the Florida kids' parents that were here.
It's fun when you can do something like this with those that love you the most
in the stands. It was good to see them win the championship today.  
  
Q. There was about 14 minutes in the first half where Iowa State didn't
score at all. How well did you think you played defense? How many days do you
think you will give the players off?  
COACH MULKEY: I'll give them a couple of days off.  
I thought yesterday Oklahoma State was the story. They needed to be
complimented. But yet in the locker room, I need to go in there and fix some
things that we didn't do that we can do better.  
The turnovers obviously were bad. But I thought our defense was worse than the
turnovers. So we got in the film room last night, and I think you saw a better
defensive effort today.  
Not only did you see the effort, but you saw communication and you saw a team
where all the players were on the same page at the same time on the floor on
the defensive end. When you see that happen, it makes you happy as a coach
because they're all focused and they're listening.  
I just thought that was the biggest difference between yesterday and today.  
  
Q. Was there anything other than yesterday that motivated this team today?  
COACH MULKEY: Probably just the way the game ended. You know, this basketball
team has won a lot of basketball games in the last two years. They're
competitors. Along the way you're going to have bad games. Sometimes along the
way when you have bad games, you lose.  
I didn't let them lose perspective. We won the game yesterday. You know, we
won the game. Yet today, they came back and realized, you know, Coach is
right, we're going to have turnovers sometimes. Teams are going to play very
good against us sometimes. The one thing we got away from was our defense.  
I just think we'll give them those two days off and we're getting back in the
gym and I don't even know if we'll pick a basketball up after that because I
think we need to get back to the fundamentals of what we lost focus of against
Oklahoma State, and that was defense.  
When they saw the film, it doesn't take long to see a talented player go, Wow,
I can't cover that up. That slaps you right in the face when you see them not
down in a stance, I'm not in the passing lane, I didn't help the helper.  
I thought today you saw kids communicating, realizing that, We were bad.
There's nothing worse than looking out there on the floor, when you have that
much talent, and that much talent doesn't play together, they don't play hard,
they don't do all the same things at the right time, it looks bad.  
If the fans in the stands were trying to encourage us from Baylor and help us
get through yesterday, they deserve for us to do a little bit better today.  
  
Q. I know you never show your emotions during a game. After Odyssey hit the
three, her third, she came off, that's the most ecstatic I saw you in a
while.  
COACH MULKEY: Because Odyssey has shared the basketball probably more this
year than she has in her whole career. Her assist‑to‑turnover ratio is off the
charts.  
When you look at a kid that works that hard on the defensive end of the floor,
it's good to see her have an offensive production like that and shoot the ball
well.  
You know, I'm hardest on point guards. I was probably hardest on Odyssey in
that film room last night. Right or wrong, they've got to learn to take it.  
When they have a game like today, you want to share in it with them. It's like
Nay‑Nay Heyden, I was hard on her in the film room. Bubba, she had a good
game. She had those turnovers early. You take her out, but you keep building
her up. This is not the time of year where you just destroy them.  
You want to just give them a sense of, Coach is for me right here, she's just
trying to get something deep within.  
To see Odyssey do that today in front of a lot of people that have watched her
grow up in the Metroplex.  
  
Q. You know the Big 12 better than Brittney and Odyssey do. To win three
titles in a row, 39 games in a row, does it speak to the consistency that the
program has been able to achieve?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I don't know. We've had that epic disappointment along the
way. I'm never going to forget that. Those kind of things motivate us.  
Honestly, I was motivated by some of the things that were written yesterday
and the day before. We've got four kids, three kids in the Metroplex over
here, they should have been written about the last four years. Let's don't
wait till it's a conference tournament. Those are big‑time players we may
never see the likes of on the same team again.  
I'm just selfish enough to think that each of them could have had a story
written about them over here. It takes something like that to always motivate
me to motivate kids. I think Bob Knight has a book out today, The Power of
Negative Thinking. That motivates coaches and players sometimes.  
I'm not into moral victories. Pat those kids on the rear yesterday. They did
win the game. We give headlines like we got beat. We won the game. Those kind
of things motivate kids, motivate coaches.  
I don't take championships for granted. We may never win another one. This may
be our last Big 12 championship. Who knows? But the thing you can't say about
this bunch is that we were talented and never won it all, never won any.  
I think, other than the one little epic disappointment, I think they've had a
great run in the Big 12 and the NCAA tournament, I really do, whether we ever
win another one.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on your win. Best of luck in the post‑season.  
COACH MULKEY: Thanks.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  75  
Iowa State  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're being joined by Iowa State head coach Bill Fennelly and
student‑athletes Nikki Moody and Anna Prins. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, my NASCAR thank you moment. I want to thank the
Big 12 Conference for everything they did. Phenomenal event. City of Dallas,
fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed our time. Wonderful venue. Could not have
been a better student‑athlete experience for all of our players, our fans. So
I appreciate that very much.  
Certainly Baylor played up to their No.1 ranking. When Odyssey Sims and
Brittney Griner go 21‑26, I don't think I don't think the Mavs could have won
tonight. Very proud of our effort, very proud of our team. We're looking
forward to next Monday night and finding out where we get to play.  
I love our team. I love what they're about. I love what they represent. Wish
we could have played a little better tonight. They're a great team and they
played that way.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Nikki, can you describe that play late in the first half when the ball is
sitting up on the rim after your layup attempt.  
NIKKI MOODY: It was just devastating to me 'cause it just sat there for the
longest, then decided to roll out. I was pretty upset about that one.  
  
Q. Anna, can you describe going up against Griner tonight. How well did she
play, what was the feeling of what you could or couldn't do against her?  
ANNA PRINS: Yeah, I mean, it's always a great opportunity to play against
Brittney Griner. Just to see her skill set improve through the last four
years. I felt like she couldn't miss tonight.  
It's been an honor to play against her, and Baylor in general. You know, this
is where we wanted to get to, to play them one last time. Like coach said,
wish we played better. But, you know, we're going to walk out of here with our
heads held high. We have more games to play, so we're really excited about
that.  
Again, just a great opportunity to play against Baylor one more time.  
  
Q. Anna, is maybe the head game more difficult than the physical game
playing against her knowing she's behind you?  
ANNA PRINS: Yeah, I mean, definitely a different kind of a presence when you
know that she's behind you. But I guess that's the fun of the game, is to
figure out strategy, you know, just try to take what she gives you. A lot of
fakes.  
But, you know, again, it's a privilege to play against her. Wish her the best
in her future.  
  
Q. Nikki, how difficult was it to kind of get in an offensive flow,
particularly in the first half? How hard is it to go against Odyssey?  
NIKKI MOODY: She's a very good player and she plays great defense.  
It was mostly just they pressure a lot on the outside, it's harder to pass the
ball exactly where you want to. You have to improvise and do different things.  
You know, it's great playing against her because it's great competition.  
  
Q. Anna, looked like in the second half you basically said, I'm not afraid,
asserted yourself a lot more against her inside. Talk about what went through
your head at that point.  
ANNA PRINS: I guess just the mindset of, We have 20 more minutes to play, what
do we have to lose? I might get blocked five times, but I'm just going to keep
taking it at her.  
I don't know. I was just throwing up threes and they were going in. But I
think just the mindset overall of we have 20 more minutes to play in the
championship game, might as well do what we can and just attack and do our
best.  
  
Q. Big picture, how do you recover from this?  
NIKKI MOODY: We need to learn from it. It was a great game to play in. This is
the kind of games we want to play in.  
We learned a lot tonight as us as teammates and we just have to keep playing
together.  
ANNA PRINS: Yeah, I mean, the same thing what Nikki said. We can always learn
something from every game we play, no matter win or lose. We have more games
to play. We have a little recovery time, find out who we play a week from
today, keep enjoying the ride.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Fennelly.  
  
Q. I remember reading a story a few days ago that you said when you showed
your kids the stats, you took Baylor out of there. Does that kind of make it
easier to put this one behind you, this is a team at a completely different
level than maybe anyone else in the country?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think they are different than anyone in the country. They've
proven that over the last two years.  
You know, it's hard to put it behind you because you lost in a championship
game and you didn't play the way you wanted to play. It is what it is.  
What they did to us tonight they've done to a lot of people over the last two
years. I'm not disappointed at all in the effort of our team. I thought our
kids were great.  
The play in the first half was bad and that's my fault. I take full
responsibility for that. When two All‑American players play that well, we have
a ball sitting on the rim that won't go in, they just throw one up at the end
of the shot clock at the end of the game, it goes in, that's the kind of night
it was.  
They're a great team in every way, shape and form. We did everything we could
to try and stay in the game, but just couldn't do it.  
  
Q. What was the defensive game plan at the outset? Why did you say it wasn't
a good one.  
COACH FENNELLY: We switched a lot of different things. We made some decisions
on double‑teams, guarding people that was a mistake on my part. That's not the
kids' fault. That's my fault.  
  
Q. After yesterday's game, is this kind of what you expected from Baylor?  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, I don't think there's any question that everyone kind of
saw that the bear kind of came out of hibernation kind of thing. I don't say
that any discredit to Oklahoma State. They played really well. When you say,
Baylor woke up, you don't give the other guy credit. But they did. They had a
great focus. They're making shots. They're not throwing the ball over. Their
defensive pressure is very good.  
But I'm sure that was discussed in the staff meeting with the Baylor players
and coaches.  
I told our players, It's going to look like eight of them out there for a
while. And Kidd, one of our freshmen out there said, I think there were nine.
It was kind of one of those nights.  
  
Q. There were a couple moments in the first half you sat down and didn't say
anything. Does a part of you appreciate her greatness during the game at all,
maybe arguably the best player ever?  
COACH FENNELLY: She's the best player I've ever coached against. Yeah, I mean,
the things she does are really special. That's a credit to her coaches. She
makes shots. They do a lot of good things to get her the ball.  
You try a lot of different things. I think we've all tried a lot of different
things and none of them have worked.  
But, no, she's a unique talent, a very special player that's changed the
dynamics certainly not of just Baylor basketball, but our league and the whole
country. I think she'll do great things. I will root for her a lot in the WNBA
and hopefully on the Olympic team. Be very glad that we don't see her again.  
Let's put it this way. I want to rephrase that. We wanted to see her one more
time tonight. I'd like to see her one more time. That would be in the national
championship game. Let's talk about, I guess. Why not, what the heck.  
  
Q. So much is talked about Brittney, and for tremendous reasons. Their
defensive pressure bothered you. How difficult was it even to get the ball up
court into the offense?  
COACH FENNELLY: They're a very good defensive team. Odyssey Sims, I had the
privilege of coaching her a couple years ago. She's the best on‑ball defender
in the country. When you have that kind of on‑ball pressure, and in the back
end of that is Brittney Griner and Jordan Madden, they're defensively
prepared. It's not just throw the ball to the big kid and let her score
points. That's a basketball team that ask things very efficiently at both ends
of the floor. That's why they're so dominating in so many ways.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  77  
Oklahoma State  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey and
student‑athletes Brooklyn Pope and Odyssey Sims. We'll go directly to
questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about just the struggles with the turnovers? I
believe this was a season high 24 turnovers.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I think we just faded a little bit on offense. I think we lead
Oklahoma State's defense beat us up on offense, couldn't get the ball to
Brittney.  
No one took charge. So I felt like we all stood around and was waiting for
that one person to step up.  
  
Q. For both, what was the feeling like of being in a close game? You've only
had a couple of those. Can a game like this help you going forward?  
BROOKLYN POPE: I think it was good for us to a certain extent. I don't like
close games. I like when we win by a large margin.  
I'm just happy we won. We're going to work on some things. I just hope this
helps us.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Close games, it does help us. We needed a game like this. We've
been beating teams by 30‑plus. We've been getting bored out there sometimes.  
Having a close game like this wakes us up. Makes us realize that just because
we're the No.1 team doesn't mean we can't be beat.  
We handled it not as well as we should have, but we'll clean it up and get it
together.  
  
Q. Odyssey, the experience factor when you get in a situation like this.
Talk about how that kind of came through. Then talk about playing for your
third straight Big 12 championship.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I think we didn't play as if we were juniors or seniors tonight.
We had way too many turnovers. Everyone individually had too many turnovers.
We turned the ball over when it was critical that could have lost us the game
if we were playing any other team like UConn or Stanford.  
It's exciting play for the third straight Big 12 tournament championship. I'm
excited. Hopefully we'll win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, y'all had done a pretty good job on Toni Young. What was doing
different today?  
BROOKLYN POPE: I just think Toni Young played at the high post a lot and that
really confused us because she wasn't down there. She crashed the boards from
the high post where we have to block her out versus the last time we just
could find her in the paint. It was kind of difficult with her bringing BG up
so high and running in there full blast to get a rebound.  
I just felt like she did a great job at making us work harder than we have had
to work against her.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, it looked a couple times like you were about to deliver a knock
‑out punch. But Oklahoma State refused to go away. Were you thinking, What do
we have to do to put these guys away?   
BROOKLYN POPE: Yeah. We thought about that. The coaches told us what to do. We
kind of did what they did. When we finally did what they said, it worked out
for the best.  
I just remember thinking, it doesn't matter, it will be a shame if we don't
win. I think once I said that, we played a little bit harder on defense.
Everybody gave a little bit extra effort than what we have been giving.  
I just felt like we kept working hard, because Oklahoma State wasn't going to
die. They want to play for a championship, as well.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, coach called a timeout with three minutes left. What did she
say to you and how important was that three ‑pointer that gave you that
security blanket?   
BROOKLYN POPE: She just told us it's time to play, a couple things to do on
the court. It goes on in the huddle because that's what keeps us going. It's
our secret. We can't tell everybody.  
  
Q. Odyssey, how huge was dictating your tempo onto the game, slowing things
down? What kind of challenges does that present to you as a point guard?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I know that I have a very big role on this team, to lead the
team, be the leader when it gets down to crunch time. I have to kind of take
control.  
I tried to do as best as I could today. Had too many turnovers.  
I understand what I have to do, what I need to do for this team. Coach is not
out there, so I kind of feed off of her from the sideline. I kind of I guess
wouldn't say dictate, but I just play the game as the game goes on.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Kim, from a coaching aspect, what do you feel you get out of a game like
this?  
COACH MULKEY: We'll get in the film room tonight and go over situations, what
we did well, what we did poorly, and move on, move on. Okay? There are no
moral victories. You either won or you lost. We could have very easily lost
today.  
Compliment Oklahoma State, but they still lost. Jim Littell is not going to
come in here and be all excited. Those kids played hard for him today. They
could have very easily won and we could have very easily lost.  
I thought late in the game we had some very uncharacteristic turnovers, which
is a sign that either I've got to do a better job of execution, making sure
the right people have the ball in their hands, or there was a little bit of
losing your composure.  
I think in this game you try to tell players all the time, If you will do
this, good things will happen for you one day. Jordan Madden is the story.
That's who needs to be written about. When she was a freshman and sophomore,
everybody wanted to expose Jordan Madden on Griner's side and not guard her.
She has stayed in the gym more than any of the perimeter starters. She might
have hit the biggest shot of her career today, and it wasn't wide open. It was
a shot clock winding down with people having their hands up. So that's the
story, is Jordan Madden, the one you would have least expected, didn't
hesitate to shoot that shot and make it.  
We'll watch the film, look at things we didn't do well, then move on and get
ready for the next. We will flush it. We will flush it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the leadership of Sims. You can't be on the floor to
make the call, but you saw her maturity level keeping everybody together.  
COACH MULKEY: I thought honestly Odyssey is the one that might have had the
most composure. I was disappointed in a couple of them late. I thought they
became pouty. I thought they didn't show any leadership.  
I never saw Odyssey do that. That's a sign of maturing. She just kept after
it. She had some critical turnovers, and she knows it, late in the game.  
But you learned a few things about a couple of them. I won't put them in that
position again either.  
  
Q. Kim, how tough an out is that Oklahoma State team going to be in the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH MULKEY: I hope tough, tough, tough, tough and tough. I hope everybody in
this league, when they go to the NCAA tournament, I hope we all have success.
I love the league. I love coaching against the coaches in this league because
you see it all. You see great three‑point shooting teams. You see good
defensive teams. You see good coaches that execute to their strengths.  
You've got a team in Oklahoma State that I'm pulling for. I think Jim Littell
has done an outstanding job, and he has very good players that play well
together.  
  
Q. In the second half I noticed that you were getting back on defense. They
scored 12 fast ‑break points. You mentioned getting back on defense was really
important.   
COACH MULKEY: I thought there were three things that Oklahoma State, kept them
in the game. One, our turnovers. Now whether those turnovers were bad
turnovers on our part or because Oklahoma State really caused them, I'll have
to look at the film and see. I do know they have length on the perimeter. In
the 2‑3 zone, we weren't penetrating. When we did penetrate, we were letting
them get touches, deflections and steals.  
I thought there was no transition defense where we stopped the layups. I
thought they made the hustle plays. They got the 50/50 balls. We knew going in
they were an outstanding offensive rebounding team. They proved it again
today. They had almost 20.  
Yes, got to get back in transition.  
  
Q. You talked about struggling to get it inside to Brittney. She scored
about two and a half minutes to go. I'm not sure she touched it after that.
Were they clogging it up in there where you couldn't get her the ball?  
COACH MULKEY: They were in a 2‑3\. They took the forward and they would front
her. They took the inside middle post and they would get behind her.  
Not anything we haven't seen, okay? So I made a decision in a timeout about
four minutes to go that I wanted Odyssey Sims to go on the baseline. Something
that we've never done. I don't even want to call it a mistake. You think with
that many seniors and returning players, I could do an adjustment like that. I
put the ball in Nay‑Nay's hands and I should have never done it. She went out
there and turned it over, turned it over. Keep the ball in the hands of your
point guard, coach, okay?  
The reason I did that, I wanted them to respect Odyssey's ability to shoot the
baseline shot. We never threw it down there. It was like everything I said to
them in the timeout, we were back to that word 'composure.' We didn't have it.  
Again, coaches protect players. I told Nay‑Nay in the locker room, that's on
me. I should have never put you in that position.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Iowa State  79  
Oklahoma  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale and
student‑athletes Aaryn Ellenberg, Morgan Hook, and Joanna McFarland. Coach,
your comments about tonight's game.  
COACH COALE: I can see there's a lot of people that want to talk about this
one.  
You know what, I would say they're a good team. How they're not ranked, I have
no idea. They have perimeter shooters. They have sure‑handed guards. They have
a front line that annihilated us. 56 points from their frontline. They're a
really, really good basketball team and they deserved to win that game.  
They manhandled us on the inside, had great poise on the perimeter, knocked
down open looks. We didn't do the same.  
We didn't come with the same aggression on the interior. We didn't knock down
open shots like they did. They deserved to win the game and have a chance to
play in the championship.  
That being said, I'm really proud of our team. I'm really proud of our
progress this year. I'm proud of our growth. We've got a lot left to play for.
Looking forward to a few days off where we can recover.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, I know you sure had adrenaline and were excited to play in the
semifinals, but did you feel it physically at all that you played last night
such a tough game?  
MORGAN HOOK: We might have felt that, but we shouldn't have come out with that
mentality. It's a mental toughness you have to overcome.  
We started the game without very much rhythm offensively. That's really where
it started.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned their dominance inside. What did you see defensively they
were trying to do to attack you guys? What happened out there?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Their post players are really strong. They have a good mind
about position. So if you let them get deep, they're going to score. That's
the thing is you have to do your work early. As post, that's a big thing on
defense and offense.  
They just really had that in their minds to be aggressive, get us deep. If you
get them deep, they're going to score.  
  
Q. Aaryn, will you be glad for the break you're going to get now?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Yeah, I think it's good for all of us to really recover a
little bit from all this beating that's been going on. That's going to be
great for us. It would have been great to play another day, but...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. I know you played against Anna. This was her career night. What did you
see out of her tonight?  
COACH COALE: Just very aggressive. Lots of offensive rebounds. Lots of
positions deep in the lane. As Jo mentioned, we didn't do a good job of doing
our work early, and post position is everything.  
  
Q. You probably would have had your work cut out given what you went through
to rally last night. Did it make it tough to play a crisp Iowa State team?  
COACH COALE: Well, yeah. I mean, Iowa State, they were really good, and they
are really good. I don't know that I've seen them play any better than they
played tonight.  
We had a little bit to do with that, too. We didn't challenge them the way
that we should have. You know, we started off okay I thought, hit a few shots.
Thought, okay, this is going to be more like us. Then we just went bone dry,
just like last night.  
That's really, really hard to summons that emotion to get back up that hill
again. You need baskets to get some energy, some life, and we couldn't get a
ball to roll in.  
  
Q. How would you break down tomorrow's championship matchup?  
COACH COALE: Baylor's really good. Iowa State's really good. Ought to be a
great Big 12 game.  
Sorry, not where my mind is right now.  
  
Q. When you were in Norman, you sounded hopeful about gathering and
refocusing. Were you encouraged by this weekend in general moving forward?  
COACH COALE: You know, I think this weekend gave us some opportunities that we
will be really, really glad we had in a couple of weeks.  
Everything that you go through, if you approach it in the right way, you can
learn and grow. These guys have done that all year long. It took us till the
end of February to figure out how to be mentally tough together when we're
really tight, when we're really physically worn down, when you face great
opponent after great opponent after great opponent. We figured that out and
put that all together and we were really good against Kansas and really good
against Texas Tech, and really good in the second half last night against West
Virginia.  
This quick turnaround, the great performance by Iowa State today, gave us yet
another level of something to play through. When we get to the first and
second rounds of the NCAA tournament, we'll be better and harder for it. If
handled in the right way, it can be a great thing that happened to us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH COALE: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Iowa State  79  
Oklahoma  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Iowa State head coach Bill Fennelly and
student‑athletes Hallie Christofferson and Anna Prins.  
COACH FENNELLY: Obviously we're ecstatic to be playing tomorrow in the
championship game in the best league in the country.  
Our team, just like yesterday, did exactly what each of them individually need
to do, and that turned into a collective effort by everyone.  
Obviously Anna's performance was one for the ages that will go down as one of
the greatest individual performances by an Iowa State player at a great time.  
Great team effort. All the numbers that we talk about that you quantify,
winning is important, but we were a great team in a great environment and
we're excited we get to play tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Hallie, what can you say about Anna's performance? And, Anna, can you
describe in some words what you were able to do today?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Anna played amazing tonight. That was a great senior
game for her. It really showed what she can do. She's just a great teammate. I
don't know. She's Anna (laughter).  
ANNA PRINS: I don't really know what happened out there. You know, honestly I
don't really care what I did out there. We got the win and we're playing in
the championship game of the Big 12 tournament.  
I think just being a senior, I just never thought I would ever be able to play
in a championship game of the Big 12 tournament. To be able to do it with this
team, what we've been through, just the journey we've taken together, I don't
know, couldn't ask for a better ending.  
I'm just really proud of our team.  
  
Q. Oklahoma had a lot of fight, but you were dominant inside. What were you
able to do to take advantage of them?  
ANNA PRINS: Well, you know, coming into this game, we knew they definitely had
size, boxing out and going to get the ball was important. Obviously we did a
good job of that.  
I think just throughout the game just going and getting the ball every time
was really key. Yeah, rebounding was a big part of the game.  
  
Q. You have been playing against Baylor and Brittney, when they've become
this power program over the years, does that help you approaching tomorrow?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Just another shot at Baylor is something you want to
have. You want to play the best in the league. You just can't let it get into
your head. You have to realize it's another game, it's another team.  
ANNA PRINS: I think we're excited to have another opportunity to play Baylor.
Obviously enjoy this win until tomorrow comes, just prepare for Baylor as best
we can.  
It's the championship game. Just go play.  
  
Q. Anna, was there a point where you could feel it, that you realized
everything you're touching is turning to gold?  
ANNA PRINS: Yeah, I think there were moments. Definitely I was feeling good.
But I think I was just ‑ I don't know ‑ playing the game. Things were really
starting to flow I think for the team as a whole. I was just getting
opportunities, I guess.  
  
Q. Hallie, what can you say about the discipline of this team?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: It helps a lot knowing if we get stops on defense, it
will lead to your offense. That's what we've tried, to buckle down on defense
lately in these games. That's what has helped us to win, definitely.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Yesterday you were talking about your overlooked defense. How big a part
was the interior defense today?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think our defense has been solid all year. It's been the
reason our team is playing at a pretty high level. Our kids are very smart.
They understand.  
We spent 30 minutes in the hotel meeting room walking through a game plan.
They're attentive, they're engaged in what we're doing. The details we stress
are important. I think they've found there's a little pride you can have in
stopping the other guy, too. As a team, we were better at that.  
Our interior defense has certainly been better the last couple weeks. We're
out of foul trouble a little bit. Our positioning is better. We're doing a
little more work before they touch the ball, which is important.  
Oklahoma is as good an offensive team as there is in this league and they
scored 60. We can't complain one bit about the way we're defending.  
  
Q. I know you probably always recruit size. But with a girl like Anna, when
you recruited her, did it have anything to do with Brittney Griner coming into
the league?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, it didn't. We try to recruit the young people that fit the
culture of Iowa State.  
Anna was a unique talent. Anna's game is totally different than Brittney's.
Anna is not a shot‑blocker. At times she's the tallest 2 guard in the country.
We let her shoot threes a lot.  
It wasn't by design, but it adds to the uniqueness of the game that two
players of that height are going to be playing against each other. Four years
they battled each other. Brittney is the most unique player, and I've been
doing this a long time, but she's the most unique player I've ever seen. We'll
be certainly glad that tomorrow night is the last time we coach against her.  
  
Q. Schematically did you do anything differently to get Anna going?  
COACH FENNELLY: We changed the way we were going to run our offense a little
bit. We changed the angles of our screening. We kind of felt like we wanted to
go at either McFarland or Griffin, whichever one was guarding, get them in
foul trouble a little bit. They're like us, not overly deep in the post.  
Anna finished the game last night on a high note. We talked about trying to
get her engaged, more shots.  
You look at 23 assists on 29 baskets, Nikki and Brynn have 15 assists and two
turnovers. So it's a combination of Anna wanting the ball, the angles were
good, and the passes.  
Oklahoma changes defenses a lot, which we don't see that a lot. But I thought
our kids handled that really, really well. For the most part they took care of
the ball, got the ball where it needed to go.  
  
Q. Was that as aggressive as you've ever seen Anna offensively?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know if ever, but it would be on the short list. I
mean, not just in demanding the ball, but she got five offensive rebounds. She
got 20 shots. She scored in traffic. She took the hit, got to the free‑throw
line 11 times. That was as complete a game as I've seen. Defensively that gave
her some momentum, too, because their defense was good.  
Yeah, like I said, I can't remember right now. But I would be hard‑pressed to
say that she's ever played a more complete game, a more aggressive game, and
certainly it came at a great time.  
  
Q. I don't know the history, but that's three wins against Oklahoma in one
season. You have such great respect for that program. What does that say about
your program? Do you remember off the top of your head if you've ever done
that?  
COACH FENNELLY: I'm going to say probably not, but I don't know.  
I have the utmost respect for Oklahoma, the way Coach Coale and her staff do
things. Someone said to me one time our program reminds them of the way
Oklahoma does things, and I take that as a great compliment.  
They play hard. They play right. They're enthusiastic. They care about their
kids. They care about the league. So, yeah, when you beat Oklahoma on the
court, you're doing it the right way. To do it three times certainly is
something that we're very, very proud of 'cause that's a great team, a great
program, one that I'm sure will be a really tough outcome tournament time.  
  
Q. Baylor tomorrow.  
COACH FENNELLY: You had to bring that up, didn't you? I thought we were going
to get out of this relaxed (laughter).  
  
Q. What do you have to do to slow them down? I don't know if you watched the
game earlier today. They turned the ball over a lot. Is that the main focus?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, Baylor's got to help you. They got to turn the ball
over a little bit, miss some shots. Coach Mulkey has to get mad and put
Brittney on the bench a couple times like she did today. She looked like the
rest of us.  
And you've got to make shots. Oklahoma State kept making shots. You hang
around. It's just one of those teams, like I said, that is the most unique
team in our league. They play the game so hard, so physical.  
You're not going to go out there and beat them easily. It's 40 minutes. We
talked on January 23rd when they beat us at our place, we were the first team
that played them twice, we were done with them, and we challenged our players.
Let's play them in the Big 12 championship game. To our team's credit, the way
they've done things, tomorrow night we get to be on the biggest stage in the
country, in the best league in the country, against the best team in the
country. That's a pretty cool day.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  77  
Oklahoma State  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma State head Coach Jim Littell and
student‑athletes Tiffany Bias and Toni Young. Coach, some opening comments.  
COACH LITTELL: Very proud of our basketball team. We went toe‑to‑toe with the
number one team in the nation tonight. I believe we were down by three with 38
seconds to go and they hit a three. Probably had a bad possession when it was
72‑69, a chance to tie it. I would have loved to have that opportunity to put
a little more pressure on them.  
But our group played extremely hard. I thought we played smart, executed very
well. It's something that is a step in the right direction for our program. We
can build off of this. Even though it is a loss, we aren't into moral
victories, but even though it is a loss, it's something we can take forward
the rest of this season and for the years to come, that we can play with a lot
of people.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. If you play like you did today, how far can you get in the NCAA
tournament?  
TONI YOUNG: Our team, we're really athletic. We don't ever give up. I think if
we work as hard as we did now, we can go as long as we work.  
Tonight was pretty obvious. We came and competed with the No.1 team in the
nation. Not that many people came that close to them. If we play like this all
the time, we can make it all the way.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I mean, I agree with Toni. If we play with a little heart and
pride, we can play with anyone in the nation. We had them to three points. It
was our mistakes that led them to an eight‑point difference in the game.  
I think our team can go as far as we want to go.  
  
Q. What was different this time around?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think that's a big pride factor and a lot of heart. You just
have to go out there and play. This is the Big 12 tournament. I think the last
few games we played, we played timid. We're afraid to play defense on Griner.
I think you have to give it all you got and just go out there and play.  
TONI YOUNG: I also think the same thing. Tonight we came out and had fun. You
could see on the court we enjoy each other the whole time. I think that's what
helped give us the confidence. No matter what, we enjoy each other on every
play.  
  
Q. Tiffany, first half you missed 12 or 13 shots. They were up 17. You made
that shot where I'm sure you called bank on the three ‑pointer over Griner. Do
you remember that situation? Just the fact you made that shot, did that seem
to kind of relax everybody?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I don't know about relax. That kind of gave us a little spark
that says, Hey, we can play with them. We weren't playing as hard as we could.
We weren't playing up to our potential.  
I think we all got together as a team and said, Hey, let's get this on and
let's play.  
  
Q. I don't know what you did defensively in the second half, but whatever it
was they were frustrated, they weren't getting easy shots. Nothing like the
first half. I know you're playing hard, but in the middle of that, what are
you doing specifically to slow them down?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think just playing together as a team. Our coaches had a
really good scout for us. They changed on the spot our defenses. They had
different defenses for us to go to. That really helped.  
Just confusing them. I think it got to them when we were close to them
throughout the whole game. I think by trading defenses, just sitting on
Griner, trying to double her, I think that really confused them.  
  
Q. Toni, towards the end of the game, it was a pretty intense moment, you
weren't rallying, you got the ball in and hit a 6 ‑footer over Griner. You had
a smile on your face. What was going through your mind when you hit that shot
over?   
TONI YOUNG: I was having fun. You can't always expect to not to get blocked.
She's 6'8", you're going to get blocked sometimes. You have to take your
chances. I was having fun taking chances.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Jim, that zone, did you do any kind of tweaking it as it went along? You
play zone the same way, most teams can find holes. Were there some adjustments
you made during the game?  
COACH LITTELL: Yes, there was. When we started having some success, getting
some hands on the ball, we kept our forwards down in front. We roped our guard
to the corner. I think that helped us to have a continuous body on Brittney
inside.  
We had a front and a back on her. It worked for the most part. They reversed
the ball late. Was it Madden that hit the three?  
But you've got to give‑and‑take. You can't guard them straight up. That was
the adjustment we made, that we kept the fronts with our 3s and 4s on their
respective sides, roped the guards to the corner. It helped us get a lot of
hands‑on balls.  
Brittney Martin was very active, our freshman, got a lot of feels during that
comeback. We kind of did that on the fly. I'm proud of our team. They listened
in the timeout, made some nice adjustments.  
  
Q. How much do you think you help your seed today, given your performance
here?  
COACH LITTELL: I think we've helped our seed going and being in the game at
Iowa State with a minute to go, very difficult place, then coming and getting
a win on a team that we lost twice to. To play the No.1 team in the country,
we're down one possession with 38 seconds to go. I think the Selection
Committee is going to look at that, that this is a team that has gotten better
as the year progressed. They look at how you're playing before you go into the
tournament.  
I think we really helped our cause today.  
  
Q. Talk about the emotions, what you were telling your players to keep them
in this game.  
COACH LITTELL: You know, we were down by 9 about eight or nine minutes to go,
and we came into a timeout. I told our team, Let's change our mindset right
now. Let's change our mindset from playing them close and being respectable to
thinking about going and winning this thing.  
I felt like our team really responded to that. They got excited. You know,
you've got to have some luck on your hand. You've got to do a lot of things
right. You've got to make shots. But to beat them, you've got to believe that
you can.  
I think the last nine minutes, our team, whether it be smart or not, believed
they could win the basketball game.  
You know, I'm proud of 'em. I thought we played with no fear. I believe
there's a lot of teams that have a fear factor when they play Baylor.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fear factor. Obviously you've seen Baylor a lot the
last couple years. Gary Blair talked about how when he beat Baylor in 2011, he
played them seven times in 13 months. They're clearly good. Do they become
less scary the more you're on the court?  
COACH LITTELL: I don't think they become less scary. I didn't sleep at all
last night, knowing what it was going to be like.  
They're a great ballclub. We played them really well at Stillwater and played
awful well and lost by 18 or 19, but we didn't make shots. You've got to hit
some shots.  
We did a lot of positive things today. We had 19 offensive boards against
them. We had 17 steals, as well. So there were a lot of pluses out of today's
game.  
We got 20 more shots at the basket than they did. You do those things, you're
going to have a chance.  
The one thing that I regret is we gave them too many and‑one's, but that's
going to happen with them. When you go to double Griner, somebody is open on
the backside, kind of pick your poison at times.  
There were a lot of pluses. 19 assists. Forcing 24 turnovers out of Baylor.
There was a lot more good out of this game today than bad for us.  
  
Q. Through Brittney's years, can you talk about what you've seen her
improving all the way to her senior year?  
COACH LITTELL: She's gotten better every year. She's added dimensions to her
game where she can step outside and shoot it. She's a prolific scorer,
shot‑blocker.  
But what people don't realize is how great a passer she is, how she enables
her other teammates to be better. By what you have to do to stop her, it
enables her other teammates to be better. I'm not taking anything away from
their other players. They've got McDonald's All‑Americans across the board.  
She just allows them to play a different way, an unconventional way. On the
wings, they can get up and guard on the wrong side because they know that
she's back there. They can take chances. They can gamble because they know
she's back there.  
I've said it numerous times, I think she's the best player in the history of
the game, and she continues to get better. Credit their coaching staff. She's
progressed each and every year and taken her game to new levels.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and best of luck in the post‑season.  
COACH LITTELL: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  79  
Kansas State  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. We'll go directly to questions for our
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, you're one assist away from a triple ‑double. You're a great
scorer, rebounder. Is there some attribute that we don't know about?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: They tell me I'm a point guard at heart.  
I guess I kind of developed it over the years, just finding my teammates.
Personally, I had a lot of turnovers. My assists weren't really too good. But
now they're better and my teammates do a great job of cutting and letting me
find them.  
  
Q. Odyssey, obviously you came back in, but went out for a little bit with
the ankle. How is it now?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I twisted it when I was playing defense. Kind of went the wrong
way.  
I'm okay. It's nothing major to worry about.  
  
Q. Is that easy as it looked?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: No. I thought we played with a lot of energy. I thought we
knocked down the shots that were given to us. I thought we played smart on
offense and defense, looked for the open person.  
Only so many players that Kansas State can guard. If they put three on
Brittney, Brittney does a great job of passing it out.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm going to jump on Destiny's answer and agree with
everything she said.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I'm just going to say, we came out with more intensity. When
they came to our house, they hit a lot of threes. We tried to cut back on
that. We communicated more, buckled down and really focused on our defense
tonight.  
  
Q. Brittney, were you aware you were that close to the triple ‑double?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: They kind of put it in my ear at the end, that I was close.  
But, I mean, I didn't just try to get those two assists or anything. They told
me about it, though.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you mentioned the three ‑point shooting in the last game.
Defensively you forced them to take mostly three‑pointers. Was that a focus
for you guys?   
ODYSSEY SIMS: Well, K State is a very good three‑point shooting team. We know
they shoot a lot of threes.  
We just tried to do the best we could defending them. Like coach told us in
the locker room, she said, They're going to hit threes, but we just got to cut
down and not let them make as many as we did last time when we played them
Senior Night.  
  
Q. Destiny, 20 points for you. You started off 16 ‑18 from the floor. Talk
about the early start for you guys, getting off on a good foot.   
DESTINY WILLIAMS: They didn't play Brittney one‑on‑one like they did at home.
So they triple teamed her, double‑teamed her. I thought we did a great job by
feeding off her. She did a great job of passing us the ball when we were open.
I thought that gave us energy in defending the three. We had great intensity
on defense which let the offense to be good.  
  
Q. For all three of you, do you like playing in American Airlines as opposed
to Kansas City?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I like them both, as long as we play and win.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Yeah, I mean, as long as we win, it really doesn't matter.
It's close to a lot of our fans to get here easier. It really doesn't matter.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It really doesn't matter. If it was in Kansas City, the fans
would still be there. As long as we get to play, no matter what gym, location,
as long as we get to play.  
  
Q. Odyssey, how important was it to get off to a fast start and basically
never look back?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Very important. When we played them Senior Night, we didn't
start off like we should have. Didn't have no intensity. We were just kind of
out there.  
Coach got on us, we buckled down in practice. We focused, came out, knew what
we had to do. We had a game plan from the jump. I think everybody was more
focused on what they needed to do individually and understood their roles.
Everyone did that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations on the win. We'll
see you tomorrow.  
Coach, we'll continue with questions for you.  
  
Q. I thought I heard you tell Brittney pretty early, Score first, pass
second. Were you telling her that? Was there a reason for that?  
COACH MULKEY: When you go past the foul line, I just have a philosophy you
can't be down in that paint area looking to pass first, because if you do,
you're going to turn it over.  
Look to score first, then the pass will present itself. I just thought she was
catching the ball and looking to be passive more than aggressive. The pass
will come. You saw that tonight with nine assists. No different than if it's
Odyssey and those guys cross the foul line, you go to score first, pass
second.  
  
Q. Do you prefer the 50 ‑point Griner night or do you like that she can do
either?  
COACH MULKEY: It only matters to me if you win. Kids are happy. They played
better defensively. The difference from a week ago is that we communicated
better on the defensive end of the floor. We switched. We never allowed them
to dribble penetrate and us get sucked in, they kick out and hit all the
three‑pointers.  
I thought that every position on the floor we guarded. We had post players
guarding point guards. We tried to do that in Waco last week and we weren't
very good. I thought our defense actually was bad.  
I thought today we set the tone with switching, communicating on the defensive
end of the floor.  
  
Q. You didn't know you were playing K State till Friday night. Seemed like
in the first half you had their number defensively. How pleasing was that to
see?  
COACH MULKEY: It was rewarding because sometimes late in the year when you
have this many seniors, they hear you but they don't listen. Kind of like your
own children at home. I hear you, mama, but I'm going to do it anyway.  
From last week until today, it was put in their head, Switch at the point of
attack on all positions. I just thought it was good to have them all on the
same page. When they did that the first five minutes of the game, I knew that
they had listened and I knew that they realized giving up 14 threes at our
place last week, yeah, you won by 22, and Griner got 50 and she dunked. It was
a sold‑out arena.  
But truly, if you want to really be good, you got to be better defensively.
And I just didn't think we were very good. Part of that was because we didn't
practice the day before when we played K State at our place because we just
needed a day off. We had just gotten back from West Virginia.  
I thought today they listened to the scout report. They listened in the film.
It was fun to see that today.  
  
Q. Your team has a lot of star power, Brittney, Odyssey, Destiny, Brooklyn
Pope. Seems they play unselfish, which is rare when you have that much star
power on a team. Is that something that is being taught?  
COACH MULKEY: I appreciate you asking that question.  
My starting five and six may not be the top 15 players in this league, but
once again, they weren't voted. I had two players voted in the top 15 in the
league. C'mon, guys. C'mon, now. You got teams that had three in the top 15,
and we went 40‑0 last year, back‑to‑back undefeated.  
I appreciate you congratulating me on Coach of the Year, but take that and
give these kids their due. How can Jordan Madden not be voted one of the top
defensive players in the league. Why? Because she played on a team with Griner
and Simms? Give her her dues.  
They came to Baylor four years ago to win a championship. Every one of them
knew who was coming. They didn't go somewhere else because they were afraid of
minutes being taken away. They're going to leave Baylor with the best record,
wins and losses, of any team I ever coached. They're going to leave with a
40‑0 record. They're going to have a possibility to win another championship.  
So those individual honors, while I don't ever understand them, they don't
mean a lot to these kids. Brittney would give all her trophies to them, look
at the players, Do you want one of these? You didn't come to Baylor so you're
not getting one.  
It's about the rings, it's about championship. It's what I appreciate most
about Brooklyn Pope and Destiny Williams, they share time at the 4, yet they
make us successful. When you look at Niya, Jordan Madden. They all accept
their role, they play their role, and they know their value to this basketball
team. I won't ever forget it. I won't ever forget what they accomplished and
their unselfishness.  
  
Q. Sticking to the side of the defense, holding K State to 29% field goal
range, 33% three ‑pointers. I noticed during the game you had Brittney Griner
playing outside the paint. Can you talk about your defensive schemes. Was this
prepared for Kansas State or is this ongoing?  
COACH MULKEY: We don't switch a lot on defense. I'm a man‑to‑man coach. I
don't switch a lot.  
But when you play a Kansas State type of offense, they require you to make
adjustments. Because they spread the floor at all positions, there are five
guards basically out there and they all can shoot the three. We had to make
changes. Our change was switch at every position, even away from the ball. A
lot of times you'll switch on ball. But away from the ball, keep your digs as
close to the rim as possible. We just switched at every position. I thought it
was very effective today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on the win. We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

IOWA STATE  77  
KANSAS - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts about tonight's game?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Ended up like it was a their place, deep post‑ups and the
contested threes in transition and executed and we didn't answer the run. And
tried to come out of the locker room and cut it to single digit, cut back the
lead from eight to four and didn't do that.  
And we didn't finish at the rim. We thought we competed and played hard and
showed some toughness, not enough. On their end, they won the battle there.
But we tried to front and get over the top, and to do that you have to be able
to press the ball and they started ripping, driving us a little bit and tried
score at the rim and get to the free throw line and obviously didn't knock
them down.  
  
Q. Yesterday, it just seemed like it was a lot more difficult today how they
defended you and playing against Brynn Williamson.  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Well, it's just kind of like what they tried to do at their
place. They tried to box in, they tried to pin and they tried to stab and they
did everything to just clog it up inside. That's just what teams are going to
do. They are going to challenge you and make you want to kick it out and make
you hit perimeter shots, so once that happens, you've got to knock them down.  
  
Q. Carolyn, they are so big inside, how difficult is it to stay with that
and defend so many big girls down there?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: They have a tough front line, 6‑0, 6‑3, 6‑3, it's a challenge
for our guards to guard in the post. And that's one of our game plans, like
Coach said, to get close coming in front and at times we did that and we
slowed them up, and when we didn't, they capitalized on that.  
  
Q. If you can both talk about Now waiting for the NCAA decision and how
difficult that's going to be this next week, the pins and needles I guess
you're on.  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Well, just like Coach said, we are not so sure what's going to
happen but we have got to stay positive, look forward, keep practicing and get
better, because more than likely we want to still play.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I mean, I think she said it all. We don't know, we think we've
had some great wins, and we are kind of in the same position we were last
year, we'll just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. When you're making a defensive game plan, do you focus more on Poppens or
Christofferson, or how do you go about approaching that in that sense?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, with Christofferson playing multiple positions, you
have guards defending her on a post‑up, and then bigs trying to send her on
the perimeter. And with Poppens, it's just how physical she is and the pace
that she plays at; we tried to front inside; we didn't do it.  
Certainly a little bit into the game, Chelsea got sat on and came in. Which is
what it was like at their place, and we tried to get around and force a
tougher pass; and at times we did it and then it turned into some late line
drives and opportunities at the rim.  
We thought both kids, the pace that they did play at, we have great respect
for that. And Chelsea has had a great career at Iowa State and has a lot left
to do in her career. The pace that she plays on her post and the pace that she
plays on her rip and drive, great offensive rebounder, leading ‑‑ will finish
her career all‑time leading offensive rebounder in Big12 play.  
She's not jumping out of the gym to do that, and I say that with great
respect. She does that by being physical and embracing that you can be a great
rebounder not, you have to be at the rim. Most of those are not up there
anyway‑‑ they are guys that work to get their shots in the air.  
  
Q. How much do you follow the whole NCAA bracket stuff? Do you have an idea,
a sense of whether you should be in or not?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Of course I think we should be in. I thought the committee
made a great decision last year and I thought we made them look real smart. I
think we should be. We play the best teams in the best league in America.  
I said going in, I think what's hard is people think because we all beat each
other up‑‑ we are a great league and we have one team ranked maybe two and we
deserve better than that as a league. Outside, a lot of people don't
understand how good the league is and how competitive it is.  
We talked about it for the last two years, it's a one‑possession league and
it's a fast league and we certainly think that if you look at our body of work
that we have got quality wins and an opportunity.  
We are excited about the opportunity and certainly like you said, on pins and
needles, because this tournament is a week earlier; it was only a four‑day
sweat‑out last year. This year it will be a little longer. Angel is right, in
the meantime, we have to be better and when we play again we'll be better.  
  
Q. You talked about the matchup problems Christofferson poses for you, but
she seems to be on a huge roll.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, she gets the two ‑‑ two threes in transition‑‑ because
we are not matched up. We are not matched up. So the guy that's chasing her is
on the other side of the floor, because that's her matchup. And Angel is
running at me, and I know Angel is not going to have Christofferson on the
make, because our matchups ‑‑ they are true and we don't communicate ‑‑ and
break down and make you pay. We have two guys guarding one guy; and she's
close enough to me I might have been able to get out there and knock it down
probably but that probably might have looked bad on TV.  
Yeah, we don't match up but she knocks that downuncontested. From a field goal
percentage, three‑point field goal percentage she leads them‑‑ when she has
someone in her face, let alone wide open.  
And then that is such a momentum play. Watch their bench when they hit a
three. Everybody gets juiced up off of that, and that's why 10,000 people
watch them play, they get excited about that.  
  
Q. Nobody has really given Baylor a tough gamein the conference season ‑‑  
COACH HENRICKSON: Oh, really‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ they were Tweeting that we were
the only team that held them under something‑something‑‑ didn't he Tweet
that‑‑  
  
Q. I thinkhe did ‑‑  
COACH HENRICKSON: ‑‑ yeah, I think he did, ask them about it.  
  
Q. This is the league showcase ‑‑ if they play like that, do you think they
can give Baylor a quality game?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, I said it all along, when they beat them up ‑‑
inaudible ‑‑ first of the year, they made 17 threes. I think that's what's got
to happen. I think it's got to be double‑digits threes; not that she doesn't
impact that part of it, it's not like she does in the paint.  
Like I'm watching film on them and I think they are posting Poppens because
Britteny is guarding Prins at the three. Prins throws a little curl pass on
the block, Gardner is fighting the pass and then goes and blocks the post‑up
from behind. So she impacts and she can impact from the three to the block.  
So I think they are as suited as anybody for an upset because of the makeup of
how they score. They can score inside, but those guys can also score from the
three‑point line and I've said that all along. I mean, 17 threes at Iowa
State‑‑ Brittney's freshman year is when they beat them.  
  
Q. You said you want to get better for the tournament; what do you want to
focus on?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, defensively, we were better last night. We have got to
be better on interior defense, got to improve. Part of the interior, that's
ball pressure, too, we have to clean that up. We give too much up to the rim.
We have to bring some help. Force some lower percentage shots.  
Those are things, you go back to the breakdown, you get to this time of the
year, so much scouting report defense and you have to get down and do some
break down defensive things more; not that we don't do anything, but we have a
chance to work on that and clean some things up.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

IOWA STATE  77  
KANSAS - 62

  
COACH FENNELLY: Very proud of our team. I thought we played with very good
energy from start to finish against a very good Kansas team, who without
question I think deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament.  
I thought in the second half, our two all‑conference players played like it.
Our senior, Anna Prins, played like it. When you only turn the ball over two
times in the second half and defend like we defended, you're going to beat
some people.  
So it's exciting for us to be in the semifinals and we are honored that Iowa
State go to move to the right in the bracket.  
  
Q. Hallie, can you talk about the first couple minutes, looked like, I don't
know if it was jitters but you turned the ball over six of the first seven
possessions, what clicked, especially with you when you went on that scoring
run?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: I think once we started hitting shots, everybody got a
little more energy. We took care of the ball like we needed to. Just we fed
off of each other and that's what you have to do to win games. Every game you
come out, there might be some nerves just because it's March, but you play
through it and you get there.  
  
Q. Was there a sense of motivation being senior year; you had a 24 and 14,
one of your better games of the season; what went into that?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Just the fact that this is my last season at Iowa State and I
won't have the amazing teammates that I have had this year. Why not take
advantage of that, like we have Hallie, who is draining the 3s. I mean, just
take advantage of it.  
  
Q. How do you explain the offensive efficiency for you guys, you seemed to
have it going, what was the biggest key behind that?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Like I said, once we hit one shot, everybody just
spread their energy around and got that confidence that they see the ball
going in the basket, that they can do the same thing.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you talked yesterday about the whole senior leadership dynamic,
when things were not going well, you stepped up, you hit a shot, actually a
couple shots right there early, did you think that got everyone going, and is
that kind of one thing you were thinking to yourself, that it's on you ‑‑  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Yeah, kind of. I knew as soon as one of us started making
shots, the rest would follow. We have like a tremendous amount of trust in
each other, and just to get the ball rolling and everything like started to
click, and it all fell together.  
  
Q. What can you say about your defense, Angel Goodrich, she got some points
‑‑ but dribble shooting a little bit, Brynn and Nikki were really on her.   
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, B has really buckled down a little bit, she's our
defensive stopper and she took it upon herself to shut down the best player
and she did. Give a lot of credit to her.  
  
Q. How much confidence do you have as a team right now and why do you say
that?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, there's a tremendous amount of confidence on our team
right now. We know what each one of us is capable of, and we have shown it
throughout the season. And just to have that trust amongst each other, we can
do anything if we set our minds to it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending against Angel, who had such a huge game
yesterday, and also seems like they got frustrated somewhere along the way
there.  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, our team is probably‑‑ we have probably never gotten
a lot of credit for the way we defended because we don't turn you over and we
don't steal the ball. But our kids have embraced that from the start and Brynn
has embraced the idea of being someone that wants to guard someone.  
We did a pretty good job on Davis. And the first half Pop was really good and
I thought an in a played really real little well the second half. She
struggled the second half, but the way she rebounded and defended to have
another bigger, stronger body to put on her made it tough. We tried to
double‑team her early, and that was a bad coaching decision. It didn't work
out very well.  
But you know, the other kids did a good job, and you know, they are a team
that can score a lot of points, and they have been scoring points. So to hold
them to 62 was good and certainly a defensive effort that was consistent, kept
them off the free throw line. Did a better job rebounding the second half,
kept them off the boards.  
Those are the kinds of things you have to do all year, but you'd certainly
better do them in March or you don't get to keep playing.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Hallie; but do you how explain the offensive
efficiency when the turnovers hurt and the shooting and quality shots are
there?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think the first four minutes, we were really nervous. You
could tell. I mean, they were trying to get into the flow of the game and I
don't think we got a shot for three minutes.  
But you know, we had 12 turnovers at halftime, and we did not have another
turnover until about three minutes to go in the game. Pop had one and then
Kidd had the charging foul with 20 seconds left.  
I thought Nikki was really good at not making any bad decisions; let the game
come to her a little bit. She had four turnovers at halftime, and none the
second half with someone in her grill the whole time.  
Our spacing was much better the second half. I think when Pop and Anna started
to hit the ball in the post and we could seep our spacing, there was enough
three‑point shots available to dictate some good looks.  
We are really, really smart with the ball. We had illegal screens in the first
half; we had a three‑second call; we had a push‑off on a dribble. You know,
you've got to get rid of that stuff, and I think our team did that. And the
way Nikki dictated our offense was a big reason we didn't turn the ball over.  
  
Q. I was about to ask you about Nikki, her last trip to Texas was not so
hot. She seemed like she could get to the basket whenever she wanted to and
that really set up a lot of stuff for Anna and Pop.  
COACH FENNELLY: It did. Nikki has got a good explosive bounce, and when they
tried to get up into her, we changed the angle of the ball screens a little
bit. Historically KU has not come off the shooters when we drove to the
basket, and so when that happened and they stayed on our shooters that opened
up the middle of the court a little bit more, and she got to the rim a couple
times, dumped it on our post players a couple times.  
When she can get that going and going, north and south towards the rim; the
first half, she made some bad decision, charging foul, tried to create some
things that weren't there and like the rest of us, trying to play a little too
fast.  
But the game kind of slowed down in front of her, and like a quarterback: All
of a sudden, everybody's open and who do you throw the ball to. It seemed like
the game was right in front of her. At halftime, she goes, "What am I
missing."  
I said: "You're fine. Don't try and make a play before you see the play." And
I thought she was really good.  
  
Q. What is the confidence level and what do you find to harp on them after
this one?  
COACH FENNELLY: I can always find something, you know me.  
I think the confidence level is high, and Pop said it and our team has said
it. It is the easiest team that I've had to manage in a long time. They like
each other. They get along. They appreciate each other. Lindsay is sitting
here‑‑ kind of like when Lindsay was a senior, her team. Those teams are
special.  
What we have tried to do as coaches is make sure the players understand this
is a special time in their life. These things don't happen and it may not
happen for some of them in their personal life and their business life. This
is something that is really truly a moment in time that you don't want to
waste. And.  
I think they appreciate that and they understand that and they all accept the
roles on their team, and they want and honestly care about playing with each
other, for each other. Those are all important things and this group is that
way, and we are skilled enough and just deep enough at certain spots that we
can be a decent team, as well.  
  
Q. If I remember correctly, you had a few reservations about moving out of
Kansas City, from the early impressions, looks like your fans turned out in
force today.  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't like the tournament suffering, I don't and I get in
trouble for saying, this just like I get in trouble at home for things I say
and do. Nothing to do with Dallas; great city, great arena, the hotel is
beautiful, the people are fantastic and we love coming here.  
But personally, and I'm not speaking for the university, I'm speaking for me,
I like the fact that our men's and women's teams are together. But, just like
at home, my opinion doesn't matter sometimes (laughing).  
But it has nothing to do with Dallas. I love it. It's a great place; for the
kids to play in an NBA arena, the hospitality, the way the setup is, it's been
fantastic. The Big12 does an amazing job of the way they treat the student
athletes, this is as big‑time as it gets, and they are treated that way. And
the people of Dallas have certainly embrace that had and we certainly
appreciate it.  
The fans have turned out in big margins for all teams and I'm sure there will
be a good crowd tomorrow.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  79  
Kansas State  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Kansas State. Coach, would you like to make
some opening comments.  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, unfortunately for us we got off to such a slow start in
the first half against a great basketball team and let them get rhythm and get
on a roll. I thought our defense led to some passive play early in that game
on the offensive end. It just took us forever to begin to feel even remotely
comfortable offensively in that first half. Kind of like being in the middle
of a buzz saw.  
Once we got down, as well as they were playing, it became a real climb for us
to get ourselves back in this basketball game.  
I am proud of how we competed in the second half. I thought we continued to
fight hard. Just didn't have enough play‑making today to be able to get the
job done.  
But I'm proud of the fact that our team continued to battle as hard as they
could, I thought. If not smart and not well every possession, we still fought
hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Brittany.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about last time you played Baylor, Brittney Griner
scored 50. You played her a completely different way this time. Is there any
way to get around that presence?  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: I think that for our team, it's a bit more of a struggle
than most teams because our tallest player is 5'10". There's only so much you
can do. She's a great player.  
I think the key for us is trying to be as physical as possible, trying to get
her as far away from the basket as possible. It does obviously present a huge
challenge for our teams that teams with a little more height would be able to
guard her a little bit better or differently.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first five or six minutes, what it was like on the
court. It seemed like Baylor piled on. Pretty tough to come back from there.  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: Yeah, coach said in the locker room they were on a mission.
They turned it up a notch. We just played one week ago. From then it's a
different team even.  
I think they see us all season. They have a goal and they're going to get
there. You can tell all their players are dialed in. They came at us hard
right away.  
  
Q. How about on the offensive end, you finished with nice numbers, but...  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: I don't think we were playing very fast. A lot of standing
around. We let them attack us in every aspect of the game and were very
passive.  
Not taking open shots when we had them, but really didn't get a ton of open
ones because we weren't creating them for ourselves.  
Just not being smart. Not playing how we did a week ago against them or even
against Texas yesterday. Just looking a little sluggish, and that's going to
hurt you, especially against a team like Baylor.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let you return to the locker room and continue with
questions for coach.  
  
Q. You were calling time ‑outs like crazy in the first half. Is that kind of
a helpless feeling when you have to use one after the another to stem the
tide?  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, against a team like Baylor, it's almost like it was a
dragster, a drag race. They just busted out so hard and so aggressive and so
fast. We were just trying to stem the tide a little bit, hopefully make a
couple adjustments quick so we didn't lose confidence and stay aggressive.  
It was a game in which you wished you had 10 time‑outs, if you could use five
in each half, to break the tempo a little bit, especially early. They came out
of the chute so hard.  
  
Q. On Monday you kept it close enough in the first half that you had the
chance in the second half. It did seem like you were hitting some shots in the
second half. Was it that early stumble that kept you out of it?  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, the first 20 minutes, I think it was like that perfect
storm almost. We were out there in the middle of the ocean, and all of a
sudden it was. It's like, Oh, my goodness. That really had us swamped under.  
But, again, I still felt, and I know our team felt like, we can be better, we
can draw this game tighter. In spite of all the our efforts accordingly, it
was just too much to overcome.  
So, yes, I think that initial burst, that strength they brought to the floor
in the big sense of the overall game, was more than we could compensate for.
But you certainly compete the second 20 as though you want to be in the
basketball game. And there were elements of our game we improved
statistically.  
We made improvements relative to us. We just didn't make improvements relative
to the score itself in the end.  
  
Q. Brit talked about drawing Griner away from the basket. You weren't able
to take advantage of that. That's just kind of the kids on the floor have to
be able to spot it?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, that was the difference today. When it came to making
those basketball decisions, on the offensive end, exploiting any advantage
that we might be able to create, we played a little bit hurried up. We didn't
quite connect. We weren't quite at that basketball IQ peak that we needed to
be in order to exploit. We played a little panicky. I think that was the
initial onslaught, got us on our heels a little bit.  
We were definitely staggered. I feel like I'm using a lot of analogies. But
it's like when you get hit with a really hard punch and you're trying to get
yourself back. I felt like we played a lot of minutes the first half that way
where we were trying to get our wits back about us.  
In order for us to be successful, we really have to be making quality plays
together, using our basketball IQ, our spacing, and our decision making has to
be on the button.  
Tonight it wasn't because they hit us with a really hard punch early.  
  
Q. You're used to playing this tournament pretty close to home. How is it
traveling a little further south?  
COACH PATTERSON: Everyone has been extremely gracious, kind and professional.
Our experience here has been a top‑drawer experience across the board.  
To me the emphasis is all about the energy of the tournament and the quality
of the resources and facilities and the kindness of the people. It's been
extraordinarily positive from our perspective.  
In spite of the score and the last 40 minutes, it's been a great experience
for us here in Dallas.  
  
Q. Obviously the season probably ends here.  
COACH PATTERSON: No. I think we should definitely have seven teams in the NCAA
tournament, without question. I think it would be a shame to the game if they
don't take seven teams from the Big 12. So hopefully we will be playing in the
WNIT, but...  
  
Q. Talk about the season with all the injuries, all the stuff, what do you
take away from that season?  
COACH PATTERSON: Oh, we've had so many things to learn. I think there's been a
lot more responsibility placed on players that wouldn't necessarily have been
filling those roles young ‑ responsibility, not just playing time.  
I think we've learned a lot about what resilience and toughness is all about,
what competing and working to find a way to win at this level is all about.
The character of our young people was tested, and I think they learned a lot
about the strength they have inside.  
So, you know, all seasons present challenges. This one had a few particulars
for us. But I think there were all kinds of positives that in terms of
individual growth for these young people, you know, they experienced because
of the adversity.  
I hope it really inspires us to be a tougher, better basketball team a year
from now as we go through the extreme adversity of losing Brittany Chambers
and Mariah White, one of the top five players ever in the history of Kansas
State is walking out the door. That is adversity, as well.  
Hopefully we'll adjust to that.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments.  
COACH PATTERSON: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

OKLAHOMA  65  
WEST VIRGINIA - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the win.  
COACH COALE: Thank you very much. I am incredibly proud of our team. These
guys are just a bunch of believers. They just believe. They believe they are
supposed to win. They believe they are going to win. They are not always sure
how it's going to happen but they just play hard enough that they put
themselves in a position to have a shot at it.  
They made big plays down the stretch. Lots of poise in the final five minutes
of the game. Great energy to mount the comeback. Just effort plays everywhere
and our defense in the second half was obviously completely different than our
defense in the first half. So I'm really, really proud of them.  
  
Q. Seemed like about ten minutes in that second half, you guys were going to
do something tonight and with Ellenberg, you were leading the charge?  
NICOLE GRIFFIN: I mean, we just made a decision. Coach told us in the timeout
before that, or many time‑outs before in the second half, that we just have to
make the decision that we are going to win this game, and that's what we did.
And obviously Joanna got a lot of rebounds and I did, too. Everybody was a
part of that but we just decided that we're going to win.  
  
Q. Nicole and Aaryn, a couple times in the second half, you worked on that
touch ‑pass underneath where you got it to Aaryn, is that something you work
on regularly or you just have the size advantage and you took advantage?   
AARYN ELLENBERG: It's one of the regular plays we use and it tends to work a
lot so we just kind of went to that on in‑bounds and it paid off.  
  
Q. Sharane, what's going through your head when you miss that first free
throw?  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: A lot of things. A lot of things. But I have to calm myself,
and I'm like, okay, I have got another ten, and I have to redeem myself right
now. I have to just believe it. Before we left Norman, Coach gave us a mustard
seed; all you need is faith the size of a mustard seed and you can make it. I
had four more tastes (ph) of the mustard seed, but just playing the pass, even
though it happened a couple of seconds, just wanting to be that person to help
win.  
  
Q. Aaryn, besides the mustard seed, where else did this belief come from,
this faith, this feeling that you guys are going to overcome somehow?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It's just a belief in each other. We have so much confidence
and love for each other, it just spews out to other people. It's really just
believing in ourselves in general and our teammates.  
  
Q. You've been part of some great games in the past few years, where does
this rank, coming back from a 22 ‑point deficit to win?  
COACH COALE: I told them we had been down 27 at the half before and come back
and won, and there's no reason why we couldn't. At halftime I thought we were
down 17. I come out, we're down 19, make that first basket, and I'm like, wait
a minute, geez, it was worse than I thought.  
There was a time‑out early in the second half where just pounded into their
belief system, they were playing in the play that just occurred instead of
being in the moment that they were in, and I just tried to get their attention
for what was at stake. And their response, that ranks pretty high. The final,
I don't know, 15, 16 minutes of that game, pretty special.  
I can't say it was beautiful basketball, but it was pretty gritty and pretty
special, because those kids just absolutely refuse to lose.  
  
Q. You beat this team at home but the last time you played them in February
there, almost a 20 ‑point win there. How do you prepare a team from this type
of game when you lost to them last time like this?  
COACH COALE: Well, obviously the first half was like the game in Morgantown.
The second half was like the game in Norman. Their pressure can really take
you out of what you want to do, and it can speed you up and that's what
happened to us.  
The same thing happened when we played them in Morgantown. We came out and we
scored easily with some pressure relief stuff right off the bat and suddenly
we just hit a lull.  
Tonight it was because we missed some open shots and then we didn't get back
in defensive transition and all of a sudden it was a snowball. We felt at
halftime that there was a specific thing that we could change and that is
defensive transition.  
Another thing is early in the second half, at that critical time‑out, we also
changed the way we were guarding ball screens which helped significantly and
we were able to keep the ball in front and contain them a little deeper in the
shot clock. I think we knew what we were getting into and we knew the physical
way they played. It's one thing to know about it and prepare for it, and it's
another thing to get out there and handle it. It's hard to simulate.  
  
Q. The defense in the first half to second half, was that a change or more
execution on your team's part in the second half?  
COACH COALE: Much better communication. Much better communication, especially
in transition. Not as many turnovers, which cut down on the number of
transition opportunities, as well.  
But the ball screen coverage was really the only real adjustment until about
the final six minutes when we tried to play no catch on Caldwell and Palmer.  
  
Q. I know you are still relishing the victory, but given the amount of
energy expended, any concern about coming back tomorrow afternoon against Iowa
State?  
COACH COALE: You know what, it's postseason, and I don't worry about that at
all.  
People have been asking us, are you worried about playing a couple of games in
a row, because only eight players on scholarship‑‑ you know what in 2004, we
played four games to win the Big12 Championship in Dallas, and that was not
the most impressive part. The most impressive part was every single one of
those kids danced on the bus from Dallas to Norman.  
So, seriously, like, they are tired? Are you kidding me? It's important. They
will be ready to play.  
  
Q. It's typical where a team facing a deficit like the one you were facing,
to mount a run, extend all their energy mounting the run and then fall back.
At some point, maybe it was clear that wasn't going to happen. How did that
not happen to you?  
COACH COALE: Resolve. They just probably said it best, believe in each other
and play for one another. Aaryn Ellenberg made two huge plays, a couple of
defensive plays, made some free throws there. Really, really just awareness,
kind of special athlete, I'm going to go make a play and make sure we get over
that hump, kind of plays, and that's how you do it.  
You have to have a kid that does something extraordinary, who just makes a
play. And we use that term in sports all the time. But there's a lot of
reality to it. You have to have a kid who can go make a play. Might be
offense, might be defense, and Vegas did that.  
  
Q. Well, she hit the three, but tell me the plays that stick with you so I
can write about it.  
COACH COALE: The inbound pass that she intercepted and got fouled on was huge.
That was the one that took us over the top. It was a huge momentum play, too.
It was kind of the way they played right back at them and I thought it kind of
changed the flavor of things.

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

OKLAHOMA  65  
WEST VIRGINIA - 64

  
COACH CAREY: Needless to say, it was a tale of two halves. The first half we
were scoring well and they couldn't score. Second half it was the other way
around. We tried to run, take some time off the clock there when it was time
to run a play that we ran against Iowa State, and they called an offensive
foul on Fields which gave them their last shot.  
Then we came down and had a good shot, good look to win the game and we missed
it. We blew a 20‑point lead. And give Oklahoma credit, they came out and
played harder than we did the second half. We were not as good offensively or
defensively in the second half than the first half.  
  
Q. What changed in the second half? Were the shots just not falling?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: They just weren't falling. I don't know.  
  
Q. Taylor, were they doing anything different do you think in the second
half or was it a case, as Christal mentioned, the shots just not falling?  
TAYLOR PALMER: I think it was a combination of both. Like our shots weren't
falling, and they were just playing a little harder and closer on defense. But
overall, I just think the shots weren't falling. We had some good looks.  
  
Q. The great run you had over the last 7:55, out ‑scored them by a wide
margin, even with the big lead at the half, did you still feel like you still
had to take it to them? Did you still have the feeling there in the locker
room?   
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: We knew‑‑ we thought that we had the game, and we knew that
we couldn't get comfortable because they were not going to stop playing. It's
tournament time and no one is going to stop playing because everyone knows
that their future is on the line and they just took it to us, and we ended up
with a loss.  
  
Q. With the foul trouble, how much did their size give you an issue in the
second half? Seemed like you guys could not get anything down low
offensively.  
TAYLOR PALMER: Getting in foul trouble, that hurt a little bit, because like
you said, you couldn't really get the ball in the post as much, because we
were a little smaller than them. Foul trouble hurt us in the second half‑‑
well, in the game in general hurt us.  
  
Q. Did you get a good look at Averee at the end?  
COACH CAREY: I'll have a look at it on tape, if it was an offensive foul, I
don't know. They took, what, 37 foul shots? What did we shoot, 12, 13? I don't
know. I don't have stats up here‑‑ 16\.  
But we fouled 94 feet from the bucket. We just weren't smart the second half.
And to answer your question, you know, at halftime, I said we still need to be
aggressive, be aggressive, be aggressive; and keep attacking, keep attacking,
keep attacking, they are going to make runs.  
And then the other thing, it's my fault, my staff didn't tell me YaYa had
three, when they finally told me that she had three, I tried to get her out to
get offensive fouls on the next play down the floor and that really hurt us.
That really hurts us in a close game because we had no post presence at that
time, zero.  
  
Q. Seems like you were really in foul trouble ‑‑  
COACH CAREY: That's the thing, YaYa can score for us in the post and when we
go the with other‑‑ that's why we were posting Averee Fields because she can
score a little bit. But you know, it hurts us, and again, I blame myself. YaYa
picking up her fourth right there, I just was not aware she had three.  
And I'm running a play for her at the same time they tell me she has three,
and I get an offensive charge so they can get her out and that's her fourth.
When they cut the lead to four, what the heck, it's tournament time, we just
had to put her in there and see what happens.  
  
Q. When you see them coming, is there anything that you can do as a coach to
try to ‑‑  
COACH CAREY: God, I wish there was. You're trying to use all your time‑outs.
You're trying to change up a little bit. You know, we sagged off a little bit.
We tried to get help on their center. But they were hitting some shots, and
then, you know, they hit six points on out‑of‑bounds plays. That is
unbelievable. That really just hurt us. Six points on an out‑of‑bounds play,
that never happens.  
  
Q. I hate to ask you this, but is this is one of your toughest losses as a
coach?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, because I think we really needed this for the NCAA, I
really do, we are on the bubble, big time. I think it's really hurt us for the
NCAA, and it's a shame. I thought our girls played hard.  
We just weren't aggressive the second half. And that's all I stressed at
halftime: Be aggressive, keep attacking, you can't relax, they are a good
team, they are going to come back, they are going to make some runs.  
But man, once that starts going, it's just hard to stop and unless somebody
steps up and hits some big shots. And as you can see in the second half, we
didn't hit any big shots, we really didn't.  
And you've got to be lucky, too. We come down, we are down one, we have a
wide‑open shot at five, seven feet and miss it. I mean, sometimes you've got
to be lucky. But we weren't. And they won.  
  
Q. They go up one with five seconds left, were you happy with the last shot
‑‑  
COACH CAREY: We told our point guard, you get over to the rim ‑‑ and she made
a good play. Bria Holmes was wide open, five, seven feet, right there on the
baseline. Good look. Good look. Just missed it, that's all.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've done enough to get into the tournament at this
point?  
COACH CAREY: I don't know. Man, I'm frustrated. You know, we go to Texas, get
beat. We lose Harlee, one of our better players. And it just seems like we
just went down at halftime once she tore her ACL. And then we bounce back in
this game, have a good first half, and do that‑‑ I don't know where we're at.
But we are on the bubble big time. On the bubble big time.  
This is the No.1 RPI league in the country, I mean, I would hope six people
would get in. But you never know. You never know. We are going to be really
worrying about it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Kelsi Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24882)

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  59  
TEXAS TECH - 54

  
COACH CURRY: Credit Oklahoma State. I don't think today was indicative of the
season we've had thus far, and it's disappointing, but at the same time, you
know, all three games against those guys have been nip and tuck and they were
able to come away with one today, and just take your hat off to them and
congratulations and move on to the next one.  
  
Q. Kelsi, you guys got to within one four times in the second half, what
happened that you were not able to get over the hump?  
KELSI BAKER: We just didn't concert. Credit them, we didn't convert on the
offensive end. It was missed shots, and credit to their defense. And when they
rebounded, we didn't get as many offensive rebounds as they got.  
  
Q. You started out 1 ‑for‑9, but got hot in the second half, finished with a
double‑double. Talk about what the changes were in the second half that
allowed to you make a lot more shots?   
KELSI BAKER: Obviously my teammates found me in perfect position and hit me
with the passes. So it was nothing that I was doing differently. It was my
teammates were hitting me in the perfect spot, and I was just fortunate to
finish my stops.  
  
Q. Just talk about the problems that young posed inside, especially on the
glass, 18 rebounds, got a couple big ones late.  
KELSI BAKER: Toni Young is a great player, she's a very athletic player. And
at crucial points in the game, we just didn't put a body on her and we didn't
box out. It was nothing that she was doing‑‑ credit to her, she's an athlete,
but we just didn't box out and we didn't finish plays like we needed to.  
  
Q. You guys were up 12 ‑5 and they went on a bit of a run and you had nine
turnovers in the rest of the half in the final ten minutes. What happened with
the offense, or was it just their defense pressuring you guys a lot?   
CASEY MORRIS: We made some small mistakes, that we can't make against any
Big12 team, every team that's in the Big12. And credit to them, they are a
great team but we can't make mistakes like that. I think we lost this game
ourselves, and we have to take responsibility and keep on moving forward and
know that we have more basketball to play.  
  
Q. You seemed to be the biggest team, yet you matched them on the offensive
glass ‑‑ talk about the team in that regard.   
COACH CURRY: We all know rebounding is not about the size of your body but the
size of your heart, and I think the kids have done a good job on the glass. We
just were not able to convert, and they were able to convert‑‑ theirs was 11
and ours was 8, that's the difference right there. They were able to convert
on our offensive put backs. We are on offensive rebound running team and we
weren't able to do that, convert.  
  
Q. I know in the first half, you guys run a lot of halfcourt press, you got
a lot of turnovers, but on the offensive end, I know late in the first half,
your team got tired, a lot of shots contested, was it an issue with fatigue?  
COACH CURRY: I don't necessarily see it as fatigue. Their bench is smaller
than our bench. I don't think our bench helped us very much today, and it is
what it is. The numbers don't lie.  
And I thought Haley came in and gave us a little basket there and some big
inside, but obviously our rotations changed a little bit, with Wills (ph) not
being here, and it is what it is, and we have got to have other people step
up.  
I stuck with who got us here and who brought us to the dance. And sure, I
could have gone to my bench but I didn't choose to do that.  
  
Q. Constantly having to play from behind and getting to three points, two
points, one point, four times, and not getting over the hump, did that start
to wear on you?  
COACH CURRY: No, I got concerned about that, but in every single huddle I
thought our coaching staff was outstanding: You can do this; positive; this is
what we need to do; see how we need to do it; you're good; get a stop; you're
a stop or two away; comeback and be aggressive on the opposite end.  
At some point I thought we were trying to coach too much energy, and as
players, you have to make plays down the stretch and we just weren't able to.  
But I was so pleased with our coaches and how positive I thought the bench
stayed and our kids on the bench. We just couldn't get that big stop that we
needed and go back down and convert, and we're one down.  
  
Q. I wanted to know the first half, you played up tempo, but the second
half, I noticed that there was a lot of standing around on the perimeter, not
a lot of off the ball movements. Was it something the defensive did or
fatigue?  
COACH CURRY: I thought Kelsi Baker had a big second half, and we went in side
and got the fourth foul on Young and I thought we got some real looks and did
some things there. Mo missed the layup, got to the foul line.  
So I don't know if I agree with us completely standing around. Obviously
Chynna had a bad day and was 0‑for‑9 but the same time, you have to want the
ball in those situations and be aggressive.  
We got to the ten‑foul mark. We talked a lot about continuously trying to get
to the line and we spread the four in our five series and were not able to get
a lot of looks. It's about able come out and consistently be attacking. We've
been a great free throw shooting team all year, and tonight we were not able
to convert those. We had enough looks at catches and throws, but we just were
not able to convert.  
  
Q. With Chynna Brown, do you think the speed ‑‑ OK‑State was an issue?   
COACH CURRY: I think just a little bit, sometimes you can be too quick and I
thought she really hurried tonight, was trying just a little too hard.  
But again, hats off to that kid. She's gotten us to this point, she's had an
incredible senior year and sometimes you have a bad day, and I'm sure she
won't have two back‑to‑back. She'll be all right.  
  
Q. You have a little bit of a layoff now, you're obviously hosting the first
is second round in the NCAA, what do you hope to accomplish during that long
layoff?  
COACH CURRY: Continuously get better. Obviously I thought just physically,
there were points during that game where I thought to myself, man, this one
looks tired; that one looks tired, and so we'll make sure that we rest.  
And at the same time I think we have got to continuously improve, and that's
my job to challenge them day‑in and day‑out. It's going to be first group and
second group this week because of spring break, and we don't have our guys in
town to practice against.  
So it's an opportunity for those kids on the bench to improve, our starters to
improve. Obviously we are not shooting the basketball very good the last three
games at the level I think we need to and making shots so a lot of areas for
improvement and we'll just continuously get better and we'll look forward to
some community service this week and spending some time together. We are
thankful for what we do have and not what we don't have and we have a lot to
look forward to, and so we're going to continue to get better.  
  
Q. (And being a host site in the NCAA Tournament)?  
COACH CURRY: It's incredible, we are so excited and so blessed to be defending
our home court and hope we can send the seniors out with wins into the
Sweet16.  
We are excited about the crowd and hope that they can come out and support so
that we can continue to host. The State of Texas is fortunate to have one in
Waco and Lubbock, and there's great opportunities in the State of Texas to
support women's basketball in the first and second rounds.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  59  
TEXAS TECH - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you would give us a comment or two about this
afternoon's game.  
COACH LITTELL: Thank you. Very proud of our team. We had lost two times
previous to Texas Tech. And every time this year that we have lost to an
opponent, other than Baylor, we found a way to come back and win. It took
three times to do that against a very good and very experienced Tech team.
They have got four seniors, and they just know how to play, and they caused us
a great deal of difficulty.  
But I thought our team really competed very well tonight. Did a lot of good
things. I don't think you've got to look any further than what Brittany Martin
did for us tonight. She did a great job locking up Chynna Brown. That was the
concern going into the game. Chynna had hurt us two previous games. Started
her all night long, held her to four points, and Brittney had a career‑high
seven steals and was very good on the offensive end.  
Tiffany Bias took care of the basketball and did some good things for us
tonight. Hit a big three down near the end of the game and then Toni Young
came in and had 18 rebounds and that was very crucial to our efforts tonight.  
  
Q. Toni, in the first half, you had 11 rebounds and a real good game
rebounding, and it seems like I guess Texas pressed defense and they moved
around a lot; was that a big key to this game for you, to be a good rebounder
and not focus on the offensive end?  
TONI YOUNG: Coach said to keep trying to get rebounds and trying to get every
rebound that comes off the rim. In this game, if I couldn't produce some
offense, I was going to do something productive and that was rebounding.  
  
Q. Brittney, coach mentioned your steals and the one that was really big,
you were up one and you had the ball; can you talk about what you saw on that
play and what that moment was like?  
BRITTNEY ATKINS: Chynna Brown, she had been coming off threes and killing us
off that, so they tried to mix it up and we had to hedge it. And Baker, who
has been scoring all night, she scored all night on us. I knew the ball was
going to Kendra‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ so I stayed right back.  
  
Q. Tiffany, how were you doing mentally taking over for the game in the
second half with the pressure being put on by Texas Tech? How did you adjust
mentally?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I struggled all game, and to be mental as a point guard, you
have to keep the ball and get it to the players. So pretty much have to be
patient and slow down and wait until they are open.  
  
Q. You guys started with six turnovers early and finished with 17. Was it
just nerves or was their quickness an issue?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Most of the time, just going too fast and that's just something
that happens when they press you like that, and Tech is a good pressing team.
So I think early, I think we just had a little bit of jitters and a lot of
deflections and so that caused turnovers, too.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you did that shut down Chynna Brown? She had one
of her worst offensive games of the season.  
TONI YOUNG: Well, the last two games we've played her, she's beat me off the
dribble. She's got a nice pull‑up, so I kind of just had to focus more on‑‑ I
was worried about her driving last game, so she was just pulling up and I kind
of just had to focus on‑‑ I guess I was just thinking about, I had to do both
today. I had to just really focus on what she was doing with it or where she's
holding the ball, just had to focus more than I did the last two games.  
  
Q. All three of those players had four fouls with about five or six minutes
left. Can you just talk about juggling, how long to keep them out and just the
fact that none of them fouled out and just how they stayed under control down
the stretch?  
COACH LITTELL: Well, we weren't going to go very long with tiff and Toni on
the bench at the same time, because those two are so instrumental in what we
do offensively, as well as defensively.  
So we were just trying to buy some minutes and you know, we decided that if we
are going to get beat, we are going to get beat with our best players on the
floor. So we went back with them probably quicker than I would have liked to
have had, but I didn't want to relinquish the lead, either.  
So we just told them to be smart, keep them in front of you, don't foul on
tough shots, and I believe we did a pretty good job of that the last seven
minutes. We were in pretty serious foul trouble.  
  
Q. In the first ten minutes of the first half, the team seemed to struggle
with their halfcourt press and you guys only had five points in the first ten
minutes and in the next ten minutes, you had better ball movement and more
offense, what was the main adjustment?  
COACH LITTELL: We went to some different stats offensively, and tried to
spread the floor a little bit. They are a team that's about the same size
across the board, and basically are playing five guards, and they switch
everything.  
So that's where they were causing some problems that some of the sets that we
normally run weren't working because they were topping out on that, so we went
more to just spreading the floor and trying to iso somebody on the elbow or at
the box. I think that was a big difference for us.  
  
Q. Kendra has been one of your most improved players. Talk about her play
today, she made some big baskets for you throughout.  
COACH LITTELL: Well, she did, and made some really nice drives to the basket.
Kendra has got a lot of versatility to her game, and she, without a doubt, is
our smartest player as far as basketball IQ goes on the floor, knowing what
needs to be done at the right time. And she didn't win any all‑conference
awards, but the last month and a half, Kendra Suttles has been our best
basketball player.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

KANSAS  83  
TCU - 61

  
Q. Playing the team three times in a row especially twice back ‑to‑back, do
you think that was a disadvantage for y'all or an advantage or how do you
think that that played into the scheme of this game?   
COACH MITTIE: I don't think it favored either team really. I think the game
takes on its own game, and we played them‑‑ obviously you play them within
three days‑‑ I think today our issues were we really struggled on and off the
dribble. We really struggled inside, both Gardener and Davis had very, very
productive games, and they have an advantage there, and I thought they played
very well.  
So we struggled with our discipline defensively. We got very spread
defensively but they also had some players up there level of play. I thought
Hawkins played good again. I thought Asia Boyd played good again‑‑ not again
but Asia, she played very well tonight. Gardener, who did not play very well
on Tuesday night had a monster game tonight. So they got a lot of production
from a lot of people tonight.  
  
Q. What would you equate to why you weren't hitting it tonight, do you think
maybe stadium had something to do with it or nerves, or what do you think
caused the real low shooting percentage?  
COACH MITTIE: I thought our shot selection was poor. I thought we made strides
in the last three weeks over our shot selection and I think tonight, if
there's anything, the atmosphere gets you a little up and you've got to settle
into it and we didn't do a very good job of that tonight.  
But we've been a 33 percent shooting team all year. We shot 32 and a half
tonight. We've been a bad‑‑ we've been a poor, efficient offensive team all
year (chuckling) okay. We have not been a very efficient offensive team all
year.  
So it's not like these numbers are abnormal. That's an average. We have scored
it better against Kansas. We shot over 40 percent both halves at Kansas, hit
ten 3s. I just didn't like our flow tonight. I thought we were very one‑on‑one
tonight, very much one‑on‑one.  
  
Q. Inaudible.  
COACH MITTIE: If I knew, I would have told them before you.

### [Chelsea Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24873)

### [Angel Goodrich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21852)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

TCU  83  
KANSAS - 61

  
COACH HENRICKSON: I thought defensively, we were so much better than we had
been, and especially in the first half, they averaged 28 points in the first
half in league play, and almost 4 approximate against us in our first two
games and our defensive numbers in the second half were better but first half,
too loose and too many 3s and at our place, it was six made 3s in the first
seven minutes.  
I thought it was the first time in the three games we've played that we
actually jumped out on them and got the lead and got some separation, as
opposed to the flip side of that, at their place and at our place.  
So much better defensive focus and intensity. It got a little sloppy there
middle minutes, but good to get one after a long day, not playing till 8:30,
that's a real, real long day, I thought the kids handled it well. We don't
have many 8:30 tips, haven't had many all year.  
So I thought they handled the kind of length of the day and like sometimes
that can wear on you, too. So really proud of our effort and proud of our
commitment to come in and guard better to start.  
  
Q. Chelsea, could you talk about having a career ‑high in rebounds and a
double‑double playing so close to home?   
CHELSEA GARNDER: I thought it was pretty nice. I came out with a lot of
energy, a lot of effort, started off with a great start and I just felt
excited about being back at home.  
  
Q. Angel, you had 16 points, five rebounds, eight assists, two blocks, two
steals, zero turnovers. Which is your favorite number there?  
ANGEL GOODRICH: The zero turnovers (laughs). I haven't done that all year.
That was the first one.  
So for me to come out and get zero turnovers especially in the Big12
Tournament, I felt great. I was excited, especially when Terry told me on the
bench, kind of put my hands up and was just smiling so big.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what you thought of the lift that air agave you both in
the first half and the second half, and then after you, I'd like the same
question of Angel, as well.  
CHELSEA GARNDER: I thought Asia gave us a lot of energy off the bench and she
came in with a big deal today, so I felt like she did a great job.  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Yes, just like Chelsea said, she came in ready to play, she
attacked and that's what we need, for people off the bench to step up and be
ready to play.  
COACH HENRICKSON: If you look at these two, they didn't know, angel said
although I'm not surprised, these two were 8 for 40 in our first two games
with these guys, and tonight they go 11 for 19. That matters. It was a good
night, much better night.  
  
Q. What about the zero turnovers for a player who is as aggressive as Angel
at all times?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Just how much she attacks, and especially they started off
in a triangle and two and we had not seen that all year and really played the
majority of it just a straight 2‑3, but they really tried to pinch her. They
run a lot of people at her.  
I thought they tried to attack her with the second guy and I thought she made
really, really good decisions in seams and didn't try to do too much. And you
know, I thought at our place and here, took penetration lanes and made really,
really good decisions.  
But they are a team that even though it's a 2‑3, it's an aggressive 2‑3, and
they really tried to get in there and cut the court on her, but I thought her
poise and decision making certainly was fantastic.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you had such a long day today waiting for the 8:30
tip, how does that change tomorrow, and how difficult is that knowing you have
a short turnaround tomorrow?  
COACH HENRICKSON: We are excited to play. We are not worried about the short
turnaround. We are excited to play and get one today and excited about the
opportunity to play Iowa State tomorrow.  
So, we'll be fine. We'll be fine, and probably go do‑‑ we'll get some
information to them. We have just recently played Iowa State, so we talked in
the locker room, what was it, 7‑for‑10 from the three in the first half. And
then it was everything inside, three bigs have 62 points and 34 rebounds; and
they didn't know the numbers, that's my job.  
But they can talk you through exactly where we broke down defensively in the
locker room after this game. So from a fresh standpoint, remembering the game,
certainly remember the game at our place, too, the comeback. But we'll be able
to go through that. But they are young and they are excited. We are really
excited to play.  
  
Q. Obviously depth is a problem for you, but in a way, can your lack of
depth maybe relax Asia, you have to play her and she knows she's going to
play?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right, yeah, and she came in and had had come in and gave us
some energy, and that's what we were lacking and that's why Hawk got the
chance. We just felt like we had been so flat and had not gotten enough out of
that position.  
I thought we could, I told her and CeCe when I made the move, doesn't mean
you're not going to play. You have to be ready to play and you have to handle
coming off the bench and if your role is a little different than maybe the
first guy or the second guy, you still have to be ready to play but it's
magnified all year but it's really magnified this time of the year.  
And you know, we have got‑‑ yeah, you're right, because when you're ‑‑ and
that's exactly what happened to us last year, everybody knew they had a chance
to contribute because of what our numbers were. And I think you're more dialed
in and ready to go and pay attention more when you go, okay, I'm going to go
and I may be the second guy off the bench, maybe not the first guy but I know
I'll go.  
And I thought her minutes were huge. For her, again, we've had some really
special kids be able to hang in there and go through the difficulties of not
getting on the floor and then because they handle themselves well, do what
Hawk did and come in and help us, and you have to be able to do the same thing
if that flipped for you, you still have to hang in there and not give up and
give in, and go okay, maybe I'm the second guy or maybe I started and I'm the
first guy, but whatever I do when I get in, I want to be able to impact the
game. I thought she did a great job for us tonight.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

KANSAS STATE  51  
TEXAS - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts and we'll take questions.  
COACH PATTERSON: Thank you. Exciting victory for our basketball team and
program.  
It was so fitting that the last play came down to tremendous execution from
Mariah White and Brittany Chambers, on just a tremendous senior‑to‑senior and
make a play at the buzzer. That was a second half in which I felt like we were
really, really struggling to find our step. And Texas found theirs a bit. So
it felt like just a war of attrition, you know, who was going to have the ball
at the last possession.  
I was extremely proud of how we continued to work as hard as we could to match
them on the defensive boards. We thought that was really critical tonight. I'm
very, very proud of every one that has had the opportunity to take the floor
tonight and who competed so hard.  
Imani McGee‑Stafford is just such a tremendous talent, and she puts so much
pressure on your defense every trip up the floor. And she took a great young
player, a great freshman, she's going to be a star in this league.  
So we're proud of Bri and Chantay and Mariah, in particular, who had the
assignment with Heidi Brown of working as hard as they could to deal with
those mismatches inside and I thought they did a great job.  
  
Q. The last play, did you see it coming ‑‑  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: We had it designed for ‑‑ coming in, we knew they were
going to double them if we came off. That was pretty much‑‑ (audio noise) ‑‑
so different option and we wanted ‑‑ so it was a broke down play but Mariah
drove to the baseline, our best driver by far and made a basket. Just I guess
playing basketball together.  
  
Q. The last play of the game, you shoot 3s, basically the entire game,
probably 80 percent. Is it ironic that you would win the game on a play like
that, and you just said broken down; broken down sometimes means that you know
what the other person is going to do in a situation. Was that the case?  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: Yeah, I think it is kind of crazy, we scored in the lane,
but, they were expecting us to shoot a three, so we didn't back cut all game,
which I mean, now that we look at it, maybe it wasn't a good option.  
But you know, they played great defense, and we were looking to shoot 3s all
night. So that back cut that Chantay had before the last play that I had were
wide open; for 39 minutes of the game, all we were doing was popping for 3s.  
Broken down, I meant more of like the play that we drew up didn't work. And so
it didn't work; they guarded it well. Mariah is just an amazing player and
that play was completely her.  
COACH PATTERSON: I think the thing about that play that was extraordinary was
we had Brit sent to that side. We wanted Haley back to the side where the ball
had been inbounded. Brittany had to remind Haley to get over there, and she
did, and Haley motored over there where we wanted her.  
But by broken play, what you saw was just two great seniors make the play,
because the play was for Chantay to back‑screen Brittany, and for Mariah to
have an option with Haley and to have an option with Brit; but when Mariah's
drive had to go middle instead of baseline down at the very end of the
dribble, Brittany just made an absolutely fantastic read on the back cut.  
So it's not just a finish of the play, it was the read to make the cut and
then the ability of Mariah to find her in that connection the two of them have
that's so extraordinary. And Haley being over on that other side, and then
having to chase her, because she had such a tremendous game on the floor, you
couldn't not guard her. She was outstanding.  
  
Q. First, can you guys talk about ‑‑ were you breathing when the ball was
bouncing around on the rim there? And if you can talk about all the minutes
that you've been flag because of the injury, just go into a little bit about
how difficult it is to get through these games.   
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: The last play of the game, I for sure thought I missed it.
It would have haunted me for the rest of my life. It felt like it was on that
rim for ten minutes, it was terrible. But seven players, we're used to it.
There's no complaining, no feeling sorry for ourselves anymore.  
We would love to have the rest of our people out there just because we love
them but coach d and the staff has been absolutely amazing this year, watching
more film than usual, running a lot more plays, not so much up‑and‑down. You
have to change a little bit when things are thrown at you, and they have done
that to help us succeed at the best way that we can.  
We are in the best shape that we have been in because of it, and sometimes,
you know, when you play with five players, it can be an advantage. When you're
subbing people in and out, sometimes people get out of rhythm and we have five
players that have played every minute together this year, and we can get in a
rhythm quick.  
So we are using, instead of looking at it as a negative, we are taking
advantage of what we can do, and getting a win against a great Texas team is
just that.  
HALEY TEXADA: Like what she said, not having some players‑‑ but at the end of
the day we realize that we do have to play together and fight for each other.
We are not fighting for ourselves. At the end of the day, we are a pretty good
group off the court and on the court, so it shows. We just have that
connection. And as far as that last shot, it felt like five minutes in that
one second. Just glad it rolled in. It looked scary for a minute there,
though.  
  
Q. Tonight we saw two halves, you led by ten and then they came back and
tied it. How important is it to keep your players in check in a game like this
against Texas?  
COACH PATTERSON: It was huge. We had talked this season about games where we
only really competed tough‑minded for 20 minutes. And in this league, you know
people are going to come back at you and I feel like the last four games we
have played, we have really bought into that 40‑minute mentality, that teams
are going to come at you, you have to stay tough‑minded.  
And today, we were really struggling offensively in the second half. It was
everything was just a struggle but we didn't check out. The kid just kept
competing. And against a team like Texas, you're expecting things to come down
to the wire at this stage of the game.  
Credit them with just the mentality of the fight that you have to have, really
right to that last second. That's also a reflection of great leaders, in
Brittany and Mariah, who just kept pushing and fighting their way through some
dry spots in that second half.  
  
Q. I noticed during the huddle that you talked more about the composure.
Going to a lot of games, I never saw that from any coaches, more about X's and
O's, hey, you should have been here. You talk about composure. My question is:
Is that something that you knew would be the final obstacle to get this game
and win, because it seemed like it was just more about composure, once they
calmed down, especially in the last 12 seconds of that game and that play, the
team was very calm and relaxed when they left the huddle and that's very
rare.  
COACH PATTERSON: Again, that just speaks to the mentality that we feel we have
to compete with to be successful.  
We know what we want every trip up the floor. We knew defensively what we
wanted. We might make a point when we fell short on a box‑out, but by and
large, our screen defensively didn't change much.  
Had a couple of little adjustments and on the offensive end, most of our play
came down to keep your wits about you, stay confident, play together and just
the simple things of the mind and the chemistry that you have to have out
there on the floor until the last part of the game.  
But these players really do have a good feel and the way we are playing this
year, it's not so much, A go here, B go here, C go here. We constantly do that
but not the majority of the game. That is a great credit to them and their
competitive maturity.  
And I was really impressed with Heidi Brown stepping up and taking a lot of
heat. You know, she had to play a lot of minutes in a role that was a little
unfamiliar to her, and Haley Texada's first half, basically give us a chance
to be in the game. So all of them found a way mentally to be extremely tough I
thought.  
  
Q. I wanted to talk about the time of possession ‑‑ was that something they
were doing defensively‑‑  
COACH PATTERSON: It varied during segments of the game. We went into the game
really comfortable with that philosophy. Now, you're only comfortable with it
if you score enough to keep yourself in the game, and as you can see, this was
not an offensive juggernaut performance tonight.  
At times I felt like we overdid that, you know and I think it was a function
of us not necessarily being good on some of those possessions. But by and
large, yes, we were looking to limit possessions, because I don't know about
you, but every time Texas went up the floor, I was expecting Imani or Nneka to
score the ball. I was thinking, oh, please. They are just two really, really
great targets, and the second half, they really found their step.  
  
Q. To be specific, on the very last play, did you want a three ‑pointer, and
did you want someone specifically to shoot it, or were you looking for best
shot underneath?   
COACH PATTERSON: Well, we had three options: The first was Mariah just off of
a drive. That was our first option.  
Our second option was we were trying to get the ball in our kickback to Haley,
a screen for Haley, and Haley, if Mariah couldn't get to the rim for a basket.  
And the third shot was a back screen on the weak side for Brittany. And we
didn't care if it was a three. I assumed it would be a three or a two, based
on spacing, because Brittany had inbounded it, and we ran it to the weak side
of the floor, hoping we would get not a true back screen like evolved, but
kind of a back screen that would get her more of a flare‑three off the
penetration, more like an in and out; you know how we drive it and a lot of
times get shots on the corners.  
So we were looking for that kind of play. But you never know when that screen
is being set on the back side if they will come flat or if your read is to
come tight. And once Mariah started her drive to the middle, Brittany knew to
make that cut tight and to keep it tight and to go just with interest timing.  
I definitely did not expect Brittany would get an at‑the‑rim shot. We had no
expectation of that. We thought it would be a jumpshot, kind of a mid‑range
shot, or a three on the back side; if Haley didn't get a jumpshot and if
Mariah didn't get a layup.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

KANSAS STATE  51  
TEXAS - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts about tonight's game and then we'll take
questions from the floor.  
COACH ASTON: Well, first of all, congratulations to k state on extending to
another round.  
You know, I thought that‑‑ I tried to get the players after the game just to
take a deep breath and understand that, you know, any time someone wins in the
last second, then you start figuring out what happened in that last second and
on that last play.  
But we actually I thought lost the game with the way we played in the first
half. We just lacked a sense of urgency in the first half from pretty much
every aspect. We were non‑aggressive offensively, and it obviously didn't hurt
that these two decided to get into foul trouble the first half.  
But we weren't very aggressive defensively, didn't communicate very well.
Looked a little bit frozen I thought in the first half. But proud of the way
we came back and fought in the second half, but you know, they made the plays
that they needed to.  
They made two consecutive plays down the stretch that I thought just kind of
caught us ball‑watching, is what I would say, where they went back door on us.
But again, I thought the first half was the determining factor in the game.  
  
Q. Ten seconds left, time ‑out, what were you expecting, because it looked
like you played brilliant defense until the shot went in. Was it a surprise,
and do you think you played well defensively in that play?   
IMANI McGEE‑STAFFORD: I'm going to say since they made the basket, we didn't
play well defensively. But I think personally a lot of them were playing for
the three. We were expecting Chambers to get the ball and expected her to get
the three‑‑ something happens, you've got a last‑second shot. We just knew we
had to play ten seconds of defense, no foul and we were hoping for overtime.  
NNEKA ENEMKPALI: Piggybacking off what she said, it was a broken play, and
K‑State plays really, really well off the ball. I feel like I just saw a split
in our defense, and we were able to find the open player and she sent the play
and we converted it.  
  
Q. Is it tougher to lose a game like this than any other way, and can you
describe the comeback that you made in the second half?  
IMANI McGEE‑STAFFORD: Yes, very much, it's so tougher to lose a game this way.
There are so many things that run through your mind that you could have done
personally to combat what happened.  
The second half, I think we took our time‑‑ I mean, for me, I was rushing my
shot. I was kind of nervous in the first half and I was rushing my shots and I
couldn't finish and I was getting to myself and I took myself out of the game,
I couldn't finish, I was so bad. The second half, my teammates were picking me
such, saying you're fine, they are going to fall. We started rebounding in the
second half. In the first half we didn't rebound well at all. In the second
half, we got the jitters out and we just came to play.  
NNEKA ENEMKPALI: You don't want to lose, basically, and the fact that this is
a loss that ended our season made it even that much harder to take in. I feel,
like Coach said, we were not the team that we had been the past couple of
games tonight. And since coming out in the second half, we regrouped, and
regrouped as a team, individually, and we made it a point to put in all those
tippy (ph) shots and play team defense and work on the things that we know
that we are capable of doing.  
  
Q. Defensively, you're in the huddle, what do you tell them to watch for and
were you surprised by what developed in the last second?  
COACH ASTON: Well, we talked about obviously chambers was taking the ball
out‑of‑bounds, so we immediately talked about the fact that she was going to
come from out‑of‑bounds and probably run off some screens or get a hand off. I
thought we guarded the initial part of their play really, really well. We
actually made White pick up her dribble. She was pretty much stuck.  
And the last thing really that we talked about before we came out of the
huddle is, really, I said this because of what they just done the play before,
I said, "Don't ball watch." Don't get caught staring at the basketball and
that's really exactly what happened. We just kind of stopped when she picked
up her dribble and Chambers did what great players do, she went back door
while we stopped and they made a play.  
  
Q. They had the advantage on fast break points ‑‑ do you think the
transition defense would have been better, would it have affected the outcome
of the game?  
COACH ASTON: I thought the transition defense was bad in the first half
because our energy level got so low.  
I would attribute that to two things in the first half: One, young players
getting really discouraged by the fact that they were missing layups. We were
missing point‑blank shots in the first half, so we got discouraged. Any time
you get discouraged, you don't go play to play.  
So we gave up transition buckets in the first half and then I really think the
biggest one in the second half was off of a turnover. It was off of that
turnover late in the game where they got a layup.  
But again, the first half, we just got discouraged because of the two things.
We missed layups, missed point‑blank shots that they all know they should have
made and the foul trouble with Nneka and Imani, we don't have an answer when
both of those players get in foul trouble at the same time. We just don't have
an answer.  
  
Q. Looking at the stats sheet, you out ‑rebounded, had more assists, more
steals, more blocks. Shooting percentage was the only thing I noticed that was
a lot different. Do you think you guys in the second half, I saw you guys slow
down on mid‑range jumpshots and started going to the paint more and that
changed the game. Do you think that if that was in the first half, the game
would be different? And do you think the team got tired just running around in
circles‑‑ they are a lot smaller, so the speed and everything, was that
something that was an issue?   
COACH ASTON: Well, I tried to give particular players that were playing
significant minutes chasing around smaller players, I tried to give them time,
a minute, 30 seconds, that I thought would be couched with the media time‑out,
and that's kind of how I've had to do Imani, Nneka, some of those that are
playing; Chas, I tried to do that with all three of them and then Celina got
in trouble late in the game and that hurt us. We don't have a bench, but they
don't either. That's an excuse. If we got tired that's an excuse because they
didn't.  
I think that this has a lot to do with the fact that we had some first
tournament jitters for a lot of players. I thought we looked really nervous.
Nneka (ph) has been playing so well and she looked a little bit shellshocked
in the first half, like a little frozen I guess is the best word I can think,
and Imani probably rushed thoughts because it was her first Big12 tournament;
Celina has never been in one. I think this regrouping at halftime helped them
but it was almost too big of a hole.  
And like you said, I think the fatigue did set in because we had to dig so
hard to try to come back. But I would compliment our players for the steps
that they have taken this year and the direction of not getting down. That
game a month ago would have been a 20‑point game because we would have said,
oh, well, you know, this is not‑‑ we can't do it.  
But I think that leadership has gotten better as we've gone along and their
resilience to fighting back from deficits has gotten so much better.

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Kelly Faris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21810)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 61  
UConn: 59

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is UConn, head coach, Geno Auriemma along with
junior center Stefanie Dolson, senior guard Kelly Faris, and freshman forward,
Breanna Stewart. Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH AURIEMMA: What can I say? I feel really bad for these guys. I thought
they played an amazing second half. We put ourselves in a big hole the first
half, and I thought we came out in the second half and played great.  
And Kayla McBride made big shot after big shot and not easy ones, either. And,
you know, they deserved to win because they made one more play at the end. One
more play than we did.  
  
Q. Were you trying to foul Skyler? Did you want your team to foul Skyler on
that last drive?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think we fouled her three times, and I guess it took a long
time for them not to call fouls on us but they picked the worst timing we
fouled her three times, we just tried to not make it look intentional, but as
it turned out we would have had to tackle her for them to call it but we
tried.  
We knew we had to foul to get them and we saved it to the end, and like so
many of these games, just wasn't meant to be.  
  
Q. You had three tough losses to them this year, a couple of years ago you
beat them three times and they beat you in the Final Four, is that something
that you can tap into and maybe make it the other way?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think history has shown that what happens during the regular
season, doesn't necessarily mean that's what's going to happen in the
postseason. There is a lot of basketball to be played before there is a chance
of a Connecticut/Notre Dame game. We're going to get together on Saturday and
start preparing for round one of the NCAA Tournament and that's as far as
we're looking forward right now.  
  
Q. We saw what happened on the last possession. What did you want to happen
on that play?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it's funny, we just went over it this morning, and we
ran a little misdirection thing and Kaleena was wide open at the top of the
circle, but this morning and yesterday‑‑ was it yesterday or the other day, we
got Stewie for a layup on the lob so Kelly was looking for that and as it
turns out Kaleena was wide open at the top of the key. Stewie made a great
catch and next time she is in that situation after she catches it she is going
to square up and catch it and attack the basket and get a foul. She is too
young to understand that right now.  
You know, it's one of those plays where you only need 2, so a score and a foul
or just a foul‑‑ when Stewie caught it I thought we were in great shape and
then it kind of‑‑ I probably should have called time‑out when Stewie dribbled
down and passed it, so I take the responsibility for that one. Actually, we
wanted to win without the time‑out, when the ball hit the rim, right, tie
score, the ball hit the rim and they had to check to see if the ball hit the
rim, wasn't that play, so they forced to us take a time‑out, we wanted to keep
flying, tie score, at home, when it's that late a lot of things pop up.  
  
Q. Can you tell us how you're feeling right now after this loss and take us
through that play where you tied the game up in the final minute?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Honestly at this point how I played isn't really in my mind.
You know, it sucks that we lost. Like Coach said we fought in the second half.
That layup that tied it up was a lot of different emotions but at the end of
the day we didn't win, doesn't really matter how I played.  
  
Q. It's been 11 years since UConn hasn't made a three in a game, national
championship game against Oklahoma, ironically. Is it conceivable that any
team could do that to you and as many as you have been shooting all year that
you could go 0 for 5?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't know that the way, you know, the way Notre Dame
played defensively was exactly the way Oklahoma played it. And it was‑‑ you
can get the ball inside anytime you want and you can drive it by and you say
we're not going to let you catch it on the three‑point line and shoot it. I
thought today was going to be one in the lane and I encouraged our guys to get
the ball in the lane and to drive it and put the ball in the lane.  
I didn't want us to settle for outside jump shots. But for us to go ofer, I
don't think we are ever going to do that. I always think we are going to make
the shot, we always do.  
  
Q. Coach, when you had Maya as a freshman and Tina as a sophomore there were
growing pains, do you feel like that you have that this year, young players in
key rolls, where they're just starting to learn how to do this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, as you look at the make‑up of our team right now,
we have a couple of players sitting up here right now that are all capable of
making big plays and they're all capable of winning the game for us. And in
those situations, you know, you try to find‑‑ in a perfect world you have the
right guy passing the ball and the right guy screen and get the right guy
catching it and everything works out hunky‑dory, but I was confident and
comfortable with either Stefanie, Kaleena or Stewie catching the ball, that's
who Kelly was looking to and she chose Stewie and I'm okay with that and next
time in the next situation if she makes that choice I'm okay with that, too.  
  
Q. Given how close the games have been between you guys, how do you think
they were able to get up 13 in the first half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I thought the first half we‑‑ I was speechless on the
bench. I mean, I can't tell you what was going through my mind on the bench
during that first half. I can't think of any scenario that I thought we would
play that first half the way we played it. I wasn't prepared for that, neither
were any of the other coaches and I can't explain it, I can't.  
I have no idea what the collective mind‑set of our team was out on the floor.
We talked a lot about that at halftime. We made a couple of adjustments and we
came out and fix it had, but I have no idea why we were so out of sync, why we
were so defensive when we were on offense. I can't explain that, the way we
played the second half is normally how we come out and play but I don't know.
Maybe like Jim said maybe as a team we have to learn how to handle ourselves
in those situations on a regular basis. I really have no‑‑ I can't explain it
Mike, I wish I could.  
  
Q. Kelly, how does an elite program like Connecticut, how does this game
against Notre Dame affect your mind set and your confidence that you can
accomplish what you all want to accomplish in April?  
KELLY FARIS: At this point, this program is about how you respond and that's
what Coach teaches us how to do and unfortunately we haven't responded the way
we need to, the way the program is used to responding, what people expect of
us and that's why we're sitting where we're at right now. Had we responded the
way we needed to, we would be on the other side so this is our last chance to
respond in the right way to respond how he teaches us to and like I said, this
is our last opportunity to step up and make something of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 61  
UConn: 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Notre Dame. Joining us is Muffet McGraw, junior
guard Skylar Diggins, junior guard Kayla McBride and junior forward Natalie
Achonwa, Coach?  
COACH McGRAW: Unbelievable game, I thought the bench did a great job of
keeping us in it and getting the lead and then when Natalie got her third I
thought we were in trouble rebounding, they had the big team in at that point
and I felt Stewart played really well, she had a great game, maybe the best
I've seen her play this year and Stefanie Dolson, they were so much on the
inside without Natalie Achonwa in there. I thought our 3‑point defense was
fantastic, we tried to keep them off the 3‑point, especially Kaleena
Mosquesa‑Lewis, but great presence to play that defense and come up with the
steal and for Sky to find Natalie under the basket, what an incredible finish.  
  
Q. Skyler, how conscious were you of how much time was left when you got the
ball?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think I glanced when I first got it, I saw like eight on the
steal or something like that. I tried to drive it down the court. That's the
fastest I've seen Natalie tryin' to run down the court to get the ball. I was
trying to draw the foul, but they let it go. I'm glad they let it go and
Natalie was just there, Jewls was on they other side, I saw Ace, and I just
threw it to her, she made it.  
  
Q. Skyler, I was going to ask, it looked like you got quite a bit of
contact. Can you talk about how you kept going? Because it looked like they
hesitated when Bria Hartley hit you.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think they thought the foul was coming and I'm glad they let
it go. I got to see the replay but I had the presence of mind to start out and
it gave me options and she called my name at the end and I looked up and saw
Natalie and she finished.  
  
Q. Skyler, you guys were never able to finish this off and how great is it
to get the monkey off your back?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It's great for our program. I'm excited about going into the
tournament with the way our bench stepped up. The way Kayla McBride put the
team on her back, the way Jewl played fighting through adversity. You know Ace
had four fouls, she could have put her head down and you know, been out of it,
but she stayed in it, she came in and made the game‑winning shot. This means a
lot for our team. I think this is our coming of age. We fought through
adversity and this is a great win for our program and for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess seventh time is the charm. What are your feelings? It
looked like it was going to be a route, and now the last Big East Tournament
you guys win it, probably one of the most exciting.  
COACH McGRAW: It certainly was that. I think it's special because it's the
last one, it's nice to leave here champions. To go undefeated for the whole
season was a great accomplishment for this team and to overachieve like we did
and to win it here makes it even better. Now we're 0‑0 and we have to focus on
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Kayla, yesterday I asked you about playing more under control as opposed
to the first game, now I'm going to ask you about playing against UConn,
because it's like you go home and kick husky puppies or something to get
ready, because you just owned this game.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: UConn is a great team. I love playing in big games, and I
couldn't do it without any teammates passing the ball, setting good screens,
things like that. It was a great win.  
  
Q. Natalie, talk about UConn players doing what they did inside and that
last play, what was going through your mind when Skyler found you?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Before that last play Skyler said, "They're tired" and in my
head, I've played four minutes, I've got all the energy in the world!
(Laughter.) And as soon as Sky got that steal at the end I saw her going, and
she had done a great job of attacking the ball the whole game, and I saw three
or four running to her, and as soon as I saw my man weak out, I was the
safety, and I had to get to the basket.  
  
Q. Skyler, Connecticut had zero 3 ‑point goals today, it's the first time
since 2002, a streak without a three‑pointer. Can you talk about the defense
you guys played, especially on the perimeter?   
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We talked about it before, in transition games we were leaving
people open, we left Kaleena Mosquesa‑Lewis open last week, somebody left
Kelly open another time. We did a bad job of finding players, and they can
shoot the ball. So before the game we said let's hold them under a couple of
three's this game, try to play defense and protect the 3‑point line, and that
was a total team effort, and I think it started on our communication with the
screens did a better job of talking and switching out. I thought that was an
improvement from last week.  
  
Q. Natalie, you always have to defend Stefanie Dolson very hard but tonight
you added a new dynamic of Breanna Stewart. How difficult was that?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Like Coach said, she had a great game today, her wing span is
incredible and that's why she got rebounds over us; we weren't boxing her out
enough. I was trying to get some ball pressure and staying away from Stefanie
Dolson in the post, because I had those fouls, and as a team we were helping
and recovering really well and at the end of the game I think that's what made
the deference.  
  
Q. Coach you hear about Skyler and the leadership and the poise, big plays.
Last couple of games she has defended Shimmel, kept her under control and
tonight was on Kaleena Mosquesa ‑Lewis for a good portion of the night and
Bria Hartley when she was hitting. Can you talk about Skylar Diggins as a
defender as opposed to the offensive player?   
COACH McGRAW: I thought when they came to Notre Dame our defense improved
because she is able to get up on the ball. A lot of players can't guard the
dribble. She is able to pick 'em up in the backcourt and had a couple of
turnovers in the backcourt, but her defense is excellent because she has so
much pride. She does not want to let you score on her. She is going to fight
and battle the screens and do everything she needs to do, but I think she is a
great defender.  
  
Q. When you look at what this team became without Peters, without others,
what is Skyler's imprint?  
COACH McGRAW: Her legacy is going to be unmatched and unparalleled for decades
to come, what she has done for our program to elevate it like she has and to
lose last year's class that was so talented and we relied on so heavily, these
two stepped up and this core with Skyler at the helm has been unbelievable.  
  
Q. Coach, Notre Dame has won seven out of eight meetings with Connecticut
now, I think five of those games were decided in the last minute. Is there a
common denominator in there that you've seen?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I don't think probably either coach feels like we have
played well in any of the games. We have great spurts and certainly great
moments, but it's just such a battle, you know?  
I think that's the only thing, we start to look at the scouting report and the
film and we go, it doesn't matter, it's not going to matter what exactly we're
doing because it's just going to be a matter of me against and you we're going
to battle and I'm going to box you out and rebound and defend and last man
standing wins.  
  
Q. Sky, you have had a lot of big wins at Notre Dame, you have one that I'm
sure you want to get in about three weeks from now. Where does this one rank?
I thought it was interesting you were the last one to cut down the net. Where
does this rank in your time at Notre Dame?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Definitely the freshest in my mind, we had a lot of big ones
this year and in my years, versus Tennessee to go to the Final Four, the win
against UConn to go to the national championship game, the win at home, and
now. I have had a lot of big wins, but this is definitely up there.  
It means a lot not only to me but I know it means a lot to Coach and our
program and like I said earlier, you know, my teammates have been stepin' up
and I give all the credit to them for just rising to the occasion and really
stepping into roles that, you know, they weren't comfortable with at first.
This is a coming of age of this group and I'm so proud of 'em.  
COACH McGRAW: I would like to thank the Big East, it's been an unbelievable
run for us, since joining the conference. It elevated our program, it's been
exciting, and we owe a lot to the Big East for where our program is right now.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2013

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  
Notre Dame: 83  
Louisville: 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Louisville Head Coach Walz.  
COACH WALZ: I would like to thank the media for making the press conference,
unfortunately there isn't anybody from UConn in here and I understand they're
playing but with the uncertainty with what's going on for our tournament next
year and the conference support I would like to put a thank you out to the
UConn fans.  
I think it's spectacular with the attendance they had for the game tonight,
it's been an interesting six years since I've been here. Of course it was my
first year I said it's a shame we have to come up here and play a conference
tournament on somebody's home floor, which I will stick to that, but it is
really‑‑ actually I've made a few friends from the UConn fan base because when
they email me, I email them back and they're shocked, "Oh my gosh! He is
replying to his e‑mails?"  
I've had a few of them call and I don't have a secretary so I answer my own
phone and all of the sudden it's Walz, women's basketball and they're like
"Coach?" And I'm like, "Yeah!" I have had four or five of them come up to me
before the game. It's been a good six years for me, I've enjoyed it.  
I think they did a nice job of putting on a good tournament here and we'll see
next year where we are and who is playing in it and all that good stuff. For
the game, I thought we‑‑ I thought we fought. It got away from us, you know,
the first five minutes of the second half, we came out and we ran a‑‑ we
executed perfectly, the play that we wanted to run, got Antonita Slaughter a
wide‑open three and she has struggled from the 3‑point line. She is a 37%
3‑point shooter on the season and it's a 6‑point game and if that goes in it's
a 3‑point game and we got momentum in our favor. I think we got the miss and
got her a second one from the left wing in front of our bench that was wide
open and could not make it and then they started to score in transition.  
They did a nice job of scoring when they needed to and they made some big
shoots when they had to. Unfortunately for us our depth is not quite where it
is with the loss of Dyer, Taylor and Mo only being able to play 5 minutes in
the game. Right now I'm pleased with how hard our kids played, very pleased.  
I told them in the locker room there is nothing to hang your head about and
we're close. We're close, we're fortunate to be able to host the first two
rounds of the NCAA Tournament, obviously we have to win the first game to play
in the second but we're close to being able to make a significant run and
we'll be able to put things together and start it on the 24th.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Antonita Slaughter. She had a lot of trouble the
last two days, how much did it hurt that she couldn't hit a shot, especially
today?  
COACH WALZ: It hurts. You're talking about a kid that averages 10 points a
game and 37% from the three. She had good looks, really, really good looks
that normally go down for her so when you've got someone you're counting on to
score and unfortunately the ball is not going in, it makes it that much more
difficult on everybody else.  
  
Q. Sara and Shoni had the first 24 points for you guys tonight, how
important is it for a third shooter to step up?  
COACH WALZ: We've had one, Antonita Slaughter for the entire season has been
as consistent as any player I have coached. You go back to the first
conference game to 16, she has been consistently putting up 10 points a night,
getting seven, eight boards a night for us, doing a great job and we have to
get her back on board. Bria Smith we have to get to the boards more and get
her to knock down free‑throws.  
  
Q. Was Monique a product of playing the back ‑to‑back situation of‑‑  
COACH WALZ: Mo is a product of just some‑‑ she had the same surgery last year
that Greg Oden had. I still don't think he's playing. For her to even be out
here playing was great and she was doing well throughout the year. We're
limiting her minutes, then in practice one day she went in and landed funny
and chipped some cartilage in the back of her knee, in that same knee, they
scoped it, took the piece out and she is going to have to have surgery again
to repair the rest of it but she wanted to continue to try to play.
Back‑to‑back games are not a good thing for Mo. She is excited because she
knows from here on out if we can continue to advance she'll get a game, day
off, play a game, four or five days off, play, if we can win, day off, play,
so there is no more back‑to‑back games. If we had figured out a way to win
this game, she probably wouldn't be able to get out of bed tomorrow, so that's
part of it.  
  
Q. She was always one of my favorites when she was playing.  
COACH WALZ: When she was healthy, she was something else.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the dynamic of Shoni playing more "2" this year and
what she brings to the team?   
COACH WALZ: She gives us a better opportunity to get her shots instead of her
having the ball in her hands. We're trying to run her off screens without the
ball in order to get her open looks and she has adjusted to it well.  
I've been pleased with how she has performed. We're still giving her the
option if there is an outlet on a rebound and it's thrown to her to go with
it. So she is continuing to get better, I thought she played hard tonight, she
missed some shots, and she made some tough ones, so we're going to sit here,
watch the film, put some things together, good things we did and get prepared
for the NCAA Tournament. Hopefully we will get a 4 or 5 seed like I think we
should and get prepared to play.  
  
Q. Coach, Notre Dame had four players in double figures, nine scored for
them total, how difficult is it to deal with their depth?  
COACH WALZ: They're a very good offensive team, Skyler made some big shots
especially the first half. We tied the game up at 16 and she came out and hit
a three and I think she may have done that twice. But more so I was pleased
with how we defended‑‑ we let the game slip away in the second half because
she started to score on transition and then again, their depth, we have to
play with what we have. For us to be 24‑8 and finished tied for third in this
league with three kids that started at one point in time last year and Tia
Gibbs hasn't played in two years and started for us, I'm thrilled.  
I don't think people realize how well our kids have played and dealt with
adversity. You don't lose a player like Shawnta' Dire who is as strong in the
post as she was and rebounds the ball and not get affected by it but we have
figured out a way to keep it going and players have stepped up to keep it
working. I'm thrilled with where we are now and I'm looking forward to a good
run in the NCAA Tournament, which I think we're capable of doing but for the
most part I couldn't be more pleased with this group of players.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2013

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 83  
Louisville: 59

  
THE MODERATOR: With the victory tonight, joining us is head Coach, Muffet
McGraw, senior guard Skylar Diggins, junior guard, Kayla McBride. Coach?  
COACH McGRAW: Overall the defense was much better, we had some really good
stretches of defense, and I thought that offensively we got a lot of people
involved, good to see the bench come in and get a lot of playing time and most
of them did pretty well. I was pleased with Kaila Turner, I thought she
steadied us and Markisha Wright I thought had a great job, and I thought Kayla
McBride had a better second half than first.  
  
Q. Skyler, can you talk about your 3 ‑point shooting? It's increased the
last few games but talk about coming off the bench after the 16‑16 tie and
hitting the two threes.   
SKYLAR DIGGINS: My teammates did a good job finding me, I got a couple of good
spots, they did a good job of hitting me in transition and just when I was
open. We needed it, and we came back.  
  
Q. Muffet, what's it going to take for you guys to get that first title
tomorrow night for Notre Dame? Been in this six times and came up short each
one.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, we wanted to play in South Bend, that might have helped
us. For us we're going in with the same mind‑set we did with both the games
this year. Tough to beat a good team three times, it really it.  
I think it's going to be another war, and it will get us ready for the NCAA
Tournament, whether we win or lose.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about the difference between yesterday's game and
today's game? You seemed cooler today from the start of the game, almost a
little too excited yesterday.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I was pressing a little bit and the early foul trouble took me
out of my game a little bit. I think I was rattled, I just wasn't feeling
myself. Today I think I still like the first half. I was kind of pressing a
little bit, trying to force too many things. I think I needed to let the game
come to me and to play within myself.  
  
Q. Skyler, Shoni Shimmel hit three out of 4 in the last games, and what do
you do?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: She created her shots and we were giving her the three, we
didn't communicate, we were supposed to be doubling up, but nobody guarded
her, she is crafty and we put a hand in her face and made her take tougher
shots.  
  
Q. What would it mean for you to win this tournament?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It would mean a lot for our program, definitely the best ever,
and for our team to get a championship for Coach McGraw, a Big East
Championship, I think that's what we're missing besides a national
championship, an opportunity for us to make history and keep our year going.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what it does for you guys offensively when
Skyler is hitting three's and other people, too, Kayla?  
COACH McGRAW: 7 for 15, that's a great day for us from the 3‑point line. We
were more selective in the second half. I thought when Skyler is on she's
pretty much got the green light to shoot when she wants but we were trying to
move it more and Kaila Turner came in and that is her job and she did it well,
really pleased with her game all around.  
It opens things up inside for us and I think sometimes we get a little
infatuated with the three and we missed Natalie Achonwa a couple times inside
and I think we need to get the ball into her a little bit more.  
  
Q. Muffet, I did some quick math, around these parts we sometimes get
fatigued by the Yankees playing the Red Sox so many times and I did the math
and you guys in the last three years have played 10% of your games against
UConn. Are you fatigued by it, excited by it? How do you look at it at this
point?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, you know, in the NCAA Tournament you would much rather
play someone else, I think that's when you get to go against other conferences
and it's more fun, I think, to get those kinda games in the NCAA Tournament.
In the league you expect you're going to come up against them if you want to
get the championship. So I think it will be interesting, you know, when the
league changes next year that we won't have to play them three times in the
year and that could be refreshing.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was putting those guys away early in the second half
as opposed to dragging it out for forty minutes?  
COACH McGRAW: Yesterday we had to play the starters so long and South Florida
is such a great team. They matched up well with us so it was good to get the
starters a rest, and give them a break because they played so much yesterday.  
  
Q. Yesterday Coach said after the game that you guys would vote on the
jerseys, you guys weren't big fans?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Uh‑uh, I wasn't.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: No comment.  
  
Q. Sky, I know it's not under your control, but would it be disappointing if
it's not UConn in the championship tomorrow night?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Doesn't matter. No, it wouldn't be disappointing.  
  
Q. Skyler, can you look back and say what the four years playing in this
tournament has been like? You're either going to win tomorrow or you're not
going to want to discuss this so I figured I should ask tonight.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It's the best conference in the country, it's amazing playing
night in, night out, you're going to be challenged against any team you go up
against. A lot of great players, Final Four appearances with us playing UConn
is crazy, the way that these teams represent the Big East getting eight and
nine teams in the tournament. It's great competition and the Big East is what
prepares you for the NCAA Tournament, because you're going out playing Sweet
16, national championship caliber games every night. It's been great for me, a
blessing to come into this league at Notre Dame and I'm proud to be at Notre
Dame and we'll go out tomorrow, I'm glad I finished it in this league.

THE MODERATOR: We are joined by UConn. With the win tonight, they will play in
the finals tomorrow night against Notre Dame. We are joined by Head Coach Geno
Auriemma, junior center, Stefanie Dolson, junior guard, Bria Hartley and
sophomore forward, Kaleena Mosquesa‑Lewis. We will start with an opening
statement and questions for Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't even know what‑‑ that was a crazy game, I thought. You
know, we did a lot of really, really good things in the first half and we‑‑ we
got a lot of contributions from various people and we got ourselves, you know,
in a pretty good situation, playing pretty well defensively, offensively we
were a little bit inside/outside, great combination of stuff.  
So I thought I would go in at halftime and try to ruin it and I did. That's
about it.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on facing Notre Dame for a third time now.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't have any thoughts about it. I don't. I'm not playin'.
I'm going to coach the same way I coached the last two times we played 'em. So
what I think and how I feel, that doesn't matter one iota. I think what's most
important is how our players play tomorrow and how we play the whole game. How
we defend, how we run our stuff and how we put ourselves in a position to win
the game.  
We've done that, we just haven't been able to do it. If we can put ourselves
in a position to win the game tomorrow, I'm confident that we will win the
game.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're probably sick of the whole Big East breaking up, but
is it fitting that the two teams who dominated the league in the last decade
will meet in the championship game tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I guess, I mean, you know, we have been the only two
teams from our league to win national championships. Us and Notre Dame have
been to the most Final Fours. There is not a whole lot of nostalgia going on,
though in conference realignment. I don't think anybody goes to the meetings
and goes, for old time's sake I think we should do this.  
I don't know that anybody else is paying attention to it. I'm glad we're
playing in the game tomorrow night, I'm sure Notre Dame is glad they're
playing in the game tomorrow night, all the schools that are leaving and some
of the other schools probably wish it was somebody else. It seems like it's
been us and Notre Dame for a long time but we're the two best teams in the
league and it's fitting that the two best teams should play.  
  
Q. Ladies, what's the biggest difference against the team tonight and last
Monday night in South Bend?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think we're playing more aggressive, we have multiple
playmakers on our team and it's hard for teams to defend that so I think we
keep having that aggressive mentality going in will be special.  
  
Q. Bria last night you looked less hesitant to shoot the ball, today you
dished off seven assists, do you think you're start to go break out of the
funk you were in?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think so, I think I changed my mind to be more aggressive and
I think the coaches have been encouraging me to be more aggressive. Just have
to have a good mind‑set and be more confident when I'm out there on the floor.  
  
Q. Stefanie, Kaleena, do you guys sense you are part of a great thing here
at UConn, part of women's basketball these last for you years and is it hard
to look at the big picture and what the rivalry means to this sport?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: You mean being a part of it? Yeah, after the era of Tennessee
and UConn, it's definitely hard because there are so many‑‑ everyone is
talking about it and there is so much hype around it but I think we do a great
job of keeping each other grounded as players and focusing more on ourselves
as a group of Connecticut rather than, you know, Connecticut versus Notre Dame
all the time.  
So we're always there to support each other make sure that no one's head is
focused that.  
  
Q. Stefanie last time, triple, great game, what's got to change for you guys
to come out on top?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: We can't have 35 turnovers, that's 35 times we should have
had a shot. We have to do a good job of taking care of the ball and making
good decisions. We are all good passers and like Bria said, good playmakers.
Sometimes we don't make the right decisions. We have to stay strong as a group
and make good decisions.  
  
Q. Kaleena, what was happening tonight that kept you guys from getting any
good separation between you and Syracuse?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I thought we did a good job in the first half being
aggressive and everyone having a good continuity, Stef was scoring inside, and
Brea was, and everybody was getting to the basket and in the second half
everybody got‑‑ I think we just lost our flow somewhere and we kind of‑‑
Syracuse got us out of our own rhythm, started throwing the ball all over the
place and didn't have a lot of composure and on defense we weren't getting
them as much as we were in the beginning, we weren't forcing them to take bad
shots. That's something we have to continue for forty minutes, you know, it
needs to continue from the first half into the second half to make sure you
have a complete game.  
  
Q. Coach, Kayla had 14 points, she was doing well in the low post tonight
and she is the first SU player to get over 2,000 points, how impressed are you
with her play tonight and her senior year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: One of the big factors when we played them the first time was
that she got in early foul trouble and didn't spend a lot of time on the
court. They resorted to just, you know, trying to win just by taking outside
shots. Shows you the difference that she makes when she is on the court. She
got Stefanie in a little bit of a foul situation and she has probably improved
more from freshman year to senior year than any kid in the league. Right now
or that I can remember in recent memory.  
I remember when she was a freshman and watching her play her senior year she
has put herself in a situation‑‑ like in our league we have three of the best
centers in America and she is certainly one of them. I don't think you would
have been able to say that her freshman or sophomore year. That's how much she
has grown and how much she means to Syracuse's program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2013

  

### [Kayla Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24922)

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn: 64  
Syracuse: 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Head Coach Quentin Hillsman and senior center,
Kayla Alexander. Coach, an opening statement to start, please?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Obviously disappointed in the loss. Really wanted to win this
basketball game and obviously when you're playing against a team like UConn
you always want to come out and play as hard as you can and try to get a win.  
I thought our kids really competed at a tremendously high level. I thought
that every play was just so critical and there were times that we broke down,
but I thought we always made a run and made a play to get ourselves back into
the basketball game. Just really proud of my kids.  
It's tough to rattle off what we could have done and should have done, but
more than anything else I was proud of the effort of my players because when
the lead gets to 15 on a floor like this, they can easily go to 30, 40 and 50,
and our kids battled back.  
I thought we had opportunities down the stretch to get it to seven or eight to
make a few plays but you got to give UConn a lot of credit. Very good team,
very good players and they're a program that requires you to compete. You have
to compete every possession and they require to you compete at a high level.
They got it done, give them credit. They're a great team and tomorrow night,
UConn/Notre Dame is going to be an awesome game.  
  
Q. Coach, after last night's game you discussed the importance of Kayla
staying on the floor. She was able to do that tonight. Can you talk about her
play and her ability to stay the on the floor especially when you were making
that run late.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Obviously it made a huge difference. You can see it in the
outcome and in our defense and the way she scored in the post. She is a good
player, our best player and we have to have her on the floor to have any kind
of a chance to beat a team like UConn and tonight she required attention, she
got 12 free‑throws, that was big for us.  
  
Q. You look at where the team is now, and you're going to get a great seed
in the NCAA Tournament and you played great in the Big East Tournament and
from where Syracuse took over at this point and now it's the end of the line
for the Big East conference, can you talk about what it's been like reaching
this point and still having that kind of an end?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's funny because I was talking to bash Jacobs about it
yesterday and I said, you know, I grew up in this conference, this is where I
started, this was my first head coaching job was the Big East and I grew up in
this conference just starting to find my way and starting to get more
comfortable with being on the sidelines and coaching and this conference has
meant everything to me.  
Obviously I have some great colleagues and people in the conference office and
in different arenas, and getting to know the restaurants and the hotels, but I
think most of all for me it's about the vision for our program and where we're
going. I put a lot of trust in them and they have entrusted me with this
program and with these young ladies and I have 1000% trust in where we are
going and obviously we're going to a pretty good conference and there will be
some great teams in there but most of all it's new and exciting but obviously
I still have friends in this conference and in the conference office but our
administration is awesome and they have made great decisions from our
facilities down to the game management and to where we're going, so I got a
lot of faith in them.  
  
Q. Kayla, you passed the 2,000 point mark tonight you're the only player in
SU history to do that as you make your exit this year can you wrap your head
around that? Did you think you were going to get there when you first
started?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, when I first got here my freshman year my goal was to get
playing time and contribute in any way possible to the team. The fact that I
hit 2,000 that's mind blowing and I'm trying to wrap my head aren't that and
it goes back to the amazing coach that I have here and the amazing coaching
staff and my teammates who are always looking for me and I give it all back to
the program, because if it weren't for them I wouldn't be here right now.  
  
Q. Coach, touching on the conference move a little more, differing from the
Catholic Seven it seemed like an upgrade, you guys will continue to play Notre
Dame, Duke, North Carolina, Maryland, do you think that will impact on the
program, since you have had one of the best seasons in the school's history
and building the program's brand?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Obviously all the teams will be competing at a high level.
There is a lot of unknowns, there is. It's exciting, there is a lot of
unknowns, but the one thing that I'm very confident in is what our
administration has built for us at Syracuse that's given us the resources to
be able to compete with those teams and the resources to be able to recruit
nationally.  
I think that's the biggest thing nationally that we have gotten down south and
got some players from down south and that's all about our administration
giving us a championship budget and championship opportunities and that's
where the move would be bad if we didn't have the resources to do that but we
do and they provided it so we've got to get it done.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the second half and the end result, but I can't
remember the last half you guys ‑‑ you were down 15 and cut it to ‑‑  
COACH HILLSMAN: We talked about coming to this game that we couldn't have
those long drops and pockets where we couldn't score, and when we got it to 10
I called a time‑out and said we have to get two or three more stops to give us
a chance to win the basketball game. You can't keep trading baskets when
you're down 13 points. You have to go in and get some stops.  
This is a great team, when we got a bucket and got it manageable, Kaleena
Mosquesa‑Lewis hit a deep three and it's one of those things where players
make plays and they made plays and down the stretch we knew we were throwing
the ball to Kayla, she got the ball inside and that was the difference in the
game just staying manageable.  
  
Q. Just before you came in here, Geno Auriemma, coach of the Senior National
Team referred to you as the player that has improved the most from the time
you came into your freshman year to the time you are leaving. I just want to
know what that means to hear that type of praise from an opposing coach, as
the tournament winds down.  
KAYLA ALEXANDER: That's extremely flattering seeing that he coaches the Senior
National Team. I feel blessed that he said that, and I will use that as focus
and motivation to continue to improve my game. I'm very flattered.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2013

  

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

### [Rachel Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24924)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Syracuse: 61  
Villanova: 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Villanova we have Coach Harry Perretta and
senior guard Rachel Roberts, Coach?  
COACH PERRETTA: I thought we played well in the second half, like later in the
game, we kept playing which I was happy about and we were down 12 or 13 at one
point and, you know, we stayed in it, we kept playing. We made a little
adjustment in our offense, probably about 8 minutes to go, maybe, we made
adjustment and we started to get better shots.  
We made a couple of threes and were able to get ourselves back in the game. I
thought it was a good game, I think we played‑‑ not as well as we could have
under the circumstances but I thought Syracuse is a very, very good team so I
was happy we were able to get back in the game.  
  
Q. Rachel, unless you guys get seated for the regional tournament this is
possibly the last time you play competitively in Connecticut. Can you talk
about everything you do at Mercy and coming back here tonight. Can you talk
about how it feels to go out like that despite the result?  
RACHEL ROBERTS: Obviously it's bitter sweet. It's been fun, Connecticut is a
great state, born and raised. I love that my whole family got to come and see
this game. My high school coach was here, my AAU coach was here. It was good
to get a last competitive game out of our team. It would have ended
differently if Sweeney had been playing and we hadn't had that run in the
second half where we kind of‑‑ not gave up but let them get some easy baskets
and not getting our shots, but it's been fun and I'm blessed to be here.  
  
Q. Coach, Kayla Alexander had a big night for Syracuse. She had a big night
against you a week ago, why is it such a match ‑up problem?   
COACH PERRETTA: Because she is very good and big and strong inside. That's
what we're not. We're not a big, physical team but what we do is make a
conscious decision not to let her score but you have to stop‑‑ you can't try
to stop her and not stop her and let the other kids score, too, so what we
tried to do in the first two games we played was to double down a little bit
and she was going to get enough shots and the other kids we were able to hold
down and that's why we were able to win the first two games.  
Today, I think the major reason we didn't win today is we didn't score enough
points today. In the other games we were able to get into the 60s, today we
were not, and we were able to make the 3‑point shots in the other games which
we were not able to do today. But to answer your question point blank, she is
very talented. What I learned is when you try to stop her by doubling, she is
going to get points and you're going to allow somebody else to score so try to
play her honest as you can and try to stop others from scoring. That's what we
tried to do.  
  
Q. Coach, going into the next season with the conference shake ‑up, can you
touch a little bit‑‑ you've been in the Big East your entire career. Can you
talk about what it's been like to be in this conference and what you expect
competitivewise and going into the future?   
COACH PERRETTA: Being in the conference was wonderful, it helps everybody even
though Connecticut was the dominant team now Notre Dame is up there with them.
Even though those teams were dominant it helped the other teams because we
were able to get recruits who wanted to come and play against those teams so
it helped us that way.  
Now, the new league will help us in a couple of different ways. The schools
are evenly‑‑ I don't want to say evenly matched but if you look at the schools
they're similar academically, everything about them is similar, enrollment,
facilities, things like that.  
In that league you may get players because now you're going to be in a much
more competitive environment in terms of being able to compete for a
championship, so it's different in both. Both help you but it's the way that
college basketball has developed so there is nothing I can do about it but try
to deal with it.  
  
Q. Is there the hope that possibly down the road you can still play teams
like Connecticut and Notre Dame?  
COACH PERRETTA: Sure, yeah. We're going to try to schedule a tough,
nonconference schedule as best as we can. But probably it will be at least
another year away or two years away because the shake‑up happened so fast. We
have a contract for teams for two years so once those run out we can start
playing old rivals.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2013

  

### [Sara Hammond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24902)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Louisville: 62  
St. Johns: 55

  
THE MODERATOR: Louisville wins today, they await the winner of USF Notre Dame
and that game tomorrow will be 6 p.m., joining us is head coach, Jeff Walz,
along with sophomore forward Sara Hammond, sophomore guard, Bria Smith, Coach?  
COACH WALZ: I would like to say what a great job Joe has done at St. John's
with Eugenia, tearin' her ACL so early in the season, that's one kid I should
have recruited harder, she was important to their team and I think Joe has
done a great job of getting them to come together and there is no doubt many
my mind that they will be able to make a run in the NCAA Tournament as well.
For our kids I was pleased with how we started, two embrace the play, and we
have been talking about this for a month now. As soon as you start conference
tournament and the NCAA Tournament the only way they advanced is they can't
call a bunch of fouls, and that's the way I like it. I would rather call it
like this the entire year and our kids can get used to it. It's a physical
game.  
You're going to have to finish with contact and that's something I thought we
got away from, the last twelve minutes of the first half, we're shooting
fade‑aways, and that's when they made their return. We talked about them
embracing contact, I thought we started to look for the pack with the ball and
that's why we were able to get to the free‑throw line a few more times but we
were finishing around the basket and that was important for us.  
  
Q. Sara, can you talk about the interior game today and what you took
advantage of?  
SARA HAMMOND: That's what Coach told us, Coach told us to run the floor, get
'em tired and go to work inside because we have the strength and the size
advantage. And Coach just preached all week about toughness and physical
contact that we can't shy away from it because the refs aren't going to call a
foul. We have to use our strength and our advantage and it worked out good for
us today.  
  
Q. Sara, what was running through your mind after you had 10 points right
before the under 16 media time ‑out?   
SARA HAMMOND: I knew I had an advantage because they started four guards and
there was a guard guarding me and the coaches prepared us well for that and
they told us who was going to be guarding the post and I knew I had to take
advantage, I haven't been playing well the last couple of games and I wanted
to come out and show everybody that our post players are really good for our
team.  
  
Q. Coach, what did they do differently after you got off to that 15 ‑2
start?   
COACH WALZ: We went 1 for 20 at one point in time in the first half. We are
gettin' some great looks and Antonita Slaughter is not going to go 1 for 9
from the field very often and the six she took were wide‑open looks. Joe did a
nice job of putting two posts in the game which neutralized our advantage when
you have a 5‑8 girl trying to guard Sara that's to our advantage and as soon
as he did that we had two posts and the guards struggled tonight from the
3‑point line, we're 2 for 19.  
When I go back and watch this film 18 of the 19 were probably good shots. We
just couldn't put the ball in the basket, but what we did do is we kept
guarding and defend and go I thought‑‑ the way it started I was like, hey, if
we can keep this going we can put them away but only to be down 3 at half, I
was excited about. I was excited about how we came out at halftime, we had two
set plays drawn up, one against man and they started off in the zone and we
got Antonita Slaughter a layup and that got things going for us.  
  
Q. Bria, you know sometimes when some teams come out of byes a little slow,
you guys obviously didn't, but it was like a tale of two 10 ‑minutes in that
first half, your coaches mentioned after you came back out after halftime and
what he said to you, what were you two saying to one another to counter that
St. John's attack because they went to work for a while.   
COACH WALZ: We just tried to start out in the second half, and I think that's
what‑‑ the reason why we won this game is because we kept going on defense,
trying to get steals and making it hard for them to get easy shots.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2013

  

### [Jose Fernandez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24911)

### [Andrell Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24912)

### [Andrea Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24913)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 75  
USF: 66

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is USF head Coach, Jose Fernandez, while we wait for
the guards, Andrea Smith and Andrell Smith. Coach?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: I told our kids in the locker room that I thought there were
two stretches, from the 7 minute media and the 3 minute media and five or six
possessions in the second half in a 3‑minute span that we want from a close
game to 8, 9, and that's what hurt. It's disappointing for our guys, because I
thought our effort on both ends of the floor was really good. Definitely shot
the ball better than yesterday, so that was a plus. Gives us an opportunity‑‑
you know, when you got three guards that can score, I think we can play with
anybody in the country, and when Akila McDonald got into foul trouble it was
tough, she teed off on the glass. It's also hard to defend from the free‑throw
line. Our free‑throw line defense was bad. They shot 35 free‑throws, that's
tough to defend.  
So what's up, guys?  
  
Q. Jose, except for Baylor and UConn, south Florida played Notre Dame better
than anyone this year, and I'm wondering about the personnel, the dynamics
that led to that?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: If you watch our‑‑ some teams will watch and we do some
things differently defensively with their perimeter guys, on switch and stuff
and having our‑‑ we went with our five who played like a goalie and we didn't
guard one of their guys for a lot of time and I think when you got three
perimeter guys that can switch on a lot of stuff and keep things in front, you
can play well.  
I think, too, you know this team winning yesterday and with, what, six, seven
minutes to go it's a 2‑point game, the NCAA Committee and everybody in the
country was watching this game. I think we showed that this team belongs in
the NCAA Tournament and I think these guys did that today.  
  
Q. Coach, two questions. First, talk about the Smith and Smith Law Firm and
how well they played tonight, they had 45 combined and keeping you in the game
in the second half, just a tremendous job. Second part, last time playing in
this conference, what it means to you, the relationships you've built and that
aspect?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: First, I think these guys are successful because of how much
work they have put in. I've been doing this a long time, high school, junior
college, Division II, Division I, they are up there as probably the
hardest‑working guys I've ever coached. They're the first ones in the gym, the
last ones to leave. The amount of time they put in outside the 20 hours we're
allowed with them is unbelievable.  
So a lot of their success is how hard they work and I was happy that Andrell
had such a great game because I think she had been struggling offensively. But
to ask her to guard an All‑American for forty minutes and to play well
offensively that was a great performance. And Andrea has had a lot of
accolades in her career, she was one of three kids first‑team and Nation
Junior College Player of the Year, WBCA, and she is‑‑ second part of your
question, it's tough. The decisions that are made now by the league got
nothing to do with women's basketball, I think they're all football related
and TV revenue related.  
You are going to miss the relationships that you've built with the coaches in
the league but I still have my boy, Geno, still together. Got to move forward
and, you know, the league that we're going to be in, we will continue to move
forward and grow the game. We will be fine.  
  
Q. Coach, Natalie Achonwa went for 20/20, why was she such a big problem for
you guys to guard tonight?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: Well, I mean, she is a tough match‑up for us, I think we're‑‑
I think early we did a good job with her. There were a lot of small‑to‑big
screens that were set and we didn't do a good job defending that but I thought
when McDonald was not in we struggled with that.  
  
Q. Ladies, a bit of a delicate question but I needed to ask you this. Coach
was mentioning when UConn plays Notre Dame it always comes up, the free ‑throw
disparity, they take more free‑throws than anyone in the country. I'm
wondering competitively when you play them do you anticipate that's the case
and if you do, how difficult is it to get your mind straight that you're going
to have to beat them on the floor and they may have 20 more free‑throws than
you?   
ANDRELL SMITH: Going into the game we don't think about that, we try to attack
and be aggressive. That's a strength of theirs, getting to the free‑throw line
and they do a great job of that but we don't anticipate that before we go into
the game.  
  
Q. You sort of carried the team in the second half, I think you combined for
15 of the first 17 points, you had to try to get back, you were down 8 and
went on a 15 ‑something run to take the lead.   
ANDREA SMITH: We wanted to attack. Our teammates build off us so if we get 'em
going they're going to come along and they push us as well as we push them so
we wanted to get out and attack and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Ladies, I have a question for you. I wanted to ask you about the dynamics
of playing together for so long, how much you enjoy playing? You're so much
fun to watch because you always seem to know where the other is going to be.  
ANDRELL SMITH: Its really fun playing with this girl right here, it means
everything to me. She is my best friend on and off the court and she makes me
better as a player, as a competitor and as a person. It means everything to
have her out there and I'm upset that we're leaving the Big East, but we're
looking forward to doing bigger things.  
ANDREA SMITH: She is also my best friend and she makes is easy to play the
game of basketball and she knows when I'm about to hang my head, and I don't
need to hang my head, so she is right there in my ear. I love this coach, but
she is always there for me, and she has made the game of basketball fun.  
  
Q. Ladies, when you're playing in a pro UConn crowd, obviously they wanted
to see Notre Dame lose, how important was it to have the crowd behind you the
way they were?  
ANDRELL SMITH: It was very important. It was momentum, we had felt good to
have people there cheering for us because it's hard to have Tampa fans come so
far up here, you know what I mean, but it felt good to have people behind our
back, but we knew why they were cheering for us, we weren't going to question
it, you know, we loved and that was the good thing about it, that was okay for
us. We enjoyed it, we really did!  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
ANDREA SMITH: I could show you my number!  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2013

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Anna Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23278)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn: 94.  
DePaul: 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from DePaul is Coach Doug Bruno and senior guard
Anna Martin. Coach?  
COACH BRUNO: Thanks for staying, just met the rest of the media on the way out
so thanks for sticking around.  
I thought our players did a much more competitive job tonight than we did a
couple of weeks ago at Storrs, and it's hard to say that when the score is
what the score is, and it's difficult for our players when their coach plays a
fast‑style game, which we do, and I've done this long enough where I've tried
to slow things down when you have a team that plays one way and then you think
you can slow 'em down for a single game and it doesn't work.  
This is a hard team to play fast with and that's one of the places where I put
our players in a tough position because we play, like they play, except they
play it better than we play it, and when you try to‑‑ not trying to go up and
down with them but at the same time it's difficult to put reigns and harnesses
on our players where‑‑ that's one place where I think I personally victimized
our own players yet in the long run it's going to pay dividends. I thought
they were better today than they were in Storrs a couple of weeks ago,
February10th. The other silver lining is that you try to find in games like
this are the second half we did have a lead and we were trying to win the
second half and we got this thing to where we were up by a point and then we
took a couple of tough shots and lost the second half by 6 or 7 points.  
We're not‑‑ we didn't come here to win a half but once the game gets out of
hand you have to play the games within the game to try to get something
accomplished within the game.  
The player sitting next to me and Katherine Harry, two seniors are two great
young people in our program, and I want to publically thank them for
everything they have done and I think will continue to do in the NCAA
Tournament. I trust we have earned our way in. Somehow something got written
that maybe we had to beat UConn in order to get in, but I didn't mean that
yesterday. I made the point that you never belive you are in until you see
your name, but I really do belive this team has earned their way into the NCAA
Tournament with a 24, 25 RPI this morning, strength of schedule is 12, 13 this
morning, and that's going to be now 8 or 9 before it's over with.  
But Anna and Katherine are two seniors that I wanted to thank for their
efforts and what they have given to DePaul University. I thought Brit Hrynko
in the second half, I had to tell her, "You're being taken out by a good
defense. You have to be a facilitator here. You can't take shots you can't
make," and I think she settled down in the second half and began taking some
shots‑‑ or becoming more of a distributor, and I think that was really a
growth process. That's only going to help us down the line.  
I think it's important when you have a good defense such as this and they're
taking you out you can't play in this game 1‑on‑5, and I think we got that a
little bit‑‑ another game within the game that we were working on. Again, I
want to thank the seniors; they've been great.  
  
Q. Coach, final game in the Big East Conference Tournament before you move
on to the Catholic Seven. Can you talk about your experience in terms of the
past and what you expect for the level of play and the competition in the
future?  
COACH BRUNO: I think it was said by somebody, maybe it was Geno, that the
league got stronger when the league restructured with all of us entering in
2005 and '6 so‑‑ and we helped the Big East get stronger, and it's been a
great conference for DePaul Women's Basketball, and I think we have held our
own and finished as high as second place once and been in a good, strong
competitive mix throughout, so I think it's been a mutually beneficial eight
years.  
I really do want to thank all the people that went before us that set up the
Big East, which is Dave and Mike and John, for all that they have done, and I
think Geno deserves credit for some‑‑ he set a standard, a gold standard here
that helped bring in order in order and all the rest of us up, and I think he
deserves some credit for that, and I think Muffet also deserves credit and
those of us who joined in league eight years ago, Louisville and ourselves and
Marquette, we have done some good things for this league.  
It has been a great eight years, it's going to be‑‑ it gets a little bit
nostalgic now that it's over, the competition is over, so it starts to really
sink in that this is the last tournament, but we will move on in the Catholic
Seven, it's not going to be called the Catholic Seven, but the new league is
going to be a great league in its own right. I think the challenge in the new
league is for someone ‑‑ and I expect it to be DePaul University to step up
and make ourselves‑‑ take what we have learned from this league and make
ourselves a UConn.  
That's what our goal is, to take ourselves to the next level. We've been a
nice little 15 to 25 to 30‑place team in the country, and I think somebody has
to step up and do what they do and I think that's the challenge in the new
league with the new teams.  
  
Q. Anna, can you discuss the challenge today? They had 46 points in the
point and 12 three ‑pointers. You can't defend everything.   
ANNA MARTIN: They're UConn. That's the reason they are one of the best.
They're just hard to guard, every position is so talented and they move the
ball well, and they're great in transition, too. I thought we competed today,
but obviously was not happy about the score.  
  
Q. You coached with Geno over the summer on the Olympic Team and Geno was
saying with a balanced offense, how tough is this team when they sub and they
don't lose a lot, and when others substitute they might lose a level of
play.  
COACH BRUNO: I think this team is one of the great three in the country, they
have one of the best chances to win a national championship, and what makes
them great is their talent and it's difficult to have to play against this
level of player and they are deep. They're starting to get Stewart playing and
that's huge, Moriah Jefferson plays today and Kelly Faris is nursing an injury
and it's nice to have the luxury to be able to not‑‑ just to be able to go as
deep as they go so I think it's going to be a great national championship and
it's going to be difficult for anybody to do but I think it can be done, it's
a special UConn group, it really is.  
I didn't watch the UConn, Notre Dame game until last night, I didn't have a
chance to look at it until last night. It was a great drama game but it wasn't
necessarily a great played game for the talent on the floor but these are two
special basketball teams along with Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach, it was a 3 ‑point game and then UConn reeled off a number of
points in a number of seconds. How difficult is it to play under the type of
pressure knowing that one or two bad possessions could let them run away with
the game quickly?   
COACH BRUNO: Like I said, you're not a coach that's going to run the ball
around the gym with a shot clock, Nova uses a shot clock in practice they're
going to be playing defense with their offense and that's not how we play and
it's not how we can play.  
Then you have to control the second shots, which we didn't. They just went
right over us to get the second shots, so it's one thing when you're making
stops and it's another thing when you're making stops and they jump over you
and go get the board. I know we can block out, I would like to have seen us‑‑
but that's what coaches beef about, block out, block out, block out, it's just
a function of people moving and you have to be able to find people to block
out and they're bigger and stronger and they get the second shot factor.  
And we're not good at guarding them off the bounce, and now they start
shooting the ball very, very well and they throw two in off the backboard in
the first half, six 3‑point shots and neither one of them was intended to be
off the backboard, and one of them was right in front of us off the glass and
tucked in from straight ahead and this basketball is a combination of offense
and defense. Offense feeds defense and defense feeds offense. When you're good
offensively you're good defensively and when you're good defensively, you're
good offensively and I got them in a place where we're not getting shots easy,
and I have to take the blame for that.  
I think we got in the place of getting good shots‑‑ never easy against UConn
and the reason you don't get good shots against UConn is because they're a
good defensive basketball team and when they are good defensively they're a
special team, back to Doug's question, when they're focused and guarding you,
they are really, really good defensively. So it's not that easy to get good
looks and you start taking shots that don't have a chance to go in, that's
what qualifies as a bad shot and that's the same as a turnover so you start
feeding into it and it becomes give it up at one end and give it back on the
other end, you've giving it up at two ends and that takes the score in an
opposite direction fast.  
  
Q. Anna, I wanted to ask you about the concept of conferences as an elite
player. Four years ago when you were trying to decide where you wanted to go
to college, how important was it that DePaul was in the Big East? Is
conference affiliation important to you, or is the institution more important
than the affiliation?  
ANNA MARTIN: I came to DePaul for many reasons and the Big East of one of
them, but I can't say. I love DePaul for the coaches, the team, the
administration, and I love the team so I can't really say.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ANNA MARTIN: I guess you can't predict that. I guess we'll see what happens
next year, but I'm a senior, so I'm lucky I don't have to make that decision.  
COACH BRUNO: John, we had a Sweet 16 team coming in in 2006 and that was with
the conference USA League, and we're not going away. With the Big East as it
was, or with the Big East as it's going to be we're not going away. We will
find people that can play competitive basketball and I can guarantee you that.  
  
Q. Anna, you have missed a lot of time this year, can you assess the
chemistry. You guys are 4 ‑6 in the last 10 games and what do you need to
improve on in terms of chemistry going into the NCAA Tournament?   
ANNA MARTIN: I think we have not reached our potential yet, and that's
exciting going into the NCAA Tournament because you want to be your best,
going into the NCAA Tournament. But I think with me coming back, like Coach
said, one person coming in changes everything so I think we have to play
together and stay close as a group and I think our best is yet to come.  
COACH BRUNO: Usually it's hard during this time of year to have two weeks off
before you play again and with this group I'm looking forward to it for them
to get their rest, we're going to finish finals before the first game of the
NCAA Tournament so we will get finals out of the way and get some rest and
have a chance to retool and try to fix some of the things that have been very
difficult to fix through the year because we have not had the team whole all
year.  
It's been a constant lose one, get one back, lose one, get one back, and you
have to overcome injuries but this has been more difficult than last year, for
instance, because last year Jan 15th, we knew the seven kids that were going
to play the rest of the year and they did and this year it's this one is in,
this one is out, these two are in, these two are out and that's what Anna is
referencing, and I think we have a chance to play our best basketball. I don't
think we have come close to playing our best basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Shenneika Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20544)

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Louisville: 62  
St. John's: 55

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach, Coach Tartamella, with Briana Brown
and Shenneika Smith, Coach?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Obviously a tough loss but I thought we did a great job of
fighting back after a slow start and proud of the way we were able to get back
into the game.  
A stretch that hurt us, I thought, the free‑throw block‑out that they got
put‑back in, I thought that was an area that we struggled and to be able to
survive I was proud of how we were able to fight back and get back into the
game.  
Obviously we looked to get ready hopefully for the postseason.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have an update on Nadirah McKenith and what happened?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: I don't have an update and she turned and got hit, I haven't
heard anything from the trainer. They're still checking her out and hopefully
she'll be okay. I think she turned and ran into somebody and I think it kind
of jarred her a little bit. I think she checked her nose, her nose was fine as
far as I know.  
  
Q. Shenneika, after that start, was it a strategy change that got you back
into it or some composure that kicked in for you?  
SHENNEIKA SMITH: We just took one possession at a time, in practice we go
through stop scores and score shots, and you know my team was all up on me, I
had some big shots, some tough shots, we took one possession at a time. We
kept our composure, we have been down like this before and we kept each
possession and tried to be successful and play defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you addressed it a little bit, but can you talk about where you
think you stand in the NCAA Tournament? Do you think you've done enough?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: I think we had a great year, especially in the finish, I
hope that will be taken into account, finishing 11‑5 in our conference we
always feel is tough to do, so I think that speaks for itself.  
I think we have challenged ourselves in the nonconference to give us a strong
strength of schedule and I'm proud of the young ladies that we have, the two
to my left and the young ladies in the locker room as well and the way they
fought toward the end of the year.  
I think if you look at the big picture we feel good where we are but you never
know and that's why I thought this was important for us to try to get as far
as we could in the conference tournament.  
  
Q. Briana, could you talk about the defensive effort against a Louisville
team that puts up points?  
BRIANA BROWN: They are a tough team. We have to go out there and defend. We
are a tough team and we are physical and that's just what we are. We keep
goin' hard, even when we're down points like we were before we still try to
defend and keep going and be tough.  
I think that's just who we are.  
  
Q. Coach, when you got down 15 ‑2 you put in the second post and was it the
inside game that helped you out there?   
COACH TARTAMELLA: Yeah, Sara Hammond hurt us and they were exploiting us in
that area and I felt we needed to play bigger and our staff felt if we were
hurt going into the game we would do that, and I also think we picked up our
energy level and took away easy baskets.  
I thought we started to get them to rush a little bit with some pressure,
which I thought helped us get back into the game.  
We had to play probably bigger than we have played all year for an extended
period of time, so it helped us, we had to, Sara Hammond was hurtin' us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23275)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn: 94  
DePaul: 61

  
THE MODERATOR: With this win tonight Connecticut advances to the semifinals,
facing the winner of the Syracuse Villanova game tomorrow night at 8 PM,
joining us is Coach Geno Auriemma, freshman forward Breanna Stewart, sophomore
forward Kaleena Mosquesa‑Lewis, junior center Stefanie Dolson check that.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I would say the same thing I said to our team after the game,
we played a really good basketball game.  
The game was well played by a lot of our players, individually and as a team,
and, you know, coming off of a pretty emotional game last Monday and we had an
opportunity to come out and play. A team that I think is one of the harder
teams to defend in our league. You saw that one stretch where, when they
started making shots, they're really, really‑‑ they're really hard to defend.
We had to make sure we had the right match‑ups in there all the time.  
So I'm really, really happy with what we did and I'm looking forward to
tomorrow.  
  
Q. How pleased are you with the impact that you got tonight and the freshmen
all together?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I had an inkling that Stewie would play better than she
has in a while because she practiced better this week than she has in a while.
I saw today some of the same things I saw Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and
it carried over into today. That's a good sign. Stewie is used to playing USA
Basketball, where you play for, like, eight or nine games, then you go back
home.  
She thinks three games this week and then maybe six after that, so this is her
way of doing‑‑ five months, she said "That's not what I signed up for, man,"
so I think she is in her comfort zone now.  
  
Q. Stefanie what did you think of Stewie's performance tonight?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think she did a good job of not second‑guessing herself,
making decisions quickly, being extremely aggressive, cutting to the basket
and doing a really good job not standing still and making sure she is always
moving and always being aggressive and defensively she had a few blocks, a few
rebounds, definitely happy with how she played. Keep it up.  
  
Q. Stef and Kaleena, if there was one thing that the needed to straighten
out afternoon Monday night and get back on the right track, back in the right
direction, what would it have been?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I think we need to do focus on rebounding
aggressiveness offensively and defensively and when we came out into the game
we picked up the intensity on the glass, everyone was going after the glass,
whether it was someone starting or coming off the bench.  
  
Q. Kaleena when you beat a team by 50, like you did last month against
DePaul, how important is it to get off to a good start like you did?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It's really important. We don't want to take any teams
lightly, and they're a good team, a well‑coached team and this is when teams
play better than they have all season so we wanted to make sure we came out in
the beginning of that first half and be aggressive and play Connecticut
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the balance on this team tonight. You had 46 points in
the paint, 12, 3 ‑pointers, five players in double figures, and how important
it is to get that kind of a balance?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought we had a little bit of an advantage against
DePaul, they're much more of a perimeter team and I thought Stef could have a
good game if we got her established and also with Stewie, and that's when you
know you have played well when you get that kind of balance. Sometimes you
just don't get it, sometimes it's just you're forcing, you know, the issue and
today I thought we just played. When shots were there we took 'em, we got the
ball where we wanted them to get it and, you know, I've seen her shoot great
from the 3‑point line and poorly from the 3‑point line, but very rarely have I
seen her miss when we get the ball into the paint.  
  
Q. Stewie, how do you build upon such a performance, after such an up
‑and‑down stretch for you, how do you build off this over the next two games
and into the NCAA Tournament.   
BREANNA STEWART: I mean, I think that just coming out and playing confident
and really just looking to shoot when I'm open and anything I can do to help
this team.  
  
Q. Geno, why did you start Mo and how do you think she did?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why did I start her? Part of it was I thought it was a good
match‑up, you know? We wanted to pick them up full court and disrupt. Their
offense is really good, you saw it during that one stretch if you don't get
pressure on the ball they get wide‑open shots, it's a fun offense to watch if
you don't have to coach against it. I thought that was the easy answer, so you
could put pressure on the ball. The hard answer is, at some point she is going
to have to play and she is going to have to play well. And it's getting more
difficult to get her in situations that are comfortable for her. If you put
her in, you bring her in off the bench and we're winning that's easy, if you
bring her in off the bench and we're struggling, that's difficult on her as a
young freshman and that's what happened in the Notre Dame game. Best way to
make sure she is in a game at a time when it means something, it's a little
bit of both, I'll start her and see what happens. First couple of minutes,
okay, after that, really good, really good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference in this team when the freshmen are
playing and getting things done like, they were tonight, talk about that.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're talking about three really, really talented players
that if they play really well, then if we sub and the other team subs, I would
hope that the level of play doesn't drop too much from‑‑ there shouldn't be a
huge gap between Stefanie and one of the freshmen big guys or even Kiah Stokes
who played pretty well tonight. Because I think that's the wear‑down that it
does to the other team.  
They've got to get their other guys into the game, too, but their guys may not
be as talented as our guys and then they have to hurry up and put their
starters back in and after a while it catches up with you. So it's important
for them to contribute just a little bit, they don't have to do a lot, they
just have to do a little bit.  
In the first half it was great, whoever we put in they played exactly like we
wanted them to play and I got cocky and said, let's put them out there and see
what they do, and at one point I said I'm glad we're up 30, because if I put
you guys out there another 7 minutes, we're tied. It's true!  
  
Q. How is Moriah when she is pressured and does she have the ability to
stabilize the offense in that sort of a situation?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, she doesn't and I don't know any freshman point guard in
America who does, that's why none of them are worth a shit. There is not one
team playing for a national championship, I think, that has a freshman point
guard, because it's hard. But having said that, I want her response to be,
against pressure, to attack the basket like she did today. Because pulling it
out and trying to get us into an offense, that's not going to happen. That's
not going to happen. Is Mel here? (Laughter.) So as long as she stays
aggressive, I'm good. I'll live with anything else she does, as long as she
plays defense, gets ball pressure and when she feels pressure and sees an
opportunity she attacks the basket and something good will happen. Right now,
that's what you can expect, what we can expect, I think, from Moriah and
that's exactly what she did today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2013

  

### [Kayla Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24922)

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  
Syracuse: 61  
Villanova: 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Syracuse head coach, Quentin Hillsman, and senior
center, Kayla Alexander. Syracuse advances to tomorrow night semifinals, they
play UConn tomorrow night at 8 p.m. Coach, a quick opening statement?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I thought the key in the game was our second half. I
thought that in the first half, we did a very good job of recognizing
shooters, and I thought the second half we did a better job of contesting.
They got some open ones second half but all the ones they got that they shot
when we matched up, we did well.  
I got to give our kids credit they did a good job sticking to our game plan,
Villanova is tough and they played 5 out and everything they do goes against
every principle in our zone and we had to make sure we contested every shot.  
Coach Reid did a great job of breaking down the tape and gave us two or three
things to concentrate on and nutrilize some of their three's. We knew we had
to make 50% of our shoot from the field to offset their 35% from the 3‑point
line. I got to give my kids credit, they just really competed like crazy and
our staff did a very good job of preparing us for the game. Proud of them for
sticking with it. It's tough being here with two days off and obviously we
were anxious to play and game. Glad we came out on top.  
  
Q. Kayla, you matched your career high with 34 points today. Can you talk
about the strategy and obviously they didn't have anyone to guard you down the
post.  
KAYLA ALEXANDER: Honestly I give it all back to my teammates. They were
looking inside, and I thought we were playing a good inside/outside game,
where they were open on the outside they were going to attack, and open on the
inside they were going to hand me the ball, and they kept giving to me, and I
don't score unless my teammates give me the ball, so I give it all back to my
teammates.  
  
Q. Kayla, you go into the game tomorrow against Stewart and Dolson, how are
you preparing mentally?  
KAYLA ALEXANDER: Mentally we have to get ready to be prepared to go hard
tomorrow and we have to give your "A" game, like on the inside, the post and
around the arc.  
  
Q. Coach, can you address her development over the past four years and have
you had a player that has made more strides in a four ‑year span than she has?
  
COACH HILLSMAN: I always tell her she is my life line. She really is and when
you have a player this talented. You have to find a way to make her better. I
think she developed over summer, and I had to find a way to develop as a coach
to make sure we gave herthe ball inside. My challenge this summer, I told her
to go get better and be able to play in the mid‑post and in the elbow and I'm
going to get better and find a way to get you the ball every possession.  
I think if she didn't do her job my job didn't matter. So she did her job
really well and I did my job okay but she make me look good, so I got to give
her credit as we're getting better.  
  
Q. What does this mean for the program, beating Villanova, winning your 24th
game, most in school history.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Obviously, this is how it was set up, you don't want to be the
team that doesn't advance when you're set up to advance. Now we played today,
we both going into the game tomorrow night with some legs and it's going to be
a tough game, obviously, we understand who we're playing, UConn is a very good
basketball team and they can score from all five positions on the floor but
it's a great opportunity. To play against a great basketball team we relish
that and want to compete as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Kayla, talk about the ‑‑ it's been a long road for you, and it's all
coming together at the same time, your individual success and the team
success, can you wrap it up for us?   
KAYLA ALEXANDER: I think it started in the preseason, we had four freshmen
competing and contributing from the start and we were going to keep each other
accountable and take no short cuts. We were going to get things done. I think
that held us accountable and it helped us throughout the season. Now we're
starting to enjoy what we have accomplished right now, trying to go out there
and play hard and have fun playing basketball and doing what we all love and
compete as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Coach, you played UConn earlier this year in this building what do you
need to do this time to have a better result?  
COACH HILLSMAN: First thing is keep her on the floor, because she was in foul
trouble the whole game so we have to keep our best players on the floor and we
have a chance to compete.  
We can't foul ourselves out of the game and Connecticut pushes every
possession and they pretty much pound you into submission, grabbing the fouls
and we got to make sure we get back in transition, see the floor, get matched
up and guard 'em.  
It's a great, great team and we know that. This is the best conference in the
country when you look at Notre Dame and Connecticut, they're going to be
there. So we have a great opportunity to play against one of the best teams in
the country, two of the top three teams are in our conference so we get to
play 'em every year and obviously we're playing UConn twice this year so it's
a great opportunity for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2013

  

### [Natalie Achonwa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21816)

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 75  
USF: 66

  
THE MODERATOR: With Notre Dame's win they get the spot in tomorrow's
semifinals, they will face Louisville, and while we wait for the players we
will take an opening statement from Coach Muffet McGraw.  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Natalie's numbers were record setting at Notre Dame,
20/20, it's an accomplishment and tied the record for most double/doubles at
Notre Dame but I thought Ariel Braker was the player of the game, she made so
many big plays when we needed them, she got put‑backs, made a couple of
jumpers, above and beyond her call.  
She is one of our best defenders and rebounders, but she helped us on
tonight's game, and that was instrumental and I thought Madison Cable off the
bench was a huge, huge game.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the sequence where she hit that jumper and
blocked a shot by Smith and that run you had late in the second half?  
COACH McGRAW: She was all over the run, she did it at both end of the floor,
refused to lose.  
She played more minutes than I hoped she would have to but she got us goin' at
both ends of the floor. I think she gave us energy, the intensity we needed
and she is so smart, she knew when to switch out and did a great job, that was
a key play, I thought that started the run.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about the game, 20/20 was huge, she got every big rebound
early on, and they made a run at you early and she came back to make it 55
‑51, talk about this year and what it's been like tonight.   
COACH McGRAW: She's been big for us all year long, in the second half she was
4 or 5 in the field, she didn't miss much, we got down 4 we needed something,
we were trying to go inside, especially when Akila McDonald got in foul
trouble, I thought that was important, that we go inside.  
  
Q. How did you turn things around to give you that 10 ‑0 run to give you
that lead in the first half?   
COACH McGRAW: I thought Michaela Mabrey when she hit that 3, that was a big
part of the run we needed. We got out in transition a little bit but we were
"off" for a lot of the game, Kayla McBride was off in the first half and we
didn't have our normal good rhythm. I thought the game was a track meet, and
we didn't keep up at times.  
We defensively at times had major breakdowns, but overall I thought we did
finally rebound when we had to, and it was closer to halftime in the
rebounding so we thought we did a better job in the second half.  
  
Q. Muffet, with the exception of UConn and Baylor, South Florida played
Notre Dame as close as anybody in the season, is that something that made that
possible in your mind?  
COACH McGRAW: Anytime you make shots you can beat anybody. I think that's the
key for any team offensively and they made ten 3s, it was like playing
Villanova, we lost 'em for a second and they hit a shot, we had our hands down
for a second and they hit a shot.  
I think they're a great team, they have speed, great team speed, they push the
ball well, McDonald has improved, she is big for them inside, you know, they
know their role, and they can shoot themselves in or out, yesterday they
couldn't make a shot, they saved them all up for today, I guess, and they
played well. I think they're a great team.  
  
Q. Sky, talk about the game and coach said before you came in that it's like
surviving in advance now, now it's just about getting wins, not if they're
pretty or not, but if they go well.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Natalie is a great player, like coach said, we were trying to
get the ball inside to her, she was great at moving without the ball and she
knows her spots and pick and chooses them well, she did a great job at the
free‑throw line and getting there and got the big rebounds when we needed 'em.  
Every game is an elimination game so as long as we're winning.  
  
Q. Natalie, how physical was tonight's game under the boards? You had 20
rebounds but did you have to work to get those?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Yeah, definitely, especially when a team is quick and their
guards come down and rebound like this that, too, I felt sometimes like I was
boxing out multiple people and they were aggressive and attacking and I worked
for the‑‑ like you saw, a couple I turned over so it was a battle for every
one.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about what turned around the second half in terms
of the shooting?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: The first half I was trying to force too much, I came back
with the ball and I tried to shoot the jumper and I traveled so the second
half I worked before I got the ball so it was catch and shoot. The guards did
a great job of finding me off plays and padded it inside.  
  
Q. Ladies, you look at Louisville, coming up next and they're similar in the
fact that Hammond played well inside and how do you prepare for a mirror image
type of game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think its just focusing on what we do in shoot around and
personnel. If we can transfer over from the tips its smart. We were
aggressive, like today, we were almost too aggressive and not smart. I think
we were running at people that aren't shooters and leaving wide‑open shooters
so as long as we stick to our personnel and the time we put in before the game
I think we will be all right.  
  
Q. Coach, do the uniforms stay or go after this game?  
COACH McGRAW: It's a team vote, I get no say in that. Whatever they want to
do. I'm good with that. It will be interesting, though, I think Louisville has
the same uniform so it could be adjusting the TV sets tomorrow when they see
that coming.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think you saw it with football last year when they
came out with all those crazy things and Adidas wanted to get something out
that was different, and eye‑catching. I like the color, the lime green, I like
that part of it, I think it makes a statement.  
I think they're trying to get on the cutting edge and I saw a couple of Tweets
from kids that we aren't recruiting but players saying wow, love the look of‑‑
there was a picture of all 5 teams in the "New York Times" and young people
like 'em. They're younger than I am.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is Nebraska head coach Connie Yori, returning 8
letter winners and four starters that won 25 games and advanced to the NCAA
Sweet 16. Coach?  
CONNIE YORI: Happy Halloween. I'm masquerading as a real person today, 90% of
the time I have sweats, so this is unusual for me.  
Just a little bit about what's happened in our program in the last six months
and we will go from there. The last six months there has been a lot of good
things in Nebraska women's basketball. We've been to a Sweet 16. We opened a
brand new arena that in Lincoln; it's beautiful. We have been granted an NCAA
regional, Lindsey Moore was drafted in the first round of the WNBA draft,
Jordan Hooper played with USA Basketball, gold medal team, so we have had a
lot of good things that have happened.  
We're different this year than last with the loss of Lindsey and we don't have
anybody masquerading right now as Lindsey in our practices, I wish we did. But
it has changed us a little bit and just because you're older doesn't mean
you're better so we've got a lot of work to do.  
  
Q. Can I get your reaction to earning the conference preseason team of the
year honors?  
CONNIE YORI: I think this is the first time in Nebraska women's basketball
history that we have been picked to win whichever league we have been playing
in. I didn't pick us to win the Big Ten and I'm not sure why everybody else
did, because we have a lot of work to do, but, you know, the poll is for you
guys to have an opportunity to write about something, what else you going to
be doing this time of year. Gives you a chance to write about women's
basketball. That's how we look at it and it doesn't change what we do or who
we are. It does put more of a target on our back, but, yet, we still go about
our business and try to do the things we always do.  
  
Q. A little more about Lindsey Moore. How hard is it to replace a four ‑year
starter at point guard, especially one as talented as she was over those
years, maybe even under rated compared to other guards, I think. How hard is
it to replace those people?   
CONNIE YORI: I didn't underrate her. I felt like the last several years she
has been one of the best point guard in the country. We knew that. We knew
that internally within our program and we knew‑‑ we were aware of the little
things that she did for us. She made everybody around her. I think that's what
any good player does but particularly at that spot. It is hard to replace her.
As I said there is nobody in our program who is going to replace Lindsey, we
have to do it collectively, everyone has to get better, we have to get more
products of our returning starters and they have got to expand their game.
Rachel Theriot will be moving to point guard but that leaves a void at the
wing spot. There is a reason why Lindsey rarely left the floor. There is a
reason why she is the all‑time leading minutes player and the all‑time leading
assist player in our program. She is that good. We're missing a key ingredient
from where we were last year, that's why in some ways for us to be picked
where we have been is surprising. I don't know if people realized how good she
really, really was.  
  
Q. Coach, can Jordan being on your team, she has proved the type of player
she is but talk about her role in leading the team in other aspects, in
practice, off the court, that type of thing.  
CONNIE YORI: I think Jordan's experience with USA basketball has made her more
confident. It's also made her more vocal. Jordan is a quiet kid and for her to
four years ago be playing at a rural high school in Nebraska, a ranch kid, to
go all the way to playing with USA basketball in Russia is a huge expansion of
who she is and where she has come from.  
So I think it takes time‑‑ it has taken time for her to become a leader for
us. She is always going to be a leader by example. She has always been that
force but we're asking her to do more in terms of being vocal and I think she
is accepting that but it's not necessarily something she is entirely
comfortable with.  
  
Q. Coach, you're the beneficiary of the regional site moving to campus this
year, but overall what are your thoughts on that? How does that if at all
change how you and your team function throughout this season?  
CONNIE YORI: We were surprised we earned a regional, we thought we were going
to get a first and second round at our place and that was what we had expected
and when we earned a regional I had to check and make sure it was us. But I
think earning a regional is‑‑ couple of reasons. We have a brand new arena and
we have a great fan base. Those two things combined have allowed us to earn
that and the fact that we are‑‑ our program has been solid over the years,
that doesn't hurt, obviously.  
We're excited to be in that position but to be playing on those dates is
another thing, whether that comes to fruition. In terms of the big picture and
what is happening with women's basketball I'm overall a proponent for what is
going to happen in the future with going back to the top 16 seeds hosting and
having neutral regionals.  
  
Q. I'm curious to know your thoughts on the rule changes particularly the
backcourt rule. How will that change your style of play? For it? Against it?  
CONNIE YORI: It will be interesting to see how it plays out. I don't think it
will be significant but I guess we're going to find out. We have had a couple
of scrimmages where we have had officials come in and now one exhibition game
and I think only one time did it impact us. I don't think it changes a lot of
what we do. I think you could go to trapping more and doing things in the
backcourt defensively but you have to have the personnel to do that so it will
be interesting to see how it plays out. The other rules I think will impact
our game greatly.  
  
Q. The other rules, that second touch rule, how has that impacted your game
so far?  
CONNIE YORI: The second touch rule has always been a rule, actually, but the
idea is to enforce the rules that are in place. I believe early on we're going
to see a lot of fouls, however, in the broad scheme of things, in our game, I
think it's going to clean up our game, going to allow players to move with
more freedom and therefore I think our scoring will be up eventually and I
think it's‑‑ I think the majority of coaches believe it's the right thing to
do. I think we're going to have to be a little patient early on as coaches, as
players and fans to understand that there are probably going to be more fouls
called than we would like, but in the long term I think it's going to be
positive.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Washington has returned 6 letter winners from an NCAA
team that won 26 games and claimed the Big Ten championship for the second
year in a row. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. It seems like you had Alex Bentley forever and the relationship with her
was fun to watch, but how difficult is it to replace a four ‑year starter at
point guard and who might be doing that for you this year?   
COQUESE WASHINGTON: It's certainly difficult to replace a player of Alex's
talent and caliber and she meant so much to our program. Dara got a chance to
play with her up close and personal and what our expectations are for point
guard and she'll slide over into that ball handling role and I don't think it
will be as big of an adjustment because the team is used to Dara. I'm used to
Dara and she is used to being on the floor and being a leader so I don't think
it will be as big of an adjustment as it could be.  
  
Q. Coach, with so many young players on your roster, seven freshmen, I
believe, talk about how that has made your practices so different from last
year and what has Maggie Lucas' role been now that she is a senior?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Our practices are interesting, you never know what you're
going to get day in and day out. Some days they look fantastic and other days
they don't. So practice is an adventure every day for our coaching staff.  
Maggie has done a fantastic job of being a leader, growing into a leadership
role. Every year she has added new things to her game and this year I think
one of the biggest is growth and leadership and being patient and having
poise. She was always the younger of the core players on our team, so she
didn't necessarily have to have that responsibility. She could just kind of
play and let the upperclassmen take care of the leadership and those things.
She has been really patient but at the same time demanding and she etcetera
sets such a high standard in practice for work ethic and intensity and focus.
That's been a real benefit for our younger players to see how you have to
carry yourself and conduct yourself on a daily basis if you want to have a
great career and if our program wants to get where we want to be at the end of
the season.  
  
Q. Just with all the younger players, the freshmen class, anybody separating
themselves from others?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I've been impressed with Kaliyah Mitchell, she was a
playing with her back to the basket in high school and she is playing more
face‑up and she has made the adjustment quickly to the college game.  
I have been impressed with her ability to make plays, Peyton Whitted is doing
a great job, stretching the defense, and Alex Harris is going to be an
athletic post player for us and she is doing a lot of good things, rebounding
the ball, getting out in transition.  
I'm optimistic that all of our freshmen will have impact on game day for us
and since we have some, chances are one of them is going to play good on game
day. One of them should show up every day. That's my hope.  
  
Q. Coach, considering what you lost, graduating your senior class, it looks
like Talia and Candice are going to have to step up and play bigger roles.
Talk about those two players in particular and what you expect from them?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Starting with Talia, she is one of our strongest players
and a tremendous defensive player and rebounder. She has played well for us in
the postseason in the last two years, put up big numbers in rebounding and
defending. We're counting on her to play with that confidence she played with
in the postseason and bringing that to the start of the season. Candice is a
tremendous player, McDonald's All‑American, didn't get a lot of playing time
last year, but she looked good in practice, got in great shape over the
summer, got her body composition intact and I think she is going to have an
impact on both ends for us with her size. She is a 6‑6 player and she has a
great touch around the basket.  
  
Q. The new 10 ‑second rule, is that something you like coming in and do you
have to continually remind your kids that you can't take 11 seconds to get it
down the court?   
COQUESE WASHINGTON: We don't ever have a problem taking 10 second to get the
ball up the floor. We like to play fast and get up and down the floor. That
won't necessarily be an issue for us. There probably will be more pressing,
teams taking trying to take advantage of the rule. So it will be a matter of
us making sure that we understand how to attack presses and how to press more
this year than we have in the past few years.  
  
Q. Last year you had Dara and Bentley; they were like a two ‑headed snake.
They were able to dominate the backcourt with their defense. How do you see
that playing out this season? Do you have an immediate answer for defensively
how you makeup for that lost speed without Alex?   
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Definitely Ariel is a great defender and what she gives up
in speed she makes up with her size and length. It will look different but I
think the pressure and the intensity and the ability to create turnovers, the
ability to make her man play a little differently than they want to play
should be a plus for us. Then again with our bench and our freshmen we have
more size on the perimeter than we have had in years past and hopefully that
will allow us to contest shots and maybe not give up as many baskets so we are
playing in transition off of rebounds as opposed to live turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Versyp is entering her 8th season, returns nine letter
winners and three starters from last year. Last year they earned their 23rd
bid to the NCAA in 25 years after winning it's second Big Ten tournament
title. Coach?  
SHARON VERSYP: This year obviously we're going to be a little bit different,
guard dominated, losing Drey Mingo and Sam Ostarello, so we will have a little
bit of a different style.  
I think it's a good style for us. We will be a different team, but I think
having our three seniors that have played since they've been freshman have
brought us great leadership.  
  
Q. Coach, can you tell us about what that different style will look like
this year?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, what we're hoping to do is run even more than we have in
the past. Everyone on our team, when they do rebound the basketball can put it
down. We don't have to go for an outlet, look for our point guard. There is
only one player on our team down low at the post that we have to come back and
receive the pass. So we have been extremely competitive playing at a higher
speed, a lot of full‑court pressing accident trying to use our length and
quickness at the guard spot to get deflections, steals, and obviously we feel
we have good outside shooting so we're going to try to drive and create.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that you did lose Sam and Drey. Who are the kids who
are going to maybe try to fill into those holes on the inside?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think Liza Clemons is the first young lady I would be speak
about. Last year she had shoulder surgery as well as some other illness with
her stomach so she wasn't able to eat much so she wasn't able to play a lot.
She played as a freshman and she has developed as a go‑to player down low. She
can score inside and outside and she is a great player, able to put it on the
floor and get the fast break going.  
Camille Redmon from Texas, our hope is she'll be able to finish down low,
Whitney Bays, a transfer, coming off a knee injury, we're hoping her skill
set, she was extremely talented and now building that confidence back up and
she is doing great things for us, she can shoot, score, handle the ball, good
offensive rebounder and you have Joslyn Massey and Torrie Thornton, a lot of
long length, a lot of athleticism.  
  
Q. I just noticed the polls this year you're not in the top three for the
first time. Where do you see yourselves at this point in time in the league
and how do you view the league overall coming into the season?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think the top three are very good choices. Nebraska only lost
one players and they played fantastic, went further in the tournament last
year, ten state is always‑‑ Coach Washington has done a job of creating a
national program. They have Maggie Lucas, and Michigan State is one that
everybody is anxious to see, they did a phenomenal job last year, they have
probably three of their top players back and we haven't seen them on the court
but on paper they look strong. We just have to go out every day and get better
it's about growing and developing our younger kids. We feel like we have
talent but there is inexperience and we feel like we have a solid blend of
five experienced players and seven that are coming in.  
  
Q. Coach, seeing that you're going to use your guards sophomore what have
you asked those players in particular to do in the off ‑season or to get
better at coming into this year?   
SHARON VERSYP: I think the big things with those two individuals is to be able
to be great leaders and get the younger players out on the court and teach
them, help them execute, talk about terminology and set the tone of what
Purdue basketball is about and how we do those things. Our freshmen have come
in better than other freshmen, the conditioning, and catching on, and they're
not behind and these two have done a great job and it's because of our two
seniors and how tough it is and our expectations at Purdue. They're leading a
young team so day in, day out they are the coaches on the court. I don't have
to always be the one doing the instructing. It's great when they're being the
coach. They both to want play oversea and who knows what they want to do as
they condition much continue on, if they want to come back to coaching but
those two are very special.  
  
Q. The 10 ‑second rule has come to women's basketball. What do you think of
the rule change and given the fact that you do have KK and Courtney? Is it a
big deal for you guys?   
SHARON VERSYP: I think it's a big deal because it's a new rule and it's
different for our women's college basketball, period. I think now when you do
full‑court press it means something, some people can pass the ball back and
forth for 15, 20 seconds, now there is obviously a time limit and as people
continue to play, whether it's scrimmages or exhibition, you forget about it,
you get a rebound, take a couple of dribbles, get it to the point guard, there
is already 4 or 5 second. Inning it's good for our game, help the defensive
end, speed it up, maybe you'll get steals but you have to have a good plan of
how to break a press and be cognizant of the backcourt rule now.  
  
Q. Coach, that can you're trying to close the gap experiencewise, how do you
use the extra time this summer with the rule change in your ability to work
out with the players and how do you think that will help you this season?  
SHARON VERSYP: I enjoyed the new rule. I think it was great for us to be able
to have hands o especially with two players that came back from injury and two
freshmen and like you said, the experience is something we have to contend.  
The biggest thing is allowing us to teach the good habits, the footwork and
the positioning and them not to do it incorrectly so when you get to practice
in Septemberyou don't have to go back and correct those things.  
I thought that was a huge advantage. I think it allowed the team to see and
especially freshmen, the tempo, how fast and physical things are. We were able
to put in new offense so I could play with some things and see if they were
going to identify, buy into it, take ownership of it. So it helped us in a big
way offense sense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Curt Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24308)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Indiana coach Curt Miller, entering his second
season, returning six letter winners after finishing 11‑19\.  
CURT MILLER: Good morning, excited about year two. We had a lot of milestones
we accomplished in year one despite not being exactly where this program is
headed. We are one of two programs in the Big Ten with less than 50% of our
scoring coming back, so we're youngest and inexperienced teams in the league
and in the country.  
Eight out of 13 players entering this season are in their first year with our
program at Indiana. With that is excitement. Sometimes it's not bad to be
naive and have a bunch of young kids. They don't know how good the Big Ten is;
they don't understand where we're being picked or the expectations on us.  
So our motto this year is to exceed expectations. We continue to want to build
our culture not only on the court but behind the scenes and have one of the
hardest working programs in the Big Ten, have great chemistry in the locker
room as we continue to build our team on and off the court. Excited about the
freshmen class, coming in as a highly‑ranked class, despite only being on the
job a couple of months when we signed that class. 62 of our 79 points came
from first‑year players so they're going to get a lot of playing time. We will
deal with the highs and lows of being an inexperienced team this year and look
forward to getting better each and every day.  
  
Q. Coach, you took your prior team to the Sweet 16 and you had 16 seniors on
that class, that how you believe in building a program?  
CURT MILLER: You're referring to our run at Bowling Green of eight straight
championships and through our tenure we had an opportunity to sign a big
recruiting class in 2003. We ultimately built around that 2003 recruiting
class and before they graduated we advanced to the Sweet 16 and had obviously
one of the premiere mid‑major programs in the country. We once again had to
sign a big recruiting class in 2007 and built around that class and continued
to win championship after championship, so I wasn't afraid of a big class.  
Ironically we come into Indiana and walked into a situation with low numbers.
I inherited a program with only nine scholarship players, so our first
recruiting class needed to be big so we did bring in six freshmen this year
and they will be the foundation for our program the next few years and we hope
that class ends up as good as some of the classes we had at the mid‑major
level.  
But they're not the only class and we're excited about future recruiting,
obviously I have to wait a few more weeks to talk specifics about our future
of recruiting but I'm not afraid to build around a big class and we had
success at the mid‑major level.  
  
Q. Coach, who among the freshman, first year players is sticking out who is
hitting the court dribbling of your kids?  
CURT MILLER: You know, really impressed coming out of our exhibition game with
our young backcourt. We have a dynamic young point guard out of Kentucky named
Larryn Brooks. Our fans won't forget her. She plays with an incredible hair‑do
that's red, so she is the talk of our town right now. First player from the
state of Kentucky to come up and play for Indiana women's basketball in 19
years, so we're excited about her.  
Also Taylor Agler, the daughter of Brian Agler from the Seattle Storm,
understands how to play, feisty, can play the 1 and 2. Both of those guards
played well in our exhibition game and are going to be staples in the game for
years to come. Believer in guard play and the Big Ten has had great guard play
and recent WNBA drafts, a the lot of young point guards going into the WNBA
out of the Big Ten and we're going to continue to improve the guard play
throughout our time.  
Jenn Anderson a 6‑3 freshman, got injured in our exhibition game, we will see
how long she is out and we gotta stay away from injuries. We're young and
inexperienced so we need all the healthy bodies we can have.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about 62 of the 79 points were scored by first ‑year
players. Obviously first‑year players are going to have to play a big role on
the team this year. What do you expect from returning starters such as Nicole
Bell and Sasha Chaplin.   
CURT MILLER: Sasha is that is a 6th year senior and today is her birthday,
joins me at media day, probably the "oldest" women's basketball player in the
conference. When she looks at the freshman class and realizes that she is six
years older than them, she can help share the journey of what it's going to be
like in college, live every day to its fullest and give what you got because
you every know when injuries are going to hurt your career and give you
red‑shirt seasons.  
So she can get up and down the floor and scores well with her back to the
basket. We have six post players, hopefully Jenn is not out very long. We have
six post players so we can continue to try and find each and every night who
is hot and the best match‑up for that game.  
Nicole Bell is just a great leader, a tiny point guard that we could barely
take off the floor last year because of our depth and numbers and even though
we have dynamic numbers in guards her leadership and experience is going to be
needed throughout the season.  
  
Q. Wanted to get your take on some of the rule emphasis. It's been a topic
of conversation. Also with the 10 ‑second backcourt rule and in addition,
getting away from neutral sites in regional competition in the NCAA
Tournament.   
CURT MILLER: First, I've been a part of a National Rules Committee, enjoyed my
time on the committee so was intimately involved in decisions that affected
the game throughout my career. I believe we all agree that the physicality was
getting to the point in women's basketball which some nights it looked like a
street fight and not a basketball game.  
I'm excited about moving in the direction of trying to have more freedom of
movement and giving the offense a little more credit and a little more
advantage. We were one of the few sports a couple of years ago that were
making rules that benefited defense while all sports were trying to benefit
the offense.  
So I like the change and I think we're going to go through growing pains,
maybe early in the season or maybe all the season there will be a lot of fouls
and our fan base and loyal following is going to have to understand that there
is a "shift" right now in the women's game.  
In the long run, I think it's going to be great because our game has so much
skill but unfortunately lately it had become a street fight at some of the
games. I'm excited if it's called consistently throughout the season to see
where our game is by the end of the year and going into the future.  
All the rule changes, including NCAA Tournament opportunities, how we're
looking at the NCAA Tournament for women's basketball is all very, very smart
thinking and thinking outside of the box that will continue to grow the game.
Our game is "flat toed" in terms of attendance and support and we want to look
for ways to continue to grow our women's basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time and best of luck.

DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now at the podium is Michigan State head coach Suzy
Merchant. She is entering her seventh season at Michigan State and returns
nine letter winners and three starters from a team that won 25 games and
earned a trip to the NCAA championship last season. We will start with an
opening statement.  
SUZY MERCHANT: Welcome to a new season and we're excited about our basketball
team at Michigan State. We have a good, core group of veterans coming back,
and at the same time we have three exciting freshmen.  
  
Q. Coach, two ‑part question here: First, how is the overall health of your
team? Second, can you talk about those new and exciting freshmen?   
SUZY MERCHANT: I'll try to remember, you're testing had he this early. I just
started my caffeine! We're getting there with the health of our team. I think
everybody asks about Madison, and bless her heart after three ACLs she is
going to try it one more time. Right now she is doing a lot more in practice,
nothing live but we're hoping within the next month or so to be able to get
her out on the basketball court and playing games.  
We're kind of going with the NBA theory there where we won't do anything live
in practice and just put her in the game. She doesn't like that because she
wants to be out there obviously but that gives her a full year of rehab. We
have been doing a lot of things with film with her to try to get her where she
needs to be.  
We have been showing her footage of different styles of play with kids that
have her size and whatnot as well as what we're doing and then it's kind of
interesting, Jim, our sports director did a nice job on‑‑ we had our
exhibition game last night and he told her that the last two NFL defensive
players of the week both had three ACLs and she was like, "Whoa, I can do
that," and she is determined to get out there. Jasmine Hines has a concussion.
She he has been out five weeks, broke her nose and has post concussion
syndrome.  
Our transfer from Auburn, Camille Glymph, who sat out last year and was
eligible to play this year as a stretch reaction in her back. We hope to have
her back eventually as well.  
The exciting freshmen, Aerial and Branndais were both freshmen, both are back.
Aerial started for us last night as an exciting face‑up four man, very
athletic. Branndais brings that toughness. She is long and lean on the
perimeter and she does a nice job of getting to the rim as well as rebounding
and our true freshman was "Miss Basketball" in the state of Michigan and she
opened up last night with 27 points. Not sure what that means but she has a
great range. That was what we were missing sometimes last year. She can extend
the defense and not a bad showing for a freshman on game night in the a
college uniform. It's exciting. They're going to have their up's and down's
but we like what they bring to our team.  
  
Q. Klarissa Bell, a lot of seniors graduated last year, Alice Bentley,
Tailer Hill and it's just a year when people like Klarissa Bell can rise to
the level of those kids and get more recognition, I guess?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I think the thing with Klarissa, we have had such amazing
talent in the league and still do. There are a lot of high‑powered
upperclassmen and seniors in particular. I feel like she has flown under the
radar because she does a nice job defensively anytime you're focused on that
side of the ball. Sometimes you don't always get the credit but she does a
good job. She is a balanced player and not as dynamic of a scorer as other
kids and maybe that's why she hasn't been breaking through some of those
things but now is a good opportunity. I think her name is out there, she has
put the work in and the time and she is a talented young lady and I think this
could be a year for her to step forward.  
  
Q. With Shiffauer and Thomas leaving not necessarily a bulk of your
production but more identified, Shiff was so tough inside and Jasmine started
to come along in terms of her leadership last year. Who will need to kinda
fill those voids and what do you see in identity and leadership?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Annalise and Klarissa are our captains and those kids are
experienced players, certainly, but you're right. They're now seniors, the
clock is ticking and what you saw‑‑ Shiff has always been that tough kid
anyway, what she didn't have in talent she made up for in hustle and toughness
and physicality and Thomas came around as the end was coming. She had this
will to win that everybody got behind. She did it just by actions, mostly.  
Klarissa and Annalise are two of the hardest working kids I've ever had in my
program so when you have senior leaders that work extremely hard, I think that
will allow our other kids to jump into the fray and that's what seniors do.
They have to have a will to win and allow others to jump into the fray and
compete as hard as they can and inspire the others on the team to do so.  
I have all the confidence in the world that although those two brought
different dynamics, I think Klarissa and Annalise can pick up in different
ways that will certainly make an impact on our team, but those two will be
missed, for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time and best of luck.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is Northwestern head coach Joe McKeown, entering
his 6th seen and returns 10 letter winners and three starters, finishing last
year 13‑17\.  
JOE McKEOWN: I'm Joe McKeown. Excited to getting back to the Big Ten and
getting started. This Sunday we scrimmage Notre Dame and get right into our
nonconference schedule so we will find out what we're all about. We have a
young team, 11 freshmen and sophomore and we return the Big Ten freshmen of
the year, Maggie Lyon who had a big year for us. It's going to be fun. It's a
fun time to be at Northwestern, a lot of excitement about all our sports.  
  
Q. In terms of basically recruiting in this league you got the McDonald All
‑American on your team this year and that's the name I'm looking for?  
JOE McKEOWN: Niac is from Minneapolis, right?  
  
Q. Where is she going to fit with Maggie Lyon and some of the other kids?
Will she make an immediate impact or are you going to bring her along
slowly?  
JOE McKEOWN: I think a little bit of both. I think she is one of the most
gifted freshmen I have had the opportunity to coach over the last 30 years.
It's just given her an opportunity to learn her teammates, learn the game. She
played on the USA National Team this summer and I think that was a great
experience for her. She is also a freshmen that is trying to find her way and
be a Northwestern student and also just trying to keep improving as a college
basketball player. Every now and then she'll do something.  
I said to one of my coaches a week ago, I said, nobody has done that in our
gym unless they were on the other team. She tried to goal tend a shot the
other day. I thought it was a good sign. She is a great kid, great person to
be around, humble and just going to get better.  
  
Q. You did lose some significant people to graduation, but your point guard
is back this year and how will she help you maybe incorporate and keep
everything together with the new, young kids?  
JOE McKEOWN: We have point guard Carly Roser from Canada, started every game
going into her junior year now. We have invested a lot, she has had tremendous
experience now as a‑‑ kind of threw her into the fire the first two years so
she is going on the road and hit a buzzer beater to beat Iowa, she has played
in a game where we LSU, played great college basketball. She has had some up's
and down's and I think she is ready in her junior year, in a league that's
loaded with great guards it important for us that she play well.  
  
Q. Coach, last season you guys were in a lot of games, you were the team
that nobody wanted to play because you scared everybody. How has your team
evolved from that persona last year to where you are right now?  
JOE McKEOWN: Great question. I think the biggest thing for us is to finish off
games now. We had some injuries over the last couple of years but hopefully we
have the depth now to play through forty minutes. We were in pretty much every
game, and there were times since I've been at Northwestern, we have been the
best 30‑minute team in America but we gotta play 40.  
This year, I think some of our depth will help us through that some of the
experiences our players have had in game situations and understanding how to
finish off now, hopefully that will carry over.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Mia, and Lauren Douglas is probably one of the best
players I've seen. How does that style of play impact your game going forward
if at all?  
JOE McKEOWN: When I took over at Northwestern, the stigma about their program
or the program when I walked in, besides we had finished last for 10 years
that was they were slow, big, floating‑type team and took us a while to change
that, but I feel like we're one of the teams now that has athletic ability to
push the ball and I think defensively we will be more aggressive. That's one
of the things I couldn't do my first couple of years even when we won 18, 19
games we couldn't go defensively at people like I wanted to like we did George
Washington when we went deep into the NCAA Tournament. I feel like we're
coming back to that type of team, Christa from Texas, also, and Lauren, and
Carly is one of the faster players in the league so hopefully as we progress
through the Big Ten that style of play will hold up.  
  
Q. How hard is it for Northwestern to get a kid like Coffey to come in and
have to battle every other Big Ten program in the country?  
JOE McKEOWN: Good question. When you look at what we have and one of the
reasons I took the job was‑‑ there was multiple reasons but we're in one of
the greatest cities in the world in Chicago, our campus is one of the most
beautiful on the lake, sits on Lake Michigan. One of the top‑10 academic
schools in the country, why wouldn't you want to come there, right? That would
be the way I would look at it. Also you have to fit Northwestern and she is a
little shy, humble kid who I think she gets what we're about.  
Northwestern will never be‑‑ it's a balanced place and I think that's what she
was looking for. The hype and the pageantry of recruiting, she was smart
enough to get past that and look for what she wanted and that's what helped
us. I don't know if that's the word pageantry, but we have a lot of that right
now.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm in WNBA mode but wanted to get your thoughts on Cheryl Reeve.
She talks about how you impacted her career and what you have seen in her over
the time.  
JOE McKEOWN: Thank you, Cheryl was my assistant at George Washington for six
years and it was the first job she got and six weeks into it I realized she
was really good. To her credit she has worked hard and to have the success in
the WNBA, she really deserves it. A lot of people talk about she has three
Olympians on her team, Maya Moore, and she has done a great job of getting
them to play well together and buy into the team aspect of pro basketball, and
it shows. Really happy for her, I think she is one of the great coaches in our
game right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck this season.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Ohio State head coach Kevin McGuff. He enters his
first season with the Buckeyes, having spent the last two years at Washington
and the previous nine at Xavier. He has led his teams to a 255‑99 overall
record, Ohio State returns 8 letter winners and three starters from last
year's squad. Coach?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Good morning everyone. I'm excited for Ohio State University. As
an Ohio native, it's an opportunity for myself and my family to get back to
the state and I'm excited to build something special.  
  
Q. Coach, how has the adjustment period been for you and your family?  
KEVIN McGUFF: It was a difficult adjustment. I took the job one week after my
wife and I welcomed our sixth child into the world. So I left Seattle and left
my wife and six children there. It was hard. But we also knew this was a
really unique opportunity for us to come back closer to our family and be at a
special place in Ohio State so we wanted to jump at this opportunity. Now the
kids are here and my oldest three are in school and settled and they're in a
great situation.  
Columbus is a fantastic community and everyone has been welcoming to us the at
Ohio State and everything has gone great and the now just focused on the team
and the upcoming season.  
  
Q. Coach, having time to work with your players and being able to come in
and make an assessment of what's there, can you give us a snapshot of what you
see in the returning players?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, it is a great advantage to be able to work with players in
the summer and this being the first summer to do that, for a new coach to get
more with your team. What I would say is when you look at who we were last
year, we were a team in the scoring column that was really dominated by Tayler
Hill and she has since graduated so we have to transition to something very
different. What I see so far and what we need to become and evolve into is a
team with balance.  
So instead of somebody with 30 points and everybody else in single digits,
we're going to have to be a much more balanced scoring team, Moore and Adams
and Scullion are going to have to share the load. I do think we have some
balance in four senior post players. Martina and Ashley can give us points
around the balance. Ferguson is a perimeter player, Maleeka and Cait have been
great this fall, so I think we have to be more balanced than what they were
last season.  
  
Q. You mentioned Darryce, Ashley, and Ameryst.  
KEVIN McGUFF: One of the things that we have had, we have been kinda banged
up, even Darryce tweaked her knee last week and didn't practice for three
straight days, but that's evolving. Of those that you mentioned, they will see
significant minutes and I think at some point they will probably have a chance
to be starters.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned trying to achieve more balance. Can you talk
specifically about the style of play we will see on the court from you to
reach that goal?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, and one of the things that I think is important that
obviously we talked about, you assess who you have in your program and on your
team and try to put them in a position where we can be as successful as we
can. You also, with a new program you want to start to chart a course for your
program to have an identity and a way of doing things and a style of play that
you need to have in the future so you have to marry the two, so to speak.  
In the future we will have a team that hopefully will be one of the fastest,
most aggressive teams in all of college basketball. We have recruited toward
that and we will continue to do that.  
We don't necessarily have a roster full of people that can play that style now
so maybe a little faster than what they've done, but also it will be at a pace
that this particular group can be successful in.  
  
Q. There is no true freshmen class, no one was recruited last year. How much
more difficult has that made you getting off the ground quickly here?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, it kinda is what it is. We don't have any freshmen so it's
a big picture thing in that it has made is more‑‑ we have had to spend a lot
of time recruiting because with the three scholarships that they had last year
that weren't used and the four seniors that now we have available
scholarships, so going back to the spring, summer and fall, we have had to‑‑
and by the way we have four juniors, so we have 11 scholarships in two years
so that has put a tremendous amount of pressure to get off the ground quick
until recruiting probably more than what it will mean overall is we have had
to spend so much time utilizing the scholarships to get the program where we
want it.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the impact that Tailer Hill has on this program.
Oftentimes she took the game over and was the floor leader. Who do you see
taking on that role of leading this team in the point guard position?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think Ameryst will get a lot of minutes at the point and she
has great presence on the court. She is still kind of evolving as a leader
that can vocalize some of the things she wants to share with her teammates.
But I like her effort, her energy and intensity, it's contagious and I believe
we will get leadership from our seniors in general. It's hard to go from
someone like Tayler and Amber Stokes who didn't put up the same amount of
points but was one of the best defenders in the league and a great kid who had
a great presence so between the two of them they provided great leadership.  
So that's something we're going to have to grow into and our seniors are going
to have to make sure they provide great leadership for the other people in the
program.  
  
Q. Ashley Adams is one of the most polite people I've ever met in my life.
How hard is it to get her to be vocal on the court?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Hard.  
  
Q. What do you do?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Ashley‑‑ you're not going to come in in one year and change
somebody's personality. Ashley is a good kid, has talent, I have enjoyed
getting to know her and coach her. I don't want to say here not going to
address that but all I can tell you ‑‑ and I don't have any reference point so
she is quiet to me but some around her say she what is been talking more than
she ever has. So maybe we are making progress, it's hard for me to measure.
She is a bright kid and always seems to be in the right place at the same
time. She helps our team and provides that leadership for people when they're
out there. She is doing the right things she has a great presence that way.  
  
Q. Coach, with Maryland and Connecticut and West Virginia and Georgia, as
you're trying to make this transition and getting to know your team and
putting all the pieces together, how do you approach those games that present
a big challenge?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, you know, you take over a job you inherit everything, like
it or not. The thing is, it is challenging and difficult. I think for our team
anyway with a new staff and a new way of doing things. We have to stay focused
on the process.  
We may be doing things really, really well. It's not going to show up in the
"win" column every night with a schedule like that, we have to realize that.
But we have to get better every day with the system because it's so new and
we're going to be challenge from a mental standpoint, mental toughness
standpoint to fight through some of those tough nights. But we're going to
learn a lot about our team and I'm hopeful that what we learn through the
schedule is going to prepare us for the big games.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Bobbie Kelsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22737)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Kelsey enters her third season and returns 10 letter
winners and 5 starters from last year's squad that finished 12‑19\. Coach will
start with an opening statement.  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Good morning. Very excited to be here today to officially kick
off our media day here in Chicago.  
We have had some great practices already; we have not scrimmaged as of yet but
we look a lot better than last year. So with that being said, I will take some
questions.  
  
Q. Two questions, Taylor Wurtz I'm hearing is back, I wonder how she is
doing now after missing last year with the injury and what she is going to
bring to you; and the second question, am I correct Michala Johnson is going
to be available to play and what will she add to your team?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Both of those ladies are high‑caliber players, starting with
Taylor, her being out last year was a bittersweet thing. We knew she would be
back and was hopeful that her injury was not such that she could not play and
she wanted to finish her career on a high note so to have her sit was hard
because we need her.  
We lost 12 of our 19 losses was by single digits, which you feel like Taylor
could have remedied a lot of that. But a lot of other kids got to play and now
that she is back and healthy she looks really good and she doesn't have to do
everything on her own. That's something she is going to have to learn, to let
people help her. But when we need a basket we're going to Taylor.  
You mentioned Johnson, it's nice to have her in the post. We haven't had a
true bonus post player since Kryuchkova came along our first year but she can
do damage down on the block.  
You have to double her a little bit unless she is just missing shots, which
she doesn't miss a whole bunch of 'em. So that nice inside/out punch along
with Morgan Paige. Jacki, who has come along nice and Nicole Bauman, she is a
sophomore. I could keep going on and on with we have a lot of young ladies who
have improved their game and come along.  
We need to see them at game situations and practice is different than any game
and we're excited for them and they're excited for each other and themselves.
We're going to come out and see what we can do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your freshman class and who you see making an
immediate impact?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: We have three freshman, Malayna Johnson, am I correct,
Michala's younger sister, Michaela Crall and a young lady from Texas and she
is a point guard, so she is‑‑ Carly Truesdale. Michala and Michaela Crall have
injuries right now and Malayna just doesn't know what she is doing. Freshman
don't always know what they're doing, but Malayna is a strong kid. Out of the
three freshman she is going to make the biggest impact and we told her you got
to be ready to play because Cassie Rochel has a back injury, we're not sure
about now. She could play but she is on the mend so we're getting Malayna
ready in case Cassie doesn't play. I'm not saying that but we're doing that so
she is not in shock if she has to get out there and play.  
Same thing for Nicole Bauman who had to get out there and start. Malayna
doesn't have that pressure because she doesn't have to carry the load as a
guard does who has to call plays and things of that nature. Once she figures
out she can get that ball down there and do some damage, rebound and run, she
is going to be a tough cover and she is getting better every day. It's amazing
how much she is gotten better in the 5 weeks we have been practicing so I'm
excited for her as well.  
  
Q. Coach, with Stevens' graduation, I'm wondering what you think is going to
be your answer at point guard this year? A freshman?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: No, Carly Truesdale is a true point guard. She has some
injuries right now but shell come along. We are look to Dakota Whyte and she
hits shots in practice I'm like, where did that come from, and last year
Dakota wasn't quite ready but she is looking to take on the challenge of
running the team and Tessa is going to back us up.  
So we have three kids that are ready to run the point, can and will but we
really are depending on Dakota to run our team and she has done a great job so
far in practice and it's given her confidence and she wants to lead. It's nice
when a kid wants to lead, not that you're making them lead but they want to
take up that challenge of leading the team. She has to figure out when to do
it more when it's a little more adversity going on.  
Anybody can lead when it's all good, but when it's going south, she needs to
be the one to pick the team up and get 'em organized and keep 'em calm. She is
working on that. That doesn't come natural for her but she has done a great
job so far.  
  
Q. Coach, your team really came on late, especially in the Big Ten
tournament last year, made a lot of noise. Can you talk about how that helped
you not only in the off season but early in this season coming back with most
of those players and what do you feel like is your team's biggest strength
right now?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: That game gave us a lot of confidence. Anybody that watched
that game and we're playing a great Illinois team, very athletic, causing you
to turn the ball over, and we had quite a few, I think we had 27, we led the
league in turnovers, which we are working on that. To beat that type of team
at that time really with about six players. If you notice we had about six
players, six and a half! It really gave our team a lot of confidence that they
could come out and really beat a great team like Illinois and do it when it
was really important to try to make a statement at the end of your season. We
knew we weren't going to go to postseason.  
However, that was a great game for us. Also, the win against Penn State at
that time when they he beat us by 44 and then getting the opportunity to come
back and beat those guys.  
We did have some signature wins, those two in particular. It allowed our kids
to understand even when you have adversity you don't have a lot, if you play
hard and believe in what you're doing and listen to the coaches, listen to and
you say try to execute what we're telling you, you can have some success. Just
having that win and ending on that note, obviously we lost to Purdue in the
next game by 12 points but we were kinda out of gas at that time. Purdue is a
great team as well.  
But to compete on that level with those type of teams. You don't want moral
victories, but you got to hang your hat on something. We want the kids ton
understand even if you don't win, if you play hard you have a chance and
that's what we give ourselves every game, a chance to win. With the exception
of those that we weren't in the game but those are few and are far between and
I'm proud of our kids for percent versing.  
The thing I get the most pleasure out of is when you have fans come up or
random strangers that have watched our team and said, "Man, you guys play so
hard." Even if we don't win sometimes that gives us the confidence to let us
know we're leading these kids in the right direction and they will never give
up until the game is totally out of hand. You're not going to foul with 5
second left and be down by 10. That kind of thing, but they fight to the
bitter end and sometimes we do come out on top in those games.  
  
Q. You mentioned, Coach, limited numbers last year and I know you've got
some bump and bruises this season but it looks like you have more bodies. How
will that allow to you change your style of play?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: That will allow us to play faster. I tell the guards to get the
ball to the frontcourt as fast as you can and then if we don't have the
advantage get us into something. So we're going to try to get the ball to the
frontcourt faster so I don't think the 10‑second backcourt rule is going to
have a lot of bearing on us, we're going to get it up there faster unless
we're being pressed or something and when kids aren't doing what we need them
to do, I can pull 'em on out. I couldn't do that last year, so I couldn't do a
lot of threatening, because last year kids were like, who are you going to put
in, the look on their faces, like, please, we're going to play.  
They really did try to do what we asked them to do but this year we have more
scorers, more bodies, more opportunities to get everybody involved.  
I love a team where you can't key in on one person because now who you going
to come off of? You gotta pick somebody. I tell our kids you have to be able
to hit an open shot, you don't have to break it down off the dribble you have
to hit an open shot because someone is going to help and we kick it out and
every kid can do that, doesn't take athletic ability, you just step into your
shot and take it.  
So we're looking forward to having the kids touch the ball and have an
opportunity to score because we all know scoring is fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up Minnesota head coach Pam Borton entering her 12th
season, returning 7 letter winners and four starters from last year as NIT
game that won 18 games.  
PAM BORTON: It's great to be here, obviously excited to start the season. Love
my team this year. Do not have to coach work ethic, effort, and it's
absolutely wonderful so it's great to be here, excited to start the season.  
  
Q. I got a story from a while ago that says Rachel Banham had surgery on her
knee. How much was a problem were the knees for her last year?  
PAM BORTON: She is‑‑ I think she was in constant pain last year. She has been
in pain for two years and a lot of tendonitis and the doctors tried something
and it didn't work so she played through the season in pain. Nothing
structurally wrong. This year they went in and it was more invasive and
relieved the pain so she is for the most part pain free and you can tell she
is in better shape than she was last year. Last year she went through the
blood clot thing in the summertime and this year the knee thing a little bit.
So she is in better shape and hopefully that will play out on the court as
well.  
  
Q. How much does Riche's role change going from power center to forward?  
PAM BORTON: I think it changes a great deal, less time on the block and more
in the pinch post area. I think her role changes as far as how she gets her
points this year. I think the whole team and her are still going through the
adjustment but a month down the road it will pay dividends. I think she is
going to be one of the best power forwards in the Big Ten, with Amanda Zahui,
has a chance to be one of the best centers in the Big Ten and Amanda there and
I think she is still getting comfortable with her role.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you have been working on getting Amanda to feeling like she
can be a major contributor. What has that process been like?  
PAM BORTON: I think it started when she came in in Decemberlast year. She got
into practice, got into the flow, learned the system and the expectations and
what they were. Coming into summer, summer access helped us get on the court
with her. But she is a different kid. She is from Stockholm. She had a lot of
pro opportunities over seas and it's a breath of fresh air to be around a kid
like that. She thinks like a pro. She has innate leader qualities. She is
probably one of the best leaders on our team. She is 20 years old. She gets
it. Thinks like a pro, other kids you have to pull in and schedule them to
watch film. This kid is in our office watching film every day, she makes
adjustments and learns quick and it's really a breath of fresh air, like I
said to be able to coach a 20 year old that is thinking like a pro.  
  
Q. Can you describe her style of play? What type of a post player is she?  
PAM BORTON: Extremely versatile. 6‑5, she has very good size, athletic, she is
a great post passer, tough to handle inside because she is so big.  
She is great around the rim, she can hit threes, your typical European post
player with great size. When you have the athleticism, the skills, the patting
ability, she can shoot from the perimeter and she can score around the rim.
She is a great leader and thinks like a pro. I think we've got the full
package. She is not perfect, she has to work on her footwork, got to learn to
use her body and she was double and triple teamed the whole night and was able
to put up some really good numbers.  
  
Q. Coach, last season there were things you were trying to get your team to
do all year, I know you had troubles on the defensive end. As you look back,
what are things you have to do better?  
PAM BORTON: I think you hit the nail on the end. Our issues were the defensive
end. Offensively I think we had one of the better teams than we've had in a
number of years, second in free‑throw percentage, 3‑point shooting percentage,
our numbers were good offensively, but defensively is where you drop a couple
of games because you've giving up 44%, you've giving up 72 points a game. I
think it was a lot of different things. If it's limiting possessions, it's
better to be on the boards, keeping people off the free‑throw line, I think we
fouled too much last year, 19 fouls per game, which is discipline.  
I think some of those kids have graduated, but I think protecting the rim and
not giving up easy shots at the rim, I thought we were small last year. Just
our kids buying into the way we need to play defense. We have always had great
defensive teams and struggled offensively but finding a balance and getting
our kids to buy in and start having fun playing on the defensive end will
solve a lot of ills.  
  
Q. I'm coming out of WNBA land, but obviously the Minnesota Lynx have had a
great deal of success and with McCarville back playing alongside Lindsey, the
target center has been great in supporting women's basketball. Talk about how
that supports your program.  
PAM BORTON: Helps to have two former players down the street playing about a
mile and a half away and they're excited to be here and playing for their fans
and their city. You know, they were excited to be playing together again, on
the Lynx, bringing back the memories and the plays that those two had
together, the around the leg passes and you sit back and smile because, yep,
that's easy to coach. Those players are easy to coach because you sit back and
don't screw things up, you let 'em play.  
Our fans, they love them, it's a show when you watch them play. There is so
much talent, there are three Olympians on the floor with the flair and the
style that they play it's fun to watch. I just think the fans were engaged.
They will be a great carry over from the two or three weeks that the fans have
had off from the links going into Gopher season, so I think people that love
college basketball and love student athletes, it's very different. Our
athletes' days are different than the pro's, but our fans are engaging. We
have some of the best fans in the country and it will be a lot of fun! I wish
I had a few of their players. We all do!  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned your team last year defensively a lot of fouls and
concerns about that aspect of the game. With all the new rules, the new points
of emphasis, how are you address that go with your team? Are you doing
anything specifically different to ensure that's not an issue for you this
season?  
PAM BORTON: I think it's a lot about the player, the individual player, the
lack of discipline that they have. I think we have more options this year as
far as the players that we put on the floor. But, you know, I think it's how
we teach it, with we have to talk about it, get them to buy in. I think we
have done a good job as a staff just teaching the hands off, I think that's a
big thing. Just calling everything in practice, a lot of emphasis, talking
about it.  
I think for this generation, coaching millennium kids, it's different,
different than coaching kids five or six years ago and going into the season
they want to see numbers. They're not going to say, hey, we got to be better
than this, we're beyond that, you're coaching a different kid. They want to
see numbers, graphs, pie charts, so we put numbers together and put numbers
together with where we were offensively last year as a team, very impressive,
top 20 in the country scoring, toward the top of the Big 10 and then you put
the numbers defensively together the number of fouls, where we were, where we
ranked in the country and in the Big Ten and it's eye‑opening.  
Numbers don't lie. Film doesn't lie and I think that hit home to the players
when they he see the positives and then they see all the negatives on the
other side and it's like, we gotta fixed in this. I think that's a big way you
get kids in this generation to buy in. Numbers don't lie, film doesn't lie. We
spent time watching film this year. We spend time watching film 15 or 20
minutes before practice, a lot of times we don't show film well in exhibition
games or scrimmages and this year we watch 15 minutes of film of themselves in
practice and it's helped our players see a little bit of reality on how they
need to get better and not just saying things or talking about it but they get
to see it and see how good they look or bad they look. I think that it's been
able to help them fixed in their mistakes quicker than us just sounding like a
broken record.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck this season.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Matt Bollant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22150)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our final coach is Illinois head coach Matt Bollant, leading
Illinois to the NIT Finals and 19 wins, returning six letter winners and three
starters from last year's squad. Coach?  
MATT BOLLANT: Exciting time of year and certainly one of the hopes we had in
coming here is teaching our kids how to practice the right way. We talked
about that last fall and certainly our team gave us kinda what they knew and
what they could.  
But our practice integrity now is night and day better than it was last year
at this time, offensively, defensively, how we play, how we practice, how we
prepare is much more to what we believe championship culture will look right.
We are teaching our kids how to get better each and every day. Our practices
have been intense and competitive and we challenged our kids and they have
grown. Each day they go beyond their limits and they grow and they know that
they're stronger and tougher and you can see the confidence growing in them
which is exciting for our program.  
We're young. We have 7 of our 14 players are new players, but it's exciting
for the future and our returning players are just better basketball players.
Their feel for the game is much better than it was last year at this time.  
Their ability to pass and shoot, defensively, their understanding of the
system is better. So we believe good things will happen. We lost two good
seniors last year in Karisma and Adrienne, but I believe overall our team is
going to have a good year and we're excited for the future of what we can do
and we're starting to practice the right way and if you can practice right
it's going to lead to playing right. We will see how we are, but the way we
practice is going to lead to good things. It's just a matter of time.  
  
Q. Coach Miller has seven freshmen coming in and eight new players, but who
among the younger players are standing out for you right now and may be able
to help you the quickest and how fast did you want them to help you quickly?  
MATT BOLLANT: Sarah Livingston and Jacqui Grant have been going back and
forth, 6‑2, 6‑3, with good length so those two are battling for the 5.  
Mckenzie Piper would be in that mix, but she had a concussion two weeks ago
and that slowed her a little bit and we're hoping to get her back and see
where she is at with that. Those two are both going to play.  
One of the things our system is difficult for big players because we pressure
the ball so hard and switch 1 through 5, so it's difficult for those players
to adjust. It's not an easy development. It's hard for big post players to
play in our system right away but both those kids have done extremely well.
They're learning and developing. I'm not sure they're feeling like that every
day because they're getting stretched and our practices are tougher than what
they will face in a game and I told them it's just a matter of time that they
will be great basketball players.  
Taylor Gleason was runner‑up Miss Basketball in Michigan, and she has had a
great fall. Ashley McConnell, a kid from Chicago here that came in and has
surprised us with how well she has done, quickly she has learned so very good.
One of the injuries, Kennedy Cattenhead tore her ACL this summer and she was
with Bolingbrook and was going to play but we will red shirt her.  
Mikaala Shackelford had a scope on her knee and has been out for six weeks.
Those two I think we'll see, depending on the knee and how that develops, but
the other freshmen are doing well. Kyley Simmons, starting point guard at
Missouri for two years, she has been great and what we hoped she would bring
she has in building our cultures and teaching our kids to play the right way.
She played for a great AAU program that taught her how to do things and she
has been exactly what we hoped for in building our culture and teaching our
kids how to practice and play right.  
  
Q. Coach, last year depth was a big concern especially with the higher tempo
that you wanted to play. Talk about getting those new players in and how
that's helping your depth this year?  
MATT BOLLANT: Certainly our depth is better than it was last year. I think
returning players‑‑ one of the things we take a lot of pride‑‑ I have a great
staff, I really do, I'm fortunate to have amazing assistants. One of the
things we take great pride is in the development of our players and Taylor
Tuck is a much better basketball player, all of the three here today, Amber
Moore, Ivory Crawford and Sarah Hartwell, all of those are better players.  
Sarah didn't get to play in games so you can see that in them and our
returning players doing well and adding the freshmen to the mix. We believe we
will be 7, 8 or 9 deep and when we went to the bench we weren't as good last
year. We're hoping to have better play coming off the bench this year, we're
probably a year away from having the depth we want to have.  
But we will see how the kids developing and you're never as deep‑‑ you start
the year you feel like, gosh, we have 8, 9, 10 kids ready to go and then you
start guarding the guys and you realize the kid is not quite ready and the
speed of the game affects the players. We're deeper than last year and we will
know once we get to the games how the freshmen will do but they're capable and
talented. And to have returning players having a better feel for the game and
all of our returning players are much better than they were last year at this
time and that's a complement to my staff and the great assistants I have.  
  
Q. With your defense and the rules instituted this year, is that beneficial
for the ten ‑second backcourt rule? And what about the contact on the
ball‑handler‑type stuff in terms of switching you do and how aggressive your
defense is. Can you address that?   
MATT BOLLANT: Last year the buzz defense gave us a big lift. We set the Big
Ten record for forced turnover and that was mainly the buzz. We played more
buzz than we wanted to because our man defense wasn't where it needed to be
and we didn't feel as confident in that. I think the combination of the two is
really good. Certainly the rules are going to affect us a little bit but in
the buzz, if we do it right we shouldn't foul much in the buzz at all because
we're playing passing lanes and one of the reasons we go to the buzz is
because we don't foul as much in that.  
I think you will see us use that, we're going to use 2‑2‑1, extend the back
pressure and the best thing we have is good athletes and they're quick.  
We want to make it a full‑court game, play faster than anybody else in the Big
Ten and we believe we can do that. When a team wants to play slow it's not
easy to pick up the tempo and the 10‑second rule will help us and the buzz as
well, it's hard to hold the ball against the buzz. We're working hard not to
use our hands and keep people in front. We scrimmaged Dayton last week and it
wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Either we did a good job with
our hand or maybe the refs didn't call it that night, but it wasn't a factor
in that game.  
I think the combination of the two is really good. We believe our system is as
good as any, better than most and our system will help us win championships
and do the right thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time and best of luck this season.

DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Iowa head Coach Lisa Bluder, entering her 14th season after
leading Iowa to it's fifth 20‑win season over the last six year and 6
consecutive NCAA championship berths, returning 8 letter winners and three
from last year's squad. Coach?  
LISA BLUDER: It's Halloween. Baseball is over; I guess it's time for
basketball and we're ready! We're excited to get this season started. We have
an exhibition game on Sunday. First time for us to put on the uniforms and get
up and down the floor, so we're ready to go.  
We think we have a good group back and I want to congratulate Sam Logic for
being a media choice for the preseason and she is a tremendous floor general
and we're looking forward to having her back.  
  
Q. Lisa, talk about how the new rule this summer, the ability to get in and
work with your players as often as you were able to do, how that impacted your
summer and this team?  
LISA BLUDER: I think the new rule is wonderful. Just to have contact with your
players over with the summer was wonderful to build relationships and keep
that contact over the course of the summer, but I think the rule mostly
impacted the freshmen. To be able to learn your defensive schemes, the
offensive expectations and to learn early so when they are scrimmaging with
upperclassmen they can implement those things so I think it puts you ahead of
the game a little bit when you start practice.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Sam Logic, now that she is known for assists,
obviously, do you expect her role as a scorer to grow this year without Jaime
Printy beside her?  
LISA BLUDER: Without doubt we are going to ask her to score more than she has
in the past. We lost a lot of offensive weapons last year. We need not one
person to pick up the load, but all of us and Sam has worked on her 3‑point
shot over the course of the summer and she'll be thinking assists first. She
led the Big Ten in assists. She was 15th best in the United States last year,
but she is now understanding that I love a scoring point guard. She is willing
to play that role as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jaime Printy and also Morgan Johnson post player in the
league last year. Who is stepping in to take the role?  
LISA BLUDER: The post position we will move Bethany Doolittle back into the
position, it's where she played high school and her freshmen year. We moved
her out to the perimeter last year out of necessity, but actually I think that
move has made her into a better post because she is now more confident
stepping out and facing the basket. She is more confident in her ball‑handling
skills and in her shooting range. I think that move last year having her play
power forward is going to help make her a better post.  
  
Q. How is the battle at power forward shaping up?  
LISA BLUDER: The battle at power forward is intense. I love that! I think
competition brings out the best in everybody, and certainly we have that going
on right now, three candidates, Kali Peschel, a sophomore, Claire Till, a
sophomore and a freshman, Ally Disterhoft. I think they're working hard and
the thing is they can go after each other extremely hard and they are the best
of friends off the floor. I love that. They don't hold grudges; they can let
each other have it and when they leave the floor they're teammates and they
understand they need to be good and for us and with the new rules I guess we
have 15 fouls at that position!  
  
Q. Next year the Big Ten goes to 14 teams and the women play 16 games which
means you're only going to play three opponents twice. What are your
preferences for something like that? Is it more about maybe trying to play a
rival more than once every year or do you think the league schedule need to
expand to incorporate more home and homes within the league?  
LISA BLUDER: Actually we are expanding to 18 games. We are at 16 this year,
but next year we will be at the 18‑game mark. So we will have an identical
schedule to the men's program.  
  
Q. Can you update the status of the two freshmen recruits and how their
progress is during practice?  
LISA BLUDER: The two freshmen are doing well, but we expected them to. We
quite honestly need them to do real well because we don't have a deep team.
Both were top‑100 recruits, Ally was Player Of The Year in Iowa, Parade
All‑American. Lexa was a top‑100 player out of Lincoln Nebraska, won a state
championship her senior year, both of them come in with State Championship
titles.  
Both of them are winners and they want to compete. They understand that they
need to, and they're not acting like freshmen. I think the access to them over
the summer has also helped with that.  
  
Q. I would like to hear your thoughts on the rules, the changes, obviously
the freedom movement, the contact, and the 10 ‑second backcourt rule. How are
you addressing those with your team?   
LISA BLUDER: That's a hard adjustment for us, but it's actually the way the
game was supposed to be played. We've gotten away from that. Now we're just
going back to making sure that we're calling it the way it was supposed to be
called.  
I think it's a great thing for women's basketball. I think it's a great thing
for us as a scoring team and having that scoring mentality for us to have more
freedom of movement I think will make our team more explosive. I think the
rule changes will be good for us and how we have adjusted to it in practice;
that's hard. We really don't know yet, until you've been there you don't know.
It's easy to say you can't put a hand on somebody twice but how much contact
is really going to be called and I think we have to have experience and that's
why this Sunday's game against Concordia, our exhibition game will be good for
us to get a better feel for that.  
But make no mistake, it's going to be called and it may be ugly to begin with
a lot of free‑throw shooting. We have to make that adjustment quickly. But I
do think it's good for the game.  
  
Q. What were the areas of concerns after last season and what did you want
to improve this year?  
LISA BLUDER: I wasn't happy with our rebounding numbers. I thought we could
have done a better job offensively and defensively. That was a big concern for
us and going into the season I've always been a coach that stresses
rebounding, so it was shocking to me when I would look at the numbers after
the games and see our poor rebounding numbers.  
So we want to get better at that. A lot of things I thought we did well
shooting the ball, assist, I thought those categories were well and we can
always improve defensively but definitely rebounding has been a thorn in my
side.  
  
Q. Coach, do you approach the season with the inexperience in the post and
most of them coming off the bench this year than any other season?  
LISA BLUDER: Do I approach the‑‑  
  
Q. The nonconference and the exhibition portion of this season with the
inexperience at the power forward position.  
LISA BLUDER: I think the nonconference season is‑‑ you can't approach it any
differently. To me it's important because that's a big factor of who make the
NCAA Tournament at the end of the year. You can't use the nonconference season
to get ready for Big Ten.  
In my opinion, you're playing against great competition, Syracuse, Boston
College, USC, at Colorado, at Iowa State, hosting Dayton. We have a tough,
nonconference schedule and we have to be ready for that as much as we have to
be ready for the Big Ten or we will be sitting home in March. We're hosting
the NCAA Tournament this year. We're proud we're going to be one of the 16
sites that are hosting and we want to be there. So we have to be ready for
that nonconference season. We can't use it as a prep time for the Big Ten.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time today and best of luck this season.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 31, 2013

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now up is Michigan head coach Kim Barnes Arico. She enters her
second season at the helm. Last year they won 22 games and advanced to the
NCAA tournament for the second straight season.  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I'm excited to be here as usual. This is year two so a
little less stress, but a little more stress as well. Our team is coming off
of the best season in program history, and our senior class was the winningest
class in program history. We have graduated five of those seniors who really
made an impact on our program, and I think it's 96% of our scoring as well.  
So that being said, it's going to be a bit of a transition year for us. We
have a lot of inexperience, we have a lot of youth, but we're really excited
about the opportunity to get on the court. We have our exhibition game
tomorrow night.  
I think another thing that I really just wanted to touch base on, we're
excited about the opportunity to play in our league. I think our league has
some of the best teams in the country, and it's getting better and better each
and every single year with some of the best coaches in the country as well.  
We know we are going to have our hands full this year. We definitely know it's
going to be a lot of bumps in the road, a lot of youth, inexperience, we have
had some injuries as well. It's going to be a challenging year for us, but
we're excited about it and we are excited to be playing against the best
competition night in and night out in the country.  
  
Q. Can you enlighten us to the younger players who are going to be taking
the places of the seniors who left?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I wish they could be there, to help our kids get their feet
wet. We have one player on our team that's returning that actually played more
than 10 minutes a game and that's Nicole Emblad and she is with us today. She
averaged 4 points a game but worked hard in the off season and she'll be the
leader of our team. Some of the kids that are returning and coming off injury
and battling back and playing well and are exported to contribute are Cyesha
Goree a 6‑3 post kid for us who has worked hard on her game and expected to
contribute inside.  
Then we have three freshmen and a transfer, Shannon Smith, whose dad happened
to play at Michigan State but now wears the Maize and Blue quite often. She
transferred from North Carolina, via Trinity Valley and we are expecting her
to step in and score some points. She can play the 1, 2 and the 3. And then we
have three freshmen, and one is probably going to start at the point for us,
and that's Siera Thompson from California. She is a tough, hard‑nosed kid,
plays both ends, will defend well, can handle pressure and has the ability to
knock down the three. Danielle Williams is another freshman that we thought
would be able to contribute and she went down last week with a broken finger
that required a couple of pins, so she'll be out for at least a month, but
hopefully when she gets back.  
She played on a great high school team and they won the national championship
and her sister ‑‑ she is a twin ‑‑ is a freshman playing at UCLA. Our other
freshman is Paige Rakers, maybe in a couple of years she would have the
capabilities of someone like Kate Thompson but just isn't there right now.
Your freshmen some days look really good and other days look inexperience and
had young. Those are some of our new kids, Madison Ristovski is returning
inside, Kendra Seto and Val Driscoll are both coming off ACL surgeries that
will hopefully help us inside. Most of our returning team is either coming off
ACL surgery or a new player to our program.  
  
Q. Coach, given all those names, do you have any idea what the five that are
going to start tomorrow night in the exhibition are? And do you have any
indication of who those starting five will be in the regular season lineup?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: That's a great question. I'm sure coaches don't give you the
complete answer when they're up here because it's difficult to tell. With our
rule changes, I'm concerned about fouling and making sure people don't get in
early foul trouble as well. I think we have to be sensitive to who we are
going to be playing out there and making sure that they're giving us great
minutes. Right now if we started this minute, I know Siera Thompson would be
in there, Nicole Elmblad and Cyesha Goree would be in there, probably Shannon
Smith as well, but those last couple of spots are a toss up. From a coaching
perspective, it's good to have the kids unsure of who has the starting role
because then practices become a little more competitive, and everybody is
fightin' for an opportunity to get on the court.  
So I didn't mention two seniors that I know are really anxious to get out
there and excited for the opportunity and chomping at the bit a little bit so
I know they're going to be pushing some of those other kids. I think we will
go in with three solid starters and then probably mix it up throughout the
year as well.  
  
Q. Coach, coming in you have a vision for your style of play, how you want
to transform things through recruiting, where are you in that process in terms
of getting the types of players that you need to play the way you want to on
the court?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I think we're headed in the right direction. Like you said,
when I first got to Michigan I did have this vision and I think what was
important for me last year is that I inherited a team with five seniors that I
was not going to come in and change everything that had happened the last four
years.  
As much as it was a transition for them, it was a transition for me, and I
kinda went with their strengths and what they did best and they were
phenomenal and embraced me and made the transition so smooth for me and I'm
thankful for that class.  
Moving forward now, we have a bunch of young, inexperienced kids, so it's an
exciting time for me to really say, hey, this is how we want to play and this
is what we want to do.  
I think our transfer and our freshmen are really the style of play that we
want to play. They can get up and defend. They want to push the ball, get
up‑tempo, knock down shots. I know we can't comment too much about the kids
that haven't signed yet, but we are‑‑ it's incredible where we are in terms of
14, 15, 16s and 17s, and I think that's truly because of the University of
Michigan. When I arrived, I knew it was a special place, but now being there
for a year, I truly feel blessed every day to come to work at such a
prestigious university that prides itself on academics and being excellent in
everything it does.  
When I go out on the recruiting trail it's exciting for me to talk about
Michigan and get players to come and visit. Once they do they fall in love and
see the vision and see what Michigan stands for. I'm excited about our future
and I know this year might be tough at times and transition at times, but I've
also felt that we have been there before and we have young kids and they
understand it's a process.  
I think from a coaching standpoint it's important for me to keep them positive
and stress that it's a process and people are coming in, people are coming in
behind you and I watched it happen with Coach Beiline and our men and that was
exciting for me to watch last year with young kids, with freshmen and
sophomores and to have the opportunity to be a part of that and go along for
the ride and go to the Final Four and see how they did it. That's what we sell
every day and it's been done at Michigan. We just want it to happen on the
women's side.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time and good luck.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  62  
Michigan State - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Head Coach Suzy Merchant and student‑athletes
Kiana Johnson and Jasmine Thomas. Opening comments, Coach.  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, obviously disappointed, especially the first half. I
mean, that was kind of where the game was lost, basically. And that was
frustrating.  
I did like our fight in the second. I thought we did some pretty good things
to make it interesting and to hear the crowd trying to get back into it.  
But we just played very flat, defensively, and I thought obviously,
offensively, we had some really good looks. I mean, we didn't make layups, and
I think that was the difference. If we could have scored early, I think that
puts more pressure on people to score at the other end. And they do go hand in
hand. So just was not our night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kiana and Jasmine.  
  
Q. Jasmine, it looked like your teammates may have been fatigued going into
this.  
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, maybe it could have been a factor. Three games in
three days is no joke. But I don't know. We knew what we were getting
ourselves into, so it was kind of up to us to manage our bodies.  
  
Q. When you guys played Purdue last time, for either of you, you went down
there with a really big focus on defense. And tonight, I think they started
out 8 for 8 or 9 for 9. What was the difference early on with you guys on
defense?  
KIANA JOHNSON: I think it was our mentality. We weren't aggressive on the
defensive end. Our posts were giving good looks. We couldn't get over the back
screen, and we didn't have help side defense. That's what it was.  
  
Q. Even though you were down big at halftime, you guys came back and almost
made a game of it or did make a game of it. What changed for you? What did you
talk about at halftime that allowed you to come, you know, have some fight
left in you?  
JASMINE THOMAS: We weren't playing our basketball. I mean, like mentioned
before, started at the defensive end, and that's not where our focus was.  
So in the locker room, we kind of talked about locking down defensively and
slowing down offensively.  
KIANA JOHNSON: Going off of that, felt like on the offensive end, we were
individuals instead of a team. And we succeed when we play team basketball.  
  
Q. What makes Mingo such a difficult matchup?  
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, we knew going in she was a hardworking post player,
probably one of the hardest workers in the Big Ten. I mean, she just doesn't
stop. If she's not open in one area, she'll fight until she is. So I mean,
that's what makes her tough because she never quits.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Looked like the players were leaving their shots short. Was that the
lights?  
COACH MERCHANT: I don't know. I know we talked about that. We haven't played
three games in three days, but it is a group that has played extended minutes.
I mean, even in the beginning of the year when we had basically five people,
six people, blowing people out, even in games where you should have been
sitting them, they were used to logging lots of minutes.  
So I guess I don't‑‑ number one thing is we're not going to make an excuse. We
played badly. We had shots. I don't know if you need your legs to make a
layup. I mean, just throwing that out there.  
I mean, you're two feet from the basket, and I'm not sure you need to be
elevating to a point that you need all of your legs. You just need to focus
and finish.  
So to me, we were not very sharp. And I think had we scored a little bit
earlier to start things out‑‑ we talked about being more actionary versus
reactionary, and I think it was completely the opposite. We just kind of took
whatever they did.  
Drey Mingo single handedly‑‑ our team had 14 points and she had 14 at the
half, for crying out loud. We're not that bad of an offensive team.  
I talked to the team about consistency. That's what's been hard this year, to
be honest, is like you can't have‑‑ everyone's going to have an elevated game
or two, but if you look at Purdue, for example, a lot of their successes come
from the same people mostly stepping up.  
Drey, I feel like Drey, Moses and KK are pretty consistent players and
double‑digit scorers for them, night in night out, and they get contributions
in other ways from other players.  
For us, it's not been like that until recently. We've had one kid that I feel
like going into the last ten games I knew exactly what she was going to give
us, and that was Jasmine Thomas.  
So that's been a little bit of our Achilles' heel is that we need everybody.
We don't have a deep bench, and we need everybody. So when one person isn't as
sharp, it affects our entire ability to do some things. That's why we practice
defense so much, because we think we can at least defend sometimes. Most of
the time.  
  
Q. You will have some basketball ahead presumably with the tournament. What
will you do to get the disappointment out of their heads and focus on the next
step?  
COACH MERCHANT: I haven't even gone there yet. It's still disappointing. I
think you've got to feel it a little bit. You've got to be disappointed in
order to kind of regroup and decide what kind of team you want to be.  
And I feel good about our team. I think‑‑ I'm very proud of them. It's just
disappointing that that wasn't the team that showed up here the last two days.
And it was frustrating.  
And I'm frustrated for Jasmine and Schiff, too, because they rely on their
teammates to be there for them.  
So to answer your question, I'm really not worried about getting the
disappointment. I hope it fuels them a little bit, that they use it to think
about what kind of player they want to be the next time they step foot on the
floor and what kind of aggressor we want to be.  
And it was disappointing, but I give Purdue a lot of credit. I thought Drey
Mingo was amazing, absolutely amazing, and I'm really happy that she got her
extra year and what a story and what a class act she is. And very, very proud
of what she's been able to accomplish with all of her adversity. I think she
represents the Big Ten and all of us very, very well. So give more credit to
her and her team than certainly the disappointment of our team.  
  
Q. Last time you guys played, Annalise was a really big factor for you guys.
Why do you think she wasn't able to get going tonight?  
COACH MERCHANT: I don't know. This entire tournament, I couldn't find the
Annalise that we've had. I don't know where she went. I was asking her. I
don't know. We've got to find her. She's a tough matchup. She's obviously a
big 3 man for us and can face up as a 4 as well. And I'm not sure why.  
She just‑‑ and obviously we had some other kids playing a little bit better in
that Penn State game. And sometimes it isn't necessarily what she's not doing;
it might be what somebody else is, so in that situation.  
But I still don't feel like she's being the player she can be. And she's gotta
come back to us. She really does. I thought today, I mean, in particular, we
had a few kids that were not the players that they can be and have been at
times.  
  
Q. Kind of the same thing, I guess, talking about Klarissa and she didn't
score a point. So what was going on, I guess?  
COACH MERCHANT: I have no idea. You should ask her. I don't know. I asked our
players. They didn't know. She's kind of tough to read sometimes like that.  
So when it just kept being consistent at both ends of the floor, maybe
sometimes it's better to sit down and give somebody else a try. And when we
did that, we made a pretty good run I thought that second half. I think we
gave her opportunities.  
That's what I'm talking about with her a little bit is the consistency piece.
I mean, she was way more aggressive and confident obviously the Michigan
thing, and then obviously very good defensively, but dropped offensively
yesterday, and then today was kind of so‑so on both sides of the ball.  
So I don't know what happened. I don't know if her legs just caught up. I
don't know if there was something going on outside. But I'm not sure. I don't
know.  
And she's a tough one. I mean, she's got a lot of talent and skill. And so one
of the things that she has to really work on in the off season is what kind of
player do you want to be, and that has to be consistent. You really have to
want to take on challenges and connect with your teammates.  
And for some reason it wasn't there tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of expand on the way that Jasmine Thomas has been
playing here. I think this was the eighth straight game in double figures in
all tournament.  
COACH MERCHANT: Wow, it's such a blessing to have someone play so hard like
that on both ends of the floor. She's doing so much for her teammates. And
that's the frustrating thing for me because I'm kind of a fiery, competitive
person. And when I see someone doing that, I don't understand how other kids
cannot jump in and play just like that or find a way to bring that kind of
emotional connection to the team.  
And that was what was hard for me tonight, because I thought JT was like
really bringing it and we couldn't get anybody else to join her. And we've had
that happen in the past, and that's not a good situation for us.  
So to comment, she's just been unbelievable. You couldn't write a better story
as a senior, as a captain. We owe this entire season to be 24‑8 in a
championship game is largely, largely due to Jasmine Thomas and her will to
win.  
  
Q. Outside of maybe duct tape and handcuffs, what could you guys have done
differently to defend Mingo?  
COACH MERCHANT: I don't know. We probably could have gone zone earlier. I
just‑‑ that's not what got us here, though. I think you know that about me.
You know where I came from and who I've played for in the past. So it's hard
for me to pull the trigger sometimes with zone. That's a true statement.  
I felt like‑‑ I was a little bit worried about their shooters. And when I see
zone, I see open opportunities for Courtney Moses, and she got away from us
finally over time. It took some time, thankfully, but she did get away from us
there. So maybe a little bit more of that pressure so we could play more gaps
and help and that kind of thing.  
But I don't know. I don't understand. We were really good defending her that
second time down there. And I thought our post defense against Penn State was
really good. So it was a shock to see each post player have three fouls in
like three minutes. And she has 14 points, and I don't know how long that
took, but it wasn't very long.  
So that's, again, the consistency thing that I didn't quite know what to do
with.  
  
Q. If you wouldn't mind looking big picture for just a minute, what can you
expect out of your team in the NCAA Tournament? And maybe even bigger picture
than that, what's it going to take for a Big Ten team to make a deep run into
the tournament and why don't you think that that's happened in a while?  
COACH MERCHANT: Geez, I don't know. Sometimes I think it's matchups. I think
the women's game still has a little ways to go. When we have these home sites,
things are manipulated with seeds that I'm not sure‑‑ maybe are accurate. I
know they try to be, but at the end of the day, you want your home people
playing on the home court that might adjust a seed just one notch, just to
make it fit.  
And then a 7‑10 really is maybe not a 7‑10 game. Maybe a 7 seed is really a 4
seed.  
So I think that could be some of it. But you're right. The time we go to work,
i think Penn State‑‑ there's a lot of us who have an opportunity. But I think
you have to look at Penn State and watch their success.  
They were a Sweet 16 team last year, which is a nice run, and they want to
take another step. And I think their defense and their athleticism will allow
them to do that.  
I know they wanted to win this thing here today, but in some ways, maybe just
getting a little taste of the things not going your way can inspire a team
like that to kick it up a notch.  
So I feel like they have a chance to be a Final Four team, I really do, given
the right matchups and the right situation. I feel it's an excellent team and
Coquese has done an amazing job.  
I think there's a lot of really good teams in our league, a lot of really good
battles this year. I hope to see six‑‑ I think last year we had seven in the
tournament. I'd love to see that again. But you just don't know. You really
don't know.  
I think Ohio State was the one that was a little bit on the bubble, but I'm
not sure.  
And then, you know I don't know, I don't know if that layover has anything to
do with it or not. There's other leagues that have the layover that we do. ACC
is finishing up. I think ACC, SEC. So they have some layover, too, and those
are teams that have been in Final Fours.  
I used to think that was the problem, but you look at it and say it's hard to
say that when you see Big East teams and things like that in the tournament.
But it's all right.  
I think our league has a lot to be proud of, student athlete‑wise,
coaching‑wise, performance‑wise. It's a tough league top to bottom, so I
expect the committee to reward us and hopefully put us in positions where we
can make runs.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  62  
Michigan State - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Head Coach Sharon Versyp, and student‑athletes
KK Houser, Drey Mingo, and Courtney Moses.  
COACH VERSYP: I'm thrilled and very proud of our team and this group. They
just have another level. You just saw the switch kind of click when we played
Illinois at home our last home game. And then it turned to March. They just
had a different mental focus, energy. And February, we knew we struggled a
little bit and there's reasons for that.  
But we came out and we know that we wanted to win the Big Ten championship,
and I've never been so proud of a group of young women.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for KK, Courtney, and Drey.  
  
Q. Drey, a year ago, you stood in street clothes as your teammates won the
Big Ten Tournament. At that time you didn't know whether you'd be back or not.
Just all things considered, with what you've been through, how sweet is
this?  
DREY MINGO: It feels amazing. I'll never forget, Coach V looked in my face
after we won last year and said, we will get back. I'm so happy that we did.
I'm elated right now.  
  
Q. You gave Sharon a big old hug after your TV interview. Was that part of
what she told you last year, just a reminder what she told you?  
DREY MINGO: Yeah, definitely. And to thank her for giving me this moment and
this opportunity.  
  
Q. Not only to win the title, but to have the type of game you had, you
seemed focussed yesterday when we talked to you about playing in the title
game, but to have this type of game, just kind of your emotions of the way you
went out in this game.  
DREY MINGO: Just credit to my teammates. My teammates just kept giving me the
ball, and I just tried to finish the best I could for them. But credit to my
teammates for it all.  
  
Q. KK, can you talk about the job Drey did? Didn't miss a shot, from the
inside, really sort of controlled everything.  
KK HOUSER: Drey was awesome tonight. She just came out with so much fire and
energy. And right from the get‑go, we were just feeding her and feeding her
and feeding her, and she was unstoppable. I wouldn't want to play against her.  
I'm speechless. Drey played amazing, and it really fired up our team.  
  
Q. Courtney, how you pounded it inside and when the two post players picked
up the two fouls, did you feel like you had them on their heels at that
point?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah. The very first play of the game it went straight to
Drey, and when Drey scored, I just knew that the posts were going to go off
tonight and Drey was going to have an awesome game.  
We just kept going to the post. That was the game plan. And we executed what
the coaches want. And like KK said yesterday during press, when we execute,
good things happen.  
  
Q. KK, they got it down to nine there in the second half. You guys needed a
couple of buckets and found a couple there in a row with Courtney there
hitting the back ‑to‑back 3s. How big at that point was it to allow you guys
to maybe breathe a little bit again in the second half?  
KK HOUSER: Those are huge buckets for us. We know they're going to make a run.
They're a great team. We just wanted to hold them off.  
Courtney came up so clutch for us. That really got us going, fired us back up
to finish the game strong.  
  
Q. Courtney, just from where you guys were out in February, two and five in
that month, what has changed so dramatically with you guys?  
COURTNEY MOSES: I would say that during February, we really took a step back
and everybody just looked at theirselves in the mirror and said, what could I
do better, and stepped up to the challenge. And we know we want to send the
three seniors out with an amazing end to the season.  
  
Q. Drey, you've had considerable success against Michigan State in all three
games this season. What's it about the Spartans that allows you to have such
good games?  
DREY MINGO: I would just say executing the game plan. I think we did a good
job pretty much in all those three games, except for the one we lost at home.
But I would just say executing the game plan.  
  
Q. Courtney, you've watched pretty close as Drey has gone through some
things over the last couple years with the sickness and then being out just
last year. How nice does it feel to help her to this win?  
COURTNEY MOSES: It's awesome. I actually didn't realize Drey didn't play last
year when we won. So when you guys said that earlier, I was like, KK, Drey
wasn't on the court with us?  
Obviously I'm very excited knowing that, to get her back there. And Drey is
just an awesome person and she deserves it.  
  
Q. KK, so you guys did bring your Indianapolis magic with you this week?  
KK HOUSER: Yeah. We walked in. We made it our home. And when we got here,
there was no looking back.  
  
Q. Just talk about the start, how you guys didn't miss a thing in the first
few minutes. Were you surprised? Were you aware that you were in that much of
a zone?  
DREY MINGO: Michigan State is a very great team. They're really aggressive and
they're really physical. We knew we would have to dig our feet in and get
started early and get off to a great start. So I think that's what we tried to
do.  
  
Q. Why do you think that Purdue plays so well in this title game? Is it a
coincidence? Are you guys lucky? Does Coach Versyp recruit a bunch of gamers.
You're always in the title game. You win it a lot. What about this tournament
game?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Since I've been here, I know every year, we've been playing
for something bigger than ourselves. Last year we were playing for Drey, and
this year we're playing for Coach Kix.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I think Drey maybe squeezed some life out of you there after that TV
interview. But just your emotions of watching her do what she did tonight, get
the MOP and then especially after last year being in street clothes.  
COACH VERSYP: When she went through her incident, she never thought she'd play
ball again. I looked her in the eye and I said, I'm not sure if you'll play
ball, but you'll still going to be a doctor and you're still going to be fine.  
She became‑‑ she was able to play. I said, your dreams aren't going to die.  
And then last year when she was part of the Big Ten Championship, I looked her
dead in the eye, I said, we will be back and you will play well and you will
lead us to a championship.  
And she didn't suck the life out of me. She put more life into me, because she
just‑‑ she's a walking miracle. She's an inspiration, and I'm just so happy
that things worked out the way it did for her and our team.  
  
Q. Your ability offensively in the first 15 minutes to really pound them
inside and get them in foul trouble. That was the whole game right there after
you were able to hang on.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah. We put a couple of new wrinkles in, but how they played
defense, they're really on the high side, down low, so we tried to attack the
baseline with a pass. DeeDee fed the post and Drey real well in the beginning,
and we were trying to spread them out and attack them.  
When we executed, we set screens, we just scored. And when our players do
those things and they score, then it just builds confidence. So we keep going
back to it, and we got those two in foul trouble, which obviously helped us
immensely.  
  
Q. In the last game in West Lafayette, you had little runs where you
couldn't score to end the halves, and then to start this game, you had the
perfect eight for eight or eight for nine start, how important was it to know
the caliber of defensive team Michigan State is?  
COACH VERSYP: I wasn't surprised because they're playing really well. And when
we execute‑‑ I think Nebraska is a great team. When we executed, we did some
good things inside, outside. So I felt if they were going to stop us one way,
we were able to score another way.  
And we had lulled ourselves to sleep a bit and they were coming back, and then
we were able to knock two 3s, which were the big change.  
Both teams are exhausted, so it was just whoever was going to get out to a
great start and able to finish shots, i think, was the one who was going to
control the tempo.  
  
Q. What's this title mean knowing everything you've gone through with Terry
and the season ‑long situation with her. But to cut down nets and have a
championship, what does that mean?  
COACH VERSYP: I mean, it's extremely emotional at a very high level. And these
players stepped up to another level. And like Courtney said, they're
constantly looking over. And when Terry was there, it's the best time. When
she's not there, then they worry.  
And for her to be here this weekend, couldn't have asked for any better
celebration and exclamation point to win the tournament and for her being here
for these three days.  
  
Q. Why was Drey able to be so successful against Michigan State in all three
games, really?  
COACH VERSYP: I think when she's posting up, she does a pretty good job of
being able to shoot with her left hand or right hand. But I think her
positioning is very good.  
And so we feel that there's a mismatch sometime when we have Taylor in and
Drey's at the 4 spot. We feel that we have a mismatch. So we feel that she can
post up and be stronger and more effective.  
So I mean it's more or less trying to see those matches. And then once a kid
is in the zone, it kind of just keeps going, and she definitely played
incredible tonight.  
  
Q. Coach Merchant mentioned yesterday that she texted you saying her son was
in the hotel room, saying, boiler up. What was your reaction to that and did
it seem like an omen, I guess?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't know. Suzy and I are very close friends. We have a great
friendship. She wished me luck, and I wished her luck. Now my boy is turning
into a‑‑ converted himself to a boilermaker rather than a Spartan. I guess he
just likes the boiler up thing.  
I think it's nice when you have colleagueship like that. And Suzy did a
phenomenal job with her team, and her son can come out and boiler up with me
any day.  
  
Q. We talked last week about bringing the Indianapolis magic up here, but KK
alluded to it, but do you like how they made this place their home and felt ‑‑
they looked comfortable and you feel like they played comfortable all
weekend?  
COACH VERSYP: As soon as we stepped on the court, I said, look at the court. I
do a lot of team building, a lot of mental imagery. And the first day we
stepped on the court to practice from 8:00 to 8:30. We were here early and we
stood around the circle and said this is like home. This is in Indianapolis.
The same court. Close your eyes and envision the WNBA Championship that we all
were a part of.  
And that we're going to win a championship and it's collective here, and just
kind of mental imagery all of that. And then each day, we always talked about
it, step one, step two, step three.  
So we made it our home in our brain, and physically it came to fruition.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  54  
Penn State - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Head Coach Suzy Merchant and Becca Mills and
Jasmine Thomas. Opening comments, Coach.  
COACH MERCHANT: We're happy to have a chance to play tomorrow, that's for
sure, and give all the credit to these guys and the ones in the locker room.  
Our defense has been the thing that has helped us succeed. And it's hard to
defend Penn State and keep them to a place where our offense could compete.
And we didn't do it for the two times we played them. They were in the 70s,
and we're not a real high‑scoring team, but we rely on our defense.  
So to see our defense come to fruition tonight, I'm very, very proud of them
and feel good about the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jasmine, what were you able to do with your speed, especially in the
second half, to kind of change the game for your team?  
JASMINE THOMAS: I don't know. The guards played us up tight, real close, even
before we started our dribble. And just to try to create space a little bit
just with that first step. But I don't know, I mean, it was to my advantage, I
guess.  
  
Q. Becca, just kind of talk about that 10 ‑0 run you guys went on after they
pulled within one on the Lucas 3, 34‑33\. You hit a big 3 during the run, and
just kind of talk about what worked well for you guys there.   
BECCA MILLS: We needed to pick up our defense. And I think after I hit the 3,
it kind of got us pumped up. And I think when we hit big shots like that, it
propels us in defense and makes us step up.  
  
Q. Jasmine, was there a point where you just said that you needed to look to
score a little more today in that second half?  
JASMINE THOMAS: Actually, I was thinking more give other people shots, because
my jump shot‑‑ I didn't feel as comfortable shooting it tonight.  
But I don't know. It was just take what they give you.  
  
Q. Jasmine, I was watching you part of the game and you had a real like
blank look on your face, even when you guys had ‑‑ you just kept‑‑ seemed
really calm and cool the whole time. What was going through your mind? This is
obviously a big game, senior, and you're trying to get to the title game, but
you still seemed pretty calm like the entire time.   
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, yeah, because it's like a 40‑minute game. And Penn
State is the type of team where they can get it going instantly. And there's
no time to celebrate. You just gotta stay in the game, stay in the moment. And
keeping that calm presence, I think, with my teammates looking at me, it
satisfies them as well.  
  
Q. Maggie Lucas on Penn State, how were you able to keep poised when she was
making 3s, especially in the last couple of minutes?  
JASMINE THOMAS: Yeah, she's a shooter. She's a scorer. I mean, we kind of know
automatically just kind of going in. But we just have to tighten up and try to
get through those screens even better the next time.  
  
Q. Jasmine, how much did that tape on your hand affect you tonight?
Obviously you still were able to lead the team. Was that affecting you at
all?  
JASMINE THOMAS: It was uncomfortable. I mean, I'm not going to put blame on
the tape. But I mean, it is what it is. I don't think it was a contributing
factor.  
  
Q. Becca, you guys were down 16 ‑5 at the start. Did you think that maybe
you guys were in serious trouble at that point?  
BECCA MILLS: No. I think that Penn State definitely is a team of runs. They
came out really hot on us. And we needed to take a deep breath. We were
playing too fast and slow down and get back to our game and get stops on
defense, because that's what we do well. And then when we do that, we play
better on offense.  
  
Q. Jasmine, just being a senior now, being able to play for a Big Ten
championship, in the last sort of second half of the season, you came up,
really clutched for your team in a lot of different situations. What does this
mean for you to play for a championship at the end of it all?  
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, we're there now. I mean, that was the plan coming in,
to try to fight to the end. And now that we're here, we just gotta give it our
all tomorrow.  
  
Q. Becca, you had nine rebounds. Jasmine Hines had 14. Could you speak to
her rebounding performance?  
BECCA MILLS: Jasmine was a beast today. Nikki Greene is not a little girl. She
was battling down there, and I think Jas worked really hard. And you could see
it with all her rebounds. She did a really good job for us.  
COACH MERCHANT: Jasmine Hines is not a little girl. Of the petite ones.
(Laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked Jasmine how calm she was during the game. Does that really
help your team during those runs? She just seemed the whole time that she was
very flank and very focused in.  
COACH MERCHANT: It helps, because I'm a crazy maniac, so we balance each other
out, I guess.  
Yeah, I think one thing, when Jasmine went to a point guard school one summer
and she came back with a lot of notes, and one of the things she told me that
she learned there was be the face your team needs to see. And that's a quote
that she came back from. And she always kind of refers back to it.  
And it was interesting you talked about that, because in the past, I think I
would read her wrong, you know, when she's like that. And probably did.  
And this year, just really getting to watch her mature and her game develop
and that‑‑ always going back to that's the face her team needs to see, calm,
poised. Becca commented on that. We played way too fast and too panicky out of
the gate, and Jas is one of those kids that can stay calm in the heat of the
battle. So that was big.  
In fact, when we would go to our timeouts, she would actually kind of take a
little bit of a walk away from her team, I think just to get herself together,
get her heart rate down, to get her focused, and to keep that same face that
her team needed to see every possession.  
  
Q. After that slow first half, especially shooting for you guys, what
changed in the second half, more efficient, better numbers?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, we knew we had to come out and be a better offensive
team in the second half, because I just felt like we took a stick and hit a
big beehive. We just angered a little bit a bunch of bees in there because of
their offense is so potent.  
And so I said to the girls, it's like we know they're going to come out.
There's aggressive attacking, crazy scores that can take over games in
seconds. And if you watch all their film‑‑ in fact, we showed a clip at film
today‑‑ or yesterday where in the Ohio State game, in 35seconds, they scored‑‑
Maggie Lucas got the 3 and got fouled. They got a steal, hit a 3, and Bentley
scored a layup in about a 35‑ 40‑second span. It's like 8, 9, 10 kind of
thing. It was that potent.  
So we talked about being aggressive, but at the same time, we had to play
slower.  
We felt like we were playing rushed and rushing our shots and rushing our
reads and just weren't ourselves offensively. And I thought getting stops
helped us a little bit because we were able to control the tempo at that
point.  
  
Q. Can you expand on the defense a little bit? Like you said, you gave them
in the 70s earlier, and it was 16 ‑5, and then you outscored them 49 to 30 the
rest of the way. It's their season low in points. That's a phenomenal effort.
Expand your thoughts a little bit on your defensive effort tonight.   
COACH MERCHANT: We did a couple of different things to Penn State. We call it
downing a ball screen, where we wouldn't let them use it, and we kind of
gate‑trapped it to the strong side.  
And the one thing, if you watch them in their triangle offense, every guard,
they'll put Maggie Lucas sometimes at the top of the key, so that whole lane
line is open to the middle.  
And so we really talked about forcing our foot angles to the sideline and
never getting beat middle.  
Now, late, I thought we broke down. But we didn't let them get middle and we
bound ball screens at the wing and in the corner.  
So basically what that means is you're going to say you're not going to come
over the top of the ball screen and use it. And they do a lot of damage that
way.  
The other thing that I thought was big to make sure that they could score in a
range that we could compete with them was not give it back to them for
turnovers, for touchdowns. We had 29 points in turnovers, I think, the last
time we played them. I don't know exactly, but I think it was somewhere around
there.  
And I think tonight they had six. Our goal was 10, 12 at the most. But we
could not give them points that they didn't earn. And I thought our kids did a
nice job of that.  
  
Q. Could you speak about Jasmine Hines's play today?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yeah, she was big. And she had been struggling a little bit
there down the stretch. And I think you can get in your own way sometimes. And
she was overthinking, overtrying. So sometimes you just gotta sit down for a
while. As much as we needed her, I think when she wasn't playing, it
frustrated her. So when she came out, she was more focused on really trying to
perform to the best of her ability.  
We were winning. We didn't have to have her. But it certainly humbled her a
little bit, and I think she wants to contribute.  
She gets people in foul trouble because she's so powerful. And tonight, it's
the best I've ever seen her defensive rebound, and that was probably more
important than the offensive rebounding.  
  
Q. Same question that was asked of Jasmine: What does this mean especially
for the seniors? I know Schiffauer hit the shot that gave you guys the lead
for the first time, and then obviously Jasmine's performance tonight. What
does the chance to play for the championship mean for that?  
COACH MERCHANT: It's really big. You always come here with that intent. And
you always leave sometimes when you come up short a little disappointed. I
mean, you know you're looking forward to the post season, but it's a long time
to wait. And it's nice to have a chance to play for that kind of hardware and
that kind of trophy.  
And I'm so proud of this group. We even lost Akyah Taylor in the game
yesterday, so now our rotation is even smaller. She's not even here. She had
to go home. She has a fracture in her face and a concussion. I don't know.
We're just going to go to the hotel and get in a bubble and come back here
tomorrow at 3:00 at this point.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off of that, halfway through you had the foul trouble with
Pickrel and Schiffauer, and the others a little bit later, the players were
gassed. Like you mentioned, Taylor's not in there. Just what can you say about
your team's fight, I guess, considering all of that and then to sort of battle
back at the end of the game?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, especially how Penn State plays. It's not like you can
take a break and get your composure, dribbling the ball up and take a few
seconds.  
I mean, they are a full court, in your face, pressure, deny, hard headed/trap
ball screens for 40 straight minutes. That is emotionally, mentally, and
physically taxing on a group of about six or eight kids.  
So that's what makes me proud is a lot of people can play with Penn State for
23 minutes, maybe 30, maybe 32, maybe 36. But it's hard to finish against them
because of the consistency at which they perform and their defense and their
offensive transition.  
So I was very pleased. We gave up some offensive rebounding opportunities just
to be sure that they couldn't get easy baskets in transition.  
So I'm proud of them. I really am. I thought it was one of the most kind of
inspiring‑‑ it was just fun to watch a band of kids just fight and compete and
not everything go their way, but find a way.  
  
Q. Top two seeds are now out in this tournament, what does that say about
the depth of this conference, with you guys and Purdue advancing to the Finals
tomorrow?  
COACH MERCHANT: We've been talking about that, and a lot of people have asked
me through the media‑‑ and I agree with that‑‑ I think it's just like the
men's side. It's just a bizarre league in that if you don't bring high energy
and focus and aggressiveness and play and compete at a high level, you could
get beat.  
The one thing I'll say about playing Purdue, I actually texted Sharon this
morning and wished her luck or whatever, and we're good friends, and I told
her the story at 6:00 this morning, my two‑year‑old jumps in bed and says:
Mommy, can I get some juice? And I said okay. So I go over get him juice. And
I turn around and my two‑year‑old is sitting in bed and he's going: Boiler up,
(clapping), boiler up, (clapping), over and over. I went, oh, my gosh, what's
happening. My Spartan is a Purdue boilermaker. That's how I started my morning
at 6:15. So I thought Sharon would get a kick out of that.  
But now I'm going to put my kid in a closet. Is that bad? Probably bad.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  77  
Nebraska - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH VERSYP: We knew it was a tough game playing Nebraska in six overtimes.
And today I think collectively this is one of our best games that we played
all year, offensively, defensively, really followed the game plan, executed
inside/outside. And I thought our defense in the first half was a big key to
our success today.  
  
Q. KK, at times over the last month, you guys have struggled against zone
defenses. Can you talk about what the difference was tonight and how you were
sort of able to attack Nebraska's zone in the second half?  
KK HOUSER: I think we just finally started listening to the coaches. They
tells us all the time: Have confidence, knock down your shots and then they
won't play zone on you. But we were so hesitant in the past.  
But finally started listening to Coach and just started feeling comfortable
and we started knocking down shots.  
  
Q. Courtney and Sam, just the last ten minutes of the first half, what
really started working for you guys at that point?  
COURTNEY MOSES: I feel like defensively we really picked up the intensity. We
got a couple steals. We had some transition baskets. And the biggest thing was
we were going inside and scoring and then we were also going inside and
outside and scoring outside. Once started doing that, it's really hard to
defend.  
SAM OSTARELLO: I think we just stayed aggressive, and that's really important.
We were playing to win, not playing not to lose, kind of like we may have done
in the past, just kind of just not being aggressive, not going to the hole.
And we changed that today and that showed.  
  
Q. Sam, why are you guys playing with so much confidence right now?  
SAM OSTARELLO: I think it's our team chemistry. We love each other. We don't
want this season to end. We want to get as many games as we can. And I think
that really shows on the court.  
Our team chemistry, it's sky high. We do all these kind of bonding and
everything. Maybe during the time, we're like, uh, another bonding. But
because we spend so much time outside of basketball with each other anyway,
but it really shows. We really love each other.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you speak to KK's all ‑around game today, especially on
the defensive end, how she got six steals and maybe how she controlled things
on the perimeter tonight?  
COURTNEY MOSES: KK did an awesome job of drawing the tempo of the game. She's
done it all year. And she was just hailing their pressure. They were pressing
her the whole time. She did a great job of staying poised and getting us in
the offense. She was finding her shot. She was attacking.  
At the beginning of the game, it really got us going when she was driving and
she was knocking down 3s and doing everything.  
  
Q. KK, when they were in their man early and in the first half, you guys
were really able to go inside. Was that part of the game plan? Did you feel
like you guys had a good advantage inside?  
KK HOUSER: That was one of our main themes of our game plan was to go inside.
We had an advantage since Hooper and Katie like to be more like guards, so we
just wanted to get inside and have our post attack them.  
  
Q. KK, last year in the tournament, kind of rose to the occasion against
Nebraska. Obviously you're from Lincoln, but just kind of your emotions going
into the game how you played against Nebraska during your career so far?  
KK HOUSER: The beginning of the game, I tried to act like it was just another
game, but it's Nebraska. I'm from there. I always want to beat them. I never
want to lose. So I step on the court and I'm ready to go for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. They got within 10 on a couple of times in the second half. What did you
tell your team when they were sort of looking like they were going to try to
get back in, close the game and push you guys a little more?  
COACH VERSYP: When I called timeout, just talked about our poise. We said they
were going to make a run. This is their run. We need to score and then get a
stop. And when I called the timeout, I said we're going to come out of here
and we're going to score the next basket.  
And in the first half, we were making our layups; second half, we missed some.
And that's how they were able to make some transitions.  
So pretty much I had somebody step up and knock down a 3 after that timeout.
And then that kind of just gave a little relaxation and everybody just kept
playing and continued to force other people to take shots when it came down to
crunch time.  
  
Q. KK gave you a lot of credit there, but what did they do well against that
zone defense that maybe they hadn't been doing here over the last month?  
COACH VERSYP: They listened. They executed. They listened. Sometimes they try
to force more against the zone, rather than just letting the game come to them
and seeing the openings. And I think with April and KK knocking down some 3s
and seeing that, they can't all sag in. They'll sag in off of a couple of our
players, but just being able to execute and when they knocked down the shot
against the zone, then just like anything, it kind of just gives them a boost
of confidence.  
But they're looking for the things that we've asked them to look for.  
  
Q. You made Jordan Hooper disappear in the second half. What was the special
attention?  
COACH VERSYP: Drey Mingo. I was telling Drey she's not doing anything, but she
did a lot tonight. Trying to motivate a kid. But the scoring wasn't coming for
her. But I think Drey, when we played them the first time, Drey's length, she
really chased her 37 minutes the first game. This time it was 25 minutes. We
had her and Dee Dee Williams on her, just trying not allow her to have easy
looks and contest a lot of shots.  
We have a lot of respect for Hooper and Drey did a good job and Dee Dee, and
just a collective team effort.  
  
Q. The first half was pretty Helter Skelter there for a while. And with
about seven and a half minutes to go, Moses and Houser hit back ‑to‑back
threes, gave you a seven‑point lead and started some separation there that you
were able to go on to 11 points by halftime. And then how big was that at that
time to get a little separation in that scoreboard?  
COACH VERSYP: It had to happen at some point, 'cuz like you said, it was
Helter Skelter. Everybody was just pushing the tempo, going up and down as
hard as both teams could.  
I said at some point we've got to settle down and be able to really execute
and knock down some shots in the half court. But I thought it was a
transition. Those 3s came in transition. I thought that was a big boost. We
love to run. And when you got the two guards knocking down 3s, then the inside
opens up.  
  
Q. Just how big of a presence was Taylor inside and coming in? Was she ‑‑
was that somebody that you felt like would have an advantage against their
post inside players?   
COACH VERSYP: I feel Taylor has an advantage. Anyone that we play. We're like,
you gotta get inside. You've got to post up. You make a difference. Whether
they foul you or not foul you, they have to pay attention to you.  
And there's two or three players on her. She continues to finish well. She's
always in double‑double. She's always shooting 50percent or more. And she gets
upset when she misses any shots or any free throws. So you like that type of
kid.  
But it's tough, especially when we play Nebraska, because they don't really
like to have that low post presence. And Taylor's‑‑ it's just hard for people
to get around her.  
  
Q. Only ten turnovers in a game with that pace. And when they went to the
full court press there, how you at times continued to attack against that.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I think playing Illinois helped us with that. I said that
on the radio. Just that frantic, being able to trap, being a 1‑3‑1, getting it
to the middle and kicking it out and being able to attack. And I thought Sam
O. did a great job in the half court when we came to the middle attacking,
whether for her to score or getting it to Drey on the baseline.  
Supposed to be accumulating knowledge, and it's continuing to work, thank God.  
  
Q. What's the secret behind the third seed? This is like five for five,
third seed, and the winner of the semifinals.  
COACH VERSYP: I'm not sure it's a seed. I think it's just a group of young
women that play at Purdue that have a tradition, and we talk about the
tradition of everyone before us.  
And they just take a lot of pride, and I hope we can continue to play well in
March Madness.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  77  
Nebraska - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska Coach Connie Yori and Jordan Hooper
and Lindsay Moore. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH YORI: I thought Purdue played really well. Really, they kind of had a
lot of the facets of their game going. They got the ball inside on us, and
they drove it. They got their transition game going. They hit enough perimeter
shots. And the game was decided by what I call the two elephants, and the
elephants in the game were rebounding and turnovers. And we didn't really take
care of either of those areas and, really, that was costly for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lindsey, I think you guys had a couple of chances to get it in the single
digits in the second half. What prevented you guys from making a run and were
they doing anything specifically?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I think we just missed some easy buckets inside. We had good
looks at it to break into the single digits, but we just weren't able to
connect on it.  
  
Q. Lindsey, was there anything in particular they did against your defense
that helped them in the first half, at the end of the first half, and then
throughout the second half?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I just thought their post play today was really, really
excellent. They knew what they wanted to do, and they were able to really do
it. They have a good post presence inside with their postups that they have.
So I think they just did a really good job of executing that, and playing into
their strengths.  
  
Q. KK had six steals in this game. How much does her pressure bother you
guys in the back court?  
JORDAN HOOPER: Well, I mean, it bothers us quite a bit. We can't get the ball
advanced up the court, can't really do what we want to do in that facet.  
But usually we can set drags between stuff like that and it releases pressure.  
LINDSEY MOORE: She did a good job defensively today. She's a risk/reward
player, and so she just was able to come up with steals and it was rewarded
for her.  
  
Q. Jordan, their playing inside was really strong. What did they do
specifically? Is it positioning type of thing or are they just ‑‑ just have
skilled big men?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I mean, they get pretty deep position on us. We're not as big
as physical as they are, and they can pretty much back us down and didn't
really have an answer for that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What changes did you make after the first half when they shot like
54percent? Seems like they shot a lot worse in the second half. Did you change
anything or did you just emphasize some stuff?  
COACH YORI: Well, we ran some more zone. We ran more zone in the second half
early. And but then we still played a lot of man as well as the half wore on.  
But we just got‑‑ we allowed too many easy post touches in the first half. And
I thought that was a big key for them shooting the percentage they did.  
  
Q. Coach, the offensive rebounding numbers were pretty similar, but I feel
like the rebounds that they got were more impactful, just in bigger
situations. Did you feel that way, that they always got the one that
matters?  
COACH YORI: This is the elephants I'm talking about. The two elephants. Even
though the turnovers weren't significantly different, the rebounds, offensive
rebounds weren't significantly different, but they cashed in on both of those
areas. They were able to, when they turned us over, it led to baskets. When
they got offensive rebounds, they were able to shoot a high percentage there.  
  
Q. How did you feel like they adjusted when it was a close game? You guys
got out 21 ‑20, how did you feel like they adjusted, or did you guys just not
play well in that stretch at the end of the first half?   
COACH YORI: Well, I thought they‑‑ again, I'm kind of going back to they got
the ball inside on us too much. They crashed the glass. And we didn't do a
good enough job of boxing out. And they got some easy baskets there. And we
got taken out of our offense a little bit. We weren't as efficient as we
needed to be.  
So I just thought Purdue played well. I think that's a big part of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2013

  

### [Alex Bentley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20493)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  54  
Penn State - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Coquese Washington and student‑athlete
Alex Bentley. We'll go straight to questions for Alex.  
  
Q. Alex, in the second half, what did Michigan State do to seal the deal for
them and how were you guys unable to get things going especially in the last
five minutes?  
ALEX BENTLEY: They played good defense. They tried to stop us from getting in
the lane and forced us to go into the baseline, and we just couldn't get our
offense going.  
  
Q. How frustrating is that, not to be able to get that offense going? Maggie
hits those two big 3s, and I thought maybe that momentum had come and it just
dropped off. How frustrating is that for you guys?  
ALEX BENTLEY: It's frustrating, but you just gotta keep your head, keep your
cool and stay focused. Try to just stay disciplined on the game plan, play our
game.  
  
Q. Now with the tournament coming up, how do you guys kind of look past this
one and change things up again going into next week, kind of deja vu from last
year? You'll pick up from last year to kind of advance to the tournament ‑‑  
ALEX BENTLEY: You can't look past it. You can't look past a loss. We take what
we learned from this game and we learn from it and we get better and we use
that to move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Michigan State really slowed this game down there in the middle of the
second half. What did they do that maybe got you guys out of your game plan?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, Michigan State is a team that likes a slow pace. I
thought we had opportunities to push the pace and we just didn't use those.  
But one of the things they did do was they rebounded very well. And we didn't
rebound well at all during that stretch. So when you can control the boards,
you have a chance to control the pace. And the second half, they certainly
were the aggressors on the backboard.  
  
Q. Coach, people say all the time it's always hard to beat somebody for the
third time in a season. You know, you beat Michigan State twice by double
digits, what was different this time around?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We didn't shoot the ball well. We didn't shoot the ball well
at all. And they shot the ball much better than we did. Basketball's a‑‑ it's
about making baskets, and we had too many stretches where I thought we got
pretty decent looks that didn't go down.  
I thought we had some stretches of the game where we just shot too many quick
jump shots and that wasn't good. We didn't get into a flow.  
But I thought Michigan State played a very good defensive game. They're a very
good defensive team. And they played with a lot of energy on the defensive
end, a lot of enthusiasm. And we didn't match that energy. So that's the
difference.  
  
Q. Moving forward now, maybe besides shooting, what is the other improvement
you guys need to make next week before the tournament comes?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you can't get too high with highs and can't get too
low with lows. Basketball is a game of matchups.  
When you play in conference play, you know, teams are so familiar with you and
know your personnel and know the things that you like to do. And you go
forward to the NCAA Tournament, you don't know what your matchups are going to
be, you don't know anything like that. It's a new season.  
We get some time off, we can rest. We can get healthy, and get ready to go to
the NCAA Tournament with a renewed focus.  
  
Q. We saw regular season in the tournament kind of a mirror image of last
year. What's different this year heading into the tournament, with this
squad?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think our confidence. And you look at this game, it's an
anomaly. It might be the worst shooting game we've had all season. And again,
credit Michigan State, but this isn't who we are.  
I'm confident we'll go into the NCAA Tournament and we'll play better
offensively. I'm confident we'll go in the NCAA Tournament and we'll play
better defensively. And you have nights when you just play poorly.  
It is what it is. It was a night that we played poorly. We shot the ball
poorly. We got outrebounded. And we didn't have good flow on offense. That's
not who we've been all season. So I don't think that's who we'll be in the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Talked about your depth all year. You put in a number of players
especially early. Still a luxury to have, right, to be able to put in all
those players and have them play a decent amount of minutes?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. Again, Michigan State played very
well. They made shots. In the second half, I don't know what the score was at
halftime, but Debbie Antonelli is here. She switched the ball at halftime
because it wasn't great offense the first half.  
But they shot the ball much better the second half. And I thought they played
well. I thought Michigan State played a very good game and Jasmine Thomas hit
some big shots in the second half.  
And I also thought Becca Mills hit big shots. They did a good job moving
people around, getting their shooters big shots.  
Again, the game comes back to making shots, and they made shots in the second
half. And we didn't make enough of them, especially when it counted like
probably the last five minutes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference that the senior class makes and what
it's going to be to have that senior leadership heading into the tournament?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think when you have four, five seniors that we have that
have been through so many, have so much experience, I think that will carry
us. Certainly our kids are very disappointed right now.  
But they're a team that has good perspective and they'll keep this game in
perspective. Certainly a number of lessons that we can learn and we can apply
moving forward and our kids will do a great job of taking those lessons and
going forward with them. But the senior class, I think they have great
perspective and will be able to keep this game in perspective.  
  
Q. How much did it hurt losing Nikki to foul trouble with about eight
minutes left in the first half, and do you think that stops her from getting
into a flow offensively with the rest of the game?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Not only did it stop her from getting into a flow, I think
it stopped our entire offense from getting into a flow. I thought we were
doing a good job of moving the ball.  
And she's also a big key for us defensively, so losing her at the end of the
first half, you know, it got us out of our rhythm offensively. But we had it
the whole pretty much the whole second half and we never got back into the
rhythm. So that's something we've got to get better at. We've gotta work on
having a better flow when, offensive flow when she's not on the floor.  
  
Q. Noticed the toughness of Maggie Lucas. Certainly isn't a secret. But
tonight, especially late, she made some tough 3s. Made some tough 3s. What
does that say about the player she is, expanding on this stage, even down by
10 or 11 and still making those 3s?  
COACH WASHINGTON: She's a competitor. She's a competitor. And her drive and
her will to win are very, very high. So‑‑ and not just her, the entire team.
Our drive and our competitive fire is high. We just met a team tonight that
played better than we did, shot the ball better than we did, and rebounded
better than we did. So that's why we didn't get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue: 74  
Wisconsin: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Purdue coach, Sharon Versyp, along with KK
Houser, Drey Mingo and Sam Ostarello. Coach?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, we know the first game you play in a tournament you need
to get through hesitation and, you know, play through the game and the first
half and I thought Wisconsin obviously played a very good basketball game,
they did a great job yesterday, and today they broke us down off the dribble
quite a bit. We tried to go to zone and they did the same thing.  
We got our game plan back together at halftime and we executed what we needed
to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. KK, can you talk about picking them up full court like you did,
especially in the second half and how you were able to slow them down and wear
them out?  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, I decided to pick 'em up, be aggressive, and I think it
worked. We were trying to get the ball out of 35's hands, so I think we did a
successful job at pressuring them.  
  
Q. Drey, they only had two field goals for about 10 minutes, did the defense
intensity allow you guys to get going offensively? And help you get going?  
DREY MINGO: Definitely, that's a staple for our team getting stops and kinda
getting our offense started.  
SAM OSTARELLO: Pigging backing off what Drey said anytime we increase our
intensity and get layups the other day that bodes well for our team.  
  
Q. KK, I know Dee Dee guarded her well but can you talk about Paige and how
you limited her ability to score? What have you done well in the two games?  
KK HOUSER: Dee Dee is the best defender on our team so we can have her lock
down, that's what Dee Dee did and whoever switched off on her we wanted to
keep the ball out of her hands, she is a great guard, she can take off the
dribble, and take the 3, and keeping the ball out of her hands was our main
goal and Dee Dee did a great job on her.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about the job that Apriland Taylor did, freshmen in their first
tournament experience.  
SAM OSTARELLO: As freshmen they have no fear. I think we have seen that all
year. They stepped up and hit big shots and they understand it right now, and
that's huge for our team and that's‑‑ I just can't wait to see their growth
through the tournament. Like I said, they're fearless and that's awesome.  
  
Q. KK, the shots that Aprilhit in the second half, the three, three pointers
there in a 10 ‑minute span, how big were those to give you a cushion that
Wisconsin couldn't come back from?   
KK HOUSER: Huge and that's April's role. She just comes in and hits big shots
for us, and she is a smooth player.  
When they sag off and she is wide open and knocks down threes, that gives us a
boost so they were really big for us.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead to tomorrow, Drey, you get Nebraska. Prepare for
overtime, I guess, with people, but another shot at them and as you move on in
this tournament?  
DREY MINGO: I think it will be a great game, always fun to play against
Nebraska, and looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Players, you can head back. Questions for the Coach?  
  
Q. Apriland Taylor, if they had any tournament nerves they were not there
but throughout history you have had freshmen step up in these situations, they
did well today, didn't they?  
COACH VERSYP: Absolutely, did a great job on Courtney early not getting some
shots and we talked about Aprilbeing open a lot and she can knock down the
three just like anybody else on our team and she did it effectively so the
second half when I had the three small guards in, all of them could shoot the
three and everybody could take it to the hole and I told Aprilto bend her
knees and knock down the shot.  
For her to score more for us was big and she won a state championship, she
loves tournament time, you can see a different gleam in her eye, and Taylor is
Taylor, just knows how to play, she understands the game. Sometimes she is too
unselfish, quit passing the ball just score every time you get the ball down
low, we had a scare, she tweaked her ankle a little bit, glad she was able to
come back in.  
  
Q. Sharon, what did you do the second half to prevent Wisconsin from getting
in the game in the second half?  
COACH VERSYP: Played defense, got that going again and we changed the tempo,
started full‑court pressing at a certain time, didn't want to do that too
early, but we started doing that and they got the ball into an offensive set
with only 2 seconds, so trying to keep it out of 5 and 35's hands, and we did
that effectively.  
They didn't respond as well because of our pressure and that throws people out
of sync.  
  
Q. Sharon, the way Wisconsin pushed you for most of the game today, and
they're an 11 seed, does that lend to the evolution of the conference as a
whole in the RPI rankings? You've been around the Big 10 a long time. Is this
one of the strongest years you've seen in the last five to eight years?  
COACH VERSYP: I believe so. I keep saying that every year and every year it
gets tougher, and we have new coaches come in, different blood, different
style of recruiting and different style of the game, so I think that has
improved immensely.  
You have seen No. 12 knock off No. 1, 11 knock off No. 2 or 3, 11 knock off
No. 6, and you're seeing the parity. Any given day anything can happen, and
it's huge right now and when you add Rutgers and Maryland in another year or
two, it's really going to escalate.  
  
Q. Thoughts on tomorrow? Playing Nebraska? What do you expect?  
COACH VERSYP: I expect an up‑tempo game. They want to run as much as they can.  
I really feel that Lindsey Moore is the key to that team right now. When we
played them, we did a great job of trying to maintain our tempo, but I think
she has been the key why they have won so many games in a row. She knows how
to manage the clock, she is a senior point guard, she knows how much time to
take off the clock and she knows who the go‑to players are and she knocks down
the shot.  
I think they have more depth than they had last year. They have guards that
can come in and "D" you up, and Hooper ‑‑ her and Moore are the keys to their
team, but they have more than just those two.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

NEBRASKA  76  
IOWA - 61

  
Q. Jordan, talk about the success against Iowa; what has been the key?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I think it's our preparation. Our coach has done a great job of
getting us ready for Iowa every single time. I think it's kind of a pride,
too, wanting to beat Iowa, kind of a rivalry, right across the border and
stuff like that. They are a lot of fun to play.  
  
Q. For either of you guying, coming off the Penn State loss, how nice is it
to get that loss out of the way?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I think it's definitely key for us to come back and bounce back
from that, and obviously, you know, I don't think we played as well as we
could have, and so it's nice to come back and play well and shoot the ball
well and pass the ball well.  
  
Q. Jordan, what did you do special on Morgan Johnson?  
JORDAN HOOPER: We didn't really change our game plan from last game. Just
played behind her and pushed off the ball a little bit.  
  
Q. How critical was that stress going into halftime, it was an 8 ‑0 run?  
COACH YORI: Well, huge, you want to have momentum going into the half, and it
was on our side. And then we came out of half and did a lot of good things to
extend the lead, as well. I thought Rachel's shot at the top of the key, the
half was a big one. They are all big ones.  
  
Q. You've beaten Iowa three times in the past few games ‑‑ what's the secret
to that?   
COACH YORI: Well, there's no secret. We respect Iowa. We know they are a
really good basketball team, got good players, well coached. You know, we have
played a lot of close games with them. The last two have not been as close.  
You know, I don't know if there's any one thing I can identify other than, you
know, we just know we have to play well. But you have to do that really
throughout the suspect. It's fairly unusual to beat a team six times in a row
as good as Iowa. We obviously feel good about that.  
But we won in different ways, too. Sometimes we won with defense and sometimes
we won with offense. So there's been a lot of different things that have
happened in the games.  
  
Q. Hailie and Katie both had a lot of offensive rebounds, and why is that,
what's working so well for you?  
COACH YORI: Go to the glass. If there's a shot, go to the glass. Emily is a
really good offensive rebounder and we knew that today, they don't play
Hailie, they leave Hailie. But one thing you can do, if you get left is that
you can get on the offensive glass and she did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Emily didn't score much but her impact on the game was felt, six assists
and the offensive rebounds, but how big of an impact did she make without even
scoring?  
COACH YORI: That's Emily's game right there. Emily is a really good all‑around
player but doesn't always put up a lot of points. She's a
right‑side‑of‑the‑stat sheet kind of player. She plays good defense and she's
going to get you rebounds on both ends, she's a really tough competitor. She
doesn't get as much notoriety, or as many of the accolades as Williams and
Jordan, but she's equally important.  
  
Q. Three days and three games, how important is it to get your berth players
going and get some energy going that don't normally see time in the game?  
COACH YORI: I thought the way the game played out is obviously advantageous
for tomorrow. Not only did we get some represents for some of our kids, but it
gives some of the kids some confidence being on the floor.  
And it wasn't perfect the last six minutes, but they kind of sold out and
tried to make every play. But I thought Tear'a and Brandi getting eight points
apiece and Hailie getting eight, that's big for us.  
  
Q. Non ‑game question, your second year in the Big Ten now, if you can
comment on the rise of the RPI and the Big Ten's power as a conference?  
COACH YORI: I think first of all, you've got institutions that have made a
commitment to women's basketball, and across the board, they have hired good
coaches. I think that's kind of where it starts. You know, good coaches are
not only going to coach well but they are going to recruit well, and it's
improved.  
Again, I wasn't in the league three years ago, but we have some new blood in
this league and we also have a lot of veterans, and it looks like right now
there's a lot of stability of coaches across the board. So that means that
we're going to continue to get better because of that.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Penn State  76  
Ohio State - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. It's 39 ‑39, probably four minutes into the second half, and then just
everything started going away. What happened in that 10‑0 run that allowed
them to get away from you?   
TAYLER HILL: I think we just had some missed assignments on defense. And then
offensively, we weren't really moving the ball, make quick shots.  
AMBER STOKES: I say we lost focus.  
  
Q. Did they change anything they were doing in the second half from what
you'd seen in the first half?  
AMBER STOKES: No, I don't think they changed. We just got out hustled on a
couple of plays. We weren't really doing what we were doing in the first half
for a couple of segments. So...  
  
Q. Tayler, what were you doing that was working against them? You were up at
least five points with the biggest lead in the first half. What was working
early for you?  
TAYLER HILL: Reversing the ball and not taking quick shots.  
  
Q. Amber, was there something there that you were seeing that they were
presenting to you? You were getting aggressive, got a lot of good looks.  
AMBER STOKES: We were moving the ball. My teammates were finding me and I was
able to make the shots. So it was just ball movement that allowed me to get
open.  
  
Q. It's kind of out of your hands right now, but as you look toward the
postseason, Tayler, just what are you thinking right now?  
TAYLER HILL: Like you said, it's out of our hands. We just gotta wait and see.  
AMBER STOKES: We've got to stay positive, that's all. Keep our heads up and
see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When it was 39 ‑39, did you think it was going pretty much your way, and
did that 10‑0 run, that came so fast, but that's them, did that kind of shock
you?  
COACH FOSTER: I just think we had about a three‑minute flip, four‑minute flip
of individual play. People forgot what was getting us great looks and getting
us opportunities was great ball reversal. And at the first sign of, it was a
little bit harder to reverse, we had people just trying to go get their own
shot. We're not that kind of team. We can't be that kind of team.  
When we moved the ball, I mean, obviously 19 assists out of 25 baskets, the
ball was hopping. And what we wanted to do, we were able to get done.  
Our turnovers were bad turnovers and our mistakes were bad mistakes. Fouling
Maggie Lucas on a 3‑point attempt in transition, the fact that she's open, we
had two people back. You have to cover that. That's a mental mistake. The foul
makes it even worse.  
But those things in the framework of a game happen. And you can't let them
bite you. You gotta‑‑ you've gotta come back. And remember what got you there.
Remember good, solid ball movement and getting everybody involved.  
  
Q. They talked about basically they felt like they tuned up their defense a
little bit after the first half and were making it harder for you guys to find
shots. They were hedging screens and they were doing all those things. But did
they play better defense in the second half?  
COACH FOSTER: I think we made poor decisions. They did not do anything
differently in the second half. They hard hedged in the first. That's who they
are. That's what they do. But in the first half, we were patient enough to
take them wide, kick it back to the other side of the floor, and spread them.
That's why Amber had such success scoring and that's why Ashley Adams had such
success scoring, because they got extended defensively.  
In the second half for that blip of time, we didn't spread them. And now
they're in the lane and we're attacking the lane. And without spreading them,
you know, that's when Greene's size and their shot‑blocking ability is going
to become part of the game. That wasn't involved when we reversed the ball,
when we got them extended.  
So it was just more a mental thing. And I can't attribute it to any one thing.
Yeah, we've got a young point guard. But a lot of games, a lot of experiences.
Grow from it.  
  
Q. You talk about you have a young point guard, but they have a senior point
guard. Seemed like she really made a lot of big baskets in the first half.  
COACH FOSTER: Well, Bentley, she's really grown as a player. I think nothing
more obvious than her patience. Like the 3s that she took today, sometimes she
gets a little restless, but she seems to be getting a little more patient and
knows when to strike. Knows when to.  
And I just think that she's gotten savvier, as she's grown. Very instinctive
player as young player, could really push it. Very gifted with the ball. I
think she played much slower tonight and with a lot more composure.  
  
Q. Are there things that Ameryst can learn from watching her then?  
COACH FOSTER: Ameryst is going to be a good player. She's got a good skill
set. And the game we played without Tayler Hill and Amber Stokes, the Purdue
game, Am had 24 points. Am averaged quite a few points in high school. I think
as a freshmen, she has deferred to couple of senior guards out there with her.
I don't think she'll be deferring too much in the next three years. You could
say the same thing about Bentley when she was a freshman.  
  
Q. Your first 10 years here, your first 10 years with this team, you pretty
much knew you were going to be in the NCAA Tournament. And I don't know that
you think ‑‑ I don't know what your thinking is right now with an 18‑13 record
coming in, but what are you thinking right now about that?   
COACH FOSTER: Well, stranger things have happened. I don't know. They always‑‑
if you asked me today, were we one of the best 64 teams in the country right
now, my response would be certainly we are. But there's X number of automatic
bids. And you can look at things in many different ways.  
So I don't expect, but you never know. You never know until people get
together in a room. Some things, sometimes maybe it was just taken for granted
at a certain point in time.  
You gotta grind for these things. Something we talk about all the time, talk
about in November, December, January.  
What I like about this is that this team sort of was in a perfect storm there
for about two, three weeks, and figured out how to get out of it. And it was
very competitive and a good basketball team at the end of the year.  
  
Q. Is it too simplistic to say if you got a lot of the contributions you've
gotten these two games, scoring ‑wise, from Ashley and Raven and Amber helping
out, Tayler, that you wouldn't be in that situation? Were there things that
you guys‑‑  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah, you can always look back and say things like that. I think
Ashley‑‑ I'll give Ashley a lot of credit. Essentially she's been a one‑leg
player for the last couple of months. She can only pivot off of one. And you
could have mailed it in. You could have mailed it in.  
But I'd say her last seven games is the best basketball that Ashley Adams has
played. She was solid. She's double figures, she's rebounded the ball, and you
could depend on her to get numbers.  
And I think a lot of that is her developing a little bit of a tougher veneer
and more of an understanding.  
  
Q. So you go home tomorrow. Would you take a couple days off and then just
come ‑‑  
COACH FOSTER: We'll probably get back in the gym Wednesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue: 74  
Wisconsin: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Wisconsin joining us. Coach Kelsey, Tessa Cichy, Tiera
Stephen and Jacki Gulczynski. Coach, opening thoughts?  
COACH KELSEY: I'm proud of my team, they played hard, we had some adversity on
us the whole year. But I thought the kids stepped up and answered the call
when they were called to play a lot of minutes. I know Tessa did and certainly
others that were playing the whole year persevered; I know Tiera was tired at
the end but they left it all on the court, and they can be proud of that.  
I told them don't cry, get mad. Come back better than you left and that will
say how much you care and how much you want to be better, and I'm sure they
will do that. We're proud of 'em.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Can you talk about how tired you were after playing forty minutes last
night?  
TESSA CICHY: Yes, we all played forty minutes. I got winded there at the end,
got a little banged up, and I came out for a few minutes but tried to fight
through it.  
  
Q. Jacki with Cassie out how was the post play for you?  
JACKI GULCZYNSKI: I thought our guards did a great job of stepping up and
having to guard Drey and all the big post players, and I thought we did a
great job of helping and limit their post play.  
  
Q. Tessa, you started the last two games at the Big 10 Tournament. Can you
talk about what it felt like to start, and the career high points and
rebounds, how you did that?  
TESSA CICHY: We were shorthanded, like Coach Bobbie said, and I thought I
needed to step up for Tiera and my teammates. Obviously this was our last game
so I thought that was important.  
With the points and rebounds, I just did what I felt I needed to do, so I
didn't even realize I had that many. I just kind of did what I tried to do all
the time, worked hard and tried to get others open and if that gets me open, I
guess I'm lucky.  
  
Q. Ladies, for any of you, you had such a nice showing in the tournament,
what will you take away from this Big 10 Tournament?  
TIERA STEPHEN: Um, at the end of the day ‑‑ I don't even know ‑‑ I got nine
teammates, I'm not sure, but one thing I will take away from this year, me
being the senior, I'm the only one leaving, I'm proud of every single one of
'em, from the best, from Morgan to whoever didn't see the floor, the bench was
more excited than we were on the court, and that's one thing, at the end of
the day, I'm not sure if any team in the Big 10 can overlook us.  
They know we are going to fight. We lost to Nebraska by 2, Northwestern by 2,
we're in every game, and maybe except for the first Penn State game, and we
came back and beat them. So at the end of the day one thing I will take away
is the heart and the fight my teammates have.  
  
Q. Tiera, can you talk about playing in the game, especially walking off the
court with a minute and a half left?  
TIERA STEPHEN: It hasn't hit me yet, so I'm not sure how to answer that
question but at the end of the day I'm blessed to have the opportunity to play
for Wisconsin. It's been a long five years, I wouldn't trade my teammates or
my coaches, I wouldn't trade this opportunity for nothing, it's a blessing,
so, yes, I'm upset and sad in the career but like I said I'm blessed.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Kelsey?  
  
Q. Bobbie, could you tell with the players that they were running out of
steam there late in the second half?  
COACH KELSEY: When you have big bodies on the other side, it's hard when you
don't, with Cassie in there, some of the fouls that were called on her were
questionable, to say the least. That's all I can say about that.  
She was out of the game and she felt bad about it, and a lot of pressure on
Tiera and Tessa. Some players you can play around but no one can play the
point like Tiera Stephen, and we don't have another 6‑4 Cassie sitting over
there, so those two are really not expendable, so to speak. No one is, but you
can fill in and help where you can, but Cassie is a big part of what we do and
the tone was set from the jump ball and that's unfortunate that she had to
experience that.  
But, again, she will use this as a motivation for her to come back and maybe
average a double/double, she is capable of that, and she will have players
around her that can help her, and take some of the pressure off.  
  
Q. What about Tessa starting these last two games, is she going to fit in
there?  
COACH KELSEY: Tessa is a gamer, whether she starts, plays, or doesn't, you
don't know. Some kids you can see in their faces but her and Morgan, you
wouldn't know if they were having a good day or bad day, they have those
personalities and Tessa is a "gamer". She is a tough, tough cookie. She will
guard anybody. She just thinks she can, sometimes like that little train if
you think you can, you can; you will make it up the mountain. Tessa, we have
had to put her on Hooper, and Nebraska and these girls are 6 and 7 inches
taller than this girl, but she will put her body in there, hustle and make
plays and she is a coach's dream because she has a great attitude, she doesn't
get down on herself, because she is a confident young lady, just very
confident.  
  
Q. Can you talk about a very difficult season with only nine players since
mid ‑December, how that's kinda worn on the team but also finally talking
about next year, the players you will have back and also adding.   
COACH KELSEY: This year was tough, and without the bodies you have to work
with what you have. All year I have had to fool myself, too, into
understanding that you can't worry about what you don't have you have to focus
on what you do have. We did that and we tried to help the players do that,
because the players can get down when they see people getting hurt, they're
like, oh, no, what are we going to do? We are going to play our game. We are
going to go out there and fight, and we are going to make adjustments as
coaches, we will help you do what we need you to do, and you will be just
fine, and you can see it manifested itself throughout this whole season,
really, being without Taylor, and AnnMarie goes down, Michala Johnson, she is
a transfer and can't play, and Nicole getting mono, but a lot of people have
injuries. You can't get down, you have to pick yourself up and keep moving.  
Just those players I mentioned are coming back down, next year, Taylor,
Michala and AnnMarie along with the freshman coming in. We're going to have
some big bodies next year, bang people around and not get banged all the time.  
I'm looking for big things from these returners. You never know what freshmen
are going to do; they're hit or miss. But I told them in the locker room, come
back better than you left here, if you don't come back better that's telling
me you don't love it enough. If you do, that tells me you love the game and
you're going to come back better. Tiera did that, she came back aggressive. We
need her to do that. I said, you can't "like" basketball, you got to "love"
it. If you don't love it you're never going to get good at it.  
  
Q. Bobbie, the Big 10, what's it like to play in day in and day out, and
then the national picture?  
COACH KELSEY: Big 10 is tough to play in, everybody is pretty skilled. You
play a "tight" team every night, which helps us tremendously, because our
league, it's about seven teams last year and I know we will probably get six
or seven in this year, and that's a testament to the play, to the
competitiveness of the league.  
On a national level I think we're up there with the other BCS conferences.
I've been in a lot of these leagues, all but probably the Big 12; ACC, SEC,
Pac 12 and now the Big 10, and every conference is different, but in a good
way, different, and when these teams meet up, it's a battle. And I want Purdue
and all the other teams in the NCAA to do well, because it's going to help our
conference, considering all the realignment that's going on and all the
shuffling that's going to go on. They are capable to represent the Big 10 and
do well, and we need 'em to get past that first round. That will be very, very
helpful, so no pressure, Purdue, Nebraska, Penn State, Michigan, Michigan
State, go out there and get it done and I know they will.  
  
Q. Coach, what about your free ‑throw shooting? I think it was a tournament
record.   
COACH KELSEY: I hope so. That would be nice.  
  
Q. You had tired kids going to the line, hitting free ‑throw after
free‑throw.   
COACH KELSEY: Yeah, again, that goes to their‑‑ that's a credit to the kids,
we work on pressure free‑throws, we will do some one and ones, so if you miss
the first you got to run, you will make it because you don't want to run.
Running is a good deterrent for a lot of things and some teams aren't good
free‑throw shooting teams this team is.  
For whatever reason they don't get nervous, at least that's what I see.
Yesterday you saw that, Morgan made 10 but we made 21 so some other folks hit
free‑throws and as Tessa said, if you don't hit the two before Morgan gets to
the line you don't win that game, and she has never been in that situation,
but the girl is confident, Morgan is confident, Cassie thinks she can make 'em
and Tiera steps up there and makes em.  
You have to make your free‑throws when it comes down to the wire, otherwise
you're goin' home and somebody else is movin' on. They don't think about being
tired, they just walk up there and make 'em.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, appreciate it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Melissa Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24378)

### [Theairra Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24379)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

NEBRASKA  76  
IOWA - 61

  
COACH BLUDER: Congratulate Nebraska on a very strongly, good‑played, well
played game. They are playing very well, and we wish them the best in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Theairra, what were they doing out there defensively today?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: They were dragging off me the whole game, clogged me up the
middle. So pretty much that's what we were supposed to do, because we couldn't
get inside because the shooters left me open.  
  
Q. If either of you could talk about the impact that Jordan had, she's
pretty much everywhere.  
MELISSA DIXON: Jordan Hooper is a great player. She got started by getting a
lot of rebounds and I thought she started getting her points, so we had a
tough time stopping her today.  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Yeah, she's a great player. She's coming off a lot of screens
and we were just a second too late and she could get her shot off really
quick.  
  
Q. Talk about their rebounding, I know Coach was telling you to box out,
what were they doing or able to get some of the contact on you guys?  
MELISSA DIXON: We struggled with making contact right away, so they were not
making over‑the‑back calls. So I thought we struggled with making contact on
the box out.  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Our box‑outs were just non‑existence effort wasn't there. And
Coach told us throughout the game, box out, box out, but we never made a
change.  
  
Q. Talk about the rebounding differential and how it hurt you early.  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, I thought that was the thing that really got Jordan Hooper
going. I thought the beginning of the game, that's what got her started
offensively was going to the glass and getting the easy put‑backs, and then
you get your confidence at that point.  
So we are disappointed in our rebounding. They got 18 points, second chance
points, that's a whole bunch and a lot of high-percentage shots, and those are
paints shots. The paint points we gave up today were atrocious. You can't give
up 38 paint points. That's too high a percentage of shots.  
  
Q. Seemed like their strategy was clog up the middle and get Morgan
involved.  
COACH BLUDER: Morgan is coming off a good game yesterday and Nebraska does a
good job of help side defense. When Morgan did get the ball, she usually had
about three people around her. You know, you need other people to pick it up,
because if they take one thing away, they are giving another thing, another
opportunity to you, and we didn't take advantage of the other opportunities.  
  
Q. They say sometimes familiarity breeds contempt: Three games in a month
against Nebraska, seems like it was very intense, a little chippy maybe at the
end, is that just the result of so many match ‑ups in such a short span of
time against that team?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, and I think it's also the way the officials called it.
They didn't call much early. When you don't call much early, games get
physical.  
  
Q. Early on, maybe a couple minutes left in the first half, it was a really
tight game and everything just kind of went downhill from there. I guess what
did Nebraska change to have so much success there the last couple of minutes
the first half and beyond?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, I'm having a hard time remembering now what they changed
differently. I thought, you know, again, the offensive rebounds is what really
got them going in my opinion. But that was earlier than that point. I can't
remember every call to tell you what they did differently at that point.  
  
Q. You didn't shoot a free throw until late in the game. Was that
frustrating, it looked like at times that the players were getting frustrated
and they were not getting the calls.  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, and I think we were getting frustrated. We got frustrated
with the officials and it affected our game. It's too bad, because we all
know, you can't crow the officials. You can't control the uncontrollable.  
But yeah, you go to the locker room and you see Nebraska with two fouls in the
whole 20 minutes. I mean, nobody is that clean; nobody is that clean in
warmups. You can't be that clean in a game, there's no way.  
  
Q. Logic had played every minute of this tournament up until her injury, is
she all right and what can you say about the way she's played over the two
days?  
COACH BLUDER: She battled hard. You know, she probably battled a little too
hard today, and it made a few mistakes. Didn't shoot the ball as well as she's
capable of.  
But again, it's not lack of will or lack of effort by any means. But she'll be
fine. I mean, you know, she's cut, she's bleeding but she will be fine, and we
have a couple weeks left.  
  
Q. With 20 wins, did you do enough in your mind to be in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH BLUDER: Absolutely. We have 20 wins; we have a 30 RPI, we have a
strength of schedule of 20. In my opinion‑‑ we are not even a bubble team in
my opinion.  
  
Q. I guess Sam started out the game really hot, had six points really early
and was 3 ‑for‑4 and then went 0‑for‑9 the rest of the game. Was there
anything that changed defensively that locked her down or shots were not
falling?  
COACH BLUDER: Nebraska is a good defensive team. Obviously she got their
attention early and drew their attention defensively, but I do think that she
made some tougher shots early, and sometimes when you make tough shots, you
kind of think, okay, I'm going to keep shooting the ball.  
Sometimes that's not a good thing. She made some tough shots early and then,
yeah, struggled after that offensively for us.  
  
Q. Do you think Sam at times ever think she has to become more of a scorer
to become maybe recognized in the league, in addition to all of the other
things she does?  
COACH BLUDER: I've asked her to become more of a scorer, so it's not Sam's
fault, at all. I've asked her to become more offensive‑minded and it's not to
be recognized in this league. It's to make our team win.  
I think we are better when we are balanced in scoring, and I think often times
Sam looks for the assist more than the score. And I praise assists, I love
assists, but I also want‑‑ you know, if she has a good shot, I want her to
take it.  
  
Q. You guys did really well early on defensively, you were getting contested
shots and they would miss it and get the offensive rebound, and as the game
wore on they started to get a lot more wide ‑open looks, what was happening
there? Was it just frustration mounting up, fatigue or what was going on
there?   
COACH BLUDER: I imagine it was a little bit of frustration. I felt like our
zone movements weren't very good. Especially to begin the second half, and
that was unfortunate.  
I think they got open, very good open looks in the second half, and you know,
we need to be aware of shooters and we need to be where Hooper is and be aware
of when to pass and close out with hands up.  
  
Q. And then right before halftime, how much of a change was it for the
team's dynamic going into the locker room after that 3 with like five seconds
to go?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, that was a momentum‑‑ definitely momentum for them. We
were suddenly down ten. It sounds a lot worse and it looks a lot worse.
Definitely having the momentum going into the locker room at halftime is an
asset for a team.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Penn State  76  
Ohio State - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Penn State group. We've got Head Coach
Coquese Washington. We're joined by Alex Bentley and Maggie Lucas and Nikki
Greene. We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, talk about those two 3s you made and the momentum it provided
your team.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: Alex set those up. First time down, she caught our little set up
play and found me the next time down. I was just able to knock them down, but
that was just her being aware on the court.  
  
Q. Alex, did anything change for you guys in the second half as you guys
kind of got on that hot streak shooting?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think our defense definitely changed. When we went into the
locker room, you know, Coach, she was telling us that if we wanted to win we
had to step on the gas defensively. So we had to get out in the passing lanes.
We just had to turn our energy up.  
And my teammates responded really well. And that's how we started going in
transition.  
  
Q. Nikki, what changed for your offensively in the second half?  
NIKKI GREENE: I think I was more patient. Just reading the defense and
whatever they gave me, I just kind of did what I needed to do.  
  
Q. What does it mean to the women to make it to the semifinals?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: It means a lot. We were focused on one game at a time. We were
glad to get this first win. Ohio State was playing well coming into this. They
played well tonight. We were just glad to get the W.  
NIKKI GREENE: Like Maggie said, we were taking each game one game at a time,
and so this game helped us advance to the second round.  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think my teammates just said it all.  
  
Q. Maggie, you were the Big Ten player of the year, but what's it like to
have a senior point guard like Alex to; play off and to basically when they
were playing ‑‑ well, I think she came in twice after a short rest and just
immediately seemed to tune up her offense, which I think got you guys going?
Didn't she get you guys going when she came off the bench. She sat down early
in the first half and early in the second half, she came out in and
immediately was in attack mode?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: Alex is an unbelievable player. She can pretty much do it all,
and it is a pleasure to play with her. And it's just awesome. She can do it
all.  
  
Q. Alex, your coach sat you down pretty early in the first half for just a
little bit and then again in the second half. Was that just to see what's
going on, or to give you an idea what you might be able to attack, or is it
just basically she wants to talk for a second and you come in more
aggressively?  
ALEX BENTLEY: It can be many things. She might have something she needs to
tell me. She might want to rest me a little bit. Coach has a lot going on in
that head of hers, so I just trust what she tells me to do and I just keep
playing and listen to her.  
  
Q. Alex, what did it do for your offensively after you see Maggie go hit two
3s back to back? Only had one opportunity, especially from the offensive
standpoint, what does that do for momentum?  
ALEX BENTLEY: It's huge. Every time Maggie hits a 3, our energy offensively
and defensively, I mean, the team, it just changes the game. It's very
exciting. I'm sure it's exciting to watch because we get excited playing with
her. And she's just that dagger. When a player is that hot, hitting 3s, just
hitting you with those throughout games, it's hard to bounce back, and she's a
great shooter.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked Alex what changed for you in the second half when you guys
got on that run?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought one of the things that we did a better job the
second half‑‑ well, two things. We kept the ball out of the paint better, and
we contested shots better.  
And those two things allowed us to get going in transition. But we just‑‑ as
Alex alluded to, we had to be a little bit more attentive defensively. In the
first half, they just got the ball inside too much and we made a few
adjustments and kind of limited that the second half. We did better at it the
second half than we did the first half.  
  
Q. After those two 3s that Maggie hit in the second half, seems like your
offense got a jump ‑start. What does it mean, first of all, to have Maggie
being able to do that from outside, and how did that change your offense in
the second half?  
COACH WASHINGTON: They're momentum type plays. When you come down in
transition, and you stop hit a big 3 or four‑point play, a potential
four‑point play, get fouled on a 3‑point shot, it's a momentum builder.  
Our team got excited, and that helped give us a little more energy on the
defensive end. So it was a combination of things.  
It got us going defensively as much as it affected us offensively.  
  
Q. And you talked about your defense. Talk about the job that Ariel and Dara
did against their best scorers tonight, the way they really made her force
shots sometimes.  
COACH WASHINGTON: The thing about Tayler Hill, she's so good, a dynamic
offensive player, and gotta be aware where she is all the time. She got loose
a couple times, especially late in the game. She got to the free‑throw line a
couple times. But we just wanted to make her take tough shots. And I thought
Ariel and Dara did a fairly good job of just trying to make her take tough
shots.  
  
Q. Obviously Nikki and Mia had big second halves from the inside. How did
that open up, and does it maybe stem from your outside shooting from Maggie
and Alex?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought they did a good job early in the game of being
attentive to our perimeter game. And I think Nikki hit it on the head. She was
a little bit more patient. She worked a little harder to get the ball.  
I think our guards were a little bit more attentive in getting her the ball
where she could be effective. And you know, we wanted to‑‑ especially the
second half, we wanted to make Ashley Adams work on defense.  
She kind of got loose in the first half offensively. So we wanted to make her
work defensively, and see if we could slow her down that way until we got the
ball to Nikki and she did a good job finishing tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  62  
Michigan - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could start with an opening statement.  
COACH MERCHANT: I think, there's a lot of relief. When you have to, one, you
have to play someone three times, but then that third for us is our in‑state
rival, the tension is obviously high. I'm sure high on their bench, high on
our bench.  
So coming into that game, there's certainly just added pressure that
potentially the other teams wouldn't have felt. I mean, certainly they want to
win games and they want to perform well. I didn't see too many in‑state rivals
the way Michigan and Michigan State is. So it made a for a unique and
interesting opening to the Big Ten Women's Tournament for the Spartans.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Klarissa, obviously one of your better games in a while. You talk about
your feelings regarding Michigan a lot. Was it just playing Michigan? Was it
the post season? What was it that sparked you tonight?  
KLARISSA BELL: I would say I was really focused coming into this game. Our
team's really energetic. Even leaving the hotel, we just had like a lot of
energy. I think that kind of helped. And we're playing against our rival
school, so that definitely helps as well.  
  
Q. Klarissa, anything specifically defensive ‑wise you did differently this
time?  
KLARISSA BELL: The last time against Michigan, I just had a lot of redemption,
let's say that. Definitely just wanted to beat up Kate Thompson the way I knew
that I could. I just didn't do it as well as I could the last time, so this
time I definitely wanted to do that. I think that showed.  
  
Q. Klarissa or Jasmine, there's a stretch they pulled within 2 there early
in the second half. And you guys mount a 14 ‑1 run to hold them without a
field goal for nearly ten minutes. What was key for you guys then?  
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, just getting back to what we were doing to get us to
that point before they cut it down, you know, whether that was going‑‑ we went
possessions without scoring and fouled a couple of times on the defensive end
to kind of get them back in it.  
I don't know, just getting back to better offensive execution and defensive
rebounding.  
  
Q. Jasmine, could you talk about your defensive efforts this time and how it
compared to last time?  
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, it's kind of similar to Klarissa. You kind of just
felt that let‑down the last game so you wanted to go back out there and kind
of prove yourself a little bit.  
  
Q. Jasmine, how does it feel to know you won't end your career with a loss
against Michigan?  
JASMINE THOMAS: Oh, I'm more than happy. I mean, I thought it was the end when
we lost to them by that one point, but to get them again, it was a good
feeling.  
  
Q. Klarissa, offensively you kind of lit it up tonight. Were you more
aggressive looking for the shots this time?  
KLARISSA BELL: Yes, I would say I was more aggressive. And I just wasn't
really thinking on offense, just catching the ball and shooting it or driving
to the rim. Trying to avoid Jenny Ryan down there, trying to take a charge,
because she's infamous for her charges.  
So just trying to attack when I could, and my teammates hit me when I was
open. So I appreciate that. And I just knocked down the shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Klarissa's performance and how pleased were
you on both ends of the floor? Obviously the 20 points, and then I don't
believe Kate Thompson hit a 3 ‑pointer. I think she hit the one at the end,
maybe one at the end.   
COACH MERCHANT: Well, that was‑‑ she's very, very difficult to guard, and I
think you watch a lot of film and how people play her, there's a lot of
different ways you can do it.  
And I've always just believed that if you have someone that can chase the tail
and be as quick and get there on the catch, that's your best bet, because when
you start getting into switches, then they slip. They're really good at
slipping and cutting to the rim. We had a couple of situations, I think you
saw that tonight, where maybe we weren't as defined just worrying about her.
And I think they play off of that.  
So the longer that Klarissa could evade screens and chase the tail, and where
the tail goes there's no screen. That's simple as can be. So that was really
our focus tonight. I thought she did a nice job at that.  
A little bit different than the last time we played them. I thought she was
late to the party, stepped slow. She'd be three or four feet behind the kid
coming underneath on their baseline, sloppy screens coming that way. You get
six inches behind that kid, and she can really do some damage.  
So I was very pleased with her tenacity. It's not an easy thing to guard
someone that gets flared, double stagged, screened, rescreened for 40 straight
minutes.  
And actually I think it's really impressive to watch her compete for, what, 31
games basically, and as an offensive player, always knowing you have to cut,
move, flare, screen, rescreen. There's a lot on you to make something happen
and you don't even have the ball in your hands yet.  
So it's tough. And I'm just glad we have to guard it a couple times a year.  
  
Q. How about that stretch when Jasmine Hines came in and how important was
that?  
COACH MERCHANT: It was. She really needed a confidence boost, too. She can do
some things for us. I think sometimes she gets in her own way as players go
through those stages and seasons where they overthink or overtry instead of
just having the confidence in your ability to get things done.  
So I was pleased with her. I think we had been watching some film with her, I
know coach Marcus spent some time with her and went back and showed her the
successful things she'd done prior instead of just, hey, here you didn't pin
and seal; and here, you should have made this shot here; here they didn't
follow you, here they fronted you.  
All the things you try to teach them to get better, sometimes it's good just
to go back and show them the good things they did.  
And I think that gave her some pep in her step and got a little bit of her
confidence back. I noticed that tonight she stepped up to the free‑throw line
as well with some confidence, and sometimes that can be a little bit of a
demon for her at times.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off that. You said Sunday, kind of your inside play would be
an area of concern, and one area you wanted to improve. Just talk about Becca
as well, too. And the second part, too, what's the status of Akyah?  
COACH MERCHANT: It was great to see. Those are two very different five men,
and most of Becca's stuff comes from face‑up and outside shots and Jasmine
Hines, as you know, is mostly power.  
But to see those kids come out and go 8 for 12 combined was really something
positive. Prior to most of the season, together they were 20 points and ten
rebounds. Depending on how much each played, you could count on those two kids
combined to get you about 20 points and about ten rebounds. And they weren't
far from it tonight. It's a really nice combination and a unique one.  
I don't know about Akyah. They took her to the hospital. She got rocked pretty
good in the eye, and it sounded like she needed to go to the hospital. I
didn't see her come off the floor. So I couldn't comment on, I didn't even
know it was her eye. I thought she might have had a concussion and got knocked
out. But sounded like Jasmine came down on her eye.  
  
Q. How important within the scheme ‑‑ the first time you guys played in the
second half, you got the seven over that gave you the lead, 16 point lead. In
this one you had 14‑1 run. How important was it to define that compared to the
middle game in your series?  
COACH MERCHANT: The one thing we were up‑‑ I said to the girls we were up for
in Ann Arbor at halftime, and we came out and we just were a little bit flat.
And they came out a little more inspired and they ran some high post isolation
action that got them a couple easy buckets and one and one, and then the next
thing you know, our four‑point lead, we're down one.  
So we talked about that. And I just said we need to set the tone when we come
out. And we need to keep the foot on the gas a little bit here, because
they're a team that can get it going if you have a let‑up.  
So for us, we really did talk about having strong four‑minute media segments,
take a break. All right, what did we do well, what did we not do well, and
what can we do better. And then challenge them the next four minutes.  
So we tried to keep it smaller type focuses because the one thing I think when
you coach in rival games, it's natural, the first thing out of a Spartans
mouth is, "we have to beat Michigan." And the first thing out of a Wolverine
mouth is, "we have to beat Michigan State," maybe Ohio State, too, I guess on
their side.  
But you think everything in outcomes, and you forget about you gotta play the
moment. It doesn't matter the outcome. Don't worry about winning or losing at
that time. Let's, for us, let's worry about the possession we're in
offensively or defensively.  
So the mindset that we had going into it, that's what I kept talking to them
about. It's really to make those runs happen, to do a better job this time
than we did last time, we had to keep the outcome out of our minds and let's
just worry about the possession we're in.  
Sounds simple, but I think in rival situations, everyone I talked to, every
text I got was, "beat the Wolverines," which is great. But I'm sure every
player got that, too.  
We just want to have a really good offensive possession and then a really good
defensive possession and another good offensive.  
You can get away from yourself, and I think you can put the cart before the
horse sometimes if you think in that mindset.  
  
Q. From an offensive standpoint, was this sort of the game you were hoping
for from Klarissa for a while? You talked about it all year about her being
aggressive and not being aggressive. Sort of on that same note, how nice was
it to have a game like that in the first game of the post season from her?  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought it was really nice. I thought sometimes Klarissa,
she can get in her own way sometimes. She has so much talent, but then she can
overthink sometimes.  
And I think coming into this game, knowing that the most important gift she
could give our team was a defensive side of the ball, and that's where she
really wanted a redemption.  
I thought first time we played them, Kate Thompson had 11 points in the first
seven minutes of the game. And she was just kind of rattled from that,
although she did play well offensively for us down there.  
So to be able to put a little more focus on the defensive side of the ball and
then just keep that aggressiveness, carrying it over on to the offensive side
was something that we need to see from her.  
I just think sometimes she can doubt herself a little bit, and there's no
reason for that. She can shoot 3s. She can take it off the bounce. She can get
to the rim. She's a good passer. She's a great defender, a good rebounder. She
can post up a little bit. There's not a whole lot she can't do.  
So sometimes it's good to see her just let loose a little bit and have some
fun out there. And that's what I saw in her. She was just as aggressive as
I've seen her this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Nya Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24871)

### [Rachel Sheffer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23220)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  62  
Michigan - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Kim Barnes Arico and student‑athletes Nya
Jordan and Rachel Sheffer.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought Michigan State played better than we did
tonight. They were deserving to win the game. They were able to score and
really limited our scoring opportunities.  
So I thought they were better than us tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rachel, what did you see different in them tonight than last time?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: I think they just attacked us defensively. We really couldn't
come together defensively, and we couldn't carry over with defensive stops to
our offense and nothing really was going for us tonight.  
  
Q. In the second half, similar to the first game this year, second half a
big run by them, or at least in some part of the second half. What really made
that happen? You played in East Lansing, they opened up with a 7 ‑0 run, start
the second half to expand their lead to 16. In this game, take that 14‑0 run,
push to all the way it to a 17‑point lead. What do you think caused that?   
NYA JORDAN: They scored a lot of transition points. We had a hard time
locating in transition, and I think that's what started it off.  
Also, like Rachel said, we struggled on defense and they were able to score.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously when you took the job, you knew of ‑‑ early on you found out
about the history with Michigan State, at least in recent years. After this
season, do you feel like this is going to be a very‑‑ a much more heated
rivalry as far as on the court from here on out, as far as you see it?   
COACH BARNES ARICO: I hope so. I've always heard about Michigan State, and
I've watched them play for years and years, because traditionally they've had
great teams. So they've always been known as a really good and established
program.  
And obviously, when I came to Michigan, I knew that would be our in‑state
rival and a big rivalry for our kids as well as our universities.  
They have a great program, a program that we aspire to be. This year, our
seniors were able to come away with a victory at home. We played really well
against them. And hopefully, my goal is obviously to get our program to be a
national contender year in, year out. So that would be on the level of a
Michigan State program.  
  
Q. How do you feel about your team right now, 21 wins, looking for the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: If you asked me 24 hours ago, I thought we played
exceptionally well. And if you ask me today, I thought we struggled a little
bit. I think most teams this point of the year, a lot depends on who you play
and when you play them.  
And obviously, Michigan State did a great job against us today, but I feel
like we've got a really good team and we've had a pretty good year. And we
could do a good job in the NCAA Tournament. We could catch somebody off guard
and we got a lot of different weapons, and when we were playing well, I think
we could beat a lot of good people.  
Michigan State had a third shot at us, and they were fired up about it. So it
was a tough matchup for us, and I thought they played pretty well tonight.  
  
Q. Did you think your offensive struggles compared to your defensive
struggles in the second half, too?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I mean, you tell a kid don't worry about what
happening on offense, just get stops on defense, and you hope that they buy
into that.  
But I think when you can't score, you can't score, you can't score, it's like
you watch football teams play, if their defense is out there the whole time,
you really feel like they have no shot. I felt like our defense got worn down,
especially when we couldn't score, for sure.  
  
Q. You mentioned this is your third time playing in the state, how do you
feel about going into a tournament where you'll probably be playing someone ‑‑
or someone's going to be looking at you for the first time?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I'm excited about that, actually. I think State,
obviously, did a tremendous job on Kate, as have most of the teams in our
league. I think they've done a great job on Jenny, too, who had an
unbelievable game against them last time.  
So for me, from a coaching standpoint, it's exciting when you get to play some
new competition and people who haven't seen your kids play and really only
watch it on film. And sometimes film doesn't really do you justice.  
So I'm excited about the opportunity to play new people in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. What can you say about Bell's defense on Thompson? Seemed like for the
longest, she might not get a 3 ‑pointer there, which is obviously
uncharacteristic?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought Bell's offense was unbelievable tonight. And her
defense was great, too. But she came out of the gates and hurt us offensively.
I think she might have had their first ten points. So we expected her to do a
great job defensively. She did a really good job defensively against Kate the
last couple of times, but I thought she really stepped up her game on the
offense tonight as well. She's a good player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  58  
Illinois - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Coach Bobbie Kelsey and Jacki Gulczynski and Morgan
Paige and Cassie Rochel. Coach, a brief opening statement and we'll take
questions for the players.  
COACH KELSEY: We won. Questions? No, seriously, we worked really hard in
preparation for‑‑ once we figured out, knew who we were going to play, we kind
of‑‑ it was like, oh, gosh, because we know they press and they trap and
they're very good at it and they caused the most turnovers in the league.  
But our kids, we just had to help them believe that it was more us not taking
anything away from Illinois, because they do cause you to turn it over but you
have to make a good passing decision once the opening is there.  
And you saw then we kind of hesitate, because it looks open and they make it
look open, and then they rip the passing lane. But we got some breaks there
and some nice plays. But we also turned it over. So we gotta watch that. But
we won the game and that was excellent.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you just talk about what was going through your mind before
and when you hit those free throws?  
MORGAN PAIGE: Like I was saying earlier, Tessa picked me off the ground and
she said: Hey, we need one to tie and two to win and you can do it.  
And I know that I'm one of the better free‑throw shooters on the team and I
had to relax and pretend like nobody else was out there. After I hit the first
one I felt it a little less. And then the second one went down and I'm like,
pick up don't foul, don't foul. That was the mind process.  
  
Q. Jacki, it seemed like in the second half, you guys picked up your
rebounding, especially you. Was that a focal point at halftime to start
crashing the boards a little better?  
JACKI GULCZYNSKI: Yeah, I think so. Illinois is a great rebounding team. We
know they get to the boards constantly. So it was a constant struggle to try
and put a body on them.  
Once we got determined and won the rebounding battle in the second half, it
really picked up our energy and resulted in those big free throws.  
  
Q. Cassie, the first three years you talked about being more aggressive. Do
you think you got there?  
CASSIE ROCHEL: I think I'm slowly getting there. I think I could still be a
little more aggressive. But lately, I've been focusing on my defense and
trying to be‑‑ defensive pressure tonight Penn was more my focus. I don't put
so much pressure on myself to score as much and it just kinda comes naturally.  
  
Q. Cassie, I don't think Penn has been held in single digits much this year.
I know she was in foul trouble, but what were you doing that was so
effective?  
CASSIE ROCHEL: I'll have to give all my credit to this girl right here. She
came in, helped me with a double. Luckily she was on somebody that she could
leave and be there whenever we needed to help her, Penn and GodBold. So we
really looked to Jacki to come and close up that double, so wasn't able to get
any easy looks. As long as we were boxing her out, she didn't get any easy
putbacks, and that was really what did it tonight.  
  
Q. Jacki, as an 11 seed. This is a big deal for you to win this first game.
And you're probably still thinking about this. But real quick, you gotta start
thinking about Purdue. A couple thoughts about Purdue.  
JACKI GULCZYNSKI: I think we're really excited to play Purdue. It was a great
game. We played them at the Kohl Center, and we're going to do our best to
prepare and get ready for the next one.  
  
Q. How tired are your legs?  
MORGAN PAIGE: We've been working on conditioning since probably September. So
it's more of a mental thing now. I don't even know if you feel it. It might
hit us later. Don't ask me like now; ask me in three hours.  
But for the most part, when the game goes, you're ready to play and you don't
really think about it. You use every media timeout as a, okay, let's get back
together, refocus.  
But I mean for me I don't feel it very much. So I don't know about you guys.  
CASSIE ROCHEL: I would say like Morgan said, when you're out there and you're
trying to focus on other things like defense and offense in the game, you
don't really feel like your body telling you that it's tired. Your adrenaline
is going, and I think we're all in pretty good shape right now and we're able
to push through and play 40 minutes if we have to.  
JACKI GULCZYNSKI: I think we're used to it by now. Especially the three of us
have been playing a lot of minutes this entire Big Ten season, the entire
season. So I think our bodies are used to it.  
And we're excited to play another day. I don't think we're worried about our
bodies. We're just happy to be playing one more game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you found that Bauman was not going to be
available today, what was the mentality? What was the thinking among the
players and their reaction, too?  
CASSIE ROCHEL: I have confidence in all of our bench players. Anyone who comes
off the bench, I have more than enough confidence in them.  
So when we found out about Nicole's sickness, we looked to Tessa. And I think
she did a tremendous job tonight on stepping up for Nicole.  
I know Nicole felt really bad, but that's what they're there for. Tessa
stepped up huge in this game. So you have confidence in your bench players.  
MORGAN PAIGE: I mean, obviously it's sad when you have somebody who‑‑ we've
been working so hard for this, and it's the postseason and it's your first
postseason as a freshman and you have to go through some adversity with
illness.  
It's sad to think she wouldn't be here sharing this with us. But in reality,
in mindset, we won this one for her. This one's for Nicole.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Are you going to put Tessa Cichy on scholarship?  
COACH KELSEY: Tessa, she's certainly proven that she deserves it, that's for
sure. But Tessa's a great kid. She's awesome. She doesn't worry about that.  
She came to Wisconsin knowing she did not have one. And she had scholarship
offers to other places, and not small schools, but she's a Badger through and
through. Her whole family went to Wisconsin and she wanted to come.  
And I had a teammate at Stanford that did the same thing. She walked on, but
she had scholarships to other places. But when your heart is somewhere and you
can do it, you don't mind the circumstances.  
So Tessa's awesome. We love her to death. She's been a great addition to our
program.  
  
Q. What was your message that you tried to convey to your team during the
almost pretty furious comeback there at the end?  
COACH KELSEY: I don't know if I had a certain message. We just said keep with
things. Every team makes a run. We make our little runs, some more than
others. Some teams make more runs than others. But we expected that. They're
not going to go away just because you hit some shots. They're going to fight
to the end, just like we're going to fight to the end.  
We just had the breaks go our way this time. But we have been on the other
side of that and we know how that feels.  
But they're a great team. They had a lot of great wins this year, and I know
they're feeling it right now, but I've been on both sides. So I know what that
feels like.  
But I'm happy for my group because we really needed this one, and we deserved
it and the kids kept playing hard throughout all the little tough losses we've
had these last five games. My team deserved it.  
  
Q. Bobbie, I was looking at your bench at the end of the game, and you had
two prospective starters sitting on the bench in street clothes, one home
sick. Could you talk about the character of your team you've been able to go
next man up without a whole lot of drop ‑off?  
COACH KELSEY: I think it's a credit to the assistant coaches. They really‑‑
Alysiah, Stacy and Jayme‑‑ they really helped me help the kids believe that we
have enough. That's my mantra throughout this whole year. Every time somebody
goes down, we have enough, there's enough in the room. If you do what you're
supposed to do, there's enough sitting here to help us win.  
And if I don't believe it, if the assistants don't believe it, they won't
believe it. They follow the adults. They do.  
And even though inside I might be like, oh, Lord, we need some people. Where
are the bodies gonna‑‑ but, again, at the end of the day, those kids are still
hurt. If you waste time worrying about, oh, my God, we don't have this one or
that one, you're going to lose.  
So we just try to help them understand that there's enough. We have enough
people to do what we're supposed to do. We just have to focus on who can play.
That's my focus.  
I asked Katrina Holly: Who is available? That's all I worry about. I can't
worry about Taylor being out or Michi not being able to play because she
transferred, or Nicole being sick. It's unfortunate, but everybody has
injuries. We're not the only team that has injuries. We just had more than
people‑‑ some people had injuries at the beginning and nobody could play.
We've had them drop off as the year has gone on.  
But you just have to focus on who can play and then get them ready. Because if
they're not ready, they don't go out and win this game.  
  
Q. You've had so many close games this year where you might have lost that
one. How does it feel to finally get a win?  
COACH KELSEY: It feels great. It feels great. We almost gave it away. But,
again, when you got kids that's playing a lot of minutes, young ones, you
just‑‑ it's a lot against us, but we don't dwell on it. We just keep playing.
And even though we've lost five in a row up to this game, you've got one more,
you could still win it, and you gotta keep playing.  
  
Q. Is this your biggest win at Wisconsin?  
COACH KELSEY: Probably not. It's probably the Penn State game because they're
ranking.  
But, again, every win is exciting for me. I don't care who it is. A win is a
win. Nobody's asking years later, they're not going to say, well, who did you
beat? They just know your record at that point.  
So but this is a big win for our team because it's one and done. If you don't
win you go home. Penn State, you've got some more games after that game.  
So this one is big in a different way, in a different way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Raven Ferguson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24824)

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  58  
Minnesota - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go straight to questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Actually the last five minutes of the first half, how much did your
defense tune up to get into that game and how much did defense mean for what
you did tonight?  
TAYLER HILL: Defense was a starting point for us. We knew that we had to hard
switch Rachel Banham because any inch we gave her, she's a good enough shooter
to knock that down.  
So defense is where we want to start. We want the pressure, we want to trap
and scramble.  
So I think the last five, four minutes of the first half we started to do a
pretty good job. In the second half, we came out and did an even better job.  
  
Q. Tayler, during the last four minutes of the first half and beginning of
the second half, did you feel any pressure on you, that you had to do
something extra to get your team going?  
TAYLER HILL: No. The ball was moving pretty well. We just had to knock down
open shots. Our coach did a good job making the adjustments of running
different plays to get the floor spread and to get the ball in my hands so I'm
coming off the screen and the floor is a little more spread and the players
are more occupied so they can't just eye in on me.  
So there was no pressure, no. We did a good job of reversing the ball.  
  
Q. Raven, what happened to you early in the second half and how do you feel,
I mean, after the game and about playing tomorrow, too, how do you think
you'll feel?  
RAVEN FERGUSON: When I went down, I knew I was going to come back. I really
wanted to play this game. I really wanted to win this game. So I mean, I felt
like either way my ankle‑‑ I twisted my ankle but it's like, are you going to
come back out? I was like, yeah. So they tied it up, taped it up and changed
my shoes and went back out there. I should be fine.  
  
Q. Raven, I just wanted to know when you were guarding Banham, was everybody
‑‑ was it a team thing? Was everybody, it seemed like there was a lot of
switching going on on her. Is that the way it was designed, everybody is to
switch on her?   
RAVEN FERGUSON: With me playing the 4, all the guards we literally can switch,
all the guards switch everything. We're going to be playing everybody. So I
knew I would play her eventually. And I had to step out and guard her high so
she could shoot.  
So I wasn't doing that a little bit in the first half and we got to adjust it
at halftime.  
  
Q. Tayler, in the game at Ohio State, Micaëlla Riché had a very nice game
against you guys. You said at that time you thought people needed to take it
personally in this game. Actually, can you speak to the job Ashley did
shutting that down?  
TAYLER HILL: Ashley did an excellent job tonight. I think she was wide low.
She did an excellent job. We came and trapped a few times on her, but Ashley,
for the most part, did her part tonight and took it personally and shut her
down tonight.  
I think when they played us at Ohio State, she had more than 20 points,
20‑plus points. Tonight she had six and five turnovers. So credit goes to
Ashley tonight.  
  
Q. This is such a quick turnaround, but basically have you even started to
think about Penn State, and can you tell me what you think about Penn State
going into tomorrow night and how hard that might be for you?  
TAYLER HILL: Yeah. We are going to watch film and break Penn State down. But
we just gotta come out and play our game, really. Penn State is physical, but
there's a lot of teams in the league that are physical. They try to push you
around. And as long as we stay calm and reverse the ball and play our game,
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Raven, they were pretty active and physical defensively this time, too.
How do you think you guys met that physicality?  
RAVEN FERGUSON: Just giving it right back. Just taking the shots and taking‑‑
giving them shots back. I mean, we can play with anybody, I feel like. It's
just a mental thing with us. So I'm not really worried about them being
physical or anything. We can play with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Seemed like a lot of times when you needed something, Raven came up with
a play. A lot of hustle plays, too, keeping balls alive and obviously she can
make shots. How big was that, though?  
COACH FOSTER: I think it was‑‑ you know, you look at the stat sheet, you can
say Raven‑‑ I thought, you look at your point guard gets 10 rebounds.  
Stokes couldn't buy a basket, but it had absolutely no effect on her defense
and her intensity. And that's the kind of focus you need at this time of year.  
  
Q. These last four or five games now, four games, these last four games,
what do you like best about this? Do you like the defense as much as anything,
or do you like the fact that Ashley's engaged? What do you like about these
last four games?  
COACH FOSTER: Winning. I think it's taking care of the ball, ball reversal.
Not a lot of turnovers. And intelligent play on defense. I didn't think we
started the game playing smart, and I thought about 15 minutes into the first
half, we had a timeout and we just went over some things, reminded some of the
things. And I think we then went on a 27‑4 run between that half and the next
half.  
And the reality is we just stayed focused on what our plan was and didn't
deviate from it. And we're disciplined in the framework of that.  
  
Q. Did you figure that Raven was coming right back or did you think it was
worse than it was, because basically she looked like she was shot and about to
be carried out?  
COACH FOSTER: I don't think Raven knows how to act when she's hurt. These guys
watch too many NBA games, and they copy the wrong things. Unfortunately for
us, her favorite player is Kobe Bryant, and he never gets injured.  
  
Q. You like to savor these things, but you do have Penn State tomorrow. And
what stands out about Penn State to you in terms of why they won it the last
couple of years and what's been the biggest challenge?  
COACH FOSTER: They've got the best players. They made an adjustment, they're
not shooting the 3 as much. They're a much more physical basketball team.
They're very physical. And you have to stand up to that. You can't let that
have an effect on you.  
And I think for 20 minutes at our place, it didn't, and for 20 minutes, it
did. But I think that this group, between the years, is a lot better place to
handle that kind of a team and that kind of mentality.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Ameryst Alston and how she's progressed to the point
‑‑  
COACH FOSTER: She's an old‑fashioned player. That's all I can tell you. I
mean, she's going to end up shooting a lot of foul shots in her career. She's
got incredible ball control and strength and body control. And she can change
speeds and tempo.  
But she's got a good instinct of how to play the game. And I think her and
Raven have, the last couple of games, created a couple of baskets just out of
their instinctual play off of each other. And that's a good thing to see
evolve so that ‑‑ it doesn't always have to come out of a set or doesn't
always have to come out of a ball reversal.  
We're to the point we've got a couple of kids that can play a little
basketball.  
They played pickup. It's very obvious that those two kids have played a lot of
pickup, and a lot of today's kids don't. They want to be told what to do.  
  
Q. So is this a good game to have those instincts? It was pretty clear they
were letting them play. You guys were just creating a lot of things out of
whatever was there.  
COACH FOSTER: In my opinion, just all‑‑ we spend an inordinate amount of time
on the defensive end of the floor drilling our kids not to foul. And when you
get in the physical game, the referees have to be really good in order for
that to be the way the game's called.  
We beat a lot of screens. We switch. We've got some pretty quick feet. And
we're not trying to foul kids.  
And sometimes you get in those physical games, and all of a sudden both teams,
there's a lot of fouls called. And a lot of times, that's just not the case
because we spend‑‑ I think we're 13th in the country, fewest fouls committed.  
There's 341 DivisionI schools. That might give you an indication. We finished
first in the country a couple times of fewest fouls committed.  
So when a game is physical like that and it's called both ways like that,
that's not good. That's not good.  
So tonight I thought the officials did a great job of calling what was out
there.  
  
Q. You're not used to playing in the first round. So starting a day earlier
than what you normally would, what kind of effect do you think that's going to
have, or is it going to have any at all?  
COACH FOSTER: I'm not going to get used to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Iowa  60  
Northwestern - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach McKeown, Dannielle Diamant and Kendall
Hackney and Inesha Hale and Kate Popovec. Coach.  
COACH McKEOWN: I asked my four seniors to come up here and have an opportunity
to celebrate, in all honesty, because they took a chance on me and
Northwestern and a new program when they came in. And I'm just really proud of
them.  
They're the winningest class at Northwestern I think since the early'90s. And
came to a program that had averaged two or three wins a year, and they've
averaged 16 or 17 wins a year in their careers.  
It's not about the numbers; it's more about what they've done for the program,
commitment. Their blood is all over Welsh Ryan Arena and the Sears Center too.  
For Kate Popovec, got hurt in the Sunday in the game against Iowa, just
outstanding captain, leadership that she's brought to us.  
For Inesha Hale, who fought all year to overcome injury and had to have
surgery, tried to come back in February, and just really proud of those two.  
For Dannielle and Kendall, you saw tonight. We honored them on Senior Day for
their careers. And just amazing what everybody at the table with me has
accomplished over the last four years.  
So due respect to Iowa, hard‑fought game. Tough game. But we have nothing to
be ashamed of.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Dannielle, can you go through that game and how you thought it went for
you guys?  
DANNIELLE DIAMANT: Like Coach said, it's a really hard‑fought game. I think we
left it all out on the court. And we just couldn't make enough plays to pull
off the win.  
  
Q. Seemed like today Iowa was really establishing themselves on the glass,
not just for the forwards but the guards. Can you go through the process of
how you were really thinking about going stopping ‑‑ Dannielle, you had it
great on the glass, but they seemed to outboard today.   
DANNIELLE DIAMANT: I mean, it's something that we've worked on all year,
really, rebounding and boxing out and stuff. So, I mean, they did a great job
crashing the boards. I mean, Sam Logic, she's the offensive leading rebounder
as a guard, and I think she really proved that tonight.  
  
Q. Dannielle or Kendall, could you talk about preparing for this game. A
team you saw four days ago, especially with Kate being out, how difficult was
the preparation?  
KENDALL HACKNEY: It's always tough to play the same team in really the same
week. Iowa is a tough team. On Sunday Dixon got hot again. 21 points in our
game. We really focused on stopping her, and we did, but we let the post play
kind of field their team today. And the rebounding, like we said, I mean, we
felt pretty confident coming in.  
We beat them early in the season in a great game, both ends. Iowa battled
hard. It was a great game to be a part of. And a little bit of a heartbreaker
for us and especially on senior day, but we just tried to fight hard and do
the best we can.  
We wanted to leave it on the floor today and do the best that we could
because‑‑ i mean, it's really all you can ask for.  
  
Q. Turnovers affected you guys early and then again in the second half. Can
you guys talk about how that might have slowed you guys down to start the
game?  
INESHA HALE: I guess turnovers has affected us, but we really just wanted to
minimize that. That was part of our game plan and just really try to take care
of the ball the best we could.  
But today, and even Sunday's game, it really hurt us. But we just tried to
really just get a hold of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. There's a sequence in the second half, you all were got down four. Karly
got a break, and she was heading down the court. She was looking to see if
there was a defender behind. Instead of finishing at the hoop, she stopped,
she tried a jump shot. She stopped. She went down hard, and then Iowa came
back made a transition 3. So that was a five ‑point swing there. Do you think
that was a key moment in the game in terms of changing it from what could have
been a one‑possession game to what was then a three‑possession game?  
COACH McKEOWN: I don't know if that‑‑ it certainly played into it in the
second half. But there's a lot of other plays that probably affected us not
being able to score when we had to score at the right time.  
But what hurts you when you have opportunities like that in transition, which
we didn't get a lot of, to not score and then for them to get a 3 at the other
end, that really hurt. We were playing from behind.  
But I was really proud of our team.  
  
Q. Maggie had a slow start. She missed her first seven shots. What was Iowa
doing that kind of like ‑‑  
COACH McKEOWN: You know, the game we beat Iowa couple of weeks ago in Iowa,
you know, Maggie played great. Melissa Dixon had 21 points. The game Sunday, I
thought Maggie did a great job. Melissa Dixon had 21 points.  
So we did a great job of shutting her down. And Iowa I think focused on
shutting Maggie Lyon down, too, and took people off of other people to help on
her.  
And I think it's been a great growth experience for her, to learn how to play
off the ball and when people are really focused on trying to stop you. But
what an incredible year she's had.  
  
Q. Coach, Karly's a great player, but like her outside shot keeps defenders
off her, are you going to work with her to get her offside shooting better?
And if she does get that better, how even more of a better guard would she
be?  
COACH McKEOWN: Well, she's had a great year. And you see the growth between‑‑
from last year to this year, and she's had to play probably too many minutes.
And I think we've addressed some of those issues in recruiting.  
But obviously, our goal in the postseason workouts will be to develop her at
the 3‑point line and make her a threat from there. If that happens‑‑ which I
think it will happen because she's a great, great work ethic and passionate.  
I think that's a challenge that we'll take on for the next six months.  
And we have a saying great players are made April through October and great
teams are made November to March. And I think this becomes a time for her.
That's a great question.  
  
Q. Coach, with Lauren in foul trouble today, you really forced Alex Cohen on
the floor a lot. She stepped up big and really showed her progression
throughout the entire Big Ten season. What role will she have to play next
year without Kendall and Dannielle?  
COACH McKEOWN: I was proud of her today and going back to where I thought she
started in the Big Ten to have an impact. We beat Illinois down there, she had
12 points, 12 rebounds. I think that got her going.  
And we played all year with two freshmen and two sophomores and two seniors.
So I think going into next year, she'll have some confidence coming off of
especially the Big Ten and what she's done.  
Like you said, even today, where she was aggressive. And she's got a lot of
work to do. But I was proud of her today.  
  
Q. Bouncing off that, Lauren had ‑‑ when she was out there, she played great
defense. Can you talk about how not having her the whole game‑‑  
COACH McKEOWN: You know, I mean, I'll kind of give you the big picture of
this. And she's had an incredible year, too. We took a post player and made
her into a shooting guard all year. And the growth that we see in her I
thought was incredible. And not having her on the floor during that stretch in
the second half probably hurt us.  
And who knows, maybe might have changed the outcome today. But I think the
future with her is really the sky's the limit and great kid, just really
excited about her. But we missed her out there, missed her ability to score
too at times.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan  67  
Indiana - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MILLER: Certainly we're disappointed with our play tonight. We came into
this game and had played four good games in a row and felt like we were
playing our best basketball down the stretch of the season and really feel a
season that we've overachieved where we doubled our win total in the Big Ten
and had a very successful nonconference and increased our wins by five games
this year from the program that we took over and felt a lot of momentum for
the end of this season.  
Unfortunately, a difficult first four or six minutes for us and we're down
12‑0 and spotted them 12‑0\. With that said, went to halftime down 10, so
found a way to outplay them the last 14 minutes of the half and felt like we
got into the halftime, took a deep breath and had a chance to gather ourselves
and come out and reestablish what the game plan was and thought it would still
have a chance.  
And unfortunately, again, the second half started very similar to the first
half and they scored eight quick points out of halftime. And so if you combine
the 12‑0 start in the beginning and the 8‑0 start in the second half, in the
first four minutes of both halves, they outscored us 20‑0 if you look at it
that way. And because of that, it wasn't much of a game.  
I'm really proud of our senior class. They did a lot of things to help create
a new culture and start things in a positive direction in our tenure.  
We're going to work relentlessly in recruiting to turn this program around. I
haven't sat at a conference tournament and been eliminated in the first round
in 10 years. So this is unusual for me to be eliminated this early, and we're
going to work really, really hard.  
But I'm really proud of our seniors and sorry they had to go out on that note.
But they've really helped us change the culture.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jasmine, how tough was it chasing around Kate Thompson the whole night
and how did that impact you on both sides of the ball?  
JASMINE McGHEE: I mean, that was just my job to play defense. And I mean,
she's a good player. And she's expected to get shots off.  
And my role was just to play defense and play as hard as I can. That's it.  
  
Q. Jasmine, even after you went down 12 ‑0 in the first half, you were able
to really make a run sort of late in the first half to go into the locker room
only down 10. How were you able to do that?   
JASMINE McGHEE: Just playing with confidence and getting my teammates involved
and just energy, maybe. I mean, we know that we were coming into a big stage
and being the underdogs, we weren't expected to win either. So just being able
to come out and just play with confidence, a little more confidence, just
probably how we tried.  
  
Q. Sasha, can you talk about the physical nature of the game? There's a huge
battle at the post and unfortunately Michigan got the better of it. But seemed
like they were really flying in for the offensive rebound. Could you talk
about the battle down low?  
SASHA CHAPLIN: Just playing them for the third time this season, we kind of
knew that Michigan is a physical team, and they do crash the offense and
defensive boards.  
So when we were coming into the game, our main objective was to crash the
board and attempt to crash the board more offensively and keep their post
players off the glass. And they did outrebound us and we have to go back and
look at this during the summer and improve.  
  
Q. What do you think contributed to that slow shooting start in the first
half? Just seemed like everything you put up, you just couldn't get a shot to
go down.  
SASHA CHAPLIN: Just I think it was just the momentum and the energy and just
trying to go out there and find our rhythm. It is a neutral site. And just the
limited amount of time we had to shoot‑around kind of affected us. So just
going out there and when we go out there, shoot, shoot, and shoot well in a
new area. So I think that was the main problem for us.  
  
Q. Sasha, you've been around this program for five years. To see where it
started, to see where it's going, to see the small improvements, and to see
the kind players that Coach Miller is recruiting, how does it make you feel
for the future of Indiana?  
SASHA CHAPLIN: Just the same positive and just knowing that Coach Miller and
his coaching staff is out there recruiting the best players in the nation
possible to bring in and establish this program.  
When I came in, we had a little success there. 2009 was the last time we made
it past the first round in the Big Ten tournament. And we went on a little
slump. But just the improvements we made this year is a great look for
Indiana's women's basketball. And that's all we're trying to do is establish
this program and bring it to the national level and show everyone that Indiana
is here to compete in women's basketball.  
  
Q. Jasmine, a few times when the runs were going against you, seemed like
you were the most emotional and vocal out there. Can you talk about what you
were trying to do in firing up your teammates when things weren't going
well?  
JASMINE McGHEE: I just think I wanted to win. And me being a senior, I didn't
want this to be my last year. I just know that I just tried to get my
teammates going and maybe we can make a run. And unfortunately it didn't
happen, but I'm just grateful for the opportunity that I've been playing here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll take questions for Coach Miller.  
  
Q. Coach, it is your first season, of course. Anytime you step into a
program, you're obviously going to have to build it up. But you did have some
improvements this year. How do you take it to the next level next year? In
other words, what expectations are you going to set like for your team, for
your coaching, to keep improving for next season?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we certainly understand that this is a long marathon
rebuilding job. And it's not going to happen overnight. And when we rebuild,
we knew this year was going to be difficult. So we never put any goals in
terms of win/loss record on this team, but we wanted to establish things as a
hardworking team and a good chemistry team. And we did that throughout the
year.  
But people have to understand that we also graduate our three leading scorers,
our two best defenders, our best rebounders, so we're going to have to depend
on a lot of freshmen next year.  
And so we want to get better, and we continue to believe that we're recruiting
kids that fit our system and in the long run are going to be very talented
players, but it's not going to happen overnight. And this is not a league that
you win easily with freshmen.  
So we are prepared to understand and dig into this journey. And our win/loss
record might be worse next year, but we really feel it's headed in the right
direction. And all of it starts with recruiting.  
We've all, every single coach in the Big Ten is a championship coach. But we
always are better with good players. And players win games.  
I can't wait for Kevin Borst's kids to graduate. I want those five seniors to
graduate.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half you called three timeouts in the first 12
minutes. What were you saying to your team during that Michigan run to try to
slow them down?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we used different tactics in those three timeouts. We were
challenging them to play harder and to get our energy level up and to not back
down.  
We understand that we lack offensive fire power, and if we dug ourselves that
kind of hole, we were going to be in trouble. And so we challenged the energy
level. We challenged the confidence level. And Michigan doesn't surprise you.
You know what they're going to do, and you're going to make some shots.  
And unfortunately, Lonnie looked fatigued tonight and couldn't get her legs
underneath us. Linda's really under the weather and sick. And those two
seniors who have been a huge part of what we do are 1 for 16 combined, and we
don't have the offensive fire power off the bench.  
So we're just kind of willing them at the time with three timeouts just trying
to stay in it in case we could catch a run and catch a flurry of good play.
But disappointing start for us, certainly. It didn't help us throughout the
evening.  
  
Q. Can you kind of talk about it almost seems like a repeat from the first
two games, shut down Kate Thompson and Sheffer is limited, but then somebody
steps up. Nya was a nemesis again tonight, 13 boards, and then out of nowhere
came Nicole Elmblad. So could you talk about how Michigan throws those other
players at you?  
COACH MILLER: Well, I want to first say that even though Jasmine McGhee did
not‑‑ not only didn't win the defensive player of the year award, didn't make
the defensive team, and there's not a better defender in this league.  
She chases around Kate Thompson with very little help all three games that we
played them, and she very rarely scored in all three games.  
And Jas did that to the best players on every team all year long. She doesn't
get a lot of credit for it because we don't win a lot of games and we're not a
big steal team and play a hokey defense. We're a pretty packed line and pretty
conservative, so she doesn't get a lot of credit.  
But first, Jasmine was once again tremendous on Kate Thompson. She gave up one
basket to her tonight, and it was the first play of the second half. The other
basket she got was not against her.  
With that said, Nya Jordan has hurt us as a versatile, active post player that
can hurt you on the outside and off the dribble. And we tried to scheme a
little differently for her and she still contributed.  
Now, Nicole should have come play for me at Bowling Green, but we didn't quite
get to the finish line with her. So I love Nicole Elmblad, but we insulted her
tonight and tried to make her the star of the game and helped off‑‑ to help
with the struggles that we had in the first two games with Sheffer and Nya
Jordan and Sam Arnold, and we were going to make her score baskets.  
Not only did she score some points, but by playing off of it, she got a lot of
free running lanes open to rebounding. And Nicole really hurt us with her
offensive rebounding. And as a kid, one of the kids that I'd love to recruit
through the years, I'm really happy for her, disappointed that she had such a
great game, but my staff, who recruited her very hard to Bowling Green, is a
huge fan and she had a great game tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, throughout the season you talked about how the offense really
relies on Aulani, to see the kind of game she has, only four points. How do
you feel after that kind of performance?  
COACH MILLER: Well, you could see all night she didn't have her legs. Her shot
was very flat tonight. Almost every single miss was short. And she depends
on‑‑ she's not great off the dribble. And so she didn't go create her own
shots. She's gotta make those shots and everything was short.  
And for what she's meant to this program and the 31‑point performance that she
had against Iowa just recently, and she's nearly scored 500 points this year
for us and in the top ten in the league in scoring. It's tough to see a senior
end her career like that.  
But we'll forget about this one and remember that she'll graduate as one of
the premier shooters at Indiana women's basketball history. And her career
should be celebrated. She had a great career.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the heart of Jasmine McGhee tonight, to sort of
try to will the team to victory?  
COACH MILLER: You know, Jasmine tried to bring everyone with her emotion with
her. Now, when you struggle, you also get into that mode where you try to do
too much.  
And as hard and as passionate that Jasmine tried to get her teammates to come
on, we can do this and we believed we had a good game plan coming into
tonight, there were stretches that that passion‑‑ she tried too hard. And she
tried to do too much, which unfortunately got us out of rhythm sometimes even
more.  
And you can't fault her for that, because she was trying the best she could to
get her fellow seniors and her teammates to come with her with a passion that
she was playing with. But we were in quicksand all night. And as soon as we
were doing one thing, we just couldn't get ourselves out of quicksand. And as
we put a Band‑Aid on one problem, another thing sprung open. It's unfortunate.  
But going to miss that senior class, and Jasmine's one of those.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, seemed like at the beginning the team was just flat
and then they went on that run. What changed between those two stretches of
play and why was Michigan able to just seemingly out ‑hustle your team at the
beginning of both halves?  
COACH MILLER: You know, I wish I could put my finger on that. As a coach, you
just don't understand sometimes. We've had really important starts. And we
talked about the cannon effect tonight, which we always talk about. And
Michigan had more determination and more fire in the beginning, and we
challenged our kids early. And why that happened, the late start, kind of a
dreary venue, I have no idea. I can only speculate.  
I don't know why we didn't have more energy in the beginning. But it's
unfortunate, that start, it dug us a hole. And you know, we don't have that
kind of fire power, and that creates major problems and now you're panicked
and you're playing a little outside of yourself because you're trying to
scramble back too fast and get it all back at once.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  58  
Illinois - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Comments by Coach.  
COACH BOLLANT: Wisconsin became the most aggressive in the second half. First
half I thought we did a great job of weathering the storm with Karisma in foul
trouble. And we just needed to step up and play aggressively in the second
half, and we didn't. I think we got caught up in thinking about the end result
and quit playing aggressively and quit attacking and that really hurt us.  
We got down 10 the first time we started playing again, and then made a run to
take the lead, but just didn't get the stops down the stretch when we had to
have it. And hurting for our team and our staff.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Those last five minutes, what's going through your guys' heads?  
IVORY CRAWFORD: Well, what was actually going through my mind at first was
just like, it's okay, we've got five minutes. You know, take our time, we can
actually take them.  
And I saw like the scaredness of like the teammates‑‑ I mean the opponents.
And I felt like we, as a team can, like, take this team down. And like we did
and we showed, and proved that, and it's just down the stretch, we made a bad
decision.  
AMBER MOORE: I just think we've been in this position before. We've been down,
we've come back, and being in that situation comes with our defense, and we
didn't start the second half that way.  
And we didn't have the edge we had in the first half. So the results didn't
say what we wanted to say.  
  
Q. Amber, what did that feel like just making that go ‑ahead 3, and what was
your thinking for the rest of the game when you made that?  
AMBER MOORE: It was just confidence. My teammates were getting me the ball and
I was knocking down shots. And it comes from our defense. We work on defense
all the time. Whether a shot's going in or not, our defense is what gets the
game won, and I think me hitting the shots created more confidence for our
team.  
  
Q. As tough a loss as this seems to be from the outside, how do you feel
about this? Can you kind of just express what this feels like?  
IVORY CRAWFORD: It just didn't end how we wanted it. That's all. I think it
just comes to like learning from our mistakes from the past and just trying to
make the adjustment. Just the scoreboard didn't show what we wanted.  
AMBER MOORE: I think we just have to learn how to keep the edge. We're a
better team when we're on edge and we're being the most aggressive team. And
we're the first one on the floor for loose balls, and we didn't show that in
the second half.  
  
Q. That obviously explains maybe the turnout or the end result perhaps, but
I guess I'd like to again ask the question. Is this as difficult as it gets in
terms of losses considering what you guys aspire to in this tournament? I
guess that's what I'm asking.  
AMBER MOORE: It is difficult. We knew we could make a run in this tournament.
And, I don't know. We just weren't aggressive in the second half. And if we
learned how to put two halves together, I think we'd be in a better position
than we're in now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, at the end you had 3.1seconds left and one timeout. Can you
explain why you didn't call that timeout?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah. We had set up a play that we've run every day in
practice. Trying to get something we've run all the time. And actually I was
yelling timeout. Once we got the ball in to Amber I was yelling, timeout,
timeout, timeout, and apparently the refs didn't hear me.  
  
Q. What do you think went wrong in the entire second half and also basically
after Amber Moore made her 3 ‑pointer, what happened after that point?  
COACH BOLLANT: We haven't been good playing with leads, honestly. We built a
lead playing aggressively and playing hard in the first half, and then we
didn't do that in the second half. We waited until we really got down ten
before we started to be the most aggressive team, and that was a struggle.  
When Amber hit the three, I felt good about our chances and put ourselves in
position to win, and the two fouls that hurt us, the Alexis foul in the press
and then the foul with three seconds left put them on the foul line where they
were awfully good, 21 for 21.  
  
Q. What impact did it have on your team for Karisma not to be on the floor
as much as she was ‑‑  
COACH BOLLANT: Karisma only played 22 minutes. It was kind of devastating to
our team and hurt us. She just never really got in the flow because of that
foul trouble. So that definitely was something that hurt our team.  
I thought we adjusted in the first half and did a really good job in the first
half playing without her. But the second half, we struggled to get in the flow
offensively and be able to get the ball inside and get easy baskets, which she
normally gets.  
  
Q. Just what do you think of your NCAA Tournament chances and why do you
think your team's deserving of playing in the tournament?  
COACH BOLLANT: I think if you look at our quality wins, that's what they talk
about. Your quality wins is what gets you into the NCAA Tournament. We have
six wins in the top 50. They're not going to take another team in the NCAA
Tournament at large bid that has six top 50 wins. And to have two top 25 wins
with Georgia, Nebraska, I think if they say it's quality wins, then we should
have that to be.  
Last year the Big Ten got seven teams in. This year the Big Ten went from six
in the RPI to second in the RPI. Us to finish tied for fifth in the RPI, tied
for fifth in the conference, to me, we should be in because of the quality
wins.  
  
Q. Does today's result change your thinking in terms of the NCAA? Does it
make you a little bit more apprehensive?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, it certainly clouds that tremendously. But again, I don't
make those decisions. Have our team ready to play in the postseason.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Morgan Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21475)

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Iowa  60  
Northwestern - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Lisa Bluder, Jaime Printy, and Morgan
Johnson. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH BLUDER: Very happy to come in here and get this win today. Puts us at 20
wins for the year. And I thought we did another good job defensively.  
I think we played several very good defensive games in a row. Got to the
free‑throw line; that was good. But I thought Sam and Morgan did a great job
for us on the boards.  
And we're very happy to get this win today and to move on to tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Morgan, it seems like everywhere you went today, you were able to
establish yourself inside and be able to pop it outside. So how do you think
your versatility in your offensive game today really led to the team's
success, because it seems like you were everywhere?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think we did a good job calling plays and where I wasn't
always on the block or I wasn't always in the short corner, just continuing
motion, really helped to open me up.  
And my teammates did a great job just finding me and getting me those open
shots.  
  
Q. Playing an opponent twice in that short of a span, how difficult to
prepare for the same team again, or is it difficult at all?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think it was extremely difficult. We had to change some of
the things. We couldn't just keep the same thing. And we also had to be
mentally prepared to get up for a team two times in a row. I think Coach did a
good job telling us it was going to be a hard game and we had to come in here
with all of our focus because they're a good team.  
  
Q. Jaime, can you talk about the physical play out there and the way you
guys were able to get a lot of loose balls?  
JAIME PRINTY: Yeah, definitely a physical game, both teams were diving for
loose balls and we really stressed that in our huddle we wanted to get the
hustle plays. But I think we also did a good job staying composed at the same
time of getting those hustle plays. So definitely a physical game.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow night you've got Nebraska. Talk about that a
little bit.  
JAIME PRINTY: I think now that we got this one out of the way we're really
looking forward to playing Nebraska. We haven't beaten them yet and I think
it's going to be a great opportunity. So we're going to enjoy this one for a
little bit. Like Coach Bluder, said go over the scouting report and get ready
to go tomorrow. We know it's going to be a tough game.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: Like Jaime said, we haven't beat them, and I think it's easy
to get up for a team you haven't beat. So just continue to keep our composure
and focusing on the scouting report, come out prepared for anything.  
  
Q. This is the first time that the Big Ten Tournament has ever been held
here at the Sears Center, first time in a long time. Do you think it makes it
easier on you having to travel less distance as opposed to going to
Indianapolis and being able to save up a lot of energy in terms of travel time
in order to bring it out on the court?  
JAIME PRINTY: Well, I guess so. We usually fly to Indianapolis, though. So we
drove here, which was fine. We all like bus trips and have fun together.  
But I think we were excited that it was here and had a new place, because we
never have been here and we get to start something new. So we were looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Jaime, you guys had quite a few turnovers, especially in the first half.
And I guess was that just a product of how physical the game was, or was there
something that Northwestern was maybe doing a little differently to cause that
much trouble?  
JAIME PRINTY: They were being physical, but at the same time it's kind of our
fault. We need to take care of the ball a little better. And Coach Bluder
stressed it at halftime, being composed and being strong with the ball because
they're a physical team and I think we did a much better job in the second
half.  
  
Q. You guys got into the bonus early in the second half. How important was
that for you guys to get to the line?  
JAIME PRINTY: Definitely very important. We are a pretty good free‑throw
shooting team, so we like to take advantage of that. When we realized that we
were in the bonus, we attacked the rim a little bit draw more and tried to
draw a couple fouls because those are some easy points for us.  
  
Q. You started play at 11:30 in the morning, which is a lot earlier than
you're used to. Does that affect at all how you prepare?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: Yeah, we didn't get our opportunity to come in and do our
shootaround like we normally do. So we had a breakfast in the morning, and we
just kind of‑‑ I think we did a good job just continuing what we can do and
keeping our consistency with everything else, our same pregame meal time and
everything else.  
So just knowing that was something that we and Northwestern didn't have the
opportunity to do.  
JAIME PRINTY: I was going to say we also practiced around that time so that
kind of helped because we have to get mentally prepared for practice, just
like a game. So that helped.  
  
Q. Morgan, you guys really cleaned up on the glass for much of the game
today. And I guess what was maybe a key for you guys to be able to have that
advantage on the glass, because you had nine, Sam came in had 11. I guess what
was kind of enabling you guys to have that sort of success?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think in practice this whole entire week we've been‑‑ or two
days, we've been focusing on getting those rebounds and knowing that they
got‑‑ they outrebounded us last time or we only outrebounded them by a little
time last time. Knowing they're a good boarding team and coming in with that
mindset that we have to get every single board, and we just did an overall
good job being scrappy in general and that included the boards.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I haven't seen the final stats but when you look at the hustle type plays
the steals, the blocks, seems like you guys had a lot of them.  
COACH BLUDER: I thought we did have a lot of hustle plays. Northwestern has
more steals than we do. But on the floor for loose balls, and we talked about
that as a point of emphasis that we need to be tough. We need to be tough with
the ball playing against a team like Northwestern who I think is physical.  
You know, you can't back down to physical. And you've got to get on the floor
for those loose balls. And I thought we did a nice job with that.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, Northwestern had one less big because I think
Popovec was out today, and you were wearing them down. And you were up 15 with
about three something to go, and I think that's when you pulled Morgan. And
then they cut it to five. Were you about ready to send her back in. Five or
six, maybe it was six. I was thinking it was six.  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I don't feel like we did. I feel like there's no rule
we can't put Morgan back in the game if we have to. And we have another game
tomorrow. And so we have to be concerned about that. I wish we would have
maybe done a few of the things with our reserves at the end. But I'm not
wanting to change that situation.  
I'm glad our reserves got in and had an opportunity to play on this floor and
had an opportunity to be in this game today.  
  
Q. Lisa, you get Nebraska tomorrow for the third time in a little over three
weeks. First of all, people talk about playing two teams in a short time. You
play them three times. Does that affect ‑‑ and secondly, what do you have to
do differently to get, to beat them this time?   
COACH BLUDER: You know, I don't really think there's any big advantage or
disadvantage to playing a team rapidly. You know, for us coaches, it's a
little less scouting. So it's a little less work sometimes.  
For the players, they know the teams a little bit better. But again it's for
each other, so it's a wash in my opinion.  
For them, you know, they've beaten us twice. So they probably have a little
more confidence coming into this game. For us we had that revenge factor. So
again, I don't know that I make any big deal about playing teams in close
succession. I guess, to me, I'd rather know a team and I feel like I know them
better when I play them closer together.  
  
Q. Samantha Logic had 11 rebounds today. That's phenomenal for a guard of
her size. How important do you think it is to be able to have guards who can
really get on the glass and not just get the defensive rebounds, but really
clean up on the offensive glass? That creates a lot of second chance
opportunities, which you converted on it countless times today.  
COACH BLUDER: She's such a versatile point guard. And she does so many things
for us on the floor that sometimes point guards don't do.  
Now, Northwestern has a pretty versatile guard in Karly, and she's able to
crash really well also.  
But Sam's been like that forever. I mean, sometimes her and Morgan get in
little competitive games as to who can get the most rebounds.  
But it's pretty unusual, I think, when you have a point guard that leads your
team in rebounds at times. But she's so physically strong and she's so smart,
and she loves it. She loves getting those rebounds. And so it makes my job a
lot easier.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Rachel Banham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23253)

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

### [Micaella Riche](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24825)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  58  
Minnesota - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: Comments, Coach?  
COACH BORTON: It was definitely a tale of two halves for us. I felt like we
gave up the momentum of the game. I felt we played well for the first 17
minutes, and with Micaëlla and Kionna getting in foul trouble, I felt like the
whole momentum changed in the last three minutes going into halftime and then
it kind of carried over into the start of the first half.  
I thought our team played extremely well defensively, keeping them to
35percent. They've been shooting about 50percent in the last five games. We
outrebounded them, and just keeping them below 60 points, I felt like if we
could, we'd have a chance to win.  
But some of the things that we did offensively, turning the ball over, missing
a lot of layups inside‑‑ I think we missed eight layups in the rim‑‑ in the
second half, obviously affected what we were doing offensively.  
So didn't play well enough to win, and I felt like Ohio State was the better
team, at least in the second half, to win the game today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. In that stretch in the last four minutes of the first half where things
just didn't seem to go in at all, was that a frustrating time for you, because
if you would have made a basket or two, maybe that would have changed the
momentum in your favor going into the second half?  
RACHEL BANHAM: I mean, I don't know if it's frustrating. I think that's how
basketball goes. I mean we're going to get up and they're going to go up, and
it's gonna go back and forth. I think it would have helped if we could have
scored a little bit there to stop the bleeding a little bit. But that's what
happens. We've got to play better.  
MICAËLLA RICHÉ: Kinda of like what Rachel said, you know. That's what happens.
And usually at the second half, whether we're up or down, we try to think of
it as 0‑0 and it's a new game and we gotta go in and just play hard and win
the first four minutes of the second half, so regardless of what happened in
the first.  
  
Q. Rachel, what were they able to do in the second half to make things more
difficult for you?  
RACHEL BANHAM: I don't really think it was much of what they were doing. I
think I needed to play better. I wasn't finishing, I wasn't being as confident
as I was in the first half. And I just didn't shoot as well. I don't know if
it was much of their defense. I think it was more my mindset.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In terms of your performance down the stretch, do you feel that you had
made a case for your team going forward in the postseason?  
COACH BORTON: I think we'll see. I think we finished the regular season
strong, and obviously Ohio State was‑‑ we met up with a hot team that has won
their last seven out of nine games. And they played well.  
I felt like we're right there, and we'll just let the basketball gods figure
it out.  
  
Q. I know you said earlier that you felt the defense played well enough to
keep you in the game. But can you talk about, a little bit about how the
offense seemed to sputter a lot. You didn't get any contribution, or little
contribution from the rest of the team other than Rachel.  
COACH BORTON: I thought we missed a lot of layups. We missed a lot of layups
and we missed a lot of layups. They were leaving certain kids open, and those
kids needed to step up and make shots. And we knew that. They were going to
double team Micaëlla and they were going to double team Rachel coming off of
ball screens and make it really tough for her.  
And I think Shayne going one for 12 and Kionna going three for nine and Sari,
you know, those kids are out there trying. They're trying as hard as they can,
but we just needed some of those kids to step up and make more shots.  
  
Q. Seems like they sort of found a formula almost in the second half against
you guys the game in Columbus. You guys won, but that's where Ferguson started
at the 4. How different are they with that kind of look?  
COACH BORTON: Well, they have five players that can score the basketball. I
think it just gives you a 4 player that can knock a 3 down. Better passer.
Handler. I think before, when they had their 4 player on the court, that you
could really help off of that player and make her make shots. And I think
their 4 player didn't make shots.  
I think it was hard for them to win. And I think for them to make that change,
Ferguson was playing well and she gives them a 3‑point threat, another ball
handler, they're a little more aggressive defensively.  
So it just gives them a different look. And they're a little more versatile.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20546)

### [Nicole Elmblad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24827)

### [Rachel Sheffer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23220)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan  67  
Indiana - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you would like to start with an opening statement,
please.  
COACH ARICO: I was really proud of the way our kids came out today. I thought
we were very focused and we were really sharp. I thought Indiana made a run at
the end of the first half, but then we started the second half crisp and sharp
again.  
I thought we rebounded. I thought we shared the basketball well and ran in
transition. It was a followed game for us against an Indiana team that has
been playing well lately.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Nicole, did you come out looking a little to score more than before or
did that just develop?  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: Obviously I kind of struggled a little bit this year, but in
practice, we've kind of been working since a couple of teams have just been
sloughing off of me and not playing me out deep.  
We've been working on cuts and places I can get open and get some shots up.
That's what we've been working on in practice.  
  
Q. Nicole, can you talk about the fastbreak tonight? Seemed like you were on
the receiving end of a lot of those fastbreak opportunities, and did that
really get you energize you and get you going?  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: Yeah, my teammates found me and I made some incredible passes
to everybody tonight. But I think that was one of the goals of the team was to
get out, run in transition, and get some easy baskets. And I think that
energized the whole team.  
  
Q. Rachel, can you talk about what Nicole's offense adds to your offense?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: Yeah, just having more threats out there when we're, from the
starting five and everything, they played off her. Packed it in the paint more
in the past couple of games. So I think Nicole just being a threat. We have
complete confidence in her to shoot the ball whenever she wants.  
So just letting her know she has the confidence in herself to shoot the ball,
too. And I think once we all have the confidence to do it, we can go really
far.  
  
Q. Rachel, can you compare like the aura around the team, last year on the
bubble, and compare it to how you guys feel now?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: I mean, it's hard to say because it's a new year and
everything. But we're really just focused on just playing ourselves and March
is a new season come tournament time and everything. So we're really just
focused on the next game right now, which is Michigan State. So we're going to
come back and prepare for that and just be ready to go for that next game.  
  
Q. I just want to ask how it seems like in all three games against Indiana,
Rachel, yourself and Kate have not had, like, great shooting nights, but seems
like someone such as Nicole or another player always steps up. Can you talk
about just the depth of the team and how the offense seems to be like an equal
opportunity offense?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: I think tonight really showed the depth of our team. We had
people come in off the bench scoring, contributing defensively, just knowing
that we have threats all the way down our bench.  
It really helps us know that we can just score with whoever out there and play
defense with whoever out there.  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: Yeah, we know that teams are going to target on Rachel and
especially Kate. And so we worked on still setting screens for them and trying
to get them the ball whenever we can, but when teams are targeting on them,
other people are going to be open for slips and cuts and everything.  
So just being able to step up other players, we've worked on that all year.  
  
Q. Obviously you talk about next games, playing as it is, but what do you
really take out of getting one more chance playing Michigan State, coming off
the victory against them last time?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: That's really the biggest key we were looking for coming into
the game against Indiana, is just being able to have the opportunity to play
tomorrow, and that was the biggest focus. And I think tonight we came out with
a lot of energy, a lot of confidence through the bench and everything. And
just being able to know we have another game tomorrow is really, really great
for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, did you plan that play for Kate right out of the half to get her
going?  
COACH ARICO: Yeah, we run that sometimes. And we always‑‑ we try to get Rachel
the ball inside. But we know if Kate's defender helps on Rachel, Kate's going
to be open. And it worked out.  
And I thought it was good to get Kate going, because her first two shots were
in and out, and then she became really hesitant. And that's one of the things
we talk about is you gotta keep shooting the ball. But sometimes her and
Rachel are the same way, both of them, miss a couple shots, then they get a
little hesitant. But we need them to score. So we ran it. It was either going
to be Kate or Rachel that we're going to score out of that or try to score out
of that play.  
  
Q. Coach Aulani Sinclair really struggled tonight for IU. What did you think
about your team's defense on her? She did get some open looks, but overall it
seemed like she was being denied the ball quite a bit?  
COACH ARICO: I thought we did a great job defensively tonight. I thought we
really, really did a tremendous job, whether it was zone or man knowing where
she was, and as well as knowing where McGhee was. I thought we did a
tremendous job on McGhee. She made some tough, tough shots in transition, pull
up 3s. But then you look at her percentage, and she was five for 16. So we
forced her to take a lot of contested shots.  
But we knew that if we could do a good job on those two, we would be in good
shape, because they've been really doing a great job for Indiana scoring
lately. So we knew they were going to be key to us winning tonight.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Nya's rebounding and assists and her total game?  
COACH ARICO: Yeah, I mean, Nya is just a name that keeps coming up each and
every single game because I think she's getting more and more comfortable and
more and more confident. And she was everywhere rebounding in the first half.
She had ten rebounds at the half, which was incredible and it gave us a lot of
our second‑chance opportunities and obviously helped in our lead at halftime.  
But when she gets out in transition, she gives a dimension to our team we
really don't have, and she was able to do that tonight. She pushed the ball.
She had six assists. Golly, she had a heck of a night. And she's just a
difference maker for the team because she plays a position we really don't
have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  76  
San Diego State  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's
game.  
COACH PEBLEY: Oh, it was so fun. That's my thoughts. So fun (smiling).  
I'm really, really happy for these girls, that their story didn't end with an
amazing shot by Ki‑Ki. It's even more special that that amazing shot led to
just an outstanding game.  
You know, we challenged them before the first game, make these the three most
memorable days of the season so far. And I think absolutely they were. I
apologize for my attire, but I got a whole thing of water dumped on me in the
locker room (laughter).  
San Diego State is a very, very good team. I'm hopeful that this means two
teams from our conference are going into the NCAA tournament. I think San
Diego State's body of work is pretty impressive, what they've been able to
accomplish, especially since January, since our game at their place. To do
what they did is so hard.  
Hats off to them, their whole team. Their posts beat us down the floor
tonight. They had a point guard that could hit crazy threes. They have an
incredible shooter in Courtney Clements. They were so hard to beat and we
couldn't put them away. They're a great team, and great teams don't get put
away.  
In the end we're so grateful we were able to pull off the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. To be in this position again, what's going through your mind right now?  
KI‑KI MOORE: Just excitement. Just to come to a new conference, to win the
championship after splitting the regular season with them, them being the
defending champions, I think it's excitement for our team and coaches as well.  
ROSIE MOULT: Definitely the same. It's been a tough year. We fought hard. We
played so well. Now we're going to the NCAAs.  
  
Q. You were able to get on a 23 ‑0 run over them. What was going through
your mind then?   
ROSIE MOULT: We needed to keep our composure because we knew San Diego State
is a great team, they were going to come out hard. We had to make sure we were
still being tough and physical on defense, and creating shots on offense, and
we did that well.  
  
Q. In the beginning of the game it looked like it was going to be a blowout,
then all of a sudden you turned the game around. What did you do? Was
something said?  
ROSIE MOULT: We just became more aggressive on defense. I think we've done
that really well this tournament. We need to make sure we caught San Diego
State by surprise because I don't think they were ready for our aggressiveness
and that's what helped us.  
KI‑KI MOORE: Same. I think we took away some of their second shots. At the
beginning they were getting a lot of second chances, making the easy shots.
Missing the first one, letting them get the second one, we knew they were
going to make the shot.  
  
Q. When San Diego State drew close in the final minutes, what were you able
to do defensively to take them out of their game?  
KI‑KI MOORE: I mean, we just played good on‑ball defense. We knew who was
going to take the shots, who they were going to pass the ball to. We played
hard defense, one‑on‑one, switches, made them take a tough shot.  
  
Q. Against Wyoming, you weren't able to shoot the three ball. Here it really
seemed to be the difference ‑maker. What was it like to get that game going?
  
ROSIE MOULT: Yeah, obviously it's a great confidence booster for our team.
We're a great three‑point shooting team. When you're hitting them early, it
always helps, you know, the lead.  
  
Q. Ki ‑Ki, being named the tournament's most valuable player, what does that
mean to you?   
KI‑KI MOORE: It's exciting. Without my teammates, none of this would have been
possible. Them giving me big shots when needed, big plays. Without my
teammates and coaches, I don't believe any of this would have been possible.  
  
Q. Rosie, knowing that you really had to win this tournament to likely get
into the NCAA tournament, how rewarding is it for you?  
ROSIE MOULT: Yeah, it's an awesome feeling. It was a very hard game. We were
very well rewarded with straight to the NCAAs. We hope to do our best at the
next level.  
  
Q. On the three ‑pointers. If you look at the stat sheet, second‑chance
points is when you caught up to them. Did you know early in the game you had
your stroke?  
ROSIE MOULT: My shot was feeling a lot better. It's been off the last two
games. It was nice to hit a few. My teammates were attacking when they either
helped off or if they didn't help off, they were getting a drive, so it was
good.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Pebley.  
  
Q. What did you say to your team to slow everything down?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, we just talked about rebounding, number one. We felt like
there was a couple mistakes we made defensively that we trusted we weren't
going to continue to make. We had to change the face of the game through
rebounding. We couldn't let them get second‑chance opportunities.  
The other thing, we felt like we got good shots, they just didn't fall. Just
like we talked about with the Wyoming team, when threes are being shot, no
lead is safe, their lead or your lead. We were able to get some threes. That
helped. We limited some of their scoring.  
Definitely that run going into half, extending the lead beyond 10, just making
them have to go into timeout and discuss how to break our press instead of
dealing with our halfcourt defense.  
  
Q. This was not only your first year at Fresno State but your first year in
the Mountain West. Talk about being a first ‑year head coach coming into a new
conference.   
COACH PEBLEY: Well, my first year here at Fresno State, I've been blessed with
great opportunities at Utah State, as well. I think those experiences, helping
lead a team, we fell short at Utah State a few times.  
But really helping a team stay focused. A lot of times we were under‑manned.
We had less talent than who we were playing against, which was Fresno State
and La Tech. You had to find ways to still win the game. I think San Diego
State top to bottom probably has more talent than we do. So we had to find
ways.  
The girls had to believe in themselves. That's absolutely how we won this
game, is their belief and absolute will and determination.  
Again, I have to give a lot of credit to our trainer, Kelly. Kelly has been
phenomenal all year. We have this thing before the game, everybody gets to say
something, what they believe's going to happen tonight. The thing she said, If
you break it, we're going to tape it up and you're going to go back out there.
They nearly broke Taylor. And Taylor was able to get back out there. That was
important, because their press without Taylor could have really impacted this
game.  
  
Q. Can you talk more about that. What does that say about her to come
back?  
COACH PEBLEY: It's just Taylor. I mean, I don't know if that's being Oklahoma,
small town, fight for everything you've got, blue‑collar. Her parents are here
and they've done an amazing job raising an amazing woman, that is a woman
among children and she's 10 feet tall and bulletproof. She loves this team and
is going to do everything she can.  
I have no idea. There could have been somebody telling her back there, You're
not playing. She would have stormed right past through them if it was
possible.  
  
Q. One of the common variables was Alex's performance.  
COACH PEBLEY: You can check my text to her mom all the way to Australia. Hi,
Deb. We knew that Bree and Alex Sheedy were going to have to be big in this
game. We used them as on‑ball screeners, really defend Ki‑Ki and Taylor. We
were going to pop them instead of rolling them. Let them facilitate offense.
They were going to have catch and shoot threes, get to attack off the dribble,
or continue to attack and to handoffs and what we call at‑action.  
They knew coming into this game that we were going to have those
opportunities. Kudos to them for taking advantage of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how your players have adapted to playing in your
system.  
COACH PEBLEY: Yeah, everybody's adapted to each other. I didn't make them
adapt to me. I adapted to them, too. Our staff adapted to them. We didn't want
to come in and change everything. They were pretty good at how they were
built.  
We still shoot the three ball. Just different ways we got it. I think we get
to the foul line a lot more. That helps us get to team's benches, foul some of
their better players out.  
Having Chelsea out, that was a big part of our run. She was out of the game
with two fouls to finish that half.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the performance of Ki ‑Ki Moore over the balance of
this tournament.   
COACH PEBLEY: All season. She just is a major factor. She's a great talent.
What we wanted Ki‑Ki to know and really believe when we came in is that great
players are going to be good and great in any system. You don't have to just
be good in one system.  
If you're going to have an opportunity to go on and play beyond college,
you're going to have to know how to adapt to different systems. And she really
did.  
I thought she and Taylor and Rosie did such a phenomenal job in the locker
room of leading this team, on the bench, the way they communicated.  
  
Q. You came to a program that already had been successful. What does it mean
to you to be able in your first year to win the conference tournament title
and send the team back to the NCAAs?  
COACH PEBLEY: I think it means to Fresno State that Fresno State has the
ability in football, in men's basketball, I think Rodney is doing a great job,
women's basketball, all of our sports, that we can compete in this league.
It's not just about women's basketball. It's pretty awesome to see that Fresno
State was prepared to be successful in the Mountain West.  
The baton was just handed off to me. I had a responsibility to keep it moving
and not take steps backwards.  
  
Q. In terms of the NCAA tournament, the teams seem to get out physical. Do
you feel good about your chances going in, that this could be the year you
take that big step and win a first game in the tournament?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, I don't know who we're going to be playing. But I think no
matter who we're going to be playing, we've got to go in with the attitude of
we are going to find a way. You just have to have the attitude of: It shall be
done.  
It's the drawing board. It's the confidence of the players. It's making sure
we're healthy. It's making sure we're smart. Just having that find‑a‑way
attitude.  
  
Q. I want to talk about the preparation for the NCAA tournament. You're
going to be facing someone you haven't seen at all. How does your preparation
change over the next couple days?  
COACH PEBLEY: We're going to get on that bus and this is going to be a great
bus ride home. Our preparation, there's nothing we can do really until we see
what the seeding comes out. Once that comes out, we're going to prepare like
we do for any and every game.  
You just got to believe in how you do things, approach everything with poise
and confidence. I think that bleeds and spills over to your players.  
Business as usual, but we'll enjoy the experience. This team has talked about
how they wanted to not just get in, they want to advance. That's the next step
that our program needs to take.  
So, I mean, we're going to go for it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH PEBLEY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  76  
San Diego State  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State. Coach, some comments on
tonight's game.  
COACH BURNS: First I'd like to congratulate Fresno State. I think they'll be
terrific representation. I've said this all week long, I think that the top
three teams in our league not only could get in but they could get in and they
could win.  
So we wish them the best of luck as they head out into the NCAA tournament.  
We picked a bad time to have a bad time. I think Fresno State had an awful lot
to do with that. We're very much a physical rep team. We work really hard to
try to do things the way we want to do 'em. And we just, out of the gate, even
though we had a lead, it was very much not San Diego State basketball, it was
more Fresno basketball, matching baskets, up and down the floor.  
I say that because it was more an offensive game going both directions. We
really didn't have our normal sense of defensive presence, and frankly, really
didn't follow many of the rules that we had aspired to going into the game.  
We usually start and finish halves really well. That's been a trademark of our
team. And obviously what happened to us at the end of the first half, which
was just an end result of our lack of defensive composure the majority of the
half, really hurt us.  
With that said, I couldn't be prouder of the five seniors that we have on our
team, our entire team. The effort that we showed. You know, at halftime it's
more a matter of, all you can do is two at a time, play as hard as you can,
shots and stops, shots and stops. I thought we played our guts out to put
ourselves in a position to win the game.  
I would hope, although I'm old enough to know better, that our body of work
and what this team has accomplished from January 10th until this point will at
least have some value come Monday afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Courtney, you got off to a fast start, then things changed. What was it
that Fresno State did that maybe caught you off guard?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: Well, to credit Fresno State, they didn't miss a shot. I
don't think that they missed. When they had an opportunity to knock down an
open shot, they took the opportunity. All the credit goes to them.  
They found the flaws in our defense and they did what they had to do.  
  
Q. Obviously this is a surprising result after all that you've accomplished.
If you could put it into words right now.  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: Well, uhm, how do you answer a question like that?  
It is disappointing that we lost, but I think we can be proud of the fact that
we fought back. We didn't give up. We did everything that we felt that we
could to try to get back in the game. We didn't just let them just win the
game outright by 20.  
I think our young kids showed a lot of fight. Desi, Erimma, Kiyana ‑ she's not
very young. I think that just goes to show you what kind of team that we have.  
If we do get the opportunity to get into the NCAA tournament, this is just a
lesson learned. You know, better to lose today than if we get the opportunity
to lose in the first round.  
All we can do is learn from this and hopefully get the opportunity next week
and take it from there.  
  
Q. Chelsea, can you make an argument for you guys to get in based on your
whole body of work?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Most definitely. I think what we've done these last couple
months is just really special. Not too many teams could say they were on a
17‑game winning streak.  
Credit to the teams in the Mountain West. I feel like in our defense it's hard
to beat the same team over and over again.  
Fresno State was excellent tonight. They made more plays, that's why they
ended up winning the game. Like Courtney said, we never gave up. Third time
playing Fresno. We've done great up until this point. I think the NCAA should
take that into account.  
We played good teams. Even teams we lost to early in the season, we played
them competitively. I think that shows we belong in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Chelsea, there's obviously disappointment. I assume this redoubles your
resolve to get this out of your mind as quick as you can?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Most definitely. But it is what it is. At the end of the day,
I'm proud of my teammates, what we've been able to accomplish this season.  
Like Courtney said, hopefully there's bigger things to come for this team.
Monday night hopefully the Committee will select us. We can go from there. We
can't live in the past, dwell on this game.  
When we get to SanDiego, we're going to focus on what's ahead. We pray it's
the NCAA tournament. But you know what, if it's the NIT, we're going to take
that tournament by storm, too.  
  
Q. Courtney, was there ever any doubt you could overcome the deficit?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: Not at all. We're a defensive team. We know when you get
stops, you find ways to come back. There's no quit in this team. So nobody on
that team planned on quitting, whether we would have got down by 20 or 30 or
40.  
Unfortunately we weren't able to come back. But you can see that we didn't
quit. No matter what they did, we still tried to come back. We didn't come
back till the clock hit zero.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about composure at the end of the half. With a
senior ‑ladened team, did that surprise you a little bit? Did they get more
rattled than you thought they might have?  
COACH BURNS: Well, we have a lot of talented kids that do what they do well
when you put it together. But Chelsea's our Superman.  
You know, hindsight is 20/20. We can't win this game without her playing this
game. We'd been able to, even though we hadn't done much of anything we set
out to do, manage a game. And I thought for two minutes we could.  
But they're a good team. They're a good team. They're an aggressive team.
Credit goes to them. But you can't live backwards. You got to live forward.  
  
Q. You've been around for a long time so you'll be sweating the next 48
hours to some extent. If you didn't make the NCAAs, what would that do to
tarnish or not this season?  
COACH BURNS: Well, you know, you reflect most on what immediately happens,
right or wrong, because, trust me, when you're in the midst of it, the only
way you can accomplish it is just to hit the next game. You can't think of it
as how many in a row or by how many points or whatever.  
You know, I said on our initial day at our press conference, no one's happier
about our streak than Raegan Pebley and Joe Legerski, because short of an
opening loss at Boise for Wyoming, those two teams have been crushing
everybody by double‑figure points all season long. But because of the nature
of ours, first we lost, then we won, everybody made us out to be this giant
killer.  
I've said from the beginning that I thought all three of us beating each other
should have an opportunity to play.  
So I think Fresno is a really good team. I think there's no shame in losing to
Fresno. Today it hurts. Tomorrow it hurts. Monday we won't know. But we won't
reflect on the season till a couple weeks from now.  
This hurts. Conference tournaments, right or wrong ‑ really wrong ‑ are really
special. They're really special. Walking up that ladder is really special. I
say right or wrong, because it's a heck of a lot harder to go two months and
win games than it is three days.  
We started out a little bit sluggish. I thought Courtney played her tail off
with her ankle. The young kids came off the bench, gave us a spark. We'll
focus on the positive. But as competitors we can't feel joy tonight.  
  
Q. Have you ever seen a stranger stat sheet? It looks like you win this
game.  
COACH BURNS: We've had lots of games where‑‑ I know we've won a lot of games.
But we've had a lot of games where we might get out‑rebounded. The one thing
we consistently do is we take care of the basketball. We don't turn the ball
over.  
Like in any sport, whether you're shooting well, if you take care of the
basketball, even though tonight it looks like we took care of the basketball,
those miscues led to offense for Fresno when we already didn't guard well in
the first half.  
Numbers are overrated. The only one at the end of the day that counts is the
one on the left.  
Just like to thank everybody. Thank the Mountain West Conference. Thank the
people in Thomas& Mack. This has been a terrific experience for our
student‑athletes and I'm sure everybody else's. This has been a first‑class
operation and we're proud to be a part of it. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  63  
Wyoming  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State. Coach, some remarks on tonight's
game.  
COACH PEBLEY: Yeah, you know, Wyoming, our games with them during the season,
when we played up at their place, it felt like that tonight actually. It felt
like we were playing out in Laramie. This game felt more like the game in
Laramie than it did at home.  
But I thought we did a really good job just of trying to make Wyoming play our
game and adjust to us more. Their halfcourt offense is too good. We knew we
couldn't sit and guard it the whole game.  
So we had to get at 'em. We had to get creative. But really it's completely
about these two on my left and the girls in the locker room, the last play,
the whole game, the turnovers that they forced all come from their effort,
total commitment. They play hard for each other, so hard. It makes our job as
coaches pretty fun to watch.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ki ‑Ki, 9.6 seconds left, what was going through your head when you made
that shot?   
KI‑KI MOORE: I mean, one thing, my coaches and teammates first were giving me
the opportunity to take the big shot and just believing in me to take the big
shot.  
Without them giving me that chance, none of that out there would have been
possible, so...  
  
Q. Taylor, you got the pass from Bree inbounds. Were you trying to look for
Ki ‑Ki?   
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Well, we had a set play. So, yeah, I was trying to get it to
Ki‑Ki. So that was our plan. If that didn't work, then we were just going to
have to wing it.  
We have great players all across the board, so I knew someone was going to
make a big play.  
  
Q. How does experience and all that play into a situation like that, tight
game, been there, done that? Does that calm you in moments like that?  
KI‑KI MOORE: I think it does. I mean, just having people out there with
experience, not giving up, not putting their head down just because the other
team makes a big shot. Just believing that we're going to go back and get
another shot. So I believe it does.  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Some teams could have just let their head down. We were
excited in our huddle. We knew we were going to pull it through somehow. We
did.  
In the past we've had, you know, tight games like that. So it was good having
experience. But I'm just proud of all of our girls.  
  
Q. Ki ‑Ki, wondering what your reaction was once you saw the ball went
through the hoop?  
KI‑KI MOORE: I mean, I was excited. But it wasn't time to celebrate yet. There
was still another play they got the ball in. Knew had to defend. Couldn't
celebrate until the buzzer went off and the shot did not go in.  
My teammates just surrounded me and everyone was happy, just jumping on me. I
felt love from my teammates. Just getting the opportunity to take that shot
shows they love me and trust me a lot.  
  
Q. You had 31 steals through two games of the tournament. What has made your
pressure defense so effective?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: I think, you know, we're aggressive. At times we're really
feisty. I like that about our team. We trust each other. We know that we can
go for steals. If we don't happen to get it, someone's going to be behind our
back helping us.  
So, you know, trust is a big thing. So I think that's why we're allowed to get
up in people and just, you know, play.  
KI‑KI MOORE: I would just say wanting to play a fast pace. To play fast, we
kind of have to turn the other team over. We take a lot of chances trying to
get steals. We play well off of each other. If we know one person doesn't get
it, we're helping each other and having each other's back.  
  
Q. Grinding this tough win out, what does that do in preparation for
tomorrow's championship game for you guys?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Most definitely we're going to celebrate tonight's win. We're
going to rest, but we're going to enjoy that we won. We're just going to
prepare for SanDiego State like any other game.  
But we're going in for nothing less than a championship.  
  
Q. Fourth year in a row you have been in 'the' game. Any extra
butterflies?  
KI‑KI MOORE: I would say just exciting. It's just excitement to be a part of
this, in our first league, just to be part of a championship game. Everyone
has been looking forward to this game. But we've just been taking it one game
at a time knowing we have to get the other games done before we can get to the
championship.  
  
Q. Can you talk more about SanDiego State.  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: You know, they're going to be a tough team. They got great
players all across the board.  
But so do we. So, you know, we're just going to go in and play our game and
hopefully, you know, I think that will be enough, if we just go in and prepare
for them the way we know how. I think we'll win.  
KI‑KI MOORE: Same. I just think we do everything we've been doing. We don't
change anything. We just come in and prepare the same way we've been preparing
for every game we've played this tournament championship so far.  
  
Q. You led for most of the game. How did you keep from not getting
demoralized late when they took the lead and it looked like they won the
game?  
KI‑KI MOORE: You have to know that teams are going to go on runs. They have
good shooters, knock down big shots. Just keeping up, not giving up, putting
our head down. Knowing we're still in the game, fighting on every possession
of the game.  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: You don't have time to let down. I mean, if you do that, then
you're already beat.  
So we knew that they got on some runs throughout the game. That last shot when
they got up by one.  
You know what, I'm proud of our team. We could have let down, but we didn't.
We were excited. We were excited for the moment. We took it, so... We came out
with the win.  
  
Q. Does the way you lost to SanDiego State stick in the back of your head
and give you added incentive to beat them this time?  
KI‑KI MOORE: I would say so. Just doing what we doing, just knowing what they
did to us last time, what we did to them the first game to start off the
conference. Everyone has something to look back on. I would say it helps us a
lot.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Pebley.  
  
Q. The players say they were excited for the opportunity. What was going
through your mind when you were down and had one last play?  
COACH PEBLEY: Uhm, I had kind of in my head as they had the ball, before they
took the lead, Okay, if they hit this, we're down two, whatever the situation
is, you're running through those things in your head as a coach.  
I consider myself still a young coach, even though I've got some years under
my belt. Every single day seems to age me more.  
But I practice this stuff. I ask our players to practice. I sit in my little
hotel room, down one, you practice those things. But in the end I knew we had
players ‑ didn't matter what I drew up ‑ we have players that wanted to win
this game. They were playing for each other. They were playing for more than
just themselves as individuals. And we trusted them.  
We practiced these situations in practice. You don't want to go to something
that they've never seen before. So we put the ball in the hands of somebody
that we trusted and put around her people she knew where they were going to be
at, and there were multiple options for that score.  
  
Q. For you to get this win, to come from behind, what does that do to
prepare you for tomorrow?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, I think it's a situation that we can build confidence
from. You never know when that situation's going to bring itself or happen
again. So all of these experiences add to their leadership and their
experience.  
But, you know, I've seen Fresno State many years be in conference tournaments
and win games in all different types of situations. I've seen them against our
former team at Utah State down 21, come back and win a game, beat us. Seen
them against Louisiana Tech in tight, close games. Bree Farley hitting an
amazing shot, a running layup on the right side.  
So this team, we just needed to put them in a situation to be successful and
they were going to find success.  
  
Q. In the regular series, you were the only blemish SanDiego State had in
conference play. Does that add any confidence for you?  
COACH PEBLEY: I think so. That was our first game in the Mountain West. That
was a huge, pivotal moment for our season. I think it helped us and really was
a catalyst for more success.  
But, you know, they came and kicked our trash in Fresno. That was a humbling
moment for our team, a learning moment. But I think we're a good team. I think
they're a good team. It's really hard to beat good teams three times.  
So this is just a great matchup for the conference, for the fans. I think
ideally you want 1 and 2 in the championship game.  
  
Q. Wyoming talked about you being able to have all these shooting options
with Taylor, Ki ‑Ki and Bree. For yourself, are you satisfied with all the
options that you have proven you've had?  
COACH PEBLEY: Yeah. You know, this was a game we had to win and win it without
really filling it up from the three‑point line. That just I think showed some
diversity to our offense, how we can score.  
We can absolutely win games from the three‑point line. I've always tried to
build our teams where we're not predictable, we're hard to prepare for. That
we can adjust to another team as much as they adjust to us.  
So SanDiego State is going to get physical with us. They're a very, very good
defensive team. I think they're averaging giving up only 49 points a game.
That's tremendous.  
So we've got a huge challenge tomorrow.  
  
Q. You touched on this is going to be the third matchup of the two teams.
Does that change the strategy going into the game tomorrow?  
COACH PEBLEY: Again, there's always tweaks and strategy changes. I've said it
before, and I mean it, no matter what kind of scheme we draw up, what kind of
scheme Beth draws up, it's going to be the players out there that have to and
get to perform.  
It's not just that game winner that Ki‑Ki hits. But being in a championship
game, opening tip, playing those 40‑plus minutes is what they prepare all
season for.  
  
Q. Getting back to Wyoming. It looked midway through the first half when you
went on the 10 ‑1 run, forcing turnovers, looked like you were going to pull
away. What were you able to do early to get that lead and what did they do to
get back in the game?  
COACH PEBLEY: We were able to get out on them quick, like you said, force some
turnovers, get out into transition.  
We talked about, in preparing for this game, last night's Wyoming game against
Colorado State is a perfect example, a team that shoots the three, no lead is
safe. Your lead's not safe and their lead's not safe.  
So Kayla Woodward came out and she hit 4‑6 in the first half from the
three‑point line. That's what I think helped them get back into the game. They
found ways to get her touches. We lost our assignment a few times, and she had
uncontested shots.  
  
Q. As a coach are you able to enjoy this win or are you thinking about
tomorrow?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, yeah. I mean, Taylor and Ki‑Ki I think did a great job. My
mind's racing, thinking about SanDiego State.  
But we came into this tournament with scouting reports and game plans ready
for every team. We're going to enjoy the moment, but really let the girls
enjoy it longer than we will as a coaching staff. We'll lock ourselves up in
our hospitality suite and go to work.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH PEBLEY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  63  
Wyoming  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming. Coach, your comments on tonight's
game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: There were times tonight where, once again, this group showed
their resiliency to keep fighting back, being down eight, ten points, even
with four minutes to go. We talked about being down six and you need to
believe.  
They came out and played at a very high level, gave themselves a chance.
That's all you can ask as a coach.  
Last night in the game against Colorado State, we made one play and had the
ball bounce our way. Tonight you give credit to Fresno State. They made one
more play and we just came up so very short.  
Very close, but it comes down to a number of execution plays and that you have
to make sure that each and every one makes a difference, whether it's in the
first minute of the game or the last minute of the game.  
But I'm very proud of this team, what they've been able to accomplish, and how
they continue to battle throughout a 40‑minute basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about your basket, your last basket. Was that play
designed for you?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: No. It was just whoever was open. But, you know, I knew we
needed a basket, so... Just tried to be aggressive.  
  
Q. Chaundra, can you take us through the last defensive sequence. Did you
have the feeling they were going to Moore in that situation?  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: Moore is their leading scorer. She's proven she's dependable
in tight situations like that. You knew they were going to go to her.  
She got by Kaitlyn. The defense didn't quite rotate just right and she was
able to hit a really nice shot.  
You've got to give it to her. She didn't hesitate.  
  
Q. You had 21 turnovers. Looked like you handled the press well and at times
you didn't. What was the difference when you struggled with it a little bit?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I just think we found the open person well. We didn't freak
out. I don't know, when we make the right cuts, you know, it helps our
teammates so much more instead of just looking for a brown jersey.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it is they do that makes it so tough with their
press.  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I think what makes them tough is they're so long with their
height. It's hard to pass around.  
  
Q. Chaundra, a little bit of a slow start, but a nice finish. What do they
do defensively inside that gives you trouble inside.  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: Like Kayla said, they're long. Alex Sheedy, Rosie Moult,
they're big, strong players inside. It makes it difficult to get in a good
position a lot of times.  
  
Q. Felt like you were playing from behind the whole game. How taxing is
that?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: Well, we're always going to fight. I mean, it does take a
little more energy, you know, a little more emotion. But we're always going to
fight till the very end.  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: I think in a game like this, the whole‑‑ we always talk about
winning four‑minute segments. Just to focus on those four‑minute segments when
you're down, it really helps. It doesn't seem quite as tough, that you're
fighting from so far behind.  
  
Q. I know this is disappointing, but there will be post ‑season for you
guys. Are you looking forward to that or is that hard to think about right
now?   
KAYLA WOODWARD: I just think it's pretty easy to think about. We've just got
to keep our heads up and know we've got some more games going so... We've just
got to be the team we are.  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: For me personally, being a senior, it's a little more
comforting. It's hard to lose and come so close.  
But I know in a matter of week we'll be back in Laramie with all our fans
cheering for us. It adds a little more excitement.  
  
Q. Kayla, what was going through your mind when you were taking the last
shot as far as the time left in the end of the game?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I don't know. We just needed a basket. That's all that was
going through my head. There was an open lane, so I just took it.  
  
Q. The shot clock, was that also in your mind?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: Yeah, a little bit. We had to get a shot off. I mean, drive
down the lane and hope it goes in.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. You said last night that if it came down to it, you wanted Kayla taking
the pivotal shot. That played out this evening. The trust you have in here in
those high ‑pressure situations, how you've seen her grow in her short time
here so far.   
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, Kayla is someone who works so hard on scoring in the
summertime. It's been well‑documented through our media back in Wyoming that
she'll make 15,000 to 20,000 shots in a summer ‑ not shoot 'em, make 'em. With
that kind of effort, you have a great deal of confidence in a young person.  
When we ran the out‑of‑bounds play, we knew the ball was going to go to
Chaundra or Kayla, and I have a great deal of trust in both players.  
  
Q. I talked to the players about the turnovers. At times it looked like you
handled the press well, at times you didn't. What did you do well when you
handled the press well and where did you struggle?  
COACH LEGERSKI: The biggest thing is they change their press up. You'll see a
diamond press, you'll see a box press, you'll see them run and jump in their
man. It gets a little difficult each and every time because you want to attack
it differently.  
So it relies a great deal of recognition from the players. I'm trying to help
them out from the bench. Once again, we have to execute.  
We knew going into this game if we could turn it over somewhere between 15 and
20 times we would have a good night. We turned it over 21. That's where I get
talking about, you know, it's one possession, whether it's in the first minute
of the first half or the last minute, it becomes very important each and every
possession.  
  
Q. Your last defensive possession. A player like Moore is hard to figure out
what she's going to do. What did you see?  
COACH LEGERSKI: The biggest thing is they have more than one option
offensively. You're worried about Moore getting to the basket. You have
Thompson that can get to the basket. You know Moult and Farley can shoot the
ball extremely well from three.  
So we talked about going out and trying to switch all screens, trying to keep
everybody in front of us, and then rebound.  
I give Moore credit. She made a big play. That's why she's a first‑team
all‑conference player. I talk about Kayla Woodward, how she plays, how
Chaundra plays. Moore does the same thing for Fresno State.  
Big‑time players make big‑time plays.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Chelan Landry today.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Chelan has great quickness and has really worked hard at her
game of getting to the basket. A great competitor. When she was stepping up,
we inserted her into the game just for that reason. She can make plays.  
Just before I called the timeout, she made another play to get the ball to
Ashley that was open. We're pleased to see the development of Chelan. That's
what we hope players do in the program. She really stepped up and has played
very well for us.  
  
Q. I know you had all five starters returning this season. Could you fathom
a season, 24 wins, doubling the win total from last year, what this team kind
of emerged as this year?  
COACH LEGERSKI: That's what I talked to them about. The good news and bad
news. The good news is you have everybody back. We had to turn things around
and get back to winning again. The players all bought in. They came out, put
their differences aside, put last year in the rearview mirror, so to speak,
and just came out and tried to do everything they could, and bought in once
again to this group.  
I think our sophomore class really improved in a year's time and we had great
senior leadership. When you have that, you start seeing 24 wins. That's
something I'm very proud of for this team. It's something they'll always
remember.  
  
Q. Talk about post ‑season now, your thoughts. Do you feel it's the NIT now
or do you still have NCAA hopes at this point?   
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, we talked about when you come here to Las Vegas for
the tournament, you need to think in terms of winning it.  
As a No.3 seed, that's not the easiest thing. You'd have been looking at
playing Fresno State and then our No.1 team, SanDiego State, who I feel is in
the tournament.  
For the rest of us, you have to be able to be here on Saturday and win. We
came up short and we'll see what the Selection Committee does.  
You get 24 wins, hopefully you're playing somewhere. But that's in the hands
of other people.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  67  
New Mexico  39

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. Coach, some comments on today's
game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Sure. I'd like to congratulate SanDiego State and Coach Burns
not only for tonight's game obviously, but for an outstanding season. She
represents our league very well. She'll represent our league very well in the
NCAA tournament.  
Her team is exceptional. They show you what championship teams do. That's a
very good team. We had to play our best. They took us out of a lot of what we
wanted to do. I just wanted to congratulate them.  
That being said, I'm really proud of our kids. They battled till the end. It's
tough. You start off 12‑0\. They continue to battle and continue to fight.
That's what I expect from them and that's what they do.  
I'm proud of my seniors, those four kids. They're not kids anymore, but
they've represented our program and our university with class, with integrity.
They're ambassadors to our program. They will not be forgotten.  
It's one of those things, tough game for us, but we'll get better. We'll work
in the off‑season and hopefully we'll be back here and maybe the next game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about that 12 ‑0 run and how hard it was to come right out of the
gates and have them dictate so early on.   
CAROLINE DURBIN: Yeah, they're really good at jumping on you early. I think
they did the same thing against Nevada yesterday. They did it by getting out
and running. They have everyone sprinting the floor as hard as they can.
That's tough to guard. And they find each other really well.  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I also would agree. I think it was really hard for us
because it kind of caught us by surprise when they came out and they just went
on a 12‑0 run, but...  
  
Q. Did they show anything different for you this third time or the same as
the first two games?  
CAROLINE DURBIN: Pretty much the same thing. Pressure defense. Very good
defense. They help well. They guard the drive, as well. I mean, their defense
is pretty phenomenal.  
Offensively they ran pretty much the same things as well as just getting out
in transition. They're really good at that.  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: The only thing that I would say was different than last
time we played them was they hedged really high on ball screens. That was a
tough transition for us.  
  
Q. As a senior, talk a little bit about this season, but also the whole
career.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: It's not what I expected, the coaching change and everything.
But I've really loved having Coach Sanchez. She really gave me a lot of
opportunities. So I'll always be grateful for that.  
That's about it. (Tearing up).  
  
Q. Can you talk about the senior class that's leaving, those still on the
team?  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: Coming in as a freshman, our senior class definitely
personally helped me a lot, taught me a lot of things.  
It's going to be really hard losing Caroline, Jourdan, Chin and Jayme. When I
go out there, I want to play like Jourdan, do something like Caroline. It's
going to be really hard for me next year not to have them around.  
  
Q. Caroline, can you talk about the transition between coaches. Seemed like
you as the seniors were really leaned on by the staff to help with that
transition.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: Yeah, last year especially those seniors, we relied on them a
lot. They kind of showed us the way, how to lead this year's team. They were a
great example for us.  
We had a much different team this year, a lot more depth.  
But, again, I think those seniors last year showed us kind of how to lead, get
everyone onboard, do what Coach wanted, all the staff wanted us to do.  
  
Q. Talk about the foundation that you have been able to build under Coach
Sanchez, what you have to do next year to take it a little further.  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I definitely think this year has been a really good year
foundation‑wise with the freshmen that came in, who we still have for next
year.  
I think next year it's gonna be really tough obviously without our seniors,
but I think we have something to build off of, for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. Getting back to the start of the game, the 12 ‑0\. Was the way they did
it surprising in any way?  
COACH SANCHEZ: No, not really. That's the biggest thing we said, is they can't
get loose early. They're notorious for doing that. They jumped on us right
away. We were tentative on offense. We backed down a little bit, were on our
heels. Those are the things we talked about.  
That's what championship teams do, not necessarily on offense, they started it
with their defense. That's what they're known to do. It's very good, a very
daunting defense that they have. They guard you. They defend. They deny.  
When we got on our heels a little bit, then they started their transition. We
know they were capable of it. We wanted to prevent it early and we didn't.  
  
Q. The size obviously was apparent. They were out ‑rebounding, points all
coming on layups early on. Can you talk about their size advantage.   
COACH SANCHEZ: Well, we just didn't box out. The first play of the game was
very indicative. The big kid shoots, misses, we don't box her out, she gets
her own rebound and puts it back again.  
They do have a little bit of a size advantage with a big kid. You got to get
back to fundamentals and boxing out. That's what hurt us early, in my opinion.
We didn't box out the first shooter. They go back and they're so good. Even
the guards are good at getting their own rebounds because they pursue the ball
like crazy.  
If you look at the rebounding total, 32‑38, we had 15 O‑boards, they had 11. I
think we battled, and I'm proud of our kids for that. But you look at what
they did to us on our offensive end, their defensive end. We had to earn
everything. We were played on our heels. For a team like that, you can't do
it.  
  
Q. Seemed like you were able to slow them down when you were able to hold
them into the halfcourt offense. Was that not something you had tried to do at
the beginning?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Well, we did want to make it a halfcourt game. What sparks
transition is turnovers, which you can't give. We only had 13 turnovers.
That's not bad against a team like that.  
Shots that aren't really within the flow of your offense. If you don't take
good shots, you turn the ball over, that will spark a transition. That's what
happened in that run.  
We didn't take good shots early, and it led to some of their transition
baskets. When we got in a flow, in our halfcourt sets, started running some
things, we did it well. We cut it to 12 at one point in the first half. Our
runs were few and far between, then they turned up their defense.  
  
Q. Talking about the turnovers, that's one of the things you talked about
all season long, that contributed to a lot of the losses. Is it a positive
sign that you were able to hold down the turnovers against a team like
SanDiego State today?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Yeah, I think so. I really do. We've had 29 turnovers against
them. So they're a very good defensive team. 13 turnovers. You look at our
stat line, except for the field goal attempts and total, 11 for 54. Not 54,
but that 11 should be a halftime total. We were 11 for the game.  
So, again, you have to credit SanDiego State and their defense and their
schemes. It's nothing that you don't know. But once you still get into it,
it's easier said than done.  
Play with poise. Play with heart. I think our kids did that. But we had to
attack the basket early and take it at 'em. And we just didn't do that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your offense. You couldn't hit anything really. Why do
you think it was?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It was because of their defense (laughter).  
I mean, I can't say it enough. They took us out of everything that we wanted
to do. Their defense is terrific. We were on our heels a little bit in the
first part. They went on a 12‑0 run. We got drives to the basket, but we
looked at the defense instead of the rim.  
Again, you got to credit SanDiego State. It's what they do, and we know what
they do. But it's easier said than done, you know, to go out there and trying
to find a little bit of a bend in the armor. We did it in some spurts, but it
wasn't enough, and it was few and far between.  
  
Q. SanDiego State, I think their RPI today is 47. May fall after this game
even though they won. In the latest bracketology from ESPN, they're a 12 seed.
That would indicate if they don't win tomorrow, there's a chance they may not
get an at ‑large berth. Can you comment on that, whether or not they deserve
an at‑large berth?  
COACH SANCHEZ: If you don't get SanDiego State in at this point, it would be
an absolute travesty. It would be completely unfair to them. Their body of
work speaks for itself. They ran through the league. It's not their fault that
their RPI drops when they play teams of a lesser RPI. They're a very good
basketball team.  
They will prove it once they get to the tournament. If by chance they don't
win the championship, then I think our league should get two in.  
That would just be ridiculous. I can't fathom a fact that SanDiego State is
not in right now, regardless of what happens tomorrow. They deserve it. Their
program deserves it. Their staff deserves it.  
I know I've seen stranger things happen in my 24 years of coaching, but that
would not be the right thing to do.  
  
Q. Looking forward, how do you replace the senior leadership? What are some
of the building blocks you have that are coming back, coming into the program
with the incoming freshmen?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It's a good foundation that both classes, last year's class and
this year's class, have left us.  
Do you replace a Caroline Durbin? Probably not for a while. But it starts in
the off‑season. You can't get better individually during the season. That's
when your team progresses.  
It starts in the off‑season when we get to working individuals. We're limited
in time constraints what they can do. They've got to come in and do the extra
work. And this group will. The group that's coming back will do that.  
We have Khadijah Shumpert coming back, Jordyn Peacock, Bryce Owens, Sara
Halasz, Deeva Vaughn. I'm going to forget some people, but we've got a very
good core foundation. Ebony Walker, a transfer from Texas Tech will be
eligible next year in the post. Whitney Johnson is a freshman really that will
be back.  
With the incoming players and our freshmen, we're pretty excited about what
we're building. The standard again is set until somebody knocks SanDiego State
off. That's the bar and that's the standard. That's the level that we want to
get to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  67  
New Mexico  39

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State. Coach, if we could start off
with your remarks on today's game.  
COACH BURNS: First, again, we'd like to congratulate New Mexico on a great
season, great atmosphere yesterday and today. They have a lot of really,
really skilled pieces. Appreciate that we've had battles with them three times
over, and their young players are really going to be something and continue to
develop.  
For our team, you know, I really couldn't be prouder. What we do is hard to
do. I'm not self‑aggrandizing it. I'm saying it's just effort. Get down, get
in a stance, get after it. I think the way we've opened both games has been
really impressive to us.  
New Mexico has very good skill positions. If you allow them to run their
stuff, they really can be good. We know we have to give that extra effort to
disrupt what they want to do. I thought we did that just in spades early.  
We got a little bit of fatigue in the second half, which led to a little bit
too much fouling, a few more O‑boards than we would have liked. Overall I
couldn't be prouder of our effort.  
I thought Malia started the game great. When you're pressuring people, to have
someone that can erase things at the cup well helps us. Today Kiyana Stamps
was big off the bench. She's versatile, can play multiple positions. I thought
the lift she gave us was very impressive.  
Final comments, for those of you that were here yesterday, people wanted to
talk about Chelsea and her assists. Chelsea says she does what's required. We
were struggling a little bit offensively today. I thought you saw what she
does. We needed her to score a little bit more, and she did.  
Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsea, the general theme up here when New Mexico was at the podium was
that you guys have this knack of jumping on people early, setting the tone
right out of the gate. Is that easier said than done?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Definitely easier said than done. When you start the game,
you have to set the tone, the dynamic. That's what we live to do against every
opponent. We want them to feel our presence, we're going to set the tempo of
this game, we're going to maintain it. That's what we look to do every time we
go out on the court.  
  
Q. Malia, I want to talk about the defensive effort, you held New Mexico to
20% shooting from the floor. What was working for you on the defensive end?  
MALIA NAHINU: Well, we knew that this game would be a tough game, and we
needed to come out with energy. As Chelsea said, Coach Burns always instills
in us to come out and fight for what we want and come out strong in the first
five minutes and really play defensive.  
Our program is built on defense. We want to maintain that forever.  
COACH BURNS: Great answer there. That was an answer (smiling).  
  
Q. Chelsea, we've asked you this a zillion times. Do you feel like you're in
the NCAA tournament if you don't win tomorrow?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Well, we definitely don't want to leave any doubt in terms of
tomorrow's game. I feel like the body of work kind of speaks for itself. We're
on, what, like a 17‑game winning streak. Not that we really pay attention to
that kind of stuff. We work so hard. It's definitely been a goal of ours since
the beginning of the season.  
I think if we get the opportunity to get in, we could definitely turn some
heads. We have the opportunity to win a few games. Definitely think we can
compete with anybody in the country.  
I hope we get that opportunity, that chance. We're going to play it one game
at a time starting tomorrow. We're going to look for our shot.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Getting back to what I asked Chelsea a minute ago, when you jump out of
the gate the way you have the last two days, how much of an impact does that
have on just draining the morale out of teams?  
COACH BURNS: Obviously that's the plan. I think we have an experienced, older
team. They were so excited. Our practices Monday and Tuesday were, I was like,
Stop, stop, because our level of energy and excitement. You make them stay to
task, stay to task, they can finally get to the tournament, a chance to cut
down some nets.  
I steal everything I say. Somebody said it first. Our separation's in our
preparation. I have terrific assistant coaches who, as we speak, somebody's is
in a Wyoming room, somebody in a Fresno State room. We've been breaking them
down for the last three or four weeks. You can't overburden them. You have to
give them key things.  
You get confidence from great preparation. They trust in what they're being
told and then they do it and have success with it.  
With that said, you can't know. You can't know. You can come out with great
energy. Every 50/50 ball goes to the other team. I think we're confident. We
have quick hands. We've beaten people.  
If you're playing somebody for a third time, the first five minutes are extra
critical because we want to find a little doubt early. I think we've done a
really good job in both games of doing that.  
  
Q. I think these first two games you've held these two teams to 10 points
below what you did in conference play, 13 below what you did overall. Are you
maybe a little more impressed than even you thought you could be defensively
this far in the tournament?  
COACH BURNS: Ask me tomorrow. You play to win the game. I'll take Mark's
question before he asks it, but you play to win the game.  
I think for us, separation is important. How we win is important. I think our
team understands that.  
But more than anything, our team is not playing what's our RPI. They love to
play. It's fun to play. If we play great defense, take the ball off the
backboard, then I allow them to run. If they make a shot, then they have to
run one of my plays, which sometimes are offensive, so they'd rather be able
to run their own.  
When we take it off the glass, we're really good. I think they have fun
playing that way. That's really been more the difference. We have skilled
people and they have some experience playing together.  
I go back to January 9th when Fresno put 80 on us. I said in subsequent press
conferences, We'll never know. Coaches don't need wake‑up calls. We're always
awake and worried.  
Really, credit to Fresno. Probably my disappointment overall is that we should
get at least two and potentially three bids, because I'm telling you right
now, Fresno and Wyoming, they could win a game. They could win a game and get
in.  
I've been in this league a long time and I'm glad I am. Mountain West this
year is a lot better than Mountain West last year. We had three 20‑game
winners. New Mexico has a win over Texas Tech who I'm told is already in the
tournament. We schedule ourselves to put in position to protect ourselves so
we wouldn't have to win three in a row.  
I think the things, like we've had double‑digit leads, we've never trailed in
these games. I'm looking at notes because I never know these facts things.
We've had big margins of victories against quality teams. It has got to help
us.  
You all know when I'm immersed in this, I have no idea what's happening in the
conference tournaments nationwide. Bottom line is if you don't walk in the
front door, there's a lot of upsets, sometimes your heart gets broken. We'll
do the best that we can to not be in that position.  
But I really think we have more than one team in the Mountain West that could
get in and could win. If anybody's listening, anybody, I think that could
happen.  
  
Q. Back to the margin of victory. How much have those kind of games helped
your second ‑line players? What have you made of them so far in the
tournament?  
COACH BURNS: I think, too, getting healthier. Desi (phonetic) and Kiyana
didn't start the season. As they get healthy and play, they really are capable
of playing starter minutes.  
I think we're in a situation where we've got to play to win and we've got to
play the people who are ready to play to win. I think more than anything, when
you're allowed to have separation, kids can get in and get some experience
because they can make a mistake and it's not going to be crucial.  
  
Q. They talked about hedging the ball screens higher. Is that something that
you tweaked or something you did better?  
COACH BURNS: Well, again, they can shoot it. Look at when they played teams in
our league that are more zone teams. They can really shoot the ball.  
I think we've gotten better at it. This is where we've really gotten better.
At the beginning of the conference, I would say our team is going to guard
ball screens this way, and that was it. We had to do what we thought would be
most effective as a team.  
Now I can say, if it's Durbin, do this. If it's Halasz, do this. We couldn't
have done that two months ago. And now I think if they allow our staff to do
the work to give them the nuances of what they're good at, we're savvy enough
and experienced enough, with very little breakdown, we're literally guarding
ball screens different ways depending on who's the guy with the ball.  
Like this last eight, nine, ten games of the stretch have been really big for
us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2013

  

### [Kathy Olivier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19395)

### [Kelli Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23327)

### [Rejane Verin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25000)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  72  
UNLV  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV. Coach, just some general comments on
today's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I thought we did a great job the first five or six
minutes. We came out. We were ready to play. We had great energy. We were
moving the ball, working together, defensively really got after it, got some
easy baskets.  
We hit a little lull there in the first half. They jumped up another level.
That's when they pretty much got control of the game.  
I thought Réjane was amazing in the first half, did so many positive things on
the floor. Kelli Thompson did a great job getting her teammates involved.  
But, again, New Mexico, you got to give it up to New Mexico, they did a really
good job defensively on the Mountain West leading scorer. Just kind of made
her life miserable today. Double‑teamed and switched off a lot.  
When you have really eight healthy players, it gets rough when you're going
eight against, I don't know how many they have, like 12. But I thought our
team showed a lot of character and a lot of fight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Réjane, looked like they really collapsed on you after that early start
by you. How frustrating was that? And, Kelli, did you feel like once they took
Réjane out of the game you had to press and do more things?  
RÉJANE VÉRIN: Uhm, it wasn't frustrating because obviously if they all on me,
somebody is open. Somebody else has to step up.  
You know, I just had to keep playing, don't worry about the defense I guess.  
But, you know, Kelli has nice shots. It was a good thing obviously they was
collapsing on me, because Dani was open, Kelli was open, Amie got some good
baskets so...It was a team effort.  
KELLI THOMPSON: 'Frustrating' is an understatement for me. Great defense,
that's all you can say. I didn't have a clean anything. When I tied my shoes,
she bent down with me.  
The young ones stepped up. This kid had 19 and 9. What freshman do you know
gets double‑teamed and ends up with 19 and 9? Amie played awesome, Rmanii
played awesome, Danielle took over when she needed to take over and played
awesome.  
As much as I had a bad game, the young ones stepped up just like they've done
all year. They played their tails off and that's all I can ask for.  
  
Q. Kelli, obviously emotional. Talk about what's going through your mind
knowing it's your last game.  
KELLI THOMPSON: I told the young ones, Season starts tomorrow for them.
Wherever I go is wherever I go, if it's WNBA, overseas, wherever my journey
may take me, I told them, Be ready for next year. With Mia Bell healthy, with
Alana healthy, with Briana healthy, with Ali eligible because she's a
transfer, these kids are going to be amazing.  
They work hard, and I feel like we just reached our peak. When we played New
Mexico the second time at the Pit, that's when we finally started gelling. It
sucks that it was so late in the year. But they're not kids anymore. You can't
use youth as an excuse anymore.  
Myself, I'm ready for them. Like I told them, get it done and I'll be here for
the tournament next year. I gave UNLV my everything. I stayed loyal to my
school. Once a Rebel, always a Rebel in my eyes.  
  
Q. Two years in a row, you're the higher seed.  
KELLI THOMPSON: I mean, it's hard to beat any team three times in a row. You
could be the Lakers for all I care.  
You play the first one and fix what happened for the second one. You play the
second one, fix what happened for the third. That's what they did.  
Coach was telling me their press release was if they stop me, they'd be better
off. That's what they did.  
Like I said, the young ones stepped up when they needed to step up, but it
wasn't enough. Hats off to New Mexico and their defense tonight.  
  
Q. How frustrating or strange is it to play in basically your own building
and have that kind of support for the opposing team?  
KELLI THOMPSON: Strange? I wouldn't say strange. That's what they do. I'm
pretty sure if they played in Alaska, they'd have 4,000 or 5,000 people there.
They're a great fan base. This is the Pit West.  
Loyal fans are everything. When you have a crowd like that, it gives you that
energy boost. I'm not saying we didn't have that energy. They're the Lobos.
That's what they do.  
  
Q. I understand you play normally in the Pavilion as opposed to Thomas &
Mack. Was that strange for you guys?   
KELLI THOMPSON: No. As much as it's home, it's not. We need to get into
tournament mode. Pretend that we traveled, pretend that we traveled somewhere
so we have that extra umph.  
I feel like when you say we have home‑court advantage, we are kind of lax and
play like this is our home.  
I wish we would have gave it that much more energy or got into tournament mode
faster. Just how the ball rolls.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Olivier.  
  
Q. Looked like after Réjane had that incredible start, they collapsed on
her. Do you think that put extra pressure on the other players? Kelli started
pressing. Never seemed to get in rhythm. Do you think that was really the
key?  
COACH OLIVIER: I thought they definitely picked it up defensively. I didn't
really see much of a double. I thought they just got really physical with
Réjane, then they were switching off every time.  
We like to set a lot of on‑ball screens. They switched off every time for
Kelli. When you do that, you have to move the ball. We tended to dribble a
lot. I think we're a better basketball team when we move the ball.  
Kelli Thompson has had an incredible career here. Four years of nothing but
relentless hard work. Again, like she said, hats off to New Mexico's D. They
had a good game plan. They did a job on the No.1 scorer in the conference.  
She's frustrated. I mean, she wasn't. She didn't get the looks that she likes
to get. She didn't get any clean ones. I think she had two or three clean
ones, she hit those.  
Tournament time, game is different. Gets more physical. I think Réjane had a
great freshman year. Got after it, was aggressive on the boards. We probably
should have maybe ran some more offenses for her.  
But New Mexico had that defense that kind of took us out of what we wanted to
do.  
  
Q. So was it mostly the defense denying the pass in to her?  
COACH OLIVIER: Yeah. That's what I saw. Again, I'm better after I watch the
film. But usually we do a lot of screen and rolls. Our guards find a way to
get our post players the ball.  
We didn't really do that today. I thought we looked to attack a little more.
We normally get to the free‑throw line a lot more than our opponents. When we
did get to the free‑throw line, we didn't make a high percentage.  
We've been shooting the ball so well from the free‑throw line, over 72% as a
team. Today, what were we final, 69% from the line. That hurts a team like us.
That's where we score.  
So they had a good game plan. Yvonne does a good job with this group. They
have more seniors than us, deeper than us. We swept them in conference.  
Come out here, first game of the conference tournament, it's rough, you know,
it's hard. They looked very comfortable. We got a little skittish when they
picked it up a level.  
  
Q. Your first year here you had that great run in the tournament. Ever since
then it's been frustration. Anything you can put your finger on? What do you
do as far as reversing that trend?  
COACH OLIVIER: Yeah, I mean, we talked about it all week in practice, just the
intensity level needs to go up. We had great leadership. Kelli was talking
about it all week.  
Again, I think we have a basketball team that they want it so bad. When you
want it so bad, sometimes you try to do too much. That's not what basketball
is about. It's a team game. So you got to make sure that you trust each other,
move the ball.  
When we do that, we're a much better team. We did that when we played them the
first time at the Pit. We didn't do it as much this time.  
Back to the drawing board. This is when it counts the most. Maybe we got to
put in some new things come tournament time. But we were down on numbers, so
we were fighting that whole thing. We talked about it as a staff.  
Really we were playing, what, six or seven players, you don't want to do too
much. You don't want to change things too much.  
Again, it's hard to take. Hopefully our team will use this for motivation over
the summer.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH OLIVIER: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  72  
Boise State  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State. Coach, some remarks on tonight's
game.  
COACH PEBLEY: Yeah, I mean, it was a great way for us to start the game. I
think it helped a lot that we were able to turn 'em over and hit some early
shots. We knew that was going to be important. Way to start both halves.  
I don't think we did as good of a job to open the second half, just knocking
down some shots that we created for ourselves.  
Boise has gone through and persevered through a lot all season. It's so
impressive to see how invested their team is through all the injuries they've
gone through. Just wanted to wish them the best of luck as they get their team
healed up in the off‑season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rosie, 29 turnovers you forced on Boise State. What does it mean to get
an opening win like this in the tournament?  
ROSIE MOULT: Obviously it's a good confidence booster for our team. Our main
objective today was to start out hard, be aggressive with our press. I think
them getting 29 turnovers was a result of our tough press.  
  
Q. Ki ‑Ki, another high‑scoring game today. What were they giving you?   
KI‑KI MOORE: I mean, we kind of just take what the defense gives us. A lot of
our teammates was driving and kicking. So them driving and kicking opened me
up a lot tonight.  
  
Q. Talking about the defense, 29 turnovers. It seems like they gave you a
lot. Can you talk more about what really led to that 31 ‑point lead.   
KI‑KI MOORE: I would just say our pressure and our pace. We wanted to play
pretty fast tonight to get them up and down with us.  
I think they got tired pretty fast. By us playing and pressuring them a lot, I
think it resulted in a lot of turnovers.  
  
Q. Rosie, this was a game where a lot of reserves got some playing time.
What did you really see from Robin and Jacinta today?  
ROSIE MOULT: Robin comes in and plays her role really well. She knocks down
her role. Jacinta was crashing the boards, which was important for us.  
  
Q. You have either Wyoming or Colorado State up next. What are you going to
focus on heading into tomorrow's game?  
ROSIE MOULT: The main focus will be on ourselves again. Doing things like
rebounding, boxing out, being good on defense will lead to good offense.  
  
Q. Rosie, could you have imagined getting off to a better start than you did
today?  
ROSIE MOULT: Obviously we got off to a really good start. We thought we would
start off well because we were aggressive. But to get the lead in the
beginning was really good.  
KI‑KI MOORE: I think our team was prepared for this game. We came in with a
chip on our shoulder knowing what we had to do and I believe we got it done.  
  
Q. How did you stay focused at halftime with such a big lead and keep the
intensity?  
KI‑KI MOORE: I mean, just coming in every half, you just have to know that the
team's never going to give up. We knew they were going to come back and fight
back. They fought till the end. I think we kept our intensity and our focus as
well.  
ROSIE MOULT: That's the same. Obviously you have to focus. Everyone playing in
this tournament, if you lose, you're out. Everyone's going to get after it. We
had to make sure we kept our intensity high, crashing the boards.  
  
Q. Can the two of you talk about the ball movement, the crisp passing,
knowing each other so well, the assists.  
ROSIE MOULT: I think offensively played really well tonight. We've got great
attackers on our team. When the defense tries to stop them, they're kicking
out. When they're pressuring on the outside, they can get to the basket. I
think it worked really well tonight.  
KI‑KI MOORE: I think we're at our best when we rotate the ball, everyone gets
a touch, and play inside out, so everything opens up, our tags, drives. Then
also just our three‑point shooting.  
  
Q. Coach, 26 ‑point lead down to 14 in the second. Were you worried about
game slippage there and how you deal with that in the future?  
COACH PEBLEY: A little bit. We had a pretty good idea how they were going to
get back into the game at that point. I just felt like where our offense was
aggressive, we needed to manage the clock a little bit better. We were able to
find and get quick shots, but not much time was coming off the clock, which
gave them even more possessions in that second half.  
So, you know, as you saw probably the last four and a half minutes we slowed
things down a little bit, were a little bit more deliberate. I think that
helped us really just try and get to their fatigue a little bit.  
But, you know, concerned? You're always concerned as a coach. I think even
with a 26‑point lead, we're only them hitting two threes away from this being
a game.  
But we've got great leaders, great defenders on the floor that were pretty
self‑motivated.  
  
Q. Was that the best you could play defense the first 10 minutes?  
COACH PEBLEY: I've seen us play consistent defense like that. I've also seen
us not play great defense. It's really, again, I think what these young women
commit themselves to.  
We've got a lot of different defensive schemes, different attacks. It doesn't
matter what we do, it's about them executing. You know, they do a great job
with it.  
We're going to play consistently great defense in this next game.  
  
Q. I know you didn't show it, were there any butterflies to start the
tournament?  
KI‑KI MOORE: Not with me. I mean, I feel like it's just excitement, just to
come out here, play the same teams we've played already, to know if you lose
it's like go home.  
So I just feel like it's excitement, play everyone, have everyone in the same
place at the same time.  
ROSIE MOULT: Yeah, there are a little bit of butterflies. To go into the
tournament you have to win three. We finished off the conference really well,
so I think there was more confidence going into it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Ki ‑Ki talked about having a chip on her shoulder. Were you guys happy
with the statement you made?   
COACH PEBLEY: We didn't talk about a statement. We just talked about winning,
survive and advance (laughter).  
We had a healthy amount of respect for Boise State. I definitely have a lot of
respect for Gordy. He's one of those coaches that I've competed against,
coached against for a long time, from back to our WAC days.  
As a young coach, I felt whenever I played against his teams, I really looked
at film, evaluated the decisions I made, I was going to get better as a coach.
He's a very, very good coach.  
Our focus was really about how do we get past Boise State first, not trying to
send a message to anybody else.  
  
Q. How do you get better for the next game?  
COACH PEBLEY: Rest. I think that's the number one thing. You don't change
anything. My philosophy, you don't change anything at this time of year.
They're playing instinctually. They worked really hard to learn the system,
incredibly hard at doing that.  
It's really about recovery, rest, making sure they're prepared for tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH PEBLEY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  60  
Colorado State  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming. Coach, some comments on tonight's
game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, I think this is everything you expect with Colorado
State/Wyoming, to step up and play at this level. I thought the intensity was
tremendous tonight. Colorado State got off to a great start, had us down 14 in
the second half. It was a situation where all we talk about all year long is
winning four minutes at a time. We talked about just getting back in the game
during those segments.  
Then when we tied it up, in fact, went ahead, we talked about we had one
four‑minute segment left, we've been here a number of times this year, it's
time to make some plays.  
Kayla Woodward executed a play, buried a big three, then Chelan Landry got to
the basket at the end. The player in between both of them, Kaitlyn Mileto,
ignited us in that run to be able to get back into the basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, talk about the mindset of the team down 14 with 14 minutes to
go.  
KAITLYN MILETO: We just talked about sticking together. Like Coach said,
taking it four minutes at a time. We didn't want to rush anything. We knew our
run would come eventually. We just kept fighting and pushing and our run came
and we ended up pulling it out.  
  
Q. Chelan, that layup, what was going through your head? How comfortable
were you it was going to go in?  
CHELAN LANDRY: Well, the play was drawn up for Kaitlyn Mileto. We were going
to bury them with a three. Their guard was guarding her.  
I had nothing to do, but I had stopped my dribble, I had to make the layup,
get it on the rim so our post could box out and get the rebound. That's what I
did.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, Marquelle Dent also came in and gave you a spark. How important
was it for the run you made?  
KAITLYN MILETO: It was huge. She distributes the ball well. I think that was
the biggest thing for her. She came in and distributed it and found the open
person.  
She definitely gave us that spark of finding the open player.  
  
Q. Chelan, did you know you were going up against Heimstra?  
CHELAN LANDRY: Yes. I told Ashley Sickles before we inbounded the ball, Make
sure she screened her, No.11. She screened her. I got around, was looking for
Kaitlyn for the draw‑in kick. I just scooped and made the layup.  
  
Q. Kayla, up ‑and‑down game. Talk about the last play Joe called for you.   
KAYLA WOODWARD: Well, that's just what the play is drawn up for. I just went
off that flare. Actually set a great screen. We just got to execute it.  
  
Q. When you were down 14 points, all of a sudden you get a couple baskets.
The crowd really pulled you through. How big a factor was having so many
Wyoming fans there on their feet pulling you through?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I just think they really get our momentum up. I don't know,
they always get us excited. We put a lot of emotion in there after they're
just screaming. It was like we're at our home court. They're awesome.  
  
Q. You have used the word 'special' a lot this year in describing this team.
Is there any more victory that signifies that term than what happened
tonight?  
KAITLYN MILETO: You know, we grind things out. I think that's what makes us
special, is that we are fighting till the end of every single game.  
I think going into the next game, we just have to continue to be on that same
roll, that same fight in us is still going to be there because we're that
team.  
We're special. That's what we're going to keep playing like.  
  
Q. You have relied a lot on Chaundra offensively. They did a good job of
keeping her down in points. How important was it for everybody else to step up
that little extra bit?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: Well, obviously Chaundra helps us so much. But when we have
other players that can step up and make shots, make some clutch plays, it's
great to be able to rely on everyone on the team.  
With her rebounds, of course we need those. She always contributes in a lot of
ways.  
  
Q. Chelan, it seemed like you were down by quite a bit. Seemed like you were
always confident. Can you take us into the psyche of the team as you were down
that much.  
CHELAN LANDRY: Yeah, I think we just keep‑‑ as long as we keep picking each
other up, we can beat any team anytime.  
The only person that's fighting us is ourselves. If we get down on ourselves,
we would have lost this game.  
We kept fighting and kept pushing and in the end we won.  
  
Q. What was the message at halftime in the locker room?  
CHELAN LANDRY: We just talked about knowing our scout, knowing our shooters,
knowing when to dig down for the point guards. Just knowing our role on the
team, like what we do best.  
Everybody was trying to help out in the post for our post players. We just
talked about the things that we were supposed to be doing, and we weren't
doing them in the first half. In the second half we picked it up.  
  
Q. You spent a lot of energy tonight. Is that a concern? In these
tournaments you play a lot of games pretty quick. What do you have to do to
make sure you have the proper level of energy heading into the next one?  
KAITLYN MILETO: I think it's about getting some good rest tonight and staying
focused. We're going to come out with the intensity we need because that's the
team we are.  
Just staying focused and making sure we get rest tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. Talk about your decision to go with Marquelle, how you feel she responded
to that situation.  
COACH LEGERSKI: What we know is we played three point guards all year, and
each and every one brings something different to the table. I thought at that
time when we were down that we needed some energy. We needed somebody that
could push the basketball, get it to the rim and make good decisions. And
that's Marquelle.  
I thought Marquelle gave us a great lift tonight. It's what we talk about each
and every night, that someone else is going to step up and help this group. I
thought Marquelle gave us as big a lift as anyone could have tonight with her
play.  
She got a little exhausted. We had to get her out. Then down towards the
stretch I knew we needed somebody with more experience in Chelan. Chelan
answered the call.  
  
Q. She did that against Seton Hall. Were you all right having the ball in
her hands in the last 30 seconds?  
COACH LEGERSKI: We drew it up that way. And we talked about getting the ball
to Chelan and then having her make a decision. They stayed on Kaitlyn. Now it
was up to Chelan because we knew we were short on the shot clock and she had
to get to the basket.  
Chelan has the ability to make that finger roll each and every time. She had a
couple rim out earlier in the game. I knew they could at least get to the rim,
and she was able to do that tonight. Fortunately the ball fell for us.  
Sometimes this game is about catching a break here or there, the ball falling
one way or the other. Chelan got the basket to go.  
  
Q. Your team was doing a good job of weathering the storm in the first
half.  
COACH LEGERSKI: It's one of the things we talk about all the time, is you just
keep fighting, you keep competing, and you wait for your opportunity to make a
run.  
You know, we made some mistakes defensively. To Colorado State's credit, they
made us pay for them. I thought they had a couple players really step up big
in the first half. At halftime what we talked about was getting back to our
game plan.  
I think the players wanted to win so bad, sometimes you forget about what the
plan is, just start running around. It looked like we were doing that at
times.  
As I say, to Colorado State's credit, they made us pay for those mistakes.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Kayla. She did some things that maybe were
uncharacteristic, but then comes in and hits one of the biggest shots of the
game. Talk about staying with her despite some troubles she had, how that paid
off for you when it was needed most.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Yeah, it's always interesting with Kayla that she plays at
such a high level. Tonight she shoots a tad under 50% from the field, she's
40% from three, grabs seven rebounds, and we're talking about maybe she wasn't
sharp (smiling). That shows how good Kayla Woodward is.  
What we've learned is Kayla is a prime time player. When you need a basket,
she's the one to go to. I have that much confidence in Kayla. You take a look
at what she was able to do. Boy, she responds each and every night out. I
can't say enough about her.  
But she did hit a big three in that last four‑minute stretch.  
  
Q. You talked about CSU's zone defense. They come out and play man ‑to‑man.
Was that something you were expecting? How much did that change the way you
would do things offensively?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, we talked about we knew something different was going to
happen. As to what, you never know. But with the game going on, we feel very
comfortable against a zone. They took us out of that comfort zone.  
They played extremely aggressive. They were able to have Heimstra just float.
She can block shots, get to the ball. At times it felt we were playing, say,
four on five. Then the point guards stepped up, Marquelle hit a shot, Chelan
hit a shot. They became very aggressive and that helped us out.  
We knew we'd see man at a time. But it was very difficult to compete against.
I give credit to the Colorado State staff and players because it was a
tremendous game tonight.  
  
Q. There's obviously been talk about your struggles in this tournament, yet
you find a way to come back and win. What does it say about this team's
makeup?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, I think when you take a look at tournament play, we
tried a little of everything here. Sometimes the pressure mounts greater on a
group of players that had nothing to do with past history.  
They understand how important it is to play well at this time. This group has
just hung together. This is the same team that had a losing record last
season. Now all of a sudden they got 24 victories on the board this year. They
started getting more and more confidence through November and December and
played extremely well.  
So you could just see there wasn't a lot of shake in 'em at the end. They
weren't going to fall apart.  
We talked about that we'll get a chance to get our run, we'll get this crowd
energized. We mentioned to them right now they're their own worst enemy. Come
back to play how we want to play, focus on what we're trying to get done, and
let's get this crowd into it. Sure enough, they were able to do that. Boy,
then you could see them respond.  
When I see Kaitlyn Mileto and she's got her arms raised in the air encouraging
our fans to yell, you know how they feel about our fan base.  
  
Q. Talk about the opportunity of taking momentum from this game into the
next one.  
COACH LEGERSKI: The big thing, Fresno State is very talented. We have a unique
situation in the Mountain West this year. We have two defending conference
champions.  
So with Fresno State returning everyone, I'll worry more not physically how
we're ready to play tomorrow, but emotionally. Not only did we win a
hard‑fought game tonight, but it was against your rival. We had to come back
in the last six minutes from 14 down.  
I don't want to be in that situation against Fresno tomorrow.  
As I told them, enjoy this one. The coaches will go to work here as soon as we
get out of here. We'll show up tomorrow. But it was a big victory tonight for
this group.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you, everybody.

### [Lauren Lenhardt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23340)

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
Fresno State  72  
Boise State  55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State. Coach, just some general remarks
on tonight's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: Obviously we struggled with the press. Probably good coaching
on their part. We knew with the matchup they would press us and obviously
we're struggling without a point guard. Had a hard time with that. We turned
it over.  
The room shrunk on us, after we turned it over, probably a little insecure, in
the first 10 minutes. After the 10‑minute mark, I thought we played a little
bit better. But we struggled certainly.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lauren, last game, your thoughts, what you're feeling right now.  
LAUREN LENHARDT: It's tough. You know, I knew we had talked after Senior Night
just about how it's an emotional time. I'm going to miss these coaches, these
players. It's been a good four years. I've loved every minute of it. It
definitely stung a little bit walking off that court.  
  
Q. You had seven blocks in the second half. Seemed like you were fired up to
end it on a good noted.  
LAUREN LENHARDT: Yeah, I was trying, doing my best. That was part of our game
plan, that I could sit back and help a little bit more. Their guards are fast.
They're penetrating. That was kind of my job, to sit back there and no layups,
is what coach said, so no layups they got.  
  
Q. Brandi, dug yourselves a little bit too much of a hole. You were more
competitive later in the game. Got yourselves way behind too much.  
BRANDI HENTON: Definitely. I don't believe you can win any big games starting
off in a big hole like that. Overall we did a good job of fighting and try to
come back. I applaud our effort.  
  
Q. Looking forward, losing Lauren, but returning quite a few people.  
BRANDI HENTON: Huge loss.  
We're excited about next year. Like Coach said, we have a lot of injuries
coming back. I think we are going to be solid. I know we're going to be solid.
Exciting.  
Just work on off‑season and get back to where we are now, but come out with a
win.  
COACH PRESNELL: We may be the only team in the country that has eight starters
coming back.  
  
Q. Brandi, you struggled with the press early on. Took time to figure it
out.  
BRANDI HENTON: Yeah, we know we can play with them definitely. We can't start
off like that. From the jump we knew they were going to be pressing. We just
didn't take it too well.  
Yeah, don't know really what happened. But we prepared all week. It's just
about executing.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Lauren's last game. Your emotions, but how she played tonight.  
COACH PRESNELL: Lauren tweaked her knee yesterday. She said if it blows out,
I'm still playing.  
I'm really proud of her. I'm proud to be part of her life, what she
represents, her value system, what she's done for Boise State and what Boise
State has done for her.  
It's a great match. A great four years. My only regret probably is what could
have been a little bit getting to play with her sidekick Kinzi, our post, and
the others that could have helped as well.  
She's just a great kid. She's got a bright future. She will do Boise State
proud in the future just like she has here.  
  
Q. Your thoughts going forward? Returning a lot of girls, only really losing
one.  
COACH PRESNELL: We feel good about the future. But it's hard right now to
figure out. We worked so hard on that dang press. How we could not get through
that, it's disappointing.  
My hat goes off to Fresno State. They did a good job. They attacked us at our
weak point. We turned it over 29 times. You're not going to win any game
turning over 29 times.  
We tried real hard defending perimeter shooters. They had 14 threes against us
at our place, and beat us. Tonight they were 6 for 26. That was a focus.  
It's disappointing. I'm really proud of our kids. I like 'em. I'm excited
about the future, that's for sure.  
  
Q. You dug yourselves quite a hole. Second half you did out ‑score them.   
COACH PRESNELL: One of the huddles we talked about the cheerleaders. Our
cheerleaders were great. If they're going to cheer for us down 31, we're going
to play with smiles on our faces and get after it. They motivated us on one of
the timeouts.  
I'm proud of our kids. They're a very seasoned team. They've got one of the
premier players in the whole west on their team. It's just one of those
things.  
But it will be a little while to get over the first 10 minutes. We worked so
hard to prepare for this.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  60  
Colorado State  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State. Coach, just some general
remarks on tonight's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought that was a good college basketball game. I thought
both teams were pretty gritty, pretty gutty. Nobody wanted to lose that game.  
I think you saw a lot of kids making winning plays on both ends of the floor.
Wyoming made some tough shots. Give them some credit. They had a great second
half. We put ourselves in position to beat the 3 seed and just came up a
little bit short.  
I'm really proud of my basketball team. They competed their tails off tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, even though you lost, was that one of the best games you have played
this year?  
SAM MARTIN: Yeah, I think a lot of people stepped up. We had a lot of people
scoring and everyone was hitting shots. We were getting the ball where we
wanted it to go. Felt like a real team out there.  
It's definitely probably one of the best games we played. We played hard. We
didn't want to lose, like Coach said that. I think it really showed. We really
put all of our heart out there and just came up a little short.  
  
Q. Meghan, offensively that first 20, 25 minutes was about the best you ever
played. Then you went into nine minutes without a basket. What was the
difference there?  
MEGHAN HEIMSTRA: I'm not really sure. I think we didn't finish around the
basket. Some of those finishes that we didn't finish transitioned into just
baskets for them. They were scoring pretty well in the second half.  
Just really important to take every possession seriously and make a basket. We
didn't transition as well. So I think that's what kind of caused it.  
  
Q. Seemed like they had a couple of fouls during the last possession. Do you
think them fouling you guys might have disrupted a little bit of the rhythm
you were trying to create?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No. We had a pretty open look. At the end the little high‑low,
it just shortened the clock. We still had eight seconds to execute. It was a
pretty quick action.  
I don't think so. I think our kids showed some pretty good poise all night in
almost every situation. They took the lead a couple different times and we
answered.  
I'm proud of how our kids answered and played with some poise down the
stretch. Even that last eight seconds. I think we got a pretty good touch.
Don't know if we caught it real clean and they dug a little bit, but...  
  
Q. Meghan, with all the Wyoming fans, did it almost feel like a road game?  
MEGHAN HEIMSTRA: No, I don't think so. They have really good fans. But we had
a good cheering section, too, with our students right there. We had some
really, really good fans as well.  
I thought it was pretty even.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defense, especially in the first half.  
MEGHAN HEIMSTRA: Yeah, I feel like that's kind of what we do. We are really
good defensively. We have a really good game plan. The coaches always get
something really good on the board. We execute pretty well. It's just kind of
more on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Sam, is it almost harder to end the season on a game you guys were this
close than if you had lost by 10 or is this the way you want to go out,
fighting with a chance to win?  
SAM MARTIN: That's a hard one. It's hard to go out on a loss like that. I
mean, none of us came in here thinking that this was our last game of the
season. We all believed we could do it. I think it did really show. We went
out and put everything we had on that court. We can leave knowing we did give
it everything we had. That's a good feeling.  
It hurts. I think I'm going to write 60‑58 above my mirror. That's motivation
for the next year. That's hard. But knowing we gave it everything we had makes
it a little easier.  
  
Q. What can you say about the way this team has grown during the course of
this season?  
SAM MARTIN: I think we've really come together as a team. We learned what the
coaches wanted. They got to know us better. I think we've come a long way from
the start of this season.  
We learned how to score, how to play together, how to stop teams and take away
their strengths. I'm really proud of my teammates. I think we did come a long
ways this year. It shows a lot about us.  
  
Q. Sam, first half, talk about LaDeyah and Alicia.  
SAM MARTIN: They both really stepped up. They had people digging into the
post. Both of them made them pay. They were huge for us. I think they really
gave us some momentum and got our team going offensively and defensively.  
They were very big parts of this game.  
  
Q. Meghan, only senior on this team. Talk about your career here at Colorado
State and what you see for the future of this program.  
MEGHAN HEIMSTRA: My career has been interesting, I could say. But this year
has definitely been the best year, not just 'cause I'm a senior, but with all
the changes and everything that's happened. It's very positive.  
I mean, as you can see, all we're doing is growing and improving, I mean, from
the start of the season till now. I'm excited to see how we're going to do
next year. If you look at how we finished now, we're going to keep climbing
and keep improving. It's going to be awesome.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. You had that nine ‑minute scoreless stretch. You built a 14‑point lead.
Then it was like all of a sudden nothing would go in for you. What was
happening there and how tough was that to endure?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought Wyoming, they picked up their pressure. They got
more physical in the post. That's obviously where we were going. We wanted to
own the interior tonight. First half we did.  
I think we still got some pretty good looks and some touches, we just didn't
convert. That's maybe been our Achilles' heel all year, just consistent
scoring. We seem to have those droughts often.  
But we kept competing. Wyoming, again, give them some credit, they made some
tough shots to get back in that game. When the momentum was obviously on their
side, all that brown and gold got up, our kids showed some poise. Again, I'm
really proud of that.  
I think maybe, Kelly, three weeks ago, we would have panicked, you wouldn't
have seen the poise and self‑control. We still made some nice plays and
answered.  
You can't go nine minutes. Wyoming is the leading scoring team in the league.
When you get that opportunity up 14, you still got to keep your foot on the
gas. Not that we took it off, but you have to score consistently against them.
Tough nine minutes obviously.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the final two plays from your perspective.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought we were open. I thought we were open. We could have
executed it maybe a little better.  
Landry's finish, she just got by us. She just got by us, made a nice finish.
I'm sure we'll look at film and think we maybe should have contained better
obviously there.  
Again, they made the shots. They got us on some inverts the last three or four
minutes. They flared Mileto, they flared Woodward. Those kids stuck some big
threes.  
But we went to our strength, which was the interior. Just needed to convert a
few more baskets.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on your first year here at CSU.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm proud of the growth. I'm really proud of the growth.
We told the kids in the locker room that we had a number of opportunities, if
you would have seen us play earlier, I think you would really know the growth
of this basketball team.  
We had a number of opportunities to maybe just kind of fade and get this thing
over with and move on. But what I'm so proud of 'em about is they just kept
grinding. They kept grinding, getting better, kept guarding, kept improving
offensively.  
So that shows some great character on our kids' part. We had some good
leadership. I thought our leadership was good late. I thought Meghan really
helped us grow as a basketball team. I mean, she got better the latter month
and a half. I think you saw our basketball team get tougher on both ends of
the floor.  
She went out like a senior should go out: performing well. It's not easy to be
a senior. It's easy to push the panic button, Oh, no, I got a few games left.
She made the most of every possession she played the last month and a half.
She can walk out of this arena really proud and we're really proud of her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  72  
UNLV  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. Coach, just some general comments
on today's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: First I'd like to congratulate UNLV and Kathy Olivier. She's
done a terrific job here. She really has. Her team was down a little bit, she
had some injuries. Trust me, we understand that. She's a terrific coach. She
does a great job with this program. I'd like to congratulate her and her
program for a solid year. They did a great job.  
Very proud of my kids. Very proud of my staff, who are excellent. It's not
easy guarding Kelli Thompson for 40 minutes and we did it by committee. They
did a terrific job. They went in there and played their hearts out. I'm so
proud of this group.  
We lived to see another day.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Down 19 ‑8 in the first half, what changed midway through the first half?
  
DEEVA VAUGHN: I feel that we came out more aggressive, as the aggressors. I
feel we didn't want it to be like the first couple games we played against
them. We just put our foot down basically and stopped them defensively. That's
when our offense came into play.  
  
Q. Second half it seemed like you guys had a little more aggressive drive to
the basket. Did they do something differently defensively or did you make a
shift at halftime?  
CAROLINE DURBIN: I think we wore them down a little bit. Like Coach said,
they're down with injuries. We have a pretty deep bench. We were able to wear
them down. We got rid of the jitters we had. We were able to be aggressive and
play our game.  
  
Q. You did this last year as an even lower seed against UNLV. Did you think
when you came back and took the lead that maybe you had the mental edge at
that point, UNLV would get tight?  
DEEVA VAUGHN: I feel like they definitely brought it up like with their
defense in the second half, were more aggressive, you know, towards us than
they were in the first half.  
But overall I feel like it was a really good game.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: We wanted to make sure, you know, we came back against them
last year late. They're capable of doing the same thing. We were able to hold
them off, though.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the variations you were able to give them on who
was scoring.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: Yeah, I mean, Antiesha showed why she's the Sixth Player of
the Year. She did great off the bench. Our offense was clicking. We were able
to find each other. Everybody was able to find each other. We just rolled from
there.  
DEEVA VAUGHN: Like Caroline said, I felt like we were in flow. Everyone says
that we do really good in the conference tournament. I feel like we did that a
lot today.  
  
Q. End of the first half, you hit two three ‑pointers to send it in the
halftime. Can you talk about what those two three‑pointers probably meant
momentum‑wise for this team.   
CAROLINE DURBIN: It was really great. I mean, it almost felt like the end of
the game. But we had a second half to come play. It just got us on a roll I
think for the second half. Gave people confidence to shoot, including myself.  
  
Q. What do you think was the key to stopping Kelli Thompson's game today?  
DEEVA VAUGHN: Definitely face guarding her, locking her down to make sure she
got limited touches, was not loose and able to just do what she wanted to do.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: I think switching off on her, and the posts were able to
guard her, which a lot of teams can't do. Our posts are really good defenders.  
I think for guards, all the breakdowns we do in practice, in guard work, that
really helped us to guard here.  
  
Q. Antiesha comes off the bench and scores 21 for you to lead the team. She
came in halfway through the season. Talk about what she brings differently to
the team.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: Tiesha is always coming in looking to make something happen,
to score, get steals, get rebounds. She's a great spark off the bench.  
Also gives us a good rotation at that 2 or 3 spot. We can keep rotating me,
Sara, Tiesh, even Jayme. It's a really good rotation for us at that spot.  
DEEVA VAUGHN: Based on her having to sit out a year, that's her drive, too, as
well. Sitting back having to watch us play, now she's stepping up saying, It's
our turn now.  
  
Q. You are both vets on the team. She seems to have the same stature on the
team as you do. Talk about that a little bit, having that kind of a teammate
that's that young.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: Yeah, I mean, she's been around our team last year, which I
think had some good leaders. She was able to learn from them. She has stepped
up this year, being someone that the younger players, the freshmen, even
others can look to her what to do during the game.  
DEEVA VAUGHN: Also this is like her first full year or half year of actually
playing DI basketball. I feel like this is our breakout, being able to play
and contribute to the team.  
  
Q. A lot of people have been calling this the Pit West. Can you talk about
the fans, how they were able to motivate you.  
DEEVA VAUGHN: They're amazing. Like I have been saying, this is like a home
away from home when they come and support us.  
I feel they do help us out tremendously just being there and just cheering us
on.  
CAROLINE DURBIN: I think a lot of them come out that maybe don't usually come
out even to the Pit during the regular season, some of the men's fans. To have
them come here and be able to watch some of our games is really great. It's a
great atmosphere.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. First half you have a 10 ‑minute stretch where you hold them without a
field goal after a good start for them. Can you talk about what switched at
19‑8?  
COACH SANCHEZ: We started out a little jittery. We took Kelli Thompson out.
That was our game plan. We were face guarding her. The person on her had no
help responsibilities.  
Their posts were getting loose, they got layups. It was a good start for them.
They did a nice job when she was gone. I kept telling our kids, Look, keep
running, run your offense, run the fast break, run and run 'em. Our plan was
to eventually wear them down.  
Right around that 10‑minute mark, the jitters were out. Deeva hit two
high‑post jump shots right away, got in the scoring column, got right back on
track. We were down two, tied for a little bit, up one, down one. Then we just
didn't look back.  
Our defense really stepped it up I thought when we locked down the post a
little bit better and they couldn't find Thompson.  
  
Q. Coming into this game, obviously you were facing a team that beat you
twice in the regular season. I know you had a lot of confidence coming into
this game. How does that work?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Selective memory (smiling).  
I mean, it's season three. Season three, it's a three‑game race. Even was zero
and zero in season three. This is how we started out.  
Yeah, you learn from it. We watched a lot of film. We make sure that we made
the adjustments we made that we didn't do in the second or first game. That's
what it's all about. It's really not about changing everything, but it's
tweaking a few things.  
The one thing that was obvious was we took out Thompson. She's been the silent
killer against us. She's a fantastic player, one of the best in our
conference. Conference leading scorer. She had 29 against us. Had the great
O‑board put back at our place. We fouled her.  
We just wanted to make somebody else beat us.  
Now, that being said, Vérin is a terrific freshman. They have great players,
they're going to be back for a while. We felt our adjustment was to take
Thompson out and try to just D up the other players.  
  
Q. How important were the two three ‑pointers at half?   
COACH SANCHEZ: There was a one‑ or two‑point advantage either team going into
that. Caroline got a little bit of room. We were a little bit stagnant on that
possession, if you remember. Caroline turned and faced, they gave her a little
room, and she hit a nice three. We go down and get a great defensive stand.  
We call our last play, it's about eight, nine seconds or less, we run it in
practice, they ran it to perfection. They did a very nice job.  
The key is the person throwing it in. Tiesh threw it in, found Bryce, and
Caroline got loose, hit two threes. It was a well‑executed play by our
players.  
  
Q. Towards the end they get that little bit of a rush on you guys, turning
it around maybe. You were able to get into the media timeout. What did you
tell the players at that point?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Just finish the game. They did a nice job on their inbound. We
went under the handoff and the kid hit a three. It was 57‑60\. It was a
three‑point game at that point. We had to finish the game.  
So you get 'em all in. The momentum is swinging a little bit. But I told them,
Look, all you need is a stop, go get a score, then a stop, O‑board putback,
then we're going to be shooting free throws.  
That has been our Achilles' heel, and we shot in the 80s, and I believe it was
84% from the free‑throw line. That was the difference. Traditionally we
haven't gotten to the line much, that was this year. I credit our players. 21
for 25 from the free‑throw line. I think that might have been the most free
throws we shot in a game. They did a great job of drawing fouls, O‑board
putbacks and finishing that. I thought that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. You mentioned taking out Kelli Thompson. You managed to take out Vérin on
top of that. How were your players able to handle both responsibilities so
well?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Vérin is very good. She got 19 and 9 on us. She finds a way.
Heck of a freshman. I think we have post players that match up a little bit
with her. We were able to maybe limit her touches a little bit, keep her off
the boards.  
When it was time for her to play, she played. Getting 19 and 9, I'm not sure
we neutralized her much. She's 7‑13, 5‑6 from the line. She's just a heck of a
player. Then not having the 1‑2 punch, I think that's what helped us.  
If you watch film, you've seen them a bunch, Thompson/Vérin, a good 1‑2 punch.
Miller will take a couple threes and hit 'em. The point guard will take a
couple threes and hit 'em. They're very good at that.  
We took the greater of two evils in Thompson. She's a heck of a player. I
think she'll be playing at the next level. We took our chance at that,
adjusted. Everyone else is one‑on‑one, we got to score more points.  
  
Q. Antiesha Brown comes in mid ‑season. She meshed really well with the team
immediately. Obviously tonight she was a big factor. How much of that is her
and how much is it just having the year under her belt playing with the girls
off the court?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Right, having the year really helped. When she transferred, she
transferred mid‑season. But she was with our kids all the time. She practiced
with our kids all the time. December couldn't have come soon enough for her.  
She's a terrific, high energy kid. She's a New Mexico kid. It's great to have
her on our side, it really is. Having two more years now, finishing this
season off, she's terrific.  
She brings a lot of spirit. She brings a lot of enthusiasm. Her defense was
terrific. Everybody will see the 21 points.  
But for the most part with her in there, her responsibility was to guard
Thompson. To be your leading scorer and guard the opponent's leading scorer is
not easy to do. She did a terrific job with us, as well as the rest of the
committee that switched off on her.  
  
Q. Talk about the opportunity to bring her to New Mexico.  
COACH SANCHEZ: It was a great opportunity because we recruited her early on.
She chose Tech. We got an opportunity to get her the second time around. She's
a terrific kid. She's a very good student. She brings all the intangibles.  
The opportunity she saw in New Mexico was as good for her as it was for us. We
had a need for her. She had a need to want to get on the court. It's just
worked out well for us.  
  
Q. The Pit West question for you and the fans.  
COACH SANCHEZ: I mean, this is my 13th year coming to the Mountain West
tournament. You get goosebumps every single time. I never get tired of it. I
never take it for granted. You never just say, Oh, ho‑hum, we have 5,000 fans.
It's just unbelievable. I get goosebumps with our fans. They are the most
loyal fans I believe, I mean, anywhere.  
You can't describe it. Being from New Mexico, watching the Lobos play my
entire life it seems like, especially on the men's side, there's nothing like
it. There's just absolutely nothing like it.  
Steve and I are very good friends. We're each other's biggest fans. I mean, I
love New Mexico. I love being part of this program. I mean, you couldn't drag
me away if you tried. You couldn't. It's a pride more than anything else. I'm
so fortunate. I thank God every day that I'm a part of this program.  
  
Q. You talked about the free throws earlier. You said you struggled at the
line all season. What was it like to get a performance like that?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It was terrific. That shows the grit of our kids. We shoot free
throws every day. We don't harp on, Don't miss, don't miss. It's muscle
memory. It's repetition. It's saying good things to yourself. It's being
positive.  
You got to continue to do that. You miss the first one, get off the line, say
good things to yourself. Basketball is such a quick game, you can't dwell on
what happened two seconds ago. They did a nice job of that. They were very,
very focused today. That has to continue for tomorrow's performance because
obviously SanDiego State is not too bad.  
But it's a good performance and it's a good focus for our kids.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup against SanDiego State. What do you have
to do to have a chance?  
COACH SANCHEZ: You know, we have to limit our turnovers. We can't let our
turnovers or even our shots create fast break opportunities for them. Hopkins
doesn't have to score, and she's about as good of a point guard as you'll see.
She started at Duke. Didn't work out there. Came to SanDiego State. She's
incredible.  
Clements is a great 1‑2 punch for them. Erimma is playing very, very well. So
are their other bigs.  
But, again, we got to get in there and be physical and be tough, take it at
'em, limit our mistakes and not play on our heels. There's no tomorrow.  
Our kids are excited to be part of this. Our kids are focused for the next
task at hand. It's not easy, but nothing good comes easy. We're going to get
there tomorrow and give it our best shot.  
  
Q. You said a couple weeks back it would have been nice to be at the Pit.
How satisfying was this victory?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Every victory is satisfying. Victories in this conference or in
this profession don't come easy. They just don't. We have great coaches. Kathy
is one of them in this league.  
Just to get a victory against a conference opponent, everyone is satisfied.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thank you, guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  67  
Nevada  39

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State. Coach, some remarks on today's
game.  
COACH BURNS: Well, first I'd like to congratulate Nevada not only on picking
up a tough win the other night where they played really well. I think they had
21 assisted baskets and scored 80, but I really appreciate the competitiveness
and spirit of their team and their leader in Coach Albright.  
They lost so many close games this year. They were in both games with us. I
just really respect their spirit. Mimi, I hope I don't say it wrong, Mungedi,
her development from January to now, to think of how young she is. All of us
up here know that Sharp is just a terrific player and scorer. They certainly
will be a force to be reckoned with.  
Was really pleased with us. One of the things, I think it's a little difficult
in some respects to play this game, to start this game. I asked our team to
see, you know, Are we going to show people if we're a No.1 seed? I think they
answered by the way we opened the game. Was just really proud of how hard we
guarded. Then it was almost like, Now what do we do?  
I think it was a bit of a challenge. We struggled a little bit to play with
the lead. I credit that to Nevada, their spirit coming back. But just couldn't
be prouder. I think everybody made big contributions. Saw a lot from a couple
of our young forwards off the bench to stem the tide when they went at us.  
Important to put this in the book and move on to whoever wins the next game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsea, can you talk coming out on that 19 ‑0 run, what the game plan
was, how well you executed that.   
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Well, I think our game plan was just to play fast. That's
pretty much when we're at our best, get a lot of transition points.  
I felt like early on we were really working the ball screen in the top of
their zone. They were rotating over and weren't getting backside help. It
opened up a lot of opportunities for our post.  
I felt like Emma, she did a great job just reading the gaps, playing off me in
the baseline, and it just resulted in some easy baskets for us.  
Definitely what we were looking for. We just wanted to be aggressive and it
worked in our favor.  
  
Q. Chelsea, assists don't always make headlines, regardless of who you are.
Players are looking to score. You seemed to be looking almost to pass first
every time you're down the court. Talk about that approach, how you take that
into a game.  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Well, honestly I pride myself on being a pass‑first point
guard. But I really pride myself on kind of doing whatever it takes to win.  
I felt like there were really easy opportunities for my teammates, so I'm not
going to force a shot when I could easily have a layup from Amarikwa or
Khristina Hunter that were ducking in early. I take whatever the defense gives
me. This time it was assists. Tomorrow it could be points. The day after it
could be rebounds.  
That's kind of how I play my game. I don't want to be one‑dimensional. I just
want to do whatever it takes to win. Assists was my game today. It worked out.
We ended up getting a great win against a great team.  
  
Q. Chelsea, were you aware of the school assist record? You came up a little
bit short, but at halftime you had a good shot at it.  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: No, I wasn't aware till I did radio after the game. But came
up a little bit short. But 14's kind of cool. I'm happy we got the win
overall. So I'll take it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Beth, coach was talking about that Chelsea had the 12 assists on 12
baskets in the first half. She said, I don't necessarily know how Beth gets
her to buy into that. Is it hard to take a player and have them be so
unselfish like that with the ball?  
COACH BURNS: Well, Beth didn't do anything to get her to buy in to do that. I
think she answered it best. The great ones are great when the level of
competition is the highest. I've said to this to her on many occasions. If it
came down to her last dollar, it was her and her mother, she would say I'm
sorry, Mom, but she would take that last dollar if she was competing. She is
one of the most competitive, in every facet of life, which is why she's
already in graduate school getting her MBA. She competes.  
She has a special gift. Everybody has different things they bring to the
table. She has a special gift, a vision that you can't teach, a level of
competitiveness, and she's been coached since she was this big by her dad Tony
to know if someone's got a better one, a great point guard will give it to
them and we'll all be better in the end. That's the way she plays.  
We made her score too much in a couple games. We forced her to. We started
watching her a little bit. She really worked on her game. She's shooting in
the mid 40s from three. She can do lots of things. But she understands to play
the game, and for teams to win games, you got to spread it around.  
So it never surprises me. I'm glad Mark just asked her that question to call
out the head coach for not knowing the records we're supposed to know at the
time for those. I don't know what the record is.  
I mean, she's gotten four triple‑doubles, ladies and gentlemen. I've been
doing this a long time. I've never known that to happen. Every time she gets
one, I'm like, Really? Because she does it every day. Her consistency is
probably her most remarkable trait, only behind her competitiveness.  
  
Q. It seems like coaches always the night before go through scenarios of how
the game is going to play out. Was there any better scenario in your head than
a 19 ‑0 run to start the game?  
COACH BURNS: I was about to call a wrap at the 13‑minute mark if we could have
done that.  
I mean, no. Every team, like this team, is best when they're aggressive. It
took us a long time to get us that aggressive on the defensive end of the
floor. If you take it off the glass, you can run. For us to finish and really
for us to start with Amarikwa making those first few baskets, that helps. I
think the tournament scenario for Chelsea, for Courtney Clements, they've been
here. They're going to be comfortable in this environment. I think that almost
relaxed our whole team.  
So I don't know if I could have had a better scenario, no. I would have no
problem whatsoever if we continued that start for the next couple.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Thank you, everybody.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  67  
Nevada  39

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada. Coach, a few comments about today's
game.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, just congratulations to SanDiego State. I think it's
pretty obvious that our arms are not quite long enough to box with them.
They're a championship‑caliber team. I'd call them a top‑25 team. Any team
that has two players in it that could be Player of the Year, plus some really
other nice players.  
They're kind of the exact opposite of our team. They have four fifth‑year
seniors and we have zero seniors. That means they're stronger physically. I
think you can look at the way they play. They've played a lot of minutes
together. We unfortunately have not logged that many minutes together.  
I thought that their pressure really took us out of any kind of execution that
we tried to do. You can look at our number of assists. The last time I was
sitting here we had 21 assists, and today we had 5 assists.  
Their point guard had 12 assists on 12 buckets in the first half. That's why
she's Player of the Year. She doesn't care if she scores. She just wants her
teammates to be better. She's as good a point guard as anybody you will see
anywhere. I don't know how Beth gets her to buy into that system, but
obviously it works. She just scores as an afterthought.  
I thought that Mimi got her first career double‑double today, that was a big
thing for us. We really are pleased with that. They really D'ed up on Danika,
physical bodies, hard for her to find the shots she found the other night.  
We as a team have to use these two better and to some things.  
The two big stats were, one, points off turnovers. What is that? 29. I should
put my glasses on. Maybe I don't want to see that. 29 points. So pretty much
that's from their pressure defense, and again, our inability to handle that.
They're a few pounds more at every position, stronger, and they're older.  
So now we'll give our kids some time off and see if we can come back and be
physically stronger next year because I believe mental strength comes with
that.  
Congratulations again to them. Last time I looked, their RPI was almost in the
20s, so we know they're a NCAA team. It's a mathematical equation. I think
they'll go deep in the tournament. There's teams capable of playing with them
in this tournament, and we're sorry we couldn't put on a better show today.  
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Danika, just describe how tough it was to go against their defense.  
DANIKA SHARP: Yeah, they were really physical, but that's just something that
we have to get better at, me personally. I have to be able to handle the
pressure, not turn the ball over. Like coach said, we had a lot of turnovers.
That really hurt us because they got 29 points off of that. I think we should
work on that more and come back ready after the off‑season.  
  
Q. Mimi, talk about your first double ‑double, going against some of those
players that are so big and so long.   
MIMI MUNGEDI: I mean, it was tough. But it's good that I have a double‑double.
But the thing is their post is just bigger and way stronger. I mean, I don't
think they stronger than me, but they just bigger body and they did bother me
today, so...I just have to work on it and come strong next year.  
  
Q. Danika, they came out on a 19 ‑0 run. That had to be frustrating. You
were trying to score. Wasn't working.   
DANIKA SHARP: Yeah, that's just getting back on defense in transition and
trying to stop the ball, getting back in the hole. We just didn't really do
that because we turned the ball over a lot. That's where they got most of
their points, in transition.  
  
Q. You got it down to 12 in the second half. Talk about your mindset at that
point.  
DANIKA SHARP: I mean, I thought we had a lot more energy in the second half
than we did in the first half. We knew we had to step up or it was going to be
a blowout. We came up with more energy. We had to dig ourselves out of that
hole.  
  
Q. Danika, when you think about you have everybody coming back next year,
just the experience from winning the game the other day, getting to this
point, how does that bode for next season?  
DANIKA SHARP: We're looking forward to having everyone back, getting a lot of
experience, playing a lot of minutes with everyone else, just playing
together.  
I think next year should be a lot better.  
  
Q. Danika, Mountain West, first season under the belt. What was the biggest
difference between the WAC and the Mountain West?  
DANIKA SHARP: Bigger, stronger, faster players (smiling). That's what it is.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach Albright.  
  
Q. I think every coach's nightmare is to play a game and not score a point.
I was wondering if you were having that nightmare?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: I probably will tonight. It will probably be recurring in the
off‑season.  
Again, just credit them because they jumped on us. There's an expression in
basketball when you say: Take someone's eyes away. Mimi was wide open. We
couldn't see her because of the pressure on our guards, that their guards were
putting on our guards. Yeah, that was a coach's nightmare.  
I was really proud of the way we did fight back because it could have been a
situation that I've never been in.  
Missed some free throws in that first half, but really, to cut it to 12 after
that. It was mostly transition. Danika was right. They had two threes in
transition and four more just layups.  
Again, just credit them for being ready to play like a championship team, and
we were in a little bit of shock.  
  
Q. Looked like Danika wanted to score, especially from the outside. They
were just on her.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Again, they've got a lot of bodies. We've got like a couple of
bodies. We've recruited a couple more bodies. I think we have some athletes
coming in that will help us.  
They kept changing up who they put on her. She was trying to get open. I think
they made us speed up. They made her speed her shot up. She knew she was only
going to be open for a millisecond, millimeter, whatever that word is. She
wasn't open for very long. Usually she has a little time to get her feet set.  
We were setting screens pretty good, but, again, their defense is really good.
I think they're better defensively than they are offensively, if that makes
any sense. I know y'all might not believe that, but they're really good
defensively.  
  
Q. What was the game plan with Mimi and Danika?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: You know, we talked a lot about how to defend them. Probably I
think the game plan offensively was to get open. We had many possessions we
didn't get in offenses. That was, again, frustrating because I think we could
have gotten some shots.  
But I don't really know what it does to the brain of an 18‑ to 22‑year‑old to
be down 0‑19 and actually enter the game thinking we have a chance. We
actually competed pretty well with them the first two times we played them. I
think it just got us on our heels.  
  
Q. Do you think Mimi held her own?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: I think she did fine. Mimi has grown up a lot in the last two
weeks. We've seen a great change in her. She was much more aggressive. They
ended up calling two fouls on them in the second half. They're great
officials, I never say a word. Those are the best officials in the country.  
But I hope that next year she can be stronger and get some of those calls.  
  
Q. Coach, Mimi improved a lot over the course of the season. In the off
‑season, what do you do with her to get her better for next year?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Unfortunately the rules don't let me do much. That's the rules
right now. I hope she can get a player development person and work with her,
just play a lot. She needs to play. That's what we need. We're that team that
if you know about that 10,000‑hour rule of mastery of anything, doesn't matter
whether it's playing the piano, concert pianist, anything, or basketball,
Mimi's hours are pretty low in that. Just five‑on‑five playing a lot.  
Our strength and conditioning people are really good at Nevada. We'll be
working hard with that. I don't know if y'all saw maybe about four minutes
left, we had three people that had our hands on the ball and they had one
player that took the ball from our three people. Not only did she take it, she
dribbled once and scores. You're shaking your head. That's just sheer
strength. You can say it's attitude. It's not attitude. We want to be strong.
We're not.  
The quote that I wrote on the board, coaches always want to teach. The think I
wrote on the board is, Every feast begins with a seed. I hope that last night
or two nights ago the seed of just knowing what it felt like to be in a
competitive situation in the Mountain West, that seed has been planted. I
believe this year was planting the seed. We need it to grow, we need to water
it, we need to get weeds out of our garden. We need to do a lot of things to
get that feast and be able to participate.  
Beth has done that with a very seasoned, veteran team. Her team was at out
place a couple years ago and we beat them in the finals of our tournament with
this young, young group. I think they were sophomores, maybe even freshmen.
They will definitely have a feast in the month of March.  
  
Q. The fact that you have everybody coming back next year, you got to think
the experience you had this week is going to help with their hunger,
motivation, their chemistry.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, I certainly believe that. I do think it fueled some
things. We know we've got some weaknesses, too. We feel like we've got‑‑ we
still want to sign a couple players in the spring that we've got identified
that can really make a huge difference in our production level. At this level
it's not all about wanting to do well, it's about skill and physical strength.
It's about a lot of things at this high level in the Mountain West.  
Again, I think it was a good start for us as far as us just coming down here.
Really when we had to kick Chanelle off the team a week ago, our team could
have tanked. She was our leading scorer. They regroup. They're such great
character kids, they really represent us well. We'll give them some time off.  
This time last year when we lost in the tournament, we brought them back in
and rode them hard. I'm not angry at them, I'm proud of them. I think our
whole university has seen how tough it is in the Mountain West. Again, we want
to be in it. We're not running. We're not going to leave or anything like
that. We just stay in it and try to get better. We have had a good, clear
vision of what we have to do to compete.  
You heard Danika. Every player would give you that same exact answer.  
  
Q. Nyasha LeSure was showing some brilliance out there today. How much has
she grown?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: I'm glad you said that about Nyasha. She missed two weeks with
a concussion. She was cleared for practice not even a week ago. She was in our
starting lineup for how many games, 16 games she was our starting forward. She
just was out for almost two to three weeks.  
I'm really, really proud of her. She's developed a lot, has got a lot of
spunk. She was on my ballot for the all‑freshmen team. Really, really proud
and pleased with her and believe that as a local product in Nevada, you know,
her and Emily and Danika, they've got a lot invested in the whole Nevada
thing.  
We hope to have another person that we're signing this spring that will be
invested in this whole thing, too. Not that the other ones aren't. But when
you're born in the battle‑ready type thing, it's neat to see her be able to
stay home and do what she's doing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Thank you y'all. Great job.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2013

  

### [Dymond James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23301)

### [Andrea Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21828)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Nevada  80  
Air Force  66

  
THE MODERATOR: Ready to begin with the Air Force Academy. Coach, if we could
start with some general comments on tonight's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: It was kind of heartbreaking for us. We do what we needed to
do in that first half, had a good game plan. The two injuries really didn't
throw us for a loop but didn't put us in a great position, so we stumbled a
little bit and needed to refocus and get back in it we did. We got the lead.
Needed to come up with some big buckets and didn't. I credit them. They had a
great game plan for us. They kept believing.  
Like I said, we came up short with some injuries that we had to deal with
throughout the game. That definitely hurt us in what we were trying to do.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Eight of nine teams are going to leave disappointed, but to have a 10
‑point lead early, does that make this tougher to take?  
DYMOND JAMES: Definitely. I mean, the other two times we played them, kind of
the same situation. But this time we couldn't close it out. This is very
disappointing, especially this being the last game.  
  
Q. To lose Byrd early, they put on a run after that, then you came back from
it, then to lose Cherae, you were down and that was the knock ‑out blow?   
DYMOND JAMES: It was‑‑ I don't know. We've never been hit like that before
with multiple injuries back to back like that.  
The only thing we could do, as Coach A would say in the huddle, is stick
together and keep pushing forward. Kind of go with what we got.  
Definitely losing Byrd on the inside and losing Cherae and her focus
capabilities with the team, it definitely, definitely hindered our chances.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. What was the difference first half, second half, especially the
turnovers?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Not having your true point guard out there. When I play Jimi
and Camille together, it's two of them that aren't as comfortable in the
college point guard position, so that hurts us. At one point I had Alicia
bringing it up against the zone to run our offense.  
Just that comfort factor. Cherae is a floor general. She does a lot more
defensively talking. They feel very comfortable hearing that voice. They've
played together three years, especially the seniors.  
Missing easy chippies, getting the ball inside, what we needed to do. Again,
we were having trouble getting back to the free‑throw line, like what we did
in the first half.  
We like scoring with the clock stopped. But not having Byrd as a solid
rebounder attacking post, Madeleine Philpot hyperextended her knee, so she was
coming back against a hyperextended knee against SanDiego on Senior Night.
Those two going out, trying to get Madeleine coming back in.  
But, yeah, 10 points, doing what they needed to do, they battled back.  
One of the main things is I wish our league had a most improved player. That
would go to Mimi. It's scary when someone 6'6" can do those things. That's
where we would miss Madeleine and some of our kids. She just kind of throws us
around like a rag doll in there.  
When she gets 18 points, she's doing something well. We need to shut down
Sharp, their shooter. She had 25. They were playing better. Their team
chemistry is much better than it had been, so hats off to them.  
  
Q. Hilbig only played 8 minutes in the first half with foul trouble. You
couldn't get your lineup out there. Disappointing for you?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Foul trouble, she's a little sore from her ride back from New
Mexico. Our seniors are old. Talking over a hundred games, astonishing on
Senior Night, how many games they played. I only picked them up from
sophomores on.  
We talked about beating teams we have never beaten them before, being a No.8
seed, we took a lot of pride in that. We have short‑term littler goals that
most teams wouldn't even think would be a goal. They've changed the program,
they're the faces of the program, and are leaving it in a better spot than it
was.  
Tonight was disappointing that we didn't finish it out. But it's hard when you
don't have your go‑to point guard, especially in the women's game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thanks.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2013

  

### [Jane Albright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24941)

### [Mimi Mungedi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24943)

### [Danika Sharp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24942)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Nevada  80  
Air Force  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada. Coach, if we could start with some
general comments on tonight's game.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: First thing I'd like to do is compliment the Mountain West.
This is our first year in it. Everything from top to bottom is first class,
all the people, all the information we got all year, the stats. The tournament
is wonderful. Of course, the floor looks wonderful. It's the women's Final
Four floor. Appreciate the work that everybody in such a great conference puts
forth for us to play.  
That being said, I was really proud of our team tonight. I felt like our post
players, we're really young, we don't have a senior on our team. Mimi is a
sophomore and Danika is a junior. Got a point guard, this is her first year of
starting.  
I think our postgame was very efficient tonight. That's something that we have
been a guard‑oriented team most of the year. Mimi, she's really I think the
last two weeks of the season, we've seen this coming, and we've learned how to
use her. I think early on it's hard to know how to use someone that's tall and
has good hands and good positioning. I felt like Danika had seven assists,
Amber had five assists. We had 21 assists on 26 buckets. That's really a team
win for us.  
So I thought that Aja Johnson did a good job coming in off the bench. We
didn't look as young as we've looked most of the year.  
I felt like our zone was pretty good. Dymond is a great basketball player. I
thought Mimi's size in the middle bothered them in the zone, made them alter
some shots.  
Obviously they always talk about our offensive rebounds. We know to score we
have to hit those offensive boards a lot, hit 'em really, really hard. I think
we had 18 points tonight on offensive boards.  
Just a great team effort. Really very, very proud of my team. It's been a
tough year for us just being young, being in a new conference.  
Danika, she really showed the great shooter that she is. She's the all‑time
leading scorer in this state, Danika is, high school‑wise. When we got her,
she was a great scorer. She's really worked on every aspect of her game. Her
assists were great, her defense was great. Everything that she did was really,
really good.  
I'm really proud of these two, but I'm proud of my whole team. I thought Arie
ran everything pretty well. We changed defenses up on them.  
That's a pretty long opening statement I know, but I'm pretty excited.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Danika, about five minutes left, they cut the lead to two. It was a 15 ‑4
run. You guys finished strong. What caused that switch in the second half to
take over?   
DANIKA SHARP: We just knew we had to come out with more energy. They're a
really physical team. We played them twice. We knew we had to outwork them,
like coach said, get the offensive boards and putbacks. We really capitalized
on that and that's what helped us come back from that deficit.  
  
Q. You lost a lot of close games like that. How does it feel to show that
type of effort when it matters late in the game?  
DANIKA SHARP: It feels good. We've been working all season. One thing I love
about my team is we never give up. We keep pushing. To get the victory today
is just amazing.  
  
Q. Mimi, you were fighting for position seemed like all game. Talk about
your performance and winning at this point of the season.  
MIMI MUNGEDI: It feels great to win, of course. I mean, in practice that's
what we do with the coach, fight for positioning, all that, what I was trying
to focus during the entire game today and I think I did a good job on that.  
  
Q. Talk about what you did from last year to this year.  
MIMI MUNGEDI: I just work hard. Come to practice. That's basically what I did,
work hard.  
  
Q. Danika, what do you think about SanDiego State, playing them on
Thursday?  
DANIKA SHARP: Both times we've played them, we've been able to compete with
them. We know we have to contain their two‑headed monster, come out with a lot
of energy like we did today, both in the first and second half and just fight.  
We know we can compete, so...  
  
Q. What do you think of your teammate, her being able to really improve, be
such a force for you guys?  
DANIKA SHARP: Mimi, we know she can score every time in the paint. She has
that drop‑step. I know she can score down there. It's really good to see her
improve over the course of the season.  
  
Q. Danika, you have to be pretty loose. You came in nothing to lose.  
DANIKA SHARP: We're feeling good coming in as the underdogs, knowing we can
compete. We lost a lot of close games. We were able to compete with SanDiego
State, so we're feeling pretty confident, like I said.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you address the same question, about how loose this team is heading
into the next game.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, to be honest with you, when we lost the other night, I
said, Can't be any worse than it is now. It can't be any worse.  
Really, the two things I told them before, we had two messages, mine was a
little more serious. I talked to them about being prepared because we're not
young anymore. This will be about as many minutes as we had when we start next
year.  
The second one is we're very capable of playing.  
We see this team in practice and I've seen them when they do really amazing
things. To shoot 48%, I see that a lot more in practice than anybody has seen
it in a game.  
Then my three assistants came in and did a cheer for them. That loosened them
up. If you had seen my assistants do the 'be aggressive' cheer, they couldn't
quit laughing.  
Danika Sharp needs to be loose because she can shoot as good as anybody. She
gets uptight. I was really, really proud that they were loose.  
  
Q. Talk about Mimi, what kind of weapon is she when she's playing like she
did today?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Like I said, the last two weeks something seemed to click with
her. She's an engineering major. I think the only B she's made is in English.
She's from Gabon, Africa. We all have our timeline for her. We wanted it to be
when she first got here, and it wasn't, quite honestly. She's never played at
this high of level. The speed of the game is different.  
She's always been pretty good offensively, but a lot of her minutes have been
limited because defensively that was really hard for her to understand
defensive schemes. But she definitely does now. She has good hands and the
kids really love her.  
She has worked hard. My Assistant Coach Camille Williams has done a great job
of working, bringing her in outside of practice and working her. That's really
what education is about, just seeing young people improve, come in, have a
good game like she did. Without that, we wouldn't have been able to win.  
  
Q. What do you think was the key? What sparked that run in the second
half?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, they've had that look in their eye. Again, I think we
got a couple of turnovers and made an offensive rebound. But they fouled us.
They fouled the right people, people that are pretty good free throw shooters.
We got a trick play, a layup with Arie. That gave us a little bit of distance.
They were in foul trouble a lot. Their players started fouling out, their
really good players.  
I think it can go either way at that point. It was just good to be on the end
where it went our way for once.  
  
Q. As a competitor, you don't want to see two of their best players go down.
That hurt them.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: No. They do an amazing job. They defend our country. They're
just great young ladies and they're very well‑coached. They're heady. Some
teams we think we can out‑work. We know we can't Air Force. They did have some
odd things happen to them, some unfortunate. That's part of the game, too.
We've had some very odd things happen to us this year too.  
  
Q. No.1 seed, SanDiego State. A lot of people probably won't give you much
of a chance. What is your mindset?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: It's March. It has to be March. Look at Liberty's men. Look at
those stories. We talked about Liberty's men. They lost 20 games, they're in
the NCAA tournament. This is what they live for. This is why you have
conference tournaments, for teams like us who are very, very young, grew up.
Again, we don't have anything to lose.  
In the locker room, they asked, Can we go to the guys' games tomorrow? That's
what their mindset is. 18 to 22‑year‑olds. We'll practice, go through a
walk‑through. I told them they can do anything they want. Some of them will
study. They have proctor three exams. I know the band leader and cheerleaders
are happy because they get to stay in Vegas for a couple more days. So we were
doing it for them (smiling).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Thank you again.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 26, 2013

  

### [Mia Nickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23266)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  70  
Penn State  66

  
Q. Mia, where did it get away from you guys the second half?  
MIA NICKSON: I'm not sure of the exact time, but I think that they just came
out second half with a little bit more firepower, a little bit more
determination, getting off of the offensive boards, getting open looks, things
like that. You know, around that six‑minute mark, I guess, if I had to guess.  
  
Q. How tough is it for the seniors for it to end this way?  
MIA NICKSON: I mean, it's really tough. We worked really hard to get here. You
know, the last four years have been great starting from where we were until
now, where we are right now. Of course we wanted it to end better, but it's a
tough one. It's going to be hard to swallow, this being our last game and
everything. But we wish the team great success, and we're looking forward to
what they're going to do next year.  
  
Q. It seemed to be a game where both teams just went on big momentum swings
either way. Did you feel it kind of slipping away towards the end when they
started knocking down shots, or did you feel like you had another run in you
towards the end of the game to kind of pull one out?  
MIA NICKSON: I thought we did have another one. Like you said, it was a game
of momentum. We just didn't have enough time. I think that's what it came down
to. They did what they needed to do in the 40 minutes, and we just didn't.  
  
Q. At what point did you become aware that Kenney wasn't going to play for
them, and as a coach, do you fear what they did, which looked like they
rallied and they played with a lot of emotion, especially on their home floor?
You feel you have an advantage but at the same time you think they might have
one, as well?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Regarding Kenney, I didn't pay any attention to whether
she was playing or not until we got to the arena, and I just came into the
game assuming that she would play, and when she didn't play, I didn't think
that that was going to be a negative necessarily for them. I thought it would,
like you said, be something that they would rally around. They've been a team
all season that played through adversity and seemed to‑‑ any kind of
adversity, they kind of used that as fuel, and certainly that happened
tonight, that they had some added emotion, and along with the home crowd, and
that was fantastic, giving them an added boost of energy and adrenaline.  
  
Q. How important do you think it was that they got off to that 8 ‑0 run to
start the second half after it seemed like you guys had taken the momentum
into halftime?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Yeah, that was pretty big. But I knew that we felt like
they would have a run in the second half, you know, and we bounced back from
that and were able to get a five‑ or six‑point lead after that. It was a game
of runs, and I thought if we had gotten off to a little bit better start, I
thought we started the game, and we had our chances to go up maybe six, eight,
zero, and we didn't knock those shots down, and it seemed to give this crowd
life. We missed a couple of open shots that we had early.  
  
Q. Maggie Lucas was obviously your best scorer and she didn't have a really
good game today. Tell us what LSU did and how frustrating it was just to try
to get her into the offense, especially late in the ballgame?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, it wasn't frustrating at all, because she's had
games throughout the season where she hasn't shot the ball well, and I thought
she got some pretty good looks, and they just didn't fall down for her.  
But some other people got going. I thought Nikki Greene had a very productive
offensive night, Ariel Edwards was very productive offensively for us, Alex
Bentley was very productive offensively. Certainly we wish Maggie would have
made some shots, but I don't think that had anything to do with‑‑ it wasn't
frustrating, so to speak. She got good looks, she didn't knock them down, so
that's basketball. That's the way it goes some nights.  
  
Q. What did you think of Webb's impact in the game both offensively and
defensively?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I thought her biggest impact was offensively. Yeah,
I thought she hit some really tough pull‑up shots, and I think a big momentum
boost for them was she hit a three towards the latter part of the second half,
and I think it even put them up one or cut the game to one. But I thought that
was a big play, and it gave them a lot of momentum to close out the game.  
  
Q. I think you had like three buckets over the last seven plus minutes.
Offensively what made it tough for you guys to score over that stretch?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I mean, they did a good job defensively of trying to
clog the lane. I thought we got some good looks in the paint that didn't go
down, and that pretty much was it. You know, I thought‑‑ I thought we got
pretty good shots. We went inside, and stretches of the game it was good for
us. Down the stretch we didn't‑‑ we got some good looks for Maggie down the
stretch, they just didn't go in.  
But of more concern was the fact that we didn't get stops late in the game.
You know, if we could get a couple stops, I mean, the last basket that they
scored that literally posted Maggie up in the paint, that's a tough play. I
felt like they got‑‑ they made a couple‑‑ a few big shots down the stretch,
and defensively we've been better than that, and we just needed to be a little
bit better defensively the last three minutes of the ballgame. And we've done
that throughout the year. We've had stretches of games or different games
where we've held teams scoreless the last five, six, seven, eight minutes of a
game, and we didn't do that tonight. Down the stretch they pretty much, when
they needed a basket, they got a basket. So defensively I felt we could have
been a little bit better.  
  
Q. I guess now all the 3 seeds are out and this is probably an example of
how cruel and surprising this game can be. You guys probably have a little bit
deeper and more experienced team but not quite going as far. Can you comment
on that?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Comment on what?  
  
Q. Just all four 3 seeds being out.  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I'm not quite sure where you want me to go with it. I
mean, it's a tournament. People lose. Upsets happen. So I mean, it is‑‑ that's
part of the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your seniors, what they've meant for you and your
program?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Yes. It's really disappointing for our seniors, because
they have given so much to our program and they have given so much to their
teammates. They are the reason that we're in this position and that we were
able to reestablish Penn State as one of the nation's elite programs on the
backs of Nikki Greene and Mia Nickson and Gizelle Studevent and Marisa Wolfe
and Alex Bentley. And we certainly had hopes that we would be able to advance
in this tournament for them. But it won't happen this year, but we will
certainly carry their spirit with us into the future, and as we compete next
year and the year after that and the year after that, the spirit of these five
seniors will resonate through our locker room and carry us to great heights,
greater heights than we've reached. They got the ball rolling, and now it's up
to their teammates who are coming back, their future teammates who are still
in high school right now to take what they started and to push it farther,
higher, deeper, stronger, and that's the challenge, and that's what's great
about being a pioneer and being women of character and women of courage to
come to Penn State and to reestablish a tradition.  
And so their spirits will live with us long, long after their days of wearing
a Lady Lion uniform. I couldn't be prouder of them.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  70  
Penn State  66

  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Really proud of our team and what they did tonight without one
of our leaders in Jeanne Kenney. It was just a courageous effort on these
seven young ladies, and coming away with a great win against a very, very
tough Penn State. But I'm so proud of the two ladies sitting to my left. They
deserve this. They have worked extremely hard, and we've still got some more
basketball to be played.  
  
Q. How much did you think towards the end of the game of the Tennessee game
when it was so close, how much did that cross your mind?  
BIANCA LUTLEY: I wasn't really thinking about the Tennessee game, I was just
thinking about what I need to do to make sure that the game ended the way that
Coach Nikki and I'm pretty sure everybody in the gym wanted it to end, and a
lot of people didn't believe in us, but we came out and did what they were
supposed to do.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I'll add to what Bianca said. Tennessee's loss was not really
in the back of our mind, but what was in our mind is this is our last game
here, and we have to take care of our house really. We just came out there and
said that we're going to buckle down. We don't want a repeat of what happened
last year. We wanted to give our all in our last game. We had to do that. And
everybody just stepped up.  
  
Q. Adrienne, maybe I just noticed it because it was happening right in front
of you, but it seemed like you were trying to make your way to one spot on the
baseline and trying to take all your shots. Is that your spot and is that what
led you to putting up 29 points tonight?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I would say my favorite shot is the baseline shot, either side,
but I mean, it's really coming off the dribble, getting around the ball screen
was what I really had to do for us to win. Just shots were falling during that
time.  
  
Q. Adrienne, I think it was a career high for you in points in what would
have been your last game had you not won, and I wondered if you could just
talk about the mindset, the assertiveness and what you learned about yourself
in this game, and then for Bianca, talk about playing with four fouls for the
last 12 minutes and coming up big in the end.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I came into this game thinking that as a senior and being one
of five‑‑ two senior upperclassmen that I had to play my hardest in our last
game because it's do or die. And it's winner advance or loser go home. But I
really had to assert myself trying to come to the ball and finding open gaps
when my teammates were either penetrating or someone doubled on
(indiscernible).  
BIANCA LUTLEY: When I picked up my fourth foul and went to the sideline,
everybody was just telling me keep my head up and help my teammates from the
sideline, and once I got back in, I adjusted how the ref was calling, and I
was just making sure that I wasn't then trying to pick a ball from a big man,
just playing smart.  
  
Q. After the sluggish end of the first half you came out in the second half
and went on a run. Did coach tell you anything that led to that spark?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Coach fired us up in the locker room at halftime, really
talking about how we got our lead in the first half and also how we lost it.
But what it really came down to was our heart and our effort on both ends of
the floor. So we really took to heart what she said and came out and executed
at the beginning of the second half.  
  
Q. Adrienne, great defensive job against Maggie Lucas. What was your
mentality, and was that important to you not just to slow her down but to hold
her to nine points? That's something right there.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, Maggie Lucas is a great player. She's a threat in the
three‑point areas and coming off ball screens and inside the screen knocking
down that shot. So my goal was to keep her from catching the ball, and whether
that's going under the screen or fighting over that way, she has no‑‑ the
passer has no angle to pass her the ball. And the coaches really pressed upon
that in practice the past two days.  
  
Q. Adrienne, I know you guys this year and last year got used to playing
through adversity and injuries. But still, to not have Jeanne tonight, for her
not even to be here to cheer you on, can you just talk about did that rally
you guys? How were you able to deal with that?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: We did not want our last game to be played with seven players.
All seven of us got together and really came together and played for our fans
which were out there and everyone who had supported us, and we also played for
Jeanne, because for me Jeanne has really been a leader for us on the court,
vocal, getting stops on defense, coming down, taking charges, and I wanted to
see her play one more game. That was my motivation at the beginning of the
game, that I wanted to play this game and have Jeanne Kenney out on the floor
with me.  
BIANCA LUTLEY: I think without Jeanne, everybody was missing her, but at the
same time we knew that we had to come out and get the job done so Jeanne would
be able to travel with us and hopefully she would be able to play with us on
Saturday. We miss her.  
  
Q. The whole time, the last few days, were you preparing not to have Jeanne,
and what did it do to your game plan?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We prepared not looking at Jeanne not being with us, but with
the seven that we knew had to go ahead to play, what we had to do. We also
talked about being in this situation before where we only had seven active
bodies. There's been times we've only had six in the course of a game. But
this team found a way and they stayed together when they were making their run
at us, and we were able to weather the storm. Once it got to late game, their
play calls were where they needed to be, ours were, and we were able to get
the stops we needed down the stretch.  
This was a great basketball game. It was fun to coach. Coach Washington has
done a phenomenal job with Penn State, and again, we're just very, very proud
to be able to get on the court again to play another game.  
  
Q. Obviously Adrienne made a lot of noise with the 29 points, but probably
more impressive were her defensive efforts. She was on Maggie Lucas like a
glove for the majority of the game. Can you talk about what she did that make
her so effective tonight?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Adrienne Webb, and I've said this before, is one of the
hardest working players I've ever coached or been around, and her competitive
spirit on the defensive end allowed her to really have the attitude that you
have to have when you face a player like Lucas, who does a lot for her team.
So it was going to be a battle of Webb versus Lucas, if you will, and Webb did
what she needed to do. She stayed true to our game plan.  
And then on the offensive end, because of her conditioning, she was able to
really get some great looks and knock down some shots, but her mental
toughness is something that she has fostered throughout the offseason, and so
she's been training for this type of game, this type of environment, this type
of situation.  
  
Q. It seemed like this game had phases, and I'm sure if someone had told you
that Plaisance was only going to score eight points you would have been quite
scared, but it seemed like you had phases, you had the phase where Adrienne
was going off and you had the phase down the stretch. How was this game to
coach with just how kind of weird this game was with your top scorer not being
on and their top scorer not being on?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Theresa has commanded double teams, and we play out of
them. If she sets great screens, then we can be efficient offensively, and
that's what she did, she did some good things for us, although she wasn't
scoring the basketball, she did have some good looks.  
I was proud of our two seniors for stepping up and making the plays down the
stretch. That's what your seniors are supposed to do, and that's exactly what
they did.  
We didn't shoot the ball, Theresa didn't shoot the ball extremely well,
neither did Ballard, but then when you can get our centers, Derryal and
Shanece McKinney to step up and give you anywhere from 10 to 12 points, that
makes up for a Plaisance. So everybody did their part tonight in picking up
the slack where it was needed.  
  
Q. What do you think are Jeanne's chances of playing on Saturday, and is it
a concussion, and why did she not come to the game, or I guess it was better
for her not to be here?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Yes, it was better for her not to be here. We want her to be
symptom free. If we get the go‑ahead for her to play Saturday, we'll do so.
Again, we won't risk anything. But this team really has rallied around Jeanne,
and like Webb said, they want to be on the floor with her. She's one of our
leaders, and if they need that motivation come Saturday, if Jeanne isn't with
us, then I'm sure they will use it however they need to. But we hope to have
her ready to go on Saturday.  
  
Q. I know it's way too early and obviously your emotions are high, but do
you know anything about Cal, and what do you expect from them on Saturday?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Cal has a veteran squad, and Kyra Dunn has done a great
job for them being a leader, a guard that's really nice off the bounce, and
then you look at their players inside, they've got some active, athletic
players. Caldwell does a great job for them, and they've got a balanced
attack. Their guard play is pretty strong as well as their post game. So we've
got to be ready to, again, defend a team that can score inside and from the
perimeter.  
  
Q. Did Jeanne watch the game at home, and how crazy do you think ‑‑ I know
she's hurt, but how crazy do you think she was going having to sit there and
watch that at home?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Jeanne, I'm sure she was screaming and yelling and
probably shouldn't be. We just really have taken the necessary steps to make
sure that she stays calm and not get herself too aroused, but how can you not
be in a game like this. And I know that she is extremely proud of her
teammates for the way they played, and I know that they‑‑ like Bianca said,
they miss her and we miss her on the bench. But again, Jeanne has left her
print on this team, and they carry her with them in everything they do.  
  
Q. Did the crowd fill in for Jeanne?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: They did. They did. You know, when you have the support and
the fans and how rowdy and loud they were, they gave us that extra energy, if
you will, that we needed. Obviously we had to create the plays, but they
brought it home for us.  
I could see our team really taking in the atmosphere here, and it was a great
atmosphere, especially for our seniors, knowing that this is their last game
at home, and we just appreciate the fans who have stayed the course with us
and who continue to believe in us when things looked a little bleak. But this
was an unbelievable crowd.  
  
Q. You've been at LSU for two years and you've already racked up an
impressive number of wins. Talk about the possibility of this being the game
that you look back on that really helped build and solidify your program.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, you know, each game that we played this year has helped
us get to this point. When you play a team like Penn State, playing in the
SEC, you're going to see great guard play, you're going to see great post
play. This game is definitely going to be one of those memorable games because
of how special it's been, the journey thus far with this team. The other thing
I'll say about this year is that when you lose five seniors a lot of people
talk about you're rebuilding, you're going to be young, and this team has
really just relished around the idea that the game does not know their age. We
had three returning players that saw quite a bit of minutes last year, and
everybody else is new.  
You know, that says a lot about them as basketball players. But again, this
game, it's March, and anything is possible, and as long as these young ladies
keep going out there and putting it on the line and laying everything they
have out there.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

### [Theresa Plaisance](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24826)

### [Adrienne Webb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21770)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
Q. Wondering before I ask the question, is there an update on Jeanne?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, at this time Jeanne is going to be reevaluated. She's
feeling a lot better than what she was yesterday after taking that, having
that collision. So we are still waiting to find out more, whether Jeanne will
be able to go or not.  
  
Q. For the players, whether it's seven or eight, Penn State is an up ‑tempo
style, and how are you going to deal with that with the numbers that you have?
  
THERESA PLAISANCE: You know, playing with Jeanne or without Jeanne, we have to
be ready to go at all costs. We've played against teams like Kentucky and
Tennessee all year, pushing the ball up and down the court and we fought
through adversity all year long, driving down to seven and six at times and we
had two and three players out.  
This is just going to be another test to see if we can push through it like we
have all year long.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: To elaborate on what Theresa said, we have been in adversity
all year, we have been up‑and‑down with different players getting hurt, and we
just have to go out and play hard tomorrow, and whether we have seven, eight
playing, or we have six, seven playing, we still have to go out there and play
our game.  
  
Q. Adrienne, no one has asked how you feel; how did you manage to get
through that without having some kind of injury last night?  
COACH CALDWELL: She has a hard head.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I have a pretty hard head. I don't know, I guess the adrenaline
just kicked in and just got me right back up. But doing fine and be ready for
tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Also, about the game, considering that you played them last year and they
have a similar team and you have similar players; is there a little bit of
déjà vu? Does it feel like maybe a big SEC game, a team that you're familiar
with, playing in your home arena again? There's a lot of things that are
familiar about last year's game.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Absolutely, but there's a lot of things that are familiar. Some
players are familiar, than others, but it's a new season, it's a new game, and
we have to go out there and play to our potential. And even though we have
seen like Maggie and Nikki Greene on the inside, we have to kind of know their
game and know their number, basically.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I honestly don't even remember the game from last year up
until last night when we had to watch game film, and then things started
clicking and I started to get those flashbacks. But you know, this is a new
year. We have a completely new starting lineup, and you know, we have new
things to offer this year. So I think it's going to be a different game with
some similarities.  
  
Q. How are you guys different than the team that played Penn State last
year?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, we are a lot different. First of all, we don't have
the five seniors, four of which played in that game, pulling us through this
year. We depend a lot of Boogie Barrett and Courtney Jones to get us through,
and this year we have a lot of new weapons. We have a lot of new guard play.
We don't have the same setup as last year. We have me inside, me and Shanece
battling on the inside this year and maybe not relying on that quick game that
Boogie and Courtney brought, slowing down a little bit on the inside.  
We also have a lot of versatility with Bianca being able to drive and dish out
to Webb or whoever spots up on the outside. And a great addition to this team
is Danielle Ballard. She brings a lot offensively and defensively, and that's
a great addition to this team, and you know, I think Danielle is going to do
well against a team like Penn State.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Yeah, our teams are very different from going to a lot of upper
classmen last year to maybe two or three to actually really play‑‑ missed a
lot of last year and having a lot of newcomers that are stepping into that
leadership role. But we've had a lot of adversity but we've fought through it
as a team.  
So we have gotten better, each and every game, each and every practice that
we've had.  
  
Q. Since you've had the opportunity to go back and watch the film from last
year's game, obviously Maggie Lucas was the big star of that game. How would
you all describe her as a player, and what are you looking to do tomorrow
night with her?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, I certainly know Maggie Lucas as a friend and I know
that Maggie Lucas is an extremely hard worker. You know, there's not too many
times that you won't catch her in the gym and that just shows in her game
play. I think she's averaging 22 points this year, and you know, that's just a
testament to her like working really hard.  
So yeah, a lot of attention is going to be on Maggie Lucas but there's a lot
of other players that they have that can do us a lot of damage, too. Alex
Bentley, senior point guard, she's not looking to go out with a loss, and I
know we are fighting for our seniors, too. And also you have Nikki Greene on
the inside, one of the most dominant posts in the Big Ten Conference. They
have a lot of weapons and so do we.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I realize that Maggie is one of their assets on their team, but
you really can't just take away her and not worry about everyone else. You
have to be on your toes on each player on the court, because on any given
night, each person can actually go off.  
  
Q. You come into this game having won eight out of nine and probably feel
like it should be nine out of ten. Can you talk about how that may be an
indication of figuring things out with some of the new players as the year
went along, and how much confidence that gives you coming into this game
against a strong team like Penn State?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Starting off this year, we had a lot of ups and downs. We
won some, we lost some, we really struggled on the road. But that just showed
our lack of maturity and lack of togetherness. As we got through the year and
got to Tennessee you started seeing a team that was more united and more
together.  
And since Tennessee, I feel like we have been playing more as a unit instead
of individuals and not that we were unconsciously being, you know, individuals
before then, but we really started to mesh and really started to build that
chemistry that, you know, we are starting a completely new starting lineup,
one of us being a freshman, and you know, it's hard to adjust to different
styles of play.  
We are finally getting a feel for each other and ever since that Tennessee
game, we seemed to mesh pretty well, and we have just grown as a group since
that game.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Theresa put everything into words. We have matured over the
year. We have really become a close‑knit group of ladies and it shows in our
play each and every time we step out on the court. I mean, referring back to
that Tennessee loss, after that, we really came together and matured as a team
each and every game.  
  
Q. Sometimes when there is that much roster overhaul it can take teams time
to sort out. Obviously there's been adversity that's come with only having
seven or eight bodies, but in a way do you think it's an odd kind of blessing,
there's no room to hide, and just by necessity, you had to be plugged into
spots and operate?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Definitely, the biggest show of that would be Derreyal
Youngblood, a freshman that we are expecting a lot out of in the paint. She's
come in, started off the year being too aggressive and over time, you slowly
see her developing into a D1 athlete that's doing a great job. We can go to
her inside and we just know she's going to power through and get a finish,
some big time rebounds from her.  
And also Danielle Ballard, she broke the record for the steals, not just
defensively, and offensively she does so much and creates so much for us.  
That's just two of the players that have done a lot for us this year, and just
being able to grow and adapt to each other's game and it's something that we
had to do, it took a little bit longer than expected but it eventually
happened.  
  
Q. Would you talk a little bit more about your friendship with Maggie, in
the locker room, she talked about how you went to AAU ball; how hard is she
going to be to defend?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Maggie and I have been friends, we go way back. We really
got close on the McDonald's team, we were on the same rock band team, we won
that championship. We have been very close ever since then. But Maggie Lucas
is one of those players that, you know, she's a special player.  
I know she works so hard, and she has a deadly release. You know, hand down,
man down; if you're not ready at any split second, she'll just release it and
doesn't matter who is guarding her. I don't think it really bothers her who is
guarding her; that shot is going up. Maggie Lucas is going to be a tough
person to guard strictly because of that fast release.  
  
Q. Specifically what was the injury to Jeanne? Was it a concussion or head
injury?  
COACH CALDWELL: They obviously wanted to be cautious on everything, and so
they did some tests, ran some tests last night and she passed some of those.
She did some good things this morning.  
We obviously want to re‑evaluate and see how she's feeling, a lot better.
She's being evaluated by doctors now. Any time that she would be diagnosed
with a concussion, our athletic department, we definitely would not take any
unnecessary measures to get her here. If she's out and they come back and say
that she is, that's what it is. Jeanne is one of those players‑‑ we told
Jeanne, we need to know, how are you feeling, because she would literally
fight her way back if she could.  
So she's being very up front and honest with how she's been feeling, so that's
been a positive, but she's been feeling good. So we are going to obviously
wait to see what the evaluation leads to after today.  
  
Q. What about her makes it so you have to be sure that she is being
completely truthful ‑‑  
COACH CALDWELL: She's a competitor. I'm not saying that she's a fibber, but
she's a competitor. She is someone, you know, we have had to at times, I've
told her, I've said, you're not going, you're not practicing today. I would
have to pull her from practice.  
She would not pull herself. And talking and working closely with Mickey, our
athletic trainer, we would literally force her to not practice because she
always wants to be out there on the floor. But she's been banged up and her
teammates understand that there's times when she will need to sit out on some
of the runs or things that we are doing up‑and‑down.  
But then she's always the first one to try to get back into drills and we're
like, Jeanne, you're fine, you know the game plan, don't worry about it. But
she's that type of player, which you love. You definitely love someone who has
that competitive spirit who isn't a quitter, and she's definitely a fighter.  
  
Q. You've had to be creative all year with the lineups with eight, but if
you get to seven, is that a little too much subtraction? What do you do if
you're at seven; is that going to be a suitable number?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, as long as three of them don't foul out, we'll be okay.
We have started different lineups this year. When Jeanne was banged up after
the Missouri game, we came back with Lutley and she played extremely well last
into for us. Being a senior, she has the experience and she's been to
postseason play. She understands what is at stake here and obviously she's
going to do everything in her power to help her team win.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up to that, it's going to sound odd to ask this, I know
coaches like to have as many options as possible, but has it been something
unique in having eight and giving you‑‑ just knowing, this is what I have to
work with, reduce the stress in planning what the team can do?  
COACH CALDWELL: The one thing about having eight players is they have become a
lot tighter. When you're traveling, it's a smaller number. They definitely
have their own personalities, but they have kind of taken on this, "Eight is
Enough" and what does that mean, eight is enough. Eight is enough for us to
come out every day and compete and play the way that we want to play.  
This group has been fun to coach. I have been overly thrilled to come every
day to practice because our practices are now really short, so it seems like
their attention span is there. Because they know we can't go long because we
don't have the bodies.  
The other thing is there's a different level, sense of urgency on their part,
because they know that you cannot keep looking down the bench is: You're going
to play. It's not an option. They cannot hide, and they all understand their
role for this team. And if someone does not do their role or they are, you
know, not having a great game, we only have maybe one other person that can
step it up.  
So they are taking on a little bit more ownership of this team, which is what
you want all the time, because it is their team.  
  
Q. How do you deal with a player like that in this situation, do you bring
her the game plan and try to tell her? And Derreyal didn't play last night,
any particular reason for that? One assumes she's going to have to play
tomorrow night.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, Jeanne, she probably was already on synergy last night
watching the game, knowing her. She's a very smart player, and you know, she
will pick up what we need to do. We have done a loot of walk‑throughs before
because we have been pretty banged up. We have done mental scouting reports
where it's just really focusing in on the film work, the film, would, the film
work.  
The question with Derreyal Youngblood, the game last night was a very up‑tempo
game. You had a team‑‑ one of the best teams in the country, that had four and
five players that could shoot the three. So we knew that was going to be a
challenge for Derreyal Youngblood, but she's also been in that situation where
she's had to come back and had to battle against teams that have power post
players and she's been successful.  
So we look for her to get some valuable minutes for us tomorrow night because
she definitely can contribute and help us.  
  
Q. How surprised were you to see Penn State again?  
COACH CALDWELL: You know, I haven't really been on any of the selection or
been to any of‑‑ the committees, how they do the brackets and things like
that. I know that when you see a team like Penn State, arguments can be out
there for them, they could easily have been a 2‑seed or a 3‑seed.  
I was more surprised to see Green Bay. They are one of the best 11‑seeds that
I've seen in a long time. I do think that they are a team that with Green Bay
that easily could have been where we are at. But with Penn State, you know,
it's a situation where you've got teams that are hosting, and so you know,
you've got to send someone somewhere. You know, we are the type or I'm the
type where I look at the bracket and I know it's totally out of our control;
so that I was more surprised, more so with Green Bay.  
But Penn State is one of those teams that you've got to play the best and they
are one of the best teams in the country, and we understand that second round
games are going to be tough and challenging, and that's just the draw that we
got.  
  
Q. I'm looking at Shanece's game and she just stood out to me more than
anybody except the threes from Adrienne, when you look at size from Penn
State, they will probably try to exploit their physicality inside and when I
look at your bigs, they don't have the same kind of style, but with Theresa
playing out behind the arc, is that an advantage compared to maybe the
physical play inside and can maybe Shanece's and Derreyal come in and be
physical down low?  
COACH CALDWELL: They definitely can. Shanece and Derreyal Youngblood have
shown that they can compete and defend some of the best players in the
country. You know, you think about Nikki Greene, she's definitely one of those
players that you've got to have a conversation about, but so is Kelly Bond
with Texas A&M. So they found success being able to battle
All‑American‑calibre type players.  
Theresa gives us an opportunity to expand our offense because of her ability
to shoot the three‑ball. With that said, everybody knows her game and
everybody knows exactly what she can and can't do.  
But we have got to make sure that we continue to put her in the most
successful situations, but she's going to have to be able to have that power
presence as well, because Plaisance can score in the paint and we are going to
need her, we are going to need paint points against a very aggressive
man‑to‑man, get into you type defense. We are going to have to be able to
handle that pressure and Theresa is going to be a big part of that.  
  
Q. Falling apart question. Seems like the breaks you've had have been
fortuitous, because it gives you a semblance of a rotation, three in the
front, five in the back; do you feel like things broke in your favor that way,
that you can actually maintain some semblance of normalcy ‑‑ looking at the
numbers, realistically, can you maintain somewhat of a normal rotation out of
all that?   
COACH CALDWELL: We can. We have got versatility and we have got players that
can play more than one position. Theresa Plaisance has played one through five
for us this year. Bianca has played one through four. So they give us an
opportunity to have different looks on the floor.  
You know, Danielle Ballard is that player that can play one, two and three,
but she is one of the best rebounding guards at the point position this I've
seen in a long time. We have been asking a lot from her to help out on the
board.  
Adrienne Webb, she is somebody that has put in the time, the hours, to be the
player that she is now‑‑ and her level of competitiveness right now is at its
highest. And I don't know if that has anything to do with her being a senior,
but at this time of year, she's definitely zoning in to what we have to do.  
So the leadership is there from your upper classmen, as well, and we have got
freshmen that are really looking to follow. And so when you have that
combination, anything is possible.  
  
Q. Theresa said she didn't really remember last year's game but I'm willing
to bet that's a different case with you.  
COACH CALDWELL: Yes.  
  
Q. How long did that stick with you after the season last year, and did the
possibility of a rematch excite you a little bit when you guys won last
night?  
COACH CALDWELL: You know, you go back and you look at the last game that you
finished, and as a coach, you critique yourself in what can we have done
better to get this team ready to play at Penn State. And so you go into the
off‑season and you meet with your staff and you talk about what you need to do
in the fall.  
This team responded and they responded in a big way, and now that test or that
challenge faces them again. The one thing about playing a team that you've
played before is obviously you know their game, it's not going to be anything
that, you know, they know who Nikki Greene is. They know who Lucas is. They
have a feel for what they are capable of doing.  
If this team wants to win tomorrow night, we cannot play the same way we did
last year. We can't rest on the fact that we could of, would of, should of. We
have to totally, if you will, erase last year and focus in on who we are today
and who we will be tomorrow. And we are a totally different team.  
This team reminds me of a team that came together like the Bad News Bears, you
know, when they weren't really good early, and then they just plugged away,
plugged away, and their confidence started to build. And that's what's
happened is this team has learned to play through adversity, but also, to
smack it back. And that's something that last year's team, we didn't do that
all the time. We kind of did, but this year's team has been very resilient.  
And so, you know, I'm proud of them for getting themselves in position to
compete again against a great team like Penn State. And you know, Theresa
Plaisance is going to be key for us. She is not the same player that she was
last year. She has evolved and became in my opinion one of the best post
players in the country.  
Adrienne Webb is playing like a woman on the a mission. And then we have a
phenomenal freshman in Danielle Ballard and if everybody else can see what we
see and we feel that's capable of, this team, they can do anything, once they
put their mind, but more importantly, their hearts to it.  
  
Q. One thing I'm sure you want different from last night is perimeter
defense, but you're limited and try to play without fouling too much; how did
you feel about your three point defense last night and what needs to be
different maybe in this game?  
COACH CALDWELL: The thing about a team like Green Bay is they are one of the
best three‑point shooting teams that we faced all year. And a lot of teams
that play a matchup zone, you're going to give up some threes.  
Where we have got to be better is the one‑pass away, and I thought we missed a
lot of those assignments because they were coming down in that trail spot,
where our bigs are pretty much trained to come down and they run to their spot
in our match‑ups. We have got to be better in that area.  
But guarding the three‑ball, you know, it's a hard‑‑ it's a hard game when you
have‑‑ when you play a team like that that has four people on the floor that
can shoot the three. You know, and they pass the ball extremely well. They had
about 20 assists.  
Green Bay is good, and a lot of teams, not just our team, have struggled in
being able to defend the three ball but a lot of teams have struggled in
scoring against them. And so we were able to put up enough points, if you
will, to win the game‑‑ but I like Green Bay. I wish they were still in the
tournament‑‑ not against us, but I like watching their style of play. I love
the hustle of his kids. I love the fight and the determination they had. They
are a fun team to watch. They weren't exactly fun to play against but they
were very fun to watch.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
Q. For the players, what do you guys remember about last year's game against
LSU and how maybe are they different than maybe the way your guys are
different this year around?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I remember that it was a pretty physical game. LSU is a physical
team and I think we are, too. Just making sure we take care of business on the
offensive and defensive end and I think both teams have gotten better within
the past year.  
NIKKI GREENE: Like Alex said, very physical and last year very athletic, and
so us contributing on the offensive and defensive end, it should be a really
good game.  
  
Q. Playing Louisiana, a little deja vu, it's a little bit unusual for an
NCAA team to see the same team two years in a row, does it feel like a
conference rivalry or something like that?  
ALEX BENTLEY: The area is familiar but we are two different teams now from
last year. LSU has changed, we have changed, so it's a whole different
ballgame now.  
  
Q. Did either of you ever watch them on television this year?  
NIKKI GREENE: Yes.  
  
Q. And? Tell me what you saw, what you thought. Do you have any memories of
it.  
ALEX BENTLEY: They get up‑and‑down the floor well. LSU is a good team. They
have had a good season, and they deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament and we
are excited to play them tomorrow.  
NIKKI GREENE: I totally agree. I did not get to see them play this year but I
did watch the first half of the next game, and they are physical and two big
post players, athletic guards.  
  
Q. Compared to last year, what do you feel like makes you all a better team?
How come you all are better this year as compared to last year at this time?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I just think with a year under our belt, that that experience,
you know, we have been here, we have been to the Sweet16, we played in the
NCAA Tournament, and you know, we have just learned a lot over the course of
this year compared to last year.  
So we are just better in that aspect. And obviously individual workouts and
people getting better at their skill sets have been important, too.  
  
Q. Alex, you guys have scored 80 ‑plus in all games you've played thus far,
is it just an anomaly? Do you guys like the shooting background? Is there any
explanation for it?   
ALEX BENTLEY: I just think we have a well balanced team. We have a well
balanced attack. We have post players, a lot of them that can score in the
lane. We have guards that can‑‑ all of us can score and that's the reason why
we get a lot of points up there on the board.  
  
Q. Unlike last night where they had one big person and this team has two,
and Cal Poly was amazed how many big people you guys have, but can you talk
about the importance of your guards, having to take over or do differently,
because you have more of an even match down low?  
NIKKI GREENE: Because LSU have two big players, I feel like our post players
are able to still dominate and you know, defend their post players as well as
our guards. Our guards are athletic and we are able to defend Alex and Maggie
and Dara. So being able to defend the athleticism, I think we'll be able to
handle their pressure.  
  
Q. If we ask this question last year, being only from four and a half hours
away, was there much interest on your part or LSU's part when you were being
recruited?  
NIKKI GREENE: Penn State and LSU were in my Top‑4 my senior year of high
school, but after building a relationship with Coquese, my decision was made
to go to Penn State.  
As far as LSU had high interest but I felt more comfortable coming to Penn
State.  
  
Q. Touched on this already a little bit, where do you feel specifically
you've improved from a year ago at this time? What areas do you think you're
better in and how do you think that's going to impact tomorrow night?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think we have improved across the boards. I think we play
better balance inside‑outside game. The guard looking for the posts and the
posts are able to kick out to the guards.  
That's something we have definitely improved on and our defense has definitely
gotten better and it's been a focus all year and see it better on the
defensive end. You know, we've been working hard at it every day in practice,
and you know, I think we've caught on and we've started to understand how to
play together on defense.  
  
Q. Alex, you and Nikki had big games down low. What does that do for you and
Maggie specifically?  
ALEX BENTLEY: You know, it's huge, but I mean, going into games, we see what
match‑ups are going to be best and we knew that, you know, our post players
were going to be important to contribute.  
I mean, they played a phenomenal game last night, all of them, all of our
posts came to play yesterday. So you know, we are proud with our performance
and we can't be here without our post players.  
  
Q. Did you have a larger rooting section than normal for last night's game?
This is pretty close to home, relatively speaking. How has that been for
people that followed you to play here?  
NIKKI GREENE: Last night I had a pretty good section. My mother and my father
came up, a couple of coaches‑‑ it felt great. It's not like the big crowd at
home but it felt good to have some family members cheering Penn State on and
myself.  
  
Q. When you were looking at them, it looked like you were looking on in
amazement or fear of what they might stay.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Probably a little bit of both. (Laughter) more amazement
than fear, more amazement.  
  
Q. I assume you would not want to have as slow a start offensively as you
did last night.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Definitely we don't want to start off slow. But one of the
things I think this team does is we have to get a feel for the game, so even
if we do start off a little slowly, I don't worry too much about it because
that's kind of who we are. It takes us a little bit to get a feel for the
game, get a feel for the team. They understand the game plan intellectually,
but understanding experientially every night, it's different.  
It takes us sometimes a little bit to get going and see how the game is going
to be played. But then once we get going, we are generally okay.  
  
Q. How is LSU different this year, do you think?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I think one way they are different is Plaisance, she's
a problem. You know, she's a matchup nightmare. Just what she can do with her
size at 6‑5, shooting it from the outside, putting it on the floor, creating
her own shot, creating for her teammates and then being able to score down
low; certainly last year, LaSandra Barrett was able to do the same thing, go
inside‑outside but LaSandra Barrett is 6‑1 and Plaisance is 6‑5\. That's a big
difference.  
You know, certainly they don't have as much depth this year as they did last
year, but they still rebound the ball very well. They are playing the match‑up
zone very, very well, making it tough for you to get shots and figure out what
they are doing.  
So you know, they have been a team that I think across the season, you know,
with integrating so many new players, not necessarily new to the team, but new
roles, having bigger responsibilities, it takes some time for to you kind of
gel and they started to figure it out the last seven, eight games of the
season, who they are, who their identity is, how they need to play and what
they can do well and be successful at.  
And I think they are now playing their best basketball of the season, and
playing with a high level of confidence and playing on their home floor in
this environment. You know, that's tough. That's tough to play against.  
So we have got to be ready and, you know, we've got to be ready to defend
their physical play, keep them off the boards and try to have an up‑tempo
game, because that's what we like to apply.  
  
Q. Given the up ‑tempo game you like to play, and they only have seven or
eight players depending ‑‑ to what extent do you think that could be a factor
that you could exploit?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, I'm hoping it will be a factor. But the
thing is, they played with limited numbers all year. So they know how to play
with seven people the whole game. I mean, that's not something new to them.
It's not like they have been playing ten, 11 people and the last week or two
they have had injuries. This is something they have dealt with all season
long. I don't see this as something being a big chink in their armor, only
having seven people at their disposal. That's what they have dealt with all
season long and they have dealt with it very, very well.  
I just, again, we want to dictate the tempo, and one of the ways they seem to
start to have success with slowing it down a little bit late in the season, so
again, I think it's going to be a contrast in styles. You know, we want it
up‑tempo. They would probably like it a little bit slower.  
So you know, we'll see which style can kind of win out.  
  
Q. Do you know Nikki at all or do you have any coaching relationship besides
her recruiting trail?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Yeah, we're friends. We've been friends. We played against
each other in college. Although both of us are so old, we don't remember the
game very much. But you know, we've become friends as well as colleagues and I
have a tremendous high regard for what she's done, what she's accomplished as
a head coach. Certainly, you know, being a part of the Tennessee coaching
staff for so many years and having so much success, I mean, she's one of the
future superstar coaches in this league; in the country, actually. So what
she's done with this team this year, given their injuries and limited numbers
is phenomenal. And when we're not playing against each other, I'm certainly
rooting for her success.  
  
Q. Have you ever been, as a coach or a player, in a situation where they are
in where you have such limited numbers and you're trying to fight through
that?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, as a player, you like having limited numbers because
that means you don't come out of the game. I'm sure their players are excited
about that. They know coming in every game, they know they are going to get
plenty of run and lots of sweat.  
You know, with TV time‑outs and time‑outs you can take, you know, I think
having seven, eight people is plenty. I just don't think it's‑‑ I don't think
it's something that hinders you from being successful. So you know, when I was
at Notre Dame, and we made it that we won the National Championship, I think
we only played eight players, so I'm not feeling sorry for Nikki Caldwell.
(Laughter) She'll be fine.  
  
Q. Is it at all intimidating to coach against somebody who wears shoes like
Nikki does?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Did you see how high my heels are? (Laughter) They are not
as fancy, not as much animal print, but, you know, the heel is pretty high.
I'm only 5‑6 but on game day, I'm like 5‑10\.  
  
Q. What I asked Alex, how are y'all better as a team this year compared to
last year?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Alex kind of hit it on the head. I think in two particular
areas. I think we are more experienced, you know, having returned the bulk of
our team from last year, and playing in these type of games. So I think our
experience in understanding how long these games are, is one of the things
that makes us better.  
But I also think probably the biggest area we've gotten better is defensively.
I think we play better team defense. Statistically, I think across the board,
our defensive numbers are better, and that's helped us when we have nights
where we have not shot the ball well. We're able to stay engaged and we are
able to make squeak some out and if we have not been successful, we are at
least able to keep it close. So I think our defense, and offensively I think
our balance offensively is a little bit better. I think we play better
inside‑outside or outside in, depending on the game and the team and how they
are defending us. So I think we have just a better offensive balance and so
those three things.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

Penn State  85  
Cal Poly  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well their size really presented some major problems for us,
both in just entry passes and for us to get into the offense, it made it
really tough for us to have any kind of flow because of their defensive
presence. And then they had their post game, they're just some big mama's. The
big mamas were throwing us around like rag dolls. But they played an awesome
game both offensively and defensively. They were very clearly the superior
team today.  
  
Q. How much did the 3 ‑pointer at the end of the half‑‑ how much did that
hurt?   
MOLLY SCHLEMER: Well I was ‑‑ it was pretty, I take responsibility for it, but
she's a great shooter, player, and she's made the Big‑10 Player of the Year
for a reason.  
So I knew that taking away her right hand, I didn't do that and she punished
me for it. So she just had some amazing shooting and that was an incredible
shot to shoot it over me, because I'm kind of tall.  
CAROLINE REEVES: I also should have taken away her right hand so it was a very
good shot. It was a moment to go into the half down 10 points but she's a
great player and we just had to try to come back from there.  
  
Q. Molly, first 10 minutes you had 12 points and then they kind of stretched
you down a little bit until I guess midway through the second half there. Did
they make any adjustments on you at that point?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: They began to front me a little more because they started off
just playing behind me and that's my favorite thing for a defender to do. So
they got more in front of me and it got harder for the passing lane from the
guard to get to me. So they did a great adjustment today.  
  
Q. For coach and Caroline. Talk about their full court press and kind of the
pressure they put on you and how that kind of caused y'all problems.  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well, for us, Griffin, who was injured in her last game of our
conference game, she's handled that responsibility almost solely this year.
And Caroline has been one of our leading people to get out on the break. She
runs her butt off so hard. So for her to make the adjustment from sprinting up
the court to actually having to stay back and inbound the ball. We didn't get
the same kind of movement that we normally get where Kayla was trained to just
grab the ball out of the net and inbound it quickly and go.  
So that was really a disruption for us. Had we had Kayla, I think that we
would have not had as many problems. Caroline did an excellent job I felt like
of making decisions with her passes, but we just weren't in our flow because
of that change in personnel.  
CAROLINE REEVES: One thing Kayla brings is pushing the ball really hard. So we
did get past their press, it was just a little slower than normal, so.  
  
Q. Molly, coach said it pretty well about the big mamas. What was that like
trying to deal with so many big bodies coming at you?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: It's completely different from our conference. They're the
biggest people we have seen by a long shot.  
But it was a good experience to play against people my size who I'm not really
used to, and I was wondering what it was like and it's really difficult. They
pushed us around, they have strong bodies. But it was like nothing I had ever
experienced before, at least three of their players were at least all my size
and that never happens.  
  
Q. For all three of you, it wasn't the outcome you wanted, but just the
whole season up to this point, you beat the odds and come here for the first
time. What does this whole experience been like for y'all and what do you take
away from it?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well I'm really proud of our team. I think that we represented
Cal Poly well and I hope that we represented the Big West well. They
definitely are first class people and I think you can see that by how hard
they played. And they weren't as gifted athletically as our opponent today,
but you couldn't fault their hearts, that's for sure. And I'm really, really
proud of what they have accomplished.  
  
Q. Caroline, yesterday you seemed to be in a just glad to be here type of
mode. But you went out and competed well in the first half until that, until
that shot sort of did it . Tell me, how do you feel like y'all overcame that
sense of wow and at least through the first half played them pretty heads
up.  
CAROLINE REEVES: I think it was just realizing that we're just out here
playing basketball. We're just going to do the same thing we do every day,
just keep working hard. So it was encouraging to stick in there with them and
yeah, so that's about it.  
  
Q. Faith, how big a factor was their depth in this ball game?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well, usually as I said, we normally maybe see one big. It was
like a wrestling match. Tag team, Brutus comes in and pounds somebody and then
Dino comes in, you know, Thor. They all come in. And it was just a constant
barrage of just trying to body Molly as much as they could there. It was
really effective.  
And we only got one Molly and she logged a lot of minutes for us today and
we're proud of her. It just seemed like a little unfair of a fight, to be
honest. It felt like five against one. Because they just got their tag team
going on.  
  
Q. In particular where do you feel like it got away in the second half?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: I thought we made a couple critical errors as far as saving
loose balls and coming in getting easy lay‑ups. They pounded the offensive
glass and any time they got on the offensive glass it was going to be another
layup. So we felt like we didn't do as good a job as we needed to know the
defensive glass. I thought that them knocking down a couple threes too really
kind of crushed us a little bit. We had a difficult time from the 3‑point line
tonight and normally Ariana can knock some things down for us and between our
guards I think we were like 3‑35 or something crazy like that. So because of
their size and their athleticism, there's like, okay, let's take the first
shot that we can take because we may not get another look. And I felt like we
rushed some of our shots, but again, because of their size, they're just so
big everywhere on the court. We had six‑four sometimes guarding our five‑five.
So our guards really couldn't get past them either, they were so athletic. So
anything we had, mismatch‑wise, I felt like we probably, at the 17 or 16
minute mark in the second half, I want to say that they knocked down a three
and I felt like we just never could recover.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

Penn State  85  
Cal Poly  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, the shot you hit at the end of the first half and what kind of
momentum did that give you guys heading in the second half?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I was just coming down the floor, I didn't think I had a good ‑‑
I just don't want to force it right before the half so I just held it out and
waited until I could get a shot at the buzzer. But when I took it, I didn't
think it was like the best shot I could have made, but it went, so, yeah, it
was just really good.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MAGGIE LUCAS: It was more momentum. But I thought the biggest thing was just
coming out defensively in the second half. I thought that's what really got
our momentum going.  
  
Q. Describe how physical a style of play y'all have. This was two games for
you without getting a foul after you fouled out in the game before that. So
just talk about how do you play as physical as you're able to do without
getting a foul twice in a row?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: She's very, very, smart. Yeah, the refs don't see it.  
(Laughter.)  
MIA NICKERSON: I think you just have to like, know when to get the foul and no
when not to. Just be smart. I've been playing college basketball for five
years now, so I had the experience to just let them get a lay up and try and
get it back on the offensive end, or try not let them get the ball and things
like that. It's going to be physical, I love playing physical, so you just
have to be smart about it.  
  
Q. Talk about the job that you and the bigs did down low, especially on the
boards using your size in the second half, especially?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I thought we did a great job. I thought that we kind of took the
game over.  
Especially on defense, when they shot it, we got the defensive boards, along
with the guards to kind of change the momentum a little bit of the game. It
was just one and done for them. And then our offense, we were able to attack
and get second chances. I thought we did pretty good for all of us that were
in there.  
  
Q. Maggie, it seemed like it took a really long time for your offense to get
on track. Was that first game jitters, Cal Poly doing something, or were you
guys out of sync for awhile? Thoughts about that?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: It might have been a little bit of jitters. But we were able to
get in rhythm and like said before, it comes from our defense. When we're able
to get out in transition and get post pancakes and layups and stuff like that,
that's going to get us moving. I thought once we addressed our defense more,
that's when our offensive flow really got going.  
  
Q. Talk about what the challenge was like guarding Schlemer underneath the
basket?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: She's a great player. She has a great touch around the basket.
Even better than what film shows. So it's difficult to guard up against her,
but she didn't have the ball at one possession, then that hurt their offense,
I felt like, so we just tried to do the best that we could, just play physical
with her. We knew she was going to get her shots and make basket, but we
wanted to just give them one shot and be ready to do that and so I think we
did a pretty decent job.  
  
Q. Since you don't know who you're going to play, could you talk about maybe
playing LSU or playing Green Bay.  
MIA NICKERSON: We don't really have film yet, but I know they're both very
talented teams. So we got to go in mentally pretty much the same, but just
ready to do whatever coach tells us. Whatever the game is going to be.  
COACH WASHINGTON: They don't know anything about who we're going to play yet.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student‑athletes and take questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Faith referred to your girls as big mamas out there. I don't know if you
heard that before. But how does having so many big players, just in your
practice preparation, those things you can do and could you tell me, is
everybody knows about the physical style of play on the men's side in the Big
‑10\. What about on the women's side, do you pride yourself on being maybe the
most physical team in the Big‑10?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think to play in the Big‑10 we have so many good coaches
in the Big‑10 and we have so many good players. And certainly when we play
night in and night out in the Big‑10, it's physical. It's fast, there's a lot
of different and a lot of very offensive styles that you have to prepare
against.  
So we want to be a team that can play a lot of different styles and we can
play against small quick teams, we can play against bigger physical teams. So
having the depth that we have in our post really is a plus for us I think.  
  
Q. Talk about how you thought your team rebounded tonight, especially Talia,
she had big boards for you tonight?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought Talia was big for us. Huge. She had a fantastic
day. I thought she did a really good job defending Schlemer. She got her
points, but the thing we wanted to do was just make her work and make her work
really hard to get touches and to get quality shots.  
I thought early in the game she got a lot of her baskets off offensive
rebounds when we had to help, when our rotation, help rotation was there and
she got free and made some offensive rebounds.  
But Talia came in the game, I thought she was big, I thought she was
aggressive defending her and the rebounds that she got were key for us getting
out in transition and getting some easy baskets.  
  
Q. What do you think the shot at the end of the half did for you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: It might have gave them a lift, but it was short lived after
I walked into the locker room and talked about the other 19 minutes and 55
seconds of the half.  
So I'm not sure it was a big lift, but Maggie's right, it was our defense, we
did a better job defensively the second half in con I think at that the ball
and contesting shots and making them take tough shots and we just didn't ‑‑ in
the first half we didn't do quite as good job as we needed to. But starting
the second half, our effort was a lot better.  
  
Q. You guys didn't manage the first 10 minutes well, maybe that layoff was a
little bit too long for you guys. But talk about the way your defense stepped
up from that point on and really got the ball rolling for you guys.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought we were a little bit more aggressive defensively.
And really Cal Poly, they're small and quick. Sometimes you watch teams on
film and you can't, one thing you can't gauge on film is how quick people are
and you can't gauge on film how strong people are.  
So I thought it took us a few minutes to adjust to their little guards
shiftiness and their speed with which they played with. They played hard and
we knew they would do that, they played hard, they played aggressive, so it
took us a little bit of time to adjust to their speed and their quickness and
how they wanted to play. But I thought once we adjusted and we did a better
job of keeping them in front of us, things seemed to work out better for us on
the defensive end.  
  
Q. So you must know something about LSU or Green Bay. You played LSU before
of course. Talk about playing either one of them?  
COACH WASHINGTON: It's certainly a contrast in styles. LSU is a team that's
playing a lot more zone and they have got Theresa, who is playing some
fantastic ball right now, inside/outside threat. She can put it on the floor,
she can do a lot of things. They're a very good rebounding team. And they got
good speed and quickness on the perimeter, close to what we have seen in
Big‑10 play in terms of personnel and bigs, traditional bigs. But they play
the matchup zone and the matchup zone is difficult to prepare for. We don't
see it on a nightly basis.  
In contrast, Green Bay is a team that they spread you out, penetrate and kick.
A little bit more similar to Cal Poly, the team we played tonight. But they're
a fantastic 3‑point shooting team and they're a very good team defensive team,
even though they're undersized in comparison to BCS level schools, they do a
fantastic job of being aggressive, fighting for the ball, their help side
defense is outstanding, and they're an outstanding team.  
And I know Kevin from having been in the Big‑10 and the way that he likes to
play, he's able to motivate them and move pieces around. You just have two
contrasting styles and I'm excited to watch this game and to see how it
unfolds.  
  
Q. Talk about the confidence, shooting 47 percent, four players finishing in
double figures, especially with what happened against Michigan state in the
Big ‑10 tourney.   
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, first of all, Michigan State, we don't even think
about that, we don't talk about that. That game is so far behind. So in terms
of where you put this game, it's one game and we put it behind us and we move
on to the next team.  
Just because you shoot well against one team doesn't mean you're going to get
the same shots the next night. So we don't celebrate and we don't put our hat
in what happened tonight, we have to focus on the next opponent, because
they're going to be different opportunities and they're going to be different
challenges that we have to focus on.  
So it comes down to discipline and determination, being determined to be
disciplined, to execute the game plan, whatever that's going to be, and as
long as we focus on that and focus on the next game, I think we'll be in good
shape.  
  
Q. Sometimes the box score can be a little misleading, but in this case all
your big girls combined for like 33 rebounds, out rebounding them. Is this one
of those games where the stats do tell the story in terms of your size
advantage and how you asserted it?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think so. I think rebounding was a key for us. The way
that they exerted their influence and their impact on the game on the boards
was big for us, especially in the second half. Giving us second chance
opportunities but also rebounding the ball and allowing us to go in
transition, that certainly was big.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  75  
GREEN BAY - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd like to make an opening statement, then we'll
direct questions to the student‑athletes?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, I'll tell you, Green Bay is one of those teams that you
don't want to play. A lot of credit to his kids and how hard they played and
how hard they fought back. But I was equally proud of our team for not folding
down the stretch and able to come away with the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. What do you think contributed to them making a big comeback in the second
half?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, with every great team, you know they're going to make a
run at some point in the game, and at that point, that was their run to try to
get our lead back. But we really buckled down that last few minutes. We felt
we're not going to lose this lead. We're not going to lose this game.  
Credit to Green Bay; they were a very great team and very strong in every
aspect of their game, but our will to win that game really shows how much that
we really want to be here and how we're underestimated a little bit how we can
finish out games.  
  
Q. Adrienne, can you talk about the collision with Jeanne late and what
transpired there?  
ReplaceName1:  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, I was originally supposed to go long, and Jeanne was
supposed to come to the ball, but I think she went a little early. We were
both going hard, so I mean, that's always a good thing, but you really don't
want to run into your own teammate. But I have to say I really can't complain.
We were both going hard trying to come get the ball.  
But I probably could have maybe rerouted it or she could have waited a little
more. You really can't say anything about timing. It probably just comes down
to that.  
  
Q. Adrienne, if you would speak about getting to this point, what this has
meant to you to go through the season? You said at the end of the regular
season you wanted to come back and play a couple more games, and now you've
won that right to do that. Just the goal of that and now that you've finally
gotten there?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: The goal is to continue. That's playing hard. I really don't
want my senior year to end in a loss. Not just for me and Bianca, but I want
to get past the second round for the underclassmen. Whether that's Theresa or
all the way down to Derreyal, we really want to give it my all each and every
game so that we can advance in the tournament.  
  
Q. Theresa, did you feel a little bit of relief after the game was over, the
fact that had he had a never ‑say‑die attitude and kept coming back like the
terminator in this game?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Most definitely, you know. Green Bay has never lost a first
round game in the NCAA Tournament. They have a great group of girls that will
do anything to pull out a victory, and that just shows. They came back from a
17‑point deficit it was, never giving up, never stopping. They tightened up
their defense a lot, and started driving to the goal. Their guns were hot from
the outside, also getting to the rim, that created a little bit of trouble for
us. That final buzzer was a huge relief for us. Because Green Bay is such a
great competition and such a great team, that anything can happen.  
  
Q. You mentioned the three ‑point shooting, and they reeled off three in a
row and cut it to six with three minutes left. What was the sense there? It
seemed they had gone to press to set you guys up, force some quick shots,
hitting the three. What was the feeling at that point to see the lead going
away?   
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, you have to calm yourself down in order to try and stop
the run. You have to buckle down on defense, gather your team up and say,
okay, we are not going to let them score on this possession. We have to get a
stop. We just really did that.  
After they got that last three, I think coach called the timeout, and she
calmed us down. It makes you realize that we have a lead. We don't want to
lose it.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We realized before the game even started that no matter how
much of a lead we had, we knew they were going to make a run. They're not just
a team to fold under pressure. They're great competitors and we knew they were
going to make a run. So when they started scoring, I think 43 out of 5
back‑to‑back baskets for them. They were really doing a great job getting to
the goal and stepping out with that three shot.  
There was just a sense of urgency that we needed to just click and get it done
and buckle down even more.  
  
Q. Adrienne, right after halftime, y'all closed up the first half on the 7
‑2 run and at the beginning of the second half you found those two early
threes and you all jumped out to an even bigger lead and got the lead up to
double digits. What was it coming right out of halftime that you were able to
find those open shots?   
ADRIENNE WEBB: I would have to say I knew that I had to step up and play my
role in order for our team to win. That was knocking down those open shots.
Our defense was on point, and when I had the opportunity to score, I had to
take it. So finding‑‑ and because of my teammates also finding me.  
When Theresa is doubled or say if there's a penetration and they doubled, I
was open for that kickout. So just knowing that I have other teammates that
are going to create also helped create shots for me is an extra benefit, and I
didn't want any of my team to go down with a loss.  
  
Q. The threes were really falling early in the game for them. But they came
in shooting a lot of threes and making a lot and y'all not so much. But y'all
stepped up and made a ton of threes today. Was that something you did in
response knowing that you can shoot that or what?  
COACH CALDWELL: Yeah, we started playing our inside game. So when they lock up
inside, you have to knock down the outside shot, And Theresa did a very good
shot job of that, Bianca did. I came in a little bit. But we established an
inside presence early in the game which made them collapse on the inside. When
they do that, you have to knock down your outside shots.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, coming in, we knew they were a three‑point shooting
team, and a three‑point game really hasn't been our strength this season at
all. I think some of these shots were a bit lucky. I must say I did call the
bank on that three‑point shot. I knew it was going off the backboard the whole
time.  
But I think just coming out and being put in that situation where you feel
like you have to knock down that shot just puts a little bit of pressure on
you to knock down that shot. Webb did a great job coming out early in the
second half and knocking down a few, and Bianca at the end of the shot clock
knocking down a big one. That could have been a turnover, but it was a
three‑point play. So just little key moments that really helped us out in the
end.  
  
Q. Theresa, I know in the second half you got in foul trouble. Just talk
about how you were able to keep your composure despite being in foul trouble?
Especially at the end where you know things got a little physical?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Just coming out with four fouls, it's sometimes to adjust.
I haven't been in much foul trouble this year, but coming out with four, I
just tried to stay positive with my teammates. I have all the faith in the
world in my teammates and I believe what they can do. I don't need to be on
the court at all times for us to win.  
We have a lot of different weapons. They did a great job of picking it up when
I came out, and I tried to be the best cheerleader on the bench when I was.
And when it was time to come back in, I had to play composed and maybe not
take that iffy block or get out the way if it's a blocked charge call. I just
have to play it safe for a little bit.  
  
Q. How big was it having this game at home? In terms of everything, whether
it's sleeping in your own bed, obviously the crowd is into it as well, is that
big for y'all?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Definitely, the crowd played the biggest part in this win.
There was some time in the game where we were struggling a little bit. We just
turned to our crowd and they were right there, cheering us on the whole entire
time. There was one play, I remember, I didn't know how much time was on the
shot clock and the girl shot it, and I caught the rebound, and I was about to
go on the fast break and I couldn't hear anything. The buzzer went off for the
shot clock violation. I had no idea because the crowd was so loud.  
We appreciate all the support and all the love that these fans give us,
because without them we really wouldn't be able to maybe hang in as tough as
we did.  
  
Q. For either player, when Bianca hit the three that stunted that run they
had made inside of 5 minutes, kind of hung the follow through there. Went down
the court and came back with the three ‑point plan and drive. I wonder if you
could illuminate what it is about her personality that allows her to play with
that swagger in that critical moment?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Bianca is an all‑around athlete. Looking at her, she seems
so laid back and so composed, so, I guess, chill, you could say. Coming on the
court, she has that thing about her. She can do it all; she's an all‑around
player; she can take the drive, take the three, post‑up, you know. Basically
everything.  
Bianca's personality, she's actually really goofy and a happy‑going person.
Just that coming out of her is a little taste of what we see in the locker
room. She's just a great teammate and a great person to be around on and off
the court.  
  
Q. Talk about, obviously, it's the tournament. Knowing that if you lose, you
go home. Now you've got to focus on another team in two days. Can you talk
about how you'll try to carry that momentum into the game against Penn State
in two days and try to keep it going, and try to live that dream of making it
all wait to the final four right down the road in New Orleans?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: This momentum is going to be key for us because Green Bay
is not a pushover team. They're a great team. They were on a 24‑game win
streak, so we were a bit intimidated coming into this game. So carrying this
over to Penn State is a big key for us. Penn State is also a great team. They
have a great outside shot in Maggie Lucas and Alex Bentley. And their inside
game of Nikki Greene is unbelievable. They're an all-around game that we need
to match up against. The momentum coming out of this win will be key for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Caldwell.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have an update on Jeanne's condition? Have you had a player
that's been beaten up like this like a football player during the year?  
COACH CALDWELL: I know, Jeanne Kenney, bless her heart. She has been on that
floor more than the free‑throw line, if you will. If you think about how many
times she's taken charges and stood in there and been banged up. But I don't
have an update at this moment, but we hope that she bounces back.  
  
Q. Was that game more physical than you thought it might be, as physical as
you thought it might be? It seemed to me that that team was a little more
physical than I thought they would be.  
COACH CALDWELL: No, having watched Green Bay and followed what they're capable
and what they have done this season, you're not ranked nationally, you're not
24‑game win streak without being physical, without having the toughness about
you. That's one of the toughest teams that we've played.  
I mean, you know, we talk about how tough the SEC is. They could easily stack
up with anybody in our conference. They're one of the best teams as far as
just finding their teammates. Their penetration to kick, their feel for where
everybody is, everybody knows where they're supposed to be, what spacing that
they should have. A very, very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Having played and coached in tournaments before, how big is home ‑court
advantage in terms of everything from the crowds? Just being at home and doing
your normal routine and everything?   
COACH CALDWELL: Well, it's definitely an advantage, if you allow it to be.
We've got an opportunity to play another game at home, and we don't have to
have the wear and tear of travel on us, especially for us having a small
number on our roster with 8 active players. It definitely helps us in that
regard. It also helps when you have the crowd. You want that support, but more
importantly, you want the fans of women's basketball.  
This is an unbelievable environment to play in. This team understands that we
have another opponent to face, but if you look at what their record is at our
place, it's their home court, if you will, with the 1‑0 record against us. So
it's really, at this point in the ballgame, it goes back to how are you going
to play this game and what‑‑ are you going to execute your game plan better
than your opponents?  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Ballard's play there late, giving you guys a
little spark there to at least block some of the momentum and another push. It
seemed like she did enough to stem the tide for you guys?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, Ballard all year has grown as a player. She's shown us
time and time again how she can change the complexion of a basketball game.
She definitely performed tonight like a veteran. The game did not know her
age. She was very composed. She made some baskets, some big basket when's we
needed them, but more importantly, she got some key rebounds as well. I liked
the play of Ballard for us late game. I thought she did some really nice
things for us.  
But her teammates have fuelled her confidence because they believe in her. She
also has a unique relationship with our two seniors where she wants to play
for them, and she did just that tonight.  
  
Q. Could you also talk about Theresa and how she has turned it on her junior
year to the point where she's become one of the top players in the country?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, when you think about the transformation of Theresa
Plaisance from last year to this year, it's incredible. It started with her
taking on ownership in the off‑season and really transforming her body and
really getting in great shape, which then made her mentally tougher. This year
she's got teammates that have rewarded her with that hard work. She
understands she needs a Jeanne Kenney, Adrienne Webb, Danielle Ballard, Bianca
Lutley. She needs McKinney who now allows her to play off the ball a little
bit. But Theresa has really taken on this persona of an All American for our
team. She's playing like that. She commands double teams. You have to pay
attention to her on your scouting reports.  
But her ability to not only give you a power game inside and also her ability
to spread the offense and the things that she does on the defensive end, she's
definitely one of the best players in the country.  
  
Q. If you'd be kind enough to offer us a glimpse into your mind when 18
points became 4 points and there were 5 minutes left? What is going on with
you there?  
COACH CALDWELL: When we got our lead, I literally thought this is too soon,
because this isn't us. We're not that team that have blown anybody out or got
ahead of anybody in that manner often. So I did, I felt that way. I also felt
the team that, when the lead was dwindling, that we'd been in that situation a
couple of times.  
But if it did get to late game, I saw a team that knew how to play down the
stretch. Because we've played down the stretch and we've known how to lose. So
they know what that feels like. It seemed to me that they had the composure,
they had the confidence to really finish off this game against an opponent
that was bringing everything at them: The dribble drive, the three, the
penetration, the kick.  
I mean, this team, Green Bay did a phenomenal job in executing their game plan
down the stretch. But we equally did so on the offensive end.  
  
Q. What did you tell them when you called the 30 ‑second time out in the
middle of the 9‑0 run early cutting to the lead? How much did you remind them
of failure versus trying to give them the practical steps and advice there?   
COACH CALDWELL: Do you really want to know what I told them?  
  
Q. Go ahead.  
COACH CALDWELL: Having played, so I talked to them about being a player. There
are players that get a little tight. I felt like we were that team right now.
I said, we're tight right now and we're playing that way. You've got to play
this game loose. You can't be hugged up on your play. You've got to be on the
help line.  
Honestly, I said some other things, but it was along those lines.  
  
Q. You've always said the first couple minutes after halftime are incredibly
crucial and you came out and just went on a big run to start out. Adrienne
Webb was a big part of that. What allowed you to do that coming out of the
half?  
COACH CALDWELL: What allowed us to do that was our team got the defensive
stops that we needed and we were able to push the ball a little bit more in
transition. We got some dribble drive looks, which led to penetration. Their
support defense is very strong. So we were able to be patient on the offensive
end, get some ball movement, some ball reversal, and we weren't quick shooting
the basketball. So I felt as though we were in rhythm, and that allowed us to
get the lead.  
  
Q. I have to ask, where in the world did you find those shoes and how would
you describe them?  
COACH CALDWELL: My stylist (Indiscernible), and I would describe them as edgy.  
  
Q. Just a little bit of a glimpse forward with this game being so physical
and Jeanne going down, and Theresa going down in a scary moment in the second
half, you've always said that 8 is enough and you'll have that motto. But was
it a little bit scary with how physical this game was knowing that you'd have
to turn around and play a game on Tuesday?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, we obviously don't want any injuries, and with our
numbers, we can't afford to have any. But it was a little shaky there with
Jeanne, and then obviously Theresa, because then we go to six. But this team
has played that way. We've played that way all year where we've had six bodies
here or that were capable, because we've had sickness, and we've had some
injuries, and they've learned how to manage the time and the game and come
away with a win.  
So, you know, we're going to obviously take this night to enjoy what we need
to, as far as what they accomplished tonight. And then at 12:01, we'll channel
our focus to Penn State. With you we've played this way all season, so this is
not anything new for us.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  75  
GREEN BAY - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Kevin Borseth, head coach, Adrian Ritchie,
Jenny Gilbertson, and Sarah Eichler.  
  
Q. Sarah, I wanted to ask you this first. You guys do go down 18 there, but
what did you talk about at that moment, and did you know you still had one
more rally left in you guys?  
SARAH EICHLER: I definitely think we fought as hard as we could. There is
nothing you can do at that point when you go down 18, and at that moment you
have to ban together, fight, and we did that. Made it a close game, but we
just didn't pull it out in the end.  
  
Q. A lot of people would have said that you might be pressing them to go at
their pace. You guys seemed to do a good job forcing them into some turnovers,
and making them make some mistakes. Can you talk about the shift of the press
and what made you all so successful in terms of executing that to maybe get
yourselves back in it?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think it was once the jitters wore off and they realized we
were here to play and we realized that we can dictate them instead of being
the ones on the other end. So by giving them a little pressure and making them
think twice about their passes is what we were trying to do, and make them
speed up a little bit more than they wanted to.  
  
Q. Throughout most of the first half, you all were staying really tight with
them and seemed like you were playing a really aggressive brand of defense. As
somebody who hasn't watched you play all year, is that kind of your usual
mentality or is that what you try to do to kind of play ball with LSU
tonight?  
SARAH EICHLER: That's something that we practice and preach every day,
definitely. It's always been our focus. I think that we did a great job
executing in the first half. We talked about the most important time of the
game is that first five minutes after halftime, and they came out and went on
a huge run, and it gave them a lot of momentum. So I think that that stretch
there was hard to come back from.  
We battled and we fought and we played more defense and we did what we could.  
  
Q. You guys look up at 18 with 12 minutes left, you haven't been down that
much. What sort of mentality in that sort of situation? Do you look at
chipping away at it? Was there anything you could do to make a push there?
What was sort of the approach when you're looking at that big of a deficit and
that much time left?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Well, 12 minutes is a lot of time left in a ballgame, and I
think we did a good job of rallying together and coming together and saying
let's get this done, let's get going, let's get focused, and I think we
stepped up and we were fighting really hard for that period of time.  
  
Q. Jenny and Sarah, I know we talked about their size and everything. How
did you feel you matched up in that capacity, and obviously still being able
to hold through, I think you were right there with them for rebounds in this
one?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think as far as size match‑ups go, I think it's hard to
play against someone that is that much taller than you. But Bre and Steph are
really long, and they are a couple of inches shorter. But it's all about our
help defense. They pass in and we trap to get it out and we rotate from there.
So it's more of a fly around kind of thing instead of a one‑on‑one physical
match‑up, but I thought that we handled it pretty well.  
  
Q. Adrian, I just wanted to ask you, I know it's been a big ride for you in
this area with basketball. Just on your career, can you reflect on what this
has meant to you and your family coming from De Pere and being able to play in
Green Bay?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Yeah, it's meant everything to me. Growing up, watching the
program, watch Coach Borseth make Green Bay what it is now. It's the biggest
gift to me, to have my family here, I just feel so lucky to be part of this
program and to have played four years. It's really hard to go out like this.  
We won every single first round of our career, so to go out like this is a
little bittersweet. It's hard to swallow right now, but still proud of what
we've done and of my senior class for sure.  
  
Q. I know you guys deal in numbers. So No. 5 came out in the second half and
got open looks and hit those early threes. Is that something that LSU did or
was that a lapse in your defense at that point?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think it was a little bit of both. I think we definitely
had some lapses. I got lost and 5 had an easy lay‑up and things like that.
That was a little uncharacteristic of us. A lot of it was LSU; they're a great
team; they're a 6 seed for a reason. They play on their home court, and
everything seemed to be going for them.  
But I think it was also a little bit of our lapses, and just things went their
way. Sometimes that happens. We tried to rally as much as we could, and we
fought as hard as we possibly could, because that's who we are. We're not
about to fall over because you're in your home court and everything's going
your way. That's not who we are, and how we're raised, and how we're raised in
the culture of this program, so we tried to do our best.  
  
Q. Jenny, I wanted to ask you, coming into today, your career high was 14
and having 15 out there tonight. For you to go out this way is a tough loss.
But what did you think about contributing tonight given how much you girls
stress being able to have the next girl come up and step up?  
JENNY GILBERTSON: A career high doesn't really mean anything to me at this
point because we lost the game. So I think anybody 1 through 15 on our team
would step up if they needed to. I could count on any single one of them, so I
don't know. Doesn't really mean a lot right now.  
  
Q. Would the rest of you seniors just kind of (Indiscernible).  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Obviously, it's great to play in front of our fans. We've had
a great run. We've had a great four years together. We know each other really
well. We're like sisters, you know, on and off the floor.  
It's been a great ride. Our careers have been amazing. To win that many games
is more than any student‑athlete can ask for. Anyone who is a competitor,
anyone who is an athlete, anyone who has ever been good at anything wants to
win. So just that in itself is special and winning is special, and we don't
take it for granted. We definitely don't.  
Looking back on those numbers in a few years, maybe after the hurt goes away a
little bit, it will be something that we can be really proud of.  
  
Q. Adrian, before the game, you spoke about how 1 through 5, you can all
shoot the three or you can shoot from the outside. Did we see that in the
second half, the rally you guys made and the barrage of points?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Absolutely. Just like Jenny said. We can trust every single
girl who steps on that floor, and Jenny stepped up huge tonight. She's been
doing it all year. It's no surprise to us, but I guess it was a surprise to
LSU because they weren't guarding her and she hit those shots. That's what
we're all about.  
It's about everyone can make three‑point shots, but it's about taking that
role if you're called upon, and it's why it made it so special. It's hard for
other teams to find one player to stop, because then Jenny is going to step up
and make two threes, you know what I mean? So it's something that we pride
ourselves on, and we're quite happy that we can deliver the ball in many
different ways.  
  
Q. Just your overall thoughts of the game, and how your girls battled and
how proud of them you are?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, we got down to the last possession, really. Our goal was
to get a stop against one of the best defensive teams in the country. Our goal
was to get a stop at the end of the game, and they did. They got the stop.
They blocked out, but was a little too small to grab the rebound. If she did,
that gave us an opportunity to get a three on that.  
But that's how our kids battled to start the second half, first half we turned
the ball over too many times and the game came down to points off turnovers.
That was really key. To start the second half, they had some shots. Had a deep
one, banked one, 32 hit her second three of the year. 3 was two for two from
the arc in the second half. So they turned up pretty good three‑point shooters
having not shot one all year long, you know?  
I thought our kids really rallied. They came back in the second half and
really rallied, got it down to one possession. Didn't look like we were going
to get it there, but we got it there, and we had an opportunity. So I was very
proud.  
  
Q. You called that timeout. What did you talk to the girls about at that
point to try to get that thing turned around?  
COACH BORSETH: The key was to try to get stops, but we just couldn't get any.
Every time we got to the end of the shot clock, they made it. Then we tried to
get out and spread a little bit, but they didn't want to speed up. Not much we
could do to speed them up. We kind of just had to play at that pace and hope
that they would get misses.  
They made shots. To their credit, they had to make them and they did. They hit
a couple at the end of the shot clock and banked one of them. As it was, we
got to the other end of the court, and what we did on the offensive end at
that point, I don't know if we missed shots. We had a couple of them blocked.
They played really well in a stretch that I thought was the determining factor
in the game.  
  
Q. Your offense was so perimeter oriented, but you had a lot of success
inside. Were you at all surprised and frustrated that you didn't get to it
sooner?  
COACH BORSETH: To be able to score it inside there? We did, but we dropped it.
The first half we turned the ball over three, four times in the post. We got
down there the first half the same way we got there in the second half. And
two times we dropped it and lost it. The other time we threw it out of there
and got deflected going out of there, and Megan had one blocked.  
But we had it down inside of there. Second half we told the kids, when they
drive, step to the short court, catch it and take it to the rim immediately.
Don't think about it. Even in the first half, we hesitated a little bit and
didn't take it there. Good observation. They are pretty big though around that
basket.  
  
Q. When the girls do lose Adrian there and getting fouled out, what did you
think of how they responded at that time? Lot of different girls stepping up
right there?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, Jenny Gilbertson is probably one of the best shooters
that we have, period. So for her to make shots certainly didn't surprise us.
Key for us the whole game was to try to find rhythm. I thought we did a pretty
good job. Other than the end of the first half where we dropped a few balls,
had some turnovers, and, again, that was the key.  
I thought we played well. Scored 43 points in the second half, gave up 40.  
  
Q. Going off that, the game got really physical in the second half. You had
two players foul out, four for LSU. Was that kind of a way or planned as a way
to get back into the game?  
COACH BORSETH: We didn't have a choice. We couldn't just sit back. We had to
battle. Our kids were battling. They were going after loose balls and taking
gambles. That's just part of the game. You know, we didn't have‑‑ yeah, we had
to be physical. We had to go after it. We had to try to get after the ball,
dive on the floor, try to deflect something or anything we could to get that
ball deflected and get neutral. I thought our kids did a pretty good job of
doing that. That really helped us.  
  
Q. Would you touch on the senior class for us?  
COACH BORSETH: Pretty special. Yeah, how well they've done. They really are a
remarkable bunch of young ladies. They say you make a living by what you get,
you make a life by what you give, and those kids got a lot. They got a lot.
But I think they gave a lot more than anything.  
They gave to the University, they gave to the city of Green Bay, they gave to
the little kids in the area, gave them something to look up to. They gave to
each other. You know, that's pretty big; it really is. I'm very proud of them,
and they should be very proud of themselves. Left a very lasting mark on Green
Bay women's basketball, and it will be very hard to duplicate for anybody.  
  
Q. Just a follow ‑up to that. As you look to reestablish your brand of
basketball at Green Bay, how much did that senior class help you kind of get
what you want going forward with your foundation?   
COACH BORSETH: I hope they were paying attention because next year those five
seniors are gone and it's almost like you're starting over again. To some
regards you are because you have the players that have least experienced that
type of desire and that type of drive and that type of togetherness. You know?
We're hoping that that carries over.  
Those kids sat there and watched and learned a lot. They are really great
leaders in their own ways. We've had a lot of those over the course of time
where our senior leadership is really‑‑ our younger kids have fed off senior
leadership, and that's been going on for a long time. We're hoping to continue
that streak as we move forward.  
  
Q. Coach, seemed like you guys coming into this tonight know if you wanted
to get an open floor game with them. But it seemed down the stretch that
benefited you going into the press. It seemed they showed a little bit of
youth there?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, but they just spread it and wouldn't let us speed them
up. So the clock kept getting away, and late in the shot clock, they hit
something. We tried to speed them up. Of course we tried to go after them and
double them and do whatever we could to create as fast a shot as we possibly
could, but it worked. We had some shots and had some misses on them. We tried
to shoot more threes. That was our goal tonight to get them to shoot threes
because we thought that would help us on the offensive glass.

ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

### [Faith Mimnaugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25231)

### [Caroline Reeves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25233)

### [Molly Schlemer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25232)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Cal Poly.  
  
Q. What's it like being at the NCAA Tournament and being there?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: It's a dream come true for all of us. We're enjoying every
moment of it. It's a great team bonding experience, and we're all really glad
we're here and that we've made it this far.  
  
Q. Caroline, I know you are traveling and everything else, but obviously
you've probably been paying attention to the men's tournament. Are you all for
Florida Gulf Coast? Putting yourself in that frame of mind?  
CAROLINE REEVES: It's definitely exciting seeing them win. It's encouraging
that we have nothing to lose, and we're excited to just go play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Molly, records are made to be broken. But being the first to do something
is something that doesn't go away. Talk about the feeling of being on this
first Cal Poly team, people remembering you and your team for getting this
far.  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: It's a crazy opportunity that we have worked for. It's surreal
and hard to get used to because Cal Poly has never been here before.  
But like I said, it's crazy and just taking it all in. We've worked really
hard for this moment, and we're just enjoying being here.  
CAROLINE REEVES: We're just excited to be here. It's been neat to see where
the program has come and seeing it improve every year. This is my fifth year,
so I've got to see a lot of things happen over the years. It's great for Coach
Faith to have the opportunity. She has been here for so long and given so much
of herself to us, so it's a really neat thing.  
  
Q. Ladies, obviously playing Columbus State and Cal earlier in the season,
what does that do to help you prepare for the team tomorrow?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: I think the athleticism of both of those teams issimilar to
what we will see tomorrow. It was a while ago in the early season, so we just
have to remember what we did in both of those games. We have to keep going on
what that was and playing our game and not letting other people take us out of
what we're doing.  
CAROLINE REEVES: It was helpful to just‑‑ the physicality of those games, just
having the experience and knowing what to expect in these games. So I think it
helps put us in the right mind‑set of how we're going to need to play and just
that it's going to be a battle every play, can't take any plays off.  
  
Q. Caroline, thoughts on Maggie Lucas, one of the stars of the game right
now, and having to go up against her?  
CAROLINE REEVES: Yeah, Lucas is an excellent player, really, really good
shooter, quick shot, green light on whatever. So there's going to have to be a
lot of pressure on her, a lot of trying to get her into her second looks,
maybe not her primary options, a lot of help on her from other teammates. It's
definitely going to be a battle and just try to make things a little difficult
for her.  
  
Q. What made you guys so good during your stretch run at the end of the
season?  
CAROLINE REEVES: What made us so good? I think just hard work, just really
focusing on each individual play and knowing that it wasn't going to be handed
to us. Try to have the same mind‑set, whether we were winning or whether we
were losing.  
If we made a score, great. Now let's go play defense. If we turned the ball
over, hey, let's go play defense. I think it was focusing on individual plays
and knowing the game isn't over until the buzzer sounds.  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: Staying together as a team. We worked really well together
toward the end of our conference, letting go of our mistakes and not dwelling
on them, just playing together. We're one of the leading assist teams in the
nation, I guess.  
So that has been to our benefit. Just sharing the ball, playing together and
staying together and being friends on the court helps us.  
  
Q. Molly, you talked about this is a dream come true, but now you got a game
to play tomorrow. Why are you confident y'all can win this game tomorrow, make
it more than just, hey, we finally played a game on this side of the
Mississippi River?  
MOLLY SCHLEMER: We have just been watching the NCAA Tournament and how there's
been a bunch of upsets. Anything is possible, and confidence is key. We have
to go out there, have a good practice today and just remember what we do,
because when we do what we do, we do it well.  
We just have to go play our game and know that anything is possible and
nothing can stop us if we have the right mind‑set.  
  
Q. Caroline, you mentioned nothing to lose earlier. Do you see yourselves as
underdogs in this ballgame?  
CAROLINE REEVES: Yeah, we are underdogs just because we're undersized. But I
do think we have a lot of heart and we play hard. I think sometimes that can
be a better team.  
So our goal is just to play really hard. It's potentially our last game, so
why not go for every loose ball and pull an upset.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Good luck. Let's start with
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you and the program to get this NCAA Tournament
berth?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: We see the quality of student‑athletes we have at Cal Poly;
they're exceptional. Everywhere we go people are impressed by the character
they have. After the game, you're going to see them pick up their water cups
from the bench. You're going to see them gather their towels and put them in a
neat pile. You will see the locker room spotless. You will see how they have
character on the court and compete.  
They're the right kind of people that NCAA wants represented in this
tournament; and Cal Poly is privileged to have them representing them. They're
first‑class, and this is a first‑class experience for them to have. We're so
proud to be able to represent our great university and our outstanding
conference as well in the Big West.  
  
Q. I know you lost two key players over the course of the season.  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Actually three, all over 6 foot.  
  
Q. Did they all make the trip with you?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Two made the trip; one did not.  
  
Q. Who didn't?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: Maddison Allen, 6'4" center from Australia.  
  
Q. She is the one who didn't come?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: She did not.  
  
Q. Obviously, the desire to play for these players and this motivation, is
there any concern that those kinds of emotions can hurt your focus? How do you
deal with that and the loss in the Big West final is so fresh?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: The loss of Griffin is substantial for us. She had everything
coming through her. Even though she is our 4 player at 6‑foot, she is somebody
that handles the ball. She is leading our team in assists, second in rebounds,
kinda the heart of the team.  
We have an award that we give every year to a player that represents what we
call the "unbroken spirit." A herd of horses is unbroken and that's what she
is, too. There is a "never quit" attitude about her, and she was the recipient
two years if a row for us. So the loss of her is significant to our program,
certainly for this game.  
Caroline Reeves is going to fill in as best she can, swing from the 3 spot to
the 4 spot. We're thin at the forward spots, so hopefully we won't get into
any foul trouble. But it will be a physical game and they have excellent post
play. So we're going to do our best to hang as tough as we can with their
great players.  
  
Q. The players were saying ‑‑ it almost came through like we're just glad to
be here. How do you instill in them that you have a game and a chance to win
and your season is on the line?   
COACH MIMNAUGH: Anytime you take the court you're always in a position that
you could win or you could lose. Our team, we're workers. Nobody is going to
have us in their top 25 and on the "USA Today" poll. Pennsylvania State is
deserving of that. We are hard hat, blue collar, dive on the floor, take
charges, box out, do‑whatever‑you‑can kind of team. Anything can happen with
those kind of teams.  
We got to our championship game in the Big West tournament. I was reminding
them because I was at N.C. State for a few years when Jim Valvano was there.
So I told them about that Cinderella team being able to march through, and
they were inspired by the fact that you could overcome a lot of things,
injuries included, if you play together.  
Our team has done that this whole season long and we talk to them about throw
your hearts over the bar and your body will follow. You're going to see a
whole lot of hearts out on the floor tomorrow and their desire to win.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Penn State?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: They're tough, really tough. As the girls said, very athletic.
Size is going to be a major problem for us. We have two dinky guards‑‑ I'm
kind of dinky myself; I try to have at least three dinkies on the team, so I
can talked to somebody.  
Molly it's always like, hello! But they're going to be much bigger than we
are. We can match some places in the quick department. We can't in the post.
Molly is a good, strong post player. She hasn't, except playing against
Oklahoma State, she hasn't faced playing somebody as big as she is, so that's
going to be a challenge for her.  
We're going to start out with a committee trying to play Lucas, and that's
going to be a big‑time job. Caroline Reeves is going to start out on her. We
will try to keep up with her zillion screens she has, and hopefully we can
wear her out.  
  
Q. Talking more about Penn State, it would seem to have, I guess, good
coaching, talent, and experience, probably a trifecta for a successful run.
How do you see that?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: I see them really well‑coached. They run excellent sets,
things that are going to‑‑ things that I think exemplify the strengths they
have on the team. They make it tough for you, because not only do they run
Lucas off the screens, but at the same time they're posting you up their bigs.  
So there is no great opportunity to stay on double teams on the court. We'll
do our best to give support, as Caroline Reeves said, with the ball screens
coming off those. We're going to be totally isolated on the post play for a
bit and how well we can have pressure on the basketball will give us a little
bit of time to try to get around the post and try to do a better job defending
them.  
Well, I can't say that they're used to it, because I've seen them play quite a
few teams and they've been really, really strong and they're going to be a
battle. They're really well‑coached and obviously their players are excellent.  
  
Q. We're working on a story at the AP about how coaches have competitive
playing backgrounds as well, and I'm trying to illustrate that. Your thoughts
on ‑‑ I don't know how much you get out on the floor with your players and
work them in practice. But you played and Nikki played and Coquese played. How
do you think you would do against any of these coaches in the tournament
one‑on‑one, or what do you know about them as players?   
COACH MIMNAUGH: Well, they're all great players, much better than I ever was.
I remember when I was‑‑ my first Division I coaching job was at North Carolina
State, and when I was there I was a graduate assistant to start out with. So I
was on the court a lot against Andrea Stinson and Rhonda Mapp, and I remember
getting back on defense and we were doing this drill, and I would always get
in because I would take charge and be really tough.  
Andrea Stinson is coming at me, and I got her. I got her, and she crosses me
up and gave a reverse layup and I had her, I had her; and that's probably what
Ms.Washington would do and Nikki would do. They're all really, really great
players, and thank God I don't have to get out on the court anymore.  
  
Q. You come to win and at the same time it is a first for your program, for
your players. How much did you want them to balance the goal of concentrating
and practicing and preparing to win a game, and yet you're in a different part
of the country and the thing is a novel experience for you for a lot of
different reasons?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: This is a fantastic opportunity. We just had final exams all
this week for our winter quarter, and I can tell you that I'm just glad we
were able to go to dinner last night. Caroline Reeves, our mechanical
engineering student, normally brings her books and homework, and she is
writing away doing her computations. I don't understand any of it. She didn't
have to do that last night. She could come here and be free spirited. We are
largely a team of faith‑minded people, so never bet a against a coach whose
name is Faith because anything can happen!  
  
Q. Can you talk about your reflexes on Kay Yow and how well you knew her?  
COACH MIMNAUGH: She is just the best. Anybody who was blessed enough to be in
her presence would know how special that was as an opportunity. I was playing
basketball overseas in Australia and I sent my resume out to 50 different
colleges, and the one thing that Kay and I shared is our faith in Christ. I
had put in there that I was part of Athletes In Action. I just had done a tour
with them. I got all these different letters, places that I had never even
really heard of. Obviously, I wrote it on the novel where I was sending my
resume to. But I get a call from America from Kay Yow and she wanted me to
come and be her coach, and I just‑‑ Kay Yow? Kay Yow? Kay Yow? I get to coach
with Kay Yow? I was going crazy!  
The opportunities that she gave me to get into coaching and as a human being,
I will never forget. It's just been a journey to see the kind of perseverance
that she had. When the girls‑‑ they hurt their finger or whatever, I'm like,
you know, Kay Yow went through three battles with cancer. I think your little
finger is going to be just fine, go on out there!  
She taught me about perseverance and keeping the faith and how to run a
program. I've been fortunate to be around some really good coaches, and she
really talked about the wholeness of a program, how to help students get jobs,
how to make sure they have study hall arranged and get all the supports they
need in place.  
I didn't have that back at Loyola University in Chicago. We were all just
smart and left to our own devices. For how she was able to‑‑ to love is one of
the great things that I think she‑‑ I feel bad she never got to win a national
championship, because she deserved that. And the ability to love your players
and not just have it be a business is something that was refreshing to see at
that level because I know it doesn't always exist. That's something I try to
do with my team members is love them.  
I feel really bad, my first head coaching experience I was at University of
Evansville and I had just lost my mom and wasn't really available emotionally
to the kids the way I wanted to be. I try my hardest, but I feel bad for those
kids that they didn't have the kind of experience that I got to enjoy in
college, Kay gave her players, and the experience that these Mustangs get to
enjoy; it's vastly different. It does start with loving your kids, and I think
we got that in place.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, best of luck tomorrow.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon. The LSU Lady Tigers are with us, Coach Caldwell
and players Adrienne Webb, Jeanne Kenney and Theresa Plaisance. We'll start
with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. I just wanted to know with the run you guys made late in the season up
until that loss against Georgia, what was the difference there compared to the
rest of the season that you hit a hot streak?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: The difference in that was we were doing the little things.
Coach put the emphasis on defense and rebounding, and in all those games you
would see that we were outrebounding our opponents and our defense was there,
and we were keeping it to a low percentage game.  
We had to keep doing those things and battling back and it worked out for us
then and we'll see how it works in the future.  
JEANNE KENNEY: I felt we matured following Texas A&M and our Tennessee game.
Losing that Tennessee game in the last couple seconds, it just‑‑ it shows that
you have to play forty minutes, play until that clock hits triple zero. I
thought that was our turning point, and we all started caring a little bit
more about our seniors and this is it. I just felt like we grew up a lot.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: As they said, we started focusing on defense and started coming
together as a team. After the Tennessee loss, we kind of brought ourselves
together in saying that there weren't‑‑ speaking of our seniors, me and
Bianca, we weren't going to let us go out bad in the last six games of our
season.  
  
Q. Adrienne, how do you prepare for such a versatile player like Adrian
Ritchie, who leads her team in stats with points and rebounds?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: It comes down to when we broke it down in practice. We really
keyed in on where she gets her shots and where‑‑ how she receives the ball and
not only focusing on her. We have to lock up on everyone else so that they
don't go off in the game, also.  
But just applying‑‑ it really comes down to defense and knowing personnel, how
they get shots, how they, you know, penetrate and kick. It really breaks down
to knowing that you haveto cover everyone on the floor.  
  
Q. When did you find out you were playing Green Bay? What do you know about
them? I know you check on the stats and stuff, but what have you been
preparing for this week?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Green Bay getting that draw we knew it was going to be a
tough game. Right now they are 29‑2, and that's probably one of the best
records in the nation. Not only are they 29‑2, but they are on a 24‑game
winning streak which is highly recognizable and doesn't go unnoticed by
anyone; and we were ranked one week out of the season and they were ranked
throughout the whole year. They're tough competition and they shouldn't be
taken lightly.  
JEANNE KENNEY: We thought they were going to be a 6 seed, so it's just
preparing for anybody that comes our way. Everyone has done their job to get
to the NCAA Tournament. We're lucky; they're lucky, and just taking it in
stride. We will play whoever comes to us.  
  
Q. You said you all expected them to be a higher seed, so going into this
game what's the attitude? Is there a calm with how y'all have been playing
lately, or is there nervousness that y'all drew a bad seed?  
JEANNE KENNEY: There is never a calmness in playing any team. I feel like we
have prepared and we're going in there prepared, and I feel like confidence is
very important. Our coaching staff has done a great job of preparing us, and
we know Green Bay is a great team.  
You have to keep everybody‑‑ you can't look past anybody or anything.
Everybody is their own team, and we're going to do our best.  
  
Q. Going along with that, a lot of times when we talked to Green Bay
throughout the season they said it doesn't matter where you're ranked, when
you start the tournament it's a clean slate. Is that the mentality that you go
into the tournament with as well?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Definitely it's a clean slate; it's a whole new season. Just
going in there and being humble about being able to have this chance to play
in the NCAA Tournament, it's a great feat. So taking one game at a time, you
can never look over anybody or any play.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Second what Jeanne said, everybody has to go down the same
path. You have to win the same amount of games. We're fortunate to be on our
home court and not everyone has that, but everyone has to win the same amount
of games to get to the Final Four.  
So the bottom line is whoever comes to play that day is going to be the winner
and you keep on moving.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I believe Jeanne and Theresa covered it. Honestly we're lucky
to be in this NCAA Tournament and lucky to be playing at home, but it's a new
season. Seedings don't play a factor in it. You have to go out every game and
play under control.  
  
Q. Talk about the mismatch. Green Bay hasn't seen your height all season
long, so talk about that as a strength for you guys.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We do have a height advantage but on the defensive end we
are going to have to match up with smaller, faster athletes. On offense, we
will stick with the postgame; but defensively the advantage is on them because
we have to be able to defend and guard their outside game and their
penetration and kick and knocking down that 3‑point shot which is deadly for
them.  
  
Q. I know you guys were 8 ‑9 when this happened, but in 2004, LSU host the
first two rounds, played the regional in Washington and the Final Four was in
New Orleans. Is there something extra special of playing at home and the goal
is playing someplace that you know is 80 miles away?   
JEANNE KENNEY: It's definitely extra special, being able to play your whole
way through the first couple of games and Final Four in your home state is
definitely a great perk. We haven't looked that far ahead yet. We got Green
Bay Sunday.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I was at that Final Four game in New Orleans way back when
and it was‑‑ so many years ago! It was a great experience just sitting in the
crowd and growing up in New Orleans, you know, that's‑‑ LSU is who I wanted to
play for, and being able to wear that purple and gold at the Final Four was
tremendous.  
I'm in that spot, having the opportunity to play on that court again is a
great one. But we need to come out and play ever game like it's our last and
keep fightin'; and if we get there, then it's a blessing, and it's a blessing
itself.  
  
Q. I think Green Bay is the 10th ranked opponent you have played this year.
How has that readied you for this tournament?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Right now every team is good, so you have to go into every game
playing your all, knowing‑‑ carrying over what you went over in practice into
the game, because it's win or go home. It's not really who is ranked in the
preseason; it's what you have in front of you right now.  
JEANNE KENNEY: I feel like it doesn't matter about rankings. It's about how
prepared you are and how focused you are and how prepared you are to play the
team that day. Rankings don't matter; so it's one game at a time.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Earlier in the week before we knew what the seedings were,
before anybody knew about the tournament Coach told us in postseason play you
can't worry about the seeding or the name, you just have to come out and stick
to your game plan and play your game, control the things that you can control,
and everything else will fall into place.  
  
Q. Jeanne, we're trying to illustrate how coaches in the tournament now have
great playing backgrounds as well and if the basket was broken down to one
‑on‑one games. How do you think Nikki would do?   
JEANNE KENNEY: She may have just had a baby and torn her Achilles tendon, but
she'll beat anybody that comes her way. Her competitive nature is
unbelievable, and it rubs off on us, too. So that's a good thing. She'll beat
anybody. Be scared!  
  
Q. At practice the other day you guys broke out gold shoes. Is this what
you're wearing tomorrow? Oh, you got 'em out, okay. You guys had the pink
shoes you wore for a while. I love that. It was good luck. Then you lose to
Georgia in the tournament so they are retired, I guess. So now you're starting
a new streak with the gold shoes? What do you hope to get from the gold shoes
and are you superstitious?  
JEANNE KENNEY: I apologize. It's probably not appropriate, but they're the
same brand just a different color. So if you're superstitious it goes a long
way. Doesn't matter about shoes, we just got to come out and play.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We like the style of shoe a lot, so we stuck with the pink
shoe; and after the first couple of games we were winning and we said
everybody wear the pink, wear the same socks, do the same thing, listen to the
same music, keep going.  
We wore down those pink shoes pretty good, so she decided to give us a new
pair. Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. Jeanne, have you or anybody played Nikki one ‑on‑one? How did it come
out?   
JEANNE KENNEY: Last time she played against us she tore her Achilles tendon.
We watched some previous game footage while she was at Tennessee‑‑  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Quite a competitor.  
JEANNE KENNEY: Quite a competitor.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you and good luck.  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. A lot of talk about seeding when you looked at Green Bay's record, 29 ‑2,
and they're an 11 seed. Do you think the committee made a mistake?   
COACH CALDWELL: I looked at the bracket and I thought, we're going to have a
tough road. But the competitive side of me is, you are going to have to play
the best; you're the top 64 teams in the country that's left.  
Like I told Theresa and the rest of the team, that's something that's totally
out of our control, but what is in our control is how hard we are going to
come out and play tomorrow, what's going to be our attitude. Are we going to
have the spirit of a warrior?  
We talked about all those things, but I was also complimentary of the body of
work that our team has done to get to this point, because there was a period
during this season where we could have tanked.  
They stayed the course. They matured. They grew together, and we're just
grateful to be able to come out, and again, practice today while teams aren't
practicing, a lot of teams aren't playing. I've been around for a while where
you can't read too much into the bracket. You just need to read into your
team. That's what I've learned to focus in on is what our team has to do, no
matter who is above us or below us on that basket line.  
  
Q. With Green Bay, what did you know about them this week, and what are you
preparing for when you see them with this game?  
COACH CALDWELL: First, they're a well‑coached team. You don't win consecutive
games, 20‑plus in a row and not be well‑coached and prepared.  
Two losses on the year, that's a pretty impressive record. They've got a team
which we have seen similar style of play when we played Florida Gulf Coast and
Missouri. They can shoot the 3 ball. We've got to be aware of that with the
match‑up zone we're going to have to extend our bigs.  
That's what they were talking about is going to be a challenge for them. They
understand that. We're 6'5" and they're not about, but they're capable and
skilled at their respective post positions. The one thing about Green Bay that
I like a lot is their ability to share the basketball.  
They have a balanced attack. They do a great job of finding the open player,
and they had a very patient way of playing the game. So that's why they've
been very useful. On the flip side, to me, they have been one of the best
defensive teams we have seen in a long time, as far as lending support and not
overextending, not doing anything outside their comfort zone, again, a very
mature basketball team.  
  
Q. You've seen similar teams. You lost to Florida Gulf Coast ‑‑  
COACH CALDWELL: And could have easily lost to Missouri.  
  
Q. What do you do different this time around?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, after the Florida Gulf Coast we were a different team
than we are now. We have started‑‑ and I've said this a lot, we finally
started to like defense. We don't love it, but we definitely started to like
it.  
If we can continue to like it a little bit more today, a little bit more
tomorrow in the shootaround, and keep going, then I think our defensive scheme
can help us. This team has gelled, so that made us different, because now
we're closer.  
We have had a lot of adversity that hit us, but they have also found success,
and they found it in a big‑time way by going through the last six, seven games
of our season and really performing the way we needed them to. We're going to
take all of that with us into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Nikki, with only having eight, nine girls for the majority of the season,
what has been the challenge in keeping them fresh and getting that kind of run
out of them that you did at the end of the season?  
COACH CALDWELL: We tried to keep practice light. We try not to go over two
hours. Their attention span is probably a good 60, 70 minutes on a good day.
So we try to get everything that we need in, in that 60, 70 minutes, and then
at that point it's fun time, like we do competitive shooting drills where
they're against the clock, and we put 'em on teams.  
It baffles me that, you know, I'm from old school where you practice two and a
half, three hours, sometimes over that, Coach Summit back then you didn't have
rules, but I will say this: We are trying to get the most out of them, and
with only having eight bodies in practice you have to be pretty creative.  
The other thing we have done is if they want to watch scout tapes, they can. I
stopped making them do it. I made them‑‑ before, here is your film, watch it,
what have you. Now, if you want to, go ahead; if you don't, don't worry about
it.  
So they now do it on their own and they're owning up to that, so I guess you
kind of trick them because you can watch. But I'm not going to enforce it, and
I will know if they did or didn't. But it's making them take ownership of how
they want their season to play out.  
  
Q. Going off that, y'all have had a lot of injuries, you come in with eight
and you've got this motto "eight is enough." But with less than a day until
the game, what's the final assessment on how healthy this team is and how
y'all will be able to go through the tournament?  
COACH CALDWELL: We're about as healthy as we're going to get; this is it for
us. They understand that. Jeanne Kenney has been banged up all year, but she
has been such a warrior. She has played through every injury there is. Our
strength and conditioning coaches, they understand when we're weight training
let's do everything in moderation.  
We're rehabbing, doing everything we can. But this time of year, there is no
excuses. There is no reason, there is no reason for you to say, I can't go,
unless you're unable to go. But right now every one of our players, all eight
of them, they're ready to go.  
  
Q. How much do you expect Jeanne Kenney to play tomorrow, since she has had
a couple of weeks to rest from your last game. Starting lineup? The bench?
What are your thoughts?  
COACH CALDWELL: Jeanne is somebody who‑‑ she is going to be ready. You can
tell by watching her in the press conference, but she was the first one‑‑ I
think she talked about this after the Tennessee game, she was the first one
after we lost the first to say, "We don't want our seniors to go out this way,
and I'm going to do everything I can to make it a great year for them and
finish off the year for them."  
And she is going to do whatever role we need her to do, off the bench,
starting player. We may have options there, but she definitely is going to be
playing.  
  
Q. You said earlier they don't make a lot of mistakes. I believe they have
the fourth best turnover ratio in the nation. What do you have to do to
counteract that?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, we can't make a lot of mistakes. We can't go into this
game with 20‑plus turnovers. We've got to take care of the basketball as well.
When you have a team that's played as well as they have and have the maturity,
the leadership, the experience, you got to stay true and not have those plays
where you're not focused.  
That's when they're going to be able to capitalize on that maturity. We're a
team that when you look at us on paper, do we press? No. Do we run our
match‑up? Yes. We're simple in our action, but we got to be precise.  
Again, against a team like this, you respect every player that's on the
roster, because this time of year anything and everything can happen.  
  
Q. When Green Bay found out they were going to play LSU they didn't know
much about your team personnel ‑wise, but they knew your name and they grew up
watching you. Is it more exciting to be in the NCAA Tournament as a coach or
as a player?   
COACH CALDWELL: As a player. I will tell you, and sometimes I forget I'm a
coach and I have to be on the sideline, but when you're a player it's
different because you've done all those sprints, you've had those 6 a.m.
workouts, you've cried, you've laughed, you've been on the back of the bus
with your teammates, you've traveled, you had to get up to go to class; you
experience it totally differently than you do as a coach.  
Not that the journey is any less, but I would love to be playing again,
especially, they got new shoes? We had one pair; you wore those out. They get
pink, gold, purple; they get all this stuff. So our contract is very good to
us.  
I will say this: As a player, you have more control over the game. Coaches
will tell you we would love to have control over the game. We have none. We
have 0. We can call a play, but ultimately, do they run it? It's up to them.
It's their choice to execute the game plan or not all you can do is provide
the shell.  
I would love to be playing today especially when you look at where women's
basketball is today. It's definitely a lot more grandiose than it was when I
played.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you say about Theresa's development, her coordination,
her game, just over the last three years? Where does that come from?  
COACH CALDWELL: She'll probably tell you DoBee, her mom. But Theresa is that
player‑‑ I recruited Theresa when I was out at UCLA, so I got a chance to
watch her in high school. I thought, wow, she is an L.T., and my coaches know
I label people, and what does that mean? She is a lazy talent; she is a
talented player.  
But she has lazy in her game. She'll tell you that, too. I've told her this,
but I will say she is no longer L.T. she is talented. She took the off season
in transforming her body, conditioning, making sure she came back in great
shape which transformed her mentality.  
So she is now mentally tougher than when I first met Theresa. She is someone
who‑‑ I don't think she even realizes everything she has done in such a short
period of time as far as statistically where she stands in the record books
here at LSU, but also nationally.  
I put her up against anybody in the country as far as one‑on‑one, her game,
she can shoot the 3, go off the bounce. She can post. So she is skilled in
that area, and she has more upside to her.  
She is one who is starting to like defense. It was interesting that she
commented on the defense because she made the SEC All‑Defensive team which is
great for Theresa, but it was her work ethic over the summer which has
transformed her into the player she is this year.  
  
Q. How surprising to hear you talk about shoes earlier (Laughter). Again,
the point is to illustrate the competitive background of the coaches as
players. If it was one ‑on‑one, coach‑on‑coach bracket, who would you consider
the favorites? How do you think you would do?   
COACH CALDWELL: I'm going to be competitive; and, you know, I'm going to do
whatever I can. I was that type of player and probably still am, if I was out
there. If you needed someone to take the charge, I was going to do it. If you
needed someone to take the extra pass, I was going to do that. I could box
out, I believe, in defense; and I could shoot the ball and triple pass.  
So I would do everything I possibly can to put myself or my team in a
successful situation by doing that and focusing in on the little things. I
know the coaches here, especially with Coach Washington having played; and we
played against each other, you know, you don't get to this point without
having some type of competitive greatness in you.  
There's a lot of opportunities here for our team and for the other teams that
are here if the team if you will, will take on the spirit of their coaches
it's going to be a great weekend, a great tournament all the way through here
at Baton Rouge.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to our first press conference of the Baton Rouge first
and second round site. We will ask Coach Washington for an opening statement
on her season and the game coming up. Then we will take questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Alex, what are the challenges of facing a team that you didn't know a lot
about until recently?  
ALEX BENTLEY: We've got to make sure we pay attention to film. Our coaches do
a great job of preparing us for games. So, yeah, we don't know much about
these opponents, but we're going to know plenty. We have to focus on the game
plan.  
  
Q. You're playing a team you don't know much about, in a school you probably
haven't heard of before this week. Did you get lessons from the men's
tournament, Florida Gulf Coast, nobody heard of of them until yesterday. Do
you respect all your opponents and this is a big deal to be here, this is the
first time.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: You know, we see that everyone in the tournament is capable of
beating anyone. Everyone is very talented. Cal Poly has a lot of strengths.
So, you know, we go into the tournament and we don't take them lightly.
They're a good team and they're here, obviously, so they deserve it.  
ALEX BENTLEY: We just want to take it a game at a time, focus on who we're
playing and take it a game at a time to advance.  
  
Q. The familiarity of being here a year ago, knowing the facilities, knowing
the surroundings, does that help you prepare for this year's tournament?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think it does. I think it's nice that we're familiar with the
area. It's fun to come back and play here. I loved playing here last year, so
we're excited to be here.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I agree with Alex. We loved playing here last year and we're
excited to be back.  
  
Q. Alex, if you would comment about the Naismith Award?  
ALEX BENTLEY: Oh, yeah, I'm very honored. I couldn't have done it without my
teammates.  
  
Q. Alex, your thoughts as a senior now that the NCAA Tournament is here?  
ALEX BENTLEY: It's crazy. This season flew by very quick and it's been fun.
We're excited to be going into the NCAA Tournament. Yeah, it's bittersweet.  
  
Q. You both said you loved playing here last year and it feels like a time
warp for you. Why did you like playing here, the confidence of events last
year or other factors?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I love the facilities here. It's a nice place to play. It was
just fun, yeah.  
ALEX BENTLEY: Yeah, I agree with Mags. The facility is awesome, the place is
great. It's a good area, and there were plenty of fans out there last year, so
an exciting environment.  
  
Q. You said you guys had a good week in practice, able to sit back and
really work on what you guys needed to after the loss to Michigan State.
What's it going to take to make a deep run from what you guys learned after
that loss?  
ALEX BENTLEY: We have to stick to the game plan. That's the plan, take it one
game at a time, listen to our coaching staff.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I agree with Alex.  
  
Q. Penn State has been in the tournament 25 times. Tell me your reasons for
coming to Penn State and what the program means to you. You've never been to a
Final Four. How much unfulfilled are you about not doing that yet?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: One of our coaches, Maren, played on the Final Four team for
Penn State in 2000, so she has been there. And one of the things about me
going to the Penn State program was I believe in Coach Washington, and I
wanted to be a part of it.  
ALEX BENTLEY: A agree with Mags. When Coach was recruiting me, I bought into
what she was telling us. We can rebuild a program, do great things at Penn
State and we all bought into that. We're trying to reach our goals.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Best of luck to you.  
Q.Now that you've had a chance to look at Cal Poly, what are your
impressions of them?  
COACH WASHINGTON: A well‑coached, hard‑working team. They have a pretty
dynamic player that they're centered around in shore measure, their post
player. She's very good. She's tall, big, wild. So they're going to present
some challenges for our post defense, and they surround her with good
perimeter players who like to drive and kick, and when they can get their feet
set.  
They can get open, and once they knock 'em down they're a good‑shooting team.
They have good balance, get through close up driving lanes quickly. They're
very good with their help rotations, and they're aggressive in defending the
way they like to defend.  
So, as Alex said, every team in the tournament is good. They know how to play
to their strengths, whatever those are; and that's one thing that we've
noticed in watching film of Cal Poly is they play to their strengths. They do
the things they do well and they're consistent with those things. I'm certain
it's going to be a challenge to our team Sunday, tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wanted your take on my question to the players as well? I
wondered if you had talked to Nikki since you got here and if you're still
talking about babies this year? What's going on?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, I feel the same way that they did, you know.
When you get into the NCAA Tournament, one of the things that's cool is if you
get sent to a great basketball environment. It was fun playing here last year
because the crowd was into the game. They're knowledgeable fans. They showed
up for all the games. It's just a great environment.  
Like they said, the facilities here are outstanding; it's a great arena to
play in. Our kids, our team, our coaching staff, we like playing in great
basketball environments. We would much rather play in a filled arena than play
in an empty arena.  
So it's great. The people here, that southern hospitality is outstanding. It's
just a fun place to be. When we saw the bracket come out we're like cool,
we'll go back to the south and the 80 degree weather and great fans. We were
pleased.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WASHINGTON: Oh, Caldwell, I thought you were talking about Nikki Greene
on our team. I was like, she didn't have a baby! Nikki‑‑ we were just out
there talking about family, and her daughter is 1 year old now. My daughter is
3. So, yeah, we have a lot of parallels in our careers and in our personal
lives.  
It's always cool to catch up and to be able to talk‑‑ moms, we can talk about
our kids forever. You don't have to worry about us having nothing to talk
about when we're together.  
  
Q. You said the other day the team was healthy and everything. Any chance we
could see the mother hen, as you put it, playing anytime in the tournament?  
COACH WASHINGTON: No, she has not been cleared. She got cleared to play about
30 seconds senior night, but medically she is not able to go.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you were pleased when you saw where you guys were being
sent. In a way ‑‑ maybe we covered this ground last year, but in a way would
you like to see the tournament evolve to where the men's is where you have the
eight sites instead of trying to drum up support by playing at home arenas?   
COACH WASHINGTON: If we grow to that point, that would be awesome; and clearly
that's not where we are. I don't think it takes away from the tournament at
all. It makes for some fantastic basketball environments, LSU being one, you
know. All 16 first and second round sites are pretty good basketball
environments.  
So as a coach and as a competitor, I don't mind. I don't mind the challenge of
going on the road and playing. We do it all year long. Half our games are on
the road anyway. It's just fun. It's basketball, and it's the best tournament
in women's basketball. So we're excited to be a part of it.  
  
Q. What are the challenges of facing a team who may seem like it has nothing
to lose up against you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, we don't look at it that way. We don't look at it as
Cal Poly is a team that has nothing to loose. We look at it as Cal Poly is a
very good team that has earned the right to be in the tournament and earned
the right to play against us, and we look at it as we have earned the right to
play against Cal Poly.  
Our perspective is we know we are going to see a formidable and worthwhile
opponent and we prepare for them just that way. We don't prepare any other
way, and we think it's two good teams that will tip off at 4:15 tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sounds like you are happy with the team's mind ‑set coming here,
opponent, all those things being in the right frame of mind; is that correct?
  
COACH WASHINGTON: Absolutely, absolutely, seedings and all that stuff, I think
that's great for fans, great for media, something to talk about, gives an aura
of, you know, David and Goliath in every single game. I think that's what
makes the tournament exciting, because you have that element.  
But as competitors, we don't‑‑ Penn State, we don't see it that way. We don't
look at the seedings and say this is supposed to happen or that is supposed to
happen. They got the Player of the Year in their conference, and she is very
good. They've got some very good players and we haven't seen 'em.  
So we've got to come into this game and understand that we've got to execute
our game plan. I would assume they're looking at it the wait a minute say.
It's basketball, you know, it's basketball, it's not about who is supposed to
do what. When you start looking at sports like that, who is supposed to do
stuff, that's‑‑ you know, that's not who we are. That's not who Penn State is.  
We are not looking and thinking about making a deep run or any of that kinda
stuff. We're concerned about being our best tomorrow against Cal Poly, and
then whatever happens at about 7:00 tomorrow night, we'll start talking about
that. But right now the only thing we're focused on is how we're going to slow
down Schlemer. How we're going to keep their guards out of the paint, and how
we need to execute and what we need to execute to be successful.  
  
Q. They've had some kids hurt. How crucial do you think depth is going to be
in this ballgame?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'm hoping it's something we can draw upon. They do have a
couple of injuries and probably don't have‑‑ certainly don't have the rotation
that they would like coming into this game. I'm hoping that our depth and our
ability to continue to throw a bunch of different looks and bodies on the
floor will be a positive for us.  
  
Q. When a team is as good as yours offensively shoots 22% in a game, that is
obviously noteworthy. How much of a concern is the last outing?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We did not eat our Wheaties on that day, so we'll change our
bio. We will have a different pregame meal and we will be ready to go.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WASHINGTON: Nothing too exotic. We don't need upset stomachs, having
this Cajun food.  
  
Q. You talked about Schlemer, how important is Nikki's play going to be,
especially staying out of foul trouble for you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: When she is on the floor, things run smoother for us. So we
need her on the floor. But I have confidence in our post rotations. Nikki has
been in foul trouble a number of games this year. So if it happens, we're used
to it. We know how to play in that situation, in those scenarios.  
But certainly when she is out there, she is a difference‑maker for us, and
hopefully she can play a lot of minutes.  
  
Q. We are at the stage of women's basketball where there are a lot of
coaches who were successful players. I wonder if you ever ‑‑ do you ever
wonder when you run into some of those women, if we were one‑on‑one how would
we do today or how do you think you would do against Nikki or things like
that?   
COACH WASHINGTON: We do like the guys, whose got the rings. Whoever has the
most wins‑‑ I don't know. Mostly we look at‑‑ thank God we played back then
because if we had to play now against these girls and athletes and how tall
they are, we would be in trouble, little point guards, me, Dawn Staley, and
Jolette. We would be in trouble. We're thankful that we're old and out of
shape and can't run around on the court with the young girls.  
THE MODERATOR: Good players make great coaches. Coach, thanks a lot.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Green Bay. We are joined by Coach
Borseth, Lydia Bauer, Sarah Eichler and Adrian Ritchie.  
COACH BORSETH: We're excited to be here, nice, warm weather. Inside your
buildings are a little bit cold, you might want to turn the heat up.  
Excited to be here, worked hard obviously to get our opportunity to compete at
this level, and we're ready for the games to begin.  
  
Q. Obviously, you guys have been around these teams making the NCAA
Tournament experiences. What has the mood been like, and what is it like
preparing for this?  
LYDIA BAUER: We're excited. As seniors, this is our fourth time here. We want
to make our last run, a good one. Just the excitement has been fun to see and
bringing the younger girls, seeing them as well. We're just excited to be
here.  
SARAH EICHLER: Obviously, there is a lot of excitement that goes around this
tournament as we've matured, us and the senior class. It has been more
excitement than nerves this year, so that's nice to see, and all the energy
that the younger girls bring to our team.  
We get along so well and it's nice to be able to spend some time with them
away from Green Bay in an exciting time like where there is no pressure from
school. We're on spring break, so we can hang out and have fun. It's a special
time of year for us.  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Also, just being here is something we don't take for granted,
and we put in the work all season and now we're here. We can just now take
this moment to prepare for LSU.  
  
Q. Adrian, for those of us who haven't had a chance to watch your team play
this year, you shoot a lot of 3 ‑point shots, and I think you are the leader
in that category. What kind of a weapon is that for your offense, and is it
the trademark of what you do?   
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Trademark is strong. It's definitely a good thing for us that
we're balanced, and literally 1 through 5 on our starting 5 can shoot the
three, and that makes it hard for other teams to guard us, and match‑up
problems, and we have that one more pass.  
If they close up on one person, we can one pass, one pass, so no matter who it
is, we believe that girl can knock down the shot. That's a reason why we got
here this year and basically our whole careers here and the fact that we can
all shoot is one of our strengths for sure.  
  
Q. Adrian, they mentioned when they came up here about their size and that
being an advantage, but they talked about your speed and having to match that.
Do you think that can be an advantage for you guys going into this game and
what you do?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Yeah, we hope that our defense turns into offensive transition
and we can beat teams down the floor. We take pride in being in better
condition and we play forty minutes. I think a lot of teams can hang with us
for a certain amount of time and in most cases we outplay them or we can last
longer.  
We hope to use that against LSU and we hope to push them in transition.
They're a fast, athletic team and we look to make sure we can control that
aspect of their game and use it in our game to benefit us.  
  
Q. Sarah, what can you and the other post players do on Theresa Plaisance?
What do you see out of her as a player?  
SARAH EICHLER: Obviously, when you look at LSU‑‑ yeah, I got it. We deal in
numbers more than names, making sure I knew what number she was.  
Obviously, she is a big presence and we don't play many 6'5" people in our
conference, and that's definitely going to be a challenge for us, being a
smaller lineup. But that physicality is going to be a big part of this game,
and if we can match that and play at their level inside, and she'll be our
point of focus. But we will do an okay job of balancing out.  
  
Q. Sarah, if I read Justin's notes right, this is your 132nd game, more than
any player in program history. Did you anticipate playing right away when you
came here? What have you thought of that run?  
SARAH EICHLER: Obviously, it's a huge thing to play in the most games in the
history. It's a really cool thing to be a part of, and I think coming in my
freshman year you kinda come in and you just do what you have to do at that
point. There were some injuries that ended up leading to me starting in the
first place and playing in my freshman year and that kind of built the
confidence in my team around me that I was able to play in those games.  
Hannah came back after she broke her finger, and she got her starting spot
back. But staying in the lineup as one of the top 6, players was huge for me
and my confidence. I think playing with these girls for those four years has
built our team chemistry.  
For playing that long together, us three know each other very well and it's
beneficial going into games, knowing where Lydia is going to cut; and Adrian
likes the catch the ball when she is ready to shoot. Those little things that
some teams don't have because there aren't as many seniors or people that
haven't been playing together as long as us. So I think that gives us an
advantage.  
  
Q. Talk about the challenge coming here and playing on their home court,
such a big game from across country to do that?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Last year we played Iowa State on Iowa State's floor, so that
experience is something we can build off of, and we won't be as nervous coming
into tomorrow's game, playing LSU on their home floor. So it's something we
have done before, so we can eliminate those nerves and focus on just playing
and playing hard for forty minutes.  
  
Q. Adrian, you guys lost a close game last year, something that serves as
motivation going into this year?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Absolutely, I saw a picture where me and Megan Lukan, our
point guard, were looking off, and in the distance behind us you can see
Kentucky celebrating. That's motivation for me because I can see how close we
were to that upset and to the Sweet 16.  
It's definitely in the back of our minds and we're competitors, Green Bay.
We're used to winning and we like to win. It's the tradition of excellence and
the culture that we can't get enough of. It's definitely something when
everybody is on the line, especially for us three seniors. And now there are
two other teammates who are seniors; we're going to put everything on the
line, and we're ready to play against LSU for sure.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about the long winning streak you had. Not in the context
of ‑‑ obviously doesn't mean anything if you don't continue to win, but what
does it mean in the context of what does it symbolize in terms of the culture
of your program, growth, culture, chemistry?   
LYDIA BAUER: Coming in as freshman, that's something that you learn quickly
about the tradition and the culture of winning, and it's something that is
built into you over time. I think it's something we continue to pass on to the
younger girls.  
The winning streak isn't so much our priority. Our priority is to focus on the
next game to keep winning and to put Green Bay on the road map in these
tournaments.  
  
Q. Adrian, with having seven freshmen on this team and going back to your
freshman year, how important is this experience to keep that culture going
after you five seniors are gone?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Very important. Seems like every year we have been here
someone graduates, and you say, how can you fill that position and that void?
So while you're here with your freshmen, as long as our career lasts you pass
on those values and you show them by examples and you hustle forty minutes for
every single time and not just show up to practice sometimes mentally. You are
there every single day and those are the morals and the intangibles that not
everyone against you see.  
But the girls who share your locker with, those are the ones who know who you
are, and if she can see you fighting every day, especially the freshmen look
at the juniors and the seniors, that's why we need the program that we have at
Green Bay, and that's why we keep it going.  
  
Q. You look at the past five or six years, even before Coach Borseth, how
close do you all feel about changing the perception as not one of the best mid
‑major, but a program that should be in the top‑20 mentioned every year. Do
you feel like you're close? What do you feel you have to do to change that?   
ADRIAN RITCHIE: I definitely feel that we're close. In our minds, we don't
think we're a mid‑major. We strive to be our best. According to the national
rankings right now, we're near 20th; and in the past we've been up to 9, 11,
things like that.  
It's not so much for us to reach for a number, to define success as far as our
season goes or something like that. But we see the progress that we've made
freshmen year getting an at‑large bid after we were upset in our conference
tournament to now we're seniors and expected to be here. At least from our
standpoint, we expect to win that Horizon Tournament and expect to make a deep
run in the tournament.  
I think we've come somewhere. We feel we have put our impact on it moving
forward and we just hope that the country can see that from their point of
view as well.  
  
Q. Adrian, can you talk about No. 10 and No. 5? And the challenges they
present on the perimeter from the outside?  
ADRIAN RITCHIE: Sure, No. 10 is a very good player. Coach made apoint that he
notices how other teams pay attention to No. 10, and I think that says a lot
about the player she is.  
Their opponents don't want to see her get going. She is a senior leader on
that team and we know that she can do damage. We're going to have to pay
attention to her on that weak side and make sure we are closing out on her
hard so she can't get open three's.  
No. 5 is the point guard; everything runs through her. She as a nice pull‑up.
She is a lefty and those two‑‑ how we can play defense on those two will sort
of dictate how their offensive possessions go and the rhythm that they can
find. They're two very important pieces of why they are a good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Kevin, I know defensively everything you guys have done this year. How
big of a test will you be for LSU defensively?  
COACH BORSETH: They provide elements that we haven't seen before. When you
dissect a team you see kids around the basket that are big, that can play both
offensively and defensively. We haven't seen that size yet this year. You look
at the perimeter and you see the quickness and the strength of the quickness
that they have, you know, we haven't seen a lot of that either.  
They pose problems inside and out for us, both offensively and defensively.
The key for us is to do what we do and see how we shake out.  
  
Q. You play LSU every once in a while in the NCAA Tournament. Talk about
going back to Green Bay after spending a few seasons away.  
COACH BORSETH: I was in Green Bay for 9 years and spent five years at the
University of Michigan. Green Bay was home. My children were born there;
family is close to there. Being at LSU, being at Green Bay are two different
animals. They really are.  
Things on the upper stage in the BCS level are really‑‑ it's all‑‑ I felt it
was all about the job, not about your life. I thought from my perspective that
living was important and I get a better chance to live my life at Green Bay
than on the higher stage, and it didn't have anything to do particularly with
University of Michigan.  
LSU put me in the same feeling, but I feel at home in Green Bay and I'm able
to live and my life just feels better.  
  
Q. Kevin, taking a Green Bay team back to the NCAA Tournament, first time
since Natalie and Nicole, what did that mean to you to prepare for a
tournament again not only as a coach, but being in Green Bay?  
COACH BORSETH: It's funny, I don't know that I'm the guy that prepared them, I
feel like Matt should be up here, because these are the kids that he's groomed
over the last three years. He had the luxury of having the players that I had
for the last four or five years, and now I've got the luxury of having the
players that he's got and these kids are special.  
We were inspecting film today and I said, I wonder how we're going to cover
this one situation, and they said, well, we talked about it and this is what
we're going to do; and I said, really, you ought to tell me how you're going
to do it, too, because that might not be a bad idea!  
They've got a lot of plans. They've been really well taught over the last
three years of their career. In some regards, I've injected some of my
believes; a lot of things have been instilled over the course of time that
they have had here, so in some regards I'm along for the ride.  
  
Q. Coach, I look across the seeding lines and Marist is playing and they
have had success in this tournament. They're stuck in the 12 line. This
program has made a Sweet 16 run; they've pushed Kentucky. What does it take to
maybe change the perception this time of year where a seeding line can matter
‑‑  
COACH BORSETH: That's really a good question. I think in the men's field in
particular you can see what the Butler men have done, they've got to a Final
Four. I think for a mid‑major to be recognized as someone who deserves a
higher seed you're going to have to play against really good competition, the
LSUs and the big‑time schools, and you're going to have to beat them; and,
two, somebody is going to have to make a run to the Final Four to get there.  
Before anything like that happens, I think we're all probably going to be in
the same category. Doesn't change how we feel about our program. I'm quite
certain Gonzaga and Marist and Green Bay feel good about our programs. We want
to have more respect, but I think our kids are blue‑collar kids who work hard,
really proud of what we accomplished.  
I think when we play against teams, they have a great deal of respect for us
and they have to prepare for us. But until one of us makes a Final Four run
and beats teams in preseason‑‑ Green Bay did that the year they got the
at‑large bid, ironically they pushed Michigan out. It was a bittersweet moment
for me.  
But that year they had beaten Penn State and some bigger schools in the
process which had gotten the credibility up high, so preseason beating good
teams is pretty important.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got a very experienced lineup, several seniors in the
starting lineup and Green Bay 5 straight NCAA Tournament experiences. How does
that experience help you coming into the situation?  
COACH BORSETH: It means a lot. It doesn't guarantee you're going to win or
lose a game, but when the players step on the floor they're not going to be on
a foreign planet. They've been in hostile environments before, been successful
doing that. They've been in the game when the‑‑ has been around their in the
case. They've seen some of this stuff before. It can potentially end your
season.  
I think they're wise enough in that regard to savor the moment, play as good
as you can during that period of time. Doesn't guarantee you win or lose a
game, but it does guarantee that you play well; and I think that's what you
want to do at this time of year is to play your best.  
  
Q. You're going to do some things to contain Theresa Plaisance. How
difficult is she to defend in? She can pop out any, the perimeter, bring the
ball up, play the post ‑‑  
COACH BORSETH: She is not the only one you got, either, that's the bad news. A
bunch of 'em have the ability to score, but she presents a challenge because
of her‑‑ she is so multifaceted. If you guard her with someone small, they
take her down low and throw it over the top. If you play behind her she reels
around and scores. If you don't cover her properly on a ball screen, she picks
and pops and buries a three.  
We do what we do. I don't think you're going to see any smoke and mirrors from
Green Bay. Our kids are going to sell everything they have and do what we do.  
Interesting, at the beginning of the year one of the games we were playing I
said to the players, we're going to‑‑ the key is to dance with who brought
you, and one of the players looked at me like, what generation did you come
from? But in all reality, that's what we're going to do. I don't know that you
get to this stage and try to pull a rabbit out of your hat or magic up your
sleeve. You have to do what you do and do it really well. I think all the
teams in the tournament have to be able to do that.  
So while we're focusing on Theresa and the players on their team which are
very good and very well‑coached. On the other side of the ball, we got to make
sure we do things to make them have to guard us equally as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you were talking about strength of schedule. You probably didn't
help schedule this year's games, but is that something you might talk to Nikki
about after of the game and ask to schedule them preconference?  
COACH BORSETH: This is probably a decision for a different day with the
conferences starting to expand now and all the TV revenue. My opinion, all the
revenue that's involved now there is a potential for your conferences to get
so bid they might add more conference games which might limit the number of
games we can get.  
We're feeling the squeeze in our area Big 10 with the Wisconsin's and the
schools there. They're not sure how big that's going to get or nonconference
games they will be able to schedule. The key for us is to be able to play
nonconference games like that on our home floor for two reasons. One, it gives
us a chance to be able to compete on the big stage to build our resume down
the road; and, two, to play on our court to allow our fans to be able to see
good teams come up, because we've got great basketball fans in Green Bay.  
Just like in Baton Rouge, they want to see the teams come to town. If LSU
would be one of those teams that would be willing to trek north to Green Bay
we would serve 'em some nice, warm snow. It is as warm outside as it is
inside. It would certainly be nice to do that at some point down the road
because good competition is fun for our players and fun for our fans to be
able to watch.  
  
Q. I can tell just from the short time that those three were up there,
they're smart and you mentioned they come up with a game plan of how to fix a
situation. Is your team a heady team, smart? Do they win games that way, or
are they as talented as these mid ‑major programs?   
COACH BORSETH: They're gritty. They're really gritty. They literally sell the
farm with every play. They're a determined bunch of young ladies. I don't know
that they're overathletic. They're relatively skilled, but they're driven,
smart, they understand‑‑ kinda funny because I'll come in at halftime and I'll
ask one of the assistant coaches what is that play they're calling, and one of
those guys will yell, they're playing No. 2; and they're listening when
they're on the court. So they are smart, and they're gritty and that gives
them a chance in every game they play.  
  
Q. Nikki talked about the size and talked about matching up with your speed.
Do you see that as an advantage?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know who has more speed. You try to get in a running
match with 10 and 32 and find out how fast you are. Those kids are pretty
athletic. I don't know where our advantages lie, I'm not sure. Our advantages
lie, from our perspective in our grit. We're gritty and driven. Our kids are
pretty smart. I think that's the area that have to play off. I don't know that
we're bigger or stronger than them or faster than them, I don't know that.
When we get on that floor that whole thing is going to come into play. The
good news is there is only one ball, only one person can have it at one time.  
So our key is to guard that ball, and on the offensive court we have to share
it to create an advantage and make shots because you can't hold teams to zero.
This isn't soccer and it's not hockey. Points are going to go on the board, so
we're going to play well on both ends of the court.  
  
Q. How much of that grit is naturally there when they get on campus? Past
couple of years under Matt there was a red shirt policy in place there, these
girls come from the similar size high school programs in the area. They
obviously see each other. They come in with grit when you get them?  
COACH BORSETH: I think some of it is grit, but a lot of it is a learned‑‑ it's
a trained response. It really is. We're going to roll the ball on the floor
and you have to get three in a row and you stay out there until you get three
in a row. So you figure out quickly that's what you have to do. They're well
trained, highly intelligent people, very good communicators, very easy to work
with.  
They weren't recruited by big schools and not that they came in with a chip on
their shoulder, but they were young ladies who desired to compete at the
college level, and so when they get a chance to play against bigger schools
they strap up and play a little harder because they want to be like those
players.  
They're a fun group to be around and it's‑‑ the drive that comes with it,
again, part of it is training and part of it is burning desire inside, too.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on the kind of winning that this team has done and
what that signifies, understanding that it doesn't matter tomorrow.  
COACH BORSETH: It's been amazing. I remember the first year‑‑ second year I
was in Green Bay we went to Old Dominion and they had won five or six
championship in a row and Wendy Larry was coaching out there, and I thought
that was amazing!  
At whatever level, that's amazing and for us to be able to do it for 15 years
is unthinkable, it really is. We have been challenged the entire while,
different programs have challenged us, but our kids have done a great job of
rising to that challenge. For the players leaving here now it's a feather in
their cap.  
Tiffany Moore was a gal that played at Green Bay for me, and probably one of
the best players I had, sent me a note after we graduated four of our best
players, all seniors, and she said, I don't know, you don't know how we're
going to do, but, Coach, for whatever reason the players in this program know
what's expected of them and somebody will rise to that challenge.  
I think that's happened every year there, players underneath the underscored
kids‑‑ somebody made reference to the seven freshmen are watching and waiting
and learning in the process. It's been a fun ride so far. But like you said,
it's past now for the most part. We have to build for the future as time
presses forward.  
  
Q. Can you recall the first NCAA Tournament game against LSU inEugene. They
were number one seed. Did that game in any way help your program? I don't know
you didn't win, but does that help your program that you gave them a tough
game?  
COACH BORSETH: That was the team that I was referring to that was probably our
best team, the little guard was tough and Elizabeth picked her, first time
down the court. I said, what are you doing guarding her so close?  
Boom, she picks her pocket. Then she threw the ball back to that girl. She
went to the length of the floor and rammed it to the rim in a hurry. I said,
we probably shouldn't do that. But it was a close game. I don't know if this
was 7 or 10 points, but we played 'em close.  
Our kids were gritty at that time. If you draw a comparison, I think the
comparison with the amount of grit is similar to the kids that you see right
now. You know what you're going to get when they step on the court.  
From a coaching perspective, I think you learn that you can turn up the volume
and listen because the kids kind of go. They can't hear a lot they're just in
a zone. So for me going through that period of time in that game against LSU,
tomorrow's game will draw some similarities, in some regards.  
  
Q. Do you hope the awareness will give you a little more notoriety?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know. That's the thing, I don't know. I think we beat
Washington that year out there. We haven't played in any neutral sites. That's
probably the bad part. Every time we played in a neutral site I think we won.
But I think that was the year that was probably our best team and it's the
first NCAA game we'd won, so maybe turned a few heads.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

THE MODERATOR: Coach McGraw, an opening statement and questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH McGRAW: I was really pleased with our perimeter defense. I think our
goal was to guard the three‑point line, and we did a good job of finding
Printy and Dixon on the three‑point line. Overall, I thought our press
bothered them a little bit at the beginning of the game. Got us off to a good
start to start the second half.  
But Kayla McBride was phenomenal in the first half against the zone. She got
any shot she wanted and was making just about every shot she took. But Sky did
such a great job of running the team, forcing the tempo. Getting the ball into
K‑Mac's hands in the first half, and just an overall great floor game by
Skylar, and a fantastic game by Kayla.  
  
Q. Kayla, 24 points in the first half. Your previous career best was against
Connecticut, and your new career best in the NCAA Tournament. Talk about
getting those kind of numbers against really tough competition?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think I owe it to my coach and teammates because without them
I wouldn't be getting open shots. But I think it shows the balance on this
team. When you look at what Jewell did, had her career high the last game. Sky
was able to put up big numbers, along with Natalie Achonwa, it just shows how
balanced we are and how unselfish this team is.  
  
Q. Skylar, on that late and ‑one there, it seemed like you almost looked to
the crowd and said this is our house. I wonder if that's what you said, one,
and two, more so, what was it about this team that allowed it to finish the
season without ever losing on the road?   
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think this team has played in so many tough atmospheres. We
played (Indiscernible) versus Tennessee, and any Big East road game we played
in, we got their best crowds. So we're used to the experience that we've had
playing on the road. Iowa was another tough environment we had to overcome if
we wanted to keep dancing.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on it a second ago, but you decided to open with I
think it was a one ‑two‑two press. If I'm mistaken, correct me. But you opened
with the press, and then it seemed to generate some turnovers. Talk about that
decision to use it and then pull it off?   
COACH McGRAW: It was man‑to‑man, and we were trying to double team with our
best defender Ariel Braker. She was trying to get it out of Logic's hands, and
we were leaving Doolittle open, and I thought it was pretty effective to start
off.  
  
Q. Kayla followed up her first double ‑double this season with her career
high in scoring. How much better is the team when she's playing the way she
has this weekend?   
COACH McGRAW: I think when you make that many shots, you're going to look at
it offensively, and everything will seem to flow a lot better. I was really
pleased with the three‑point shot. She's more of a mid‑range jump shooter. But
she got to the rim a little bit, shot some threes and mixed it up offensively
tonight. So it makes it easier when somebody's getting us off to a good start
like that and it takes the pressure off of everybody else.

### [Bethany Doolittle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25279)

### [Samantha Logic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22973)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

NOTRE DAME  74  
IOWA  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH BLUDER: I guess I want to thank our fans for supporting us in this
championship. For them to come out tonight, 8:40 at night tip, and for them to
come out and support us really means a lot. I'm appreciative of our
administration also for putting on this tournament and giving us the
opportunity to play at home again.  
Tough to say goodbye to three really good seniors. Just a tremendous group of
women, great leaders. That's probably the hardest thing about tonight. It's
not really the losing; it's just that the season is over, and you don't ever
get to coach them again, so that's kind of tough.  
We struggled to score tonight. Which the first half we scored okay; second
half we couldn't buy a bucket. For us to go 0 from the three‑point line is
pretty unusual. Turned the ball over too many times, gave up too many
offensive rebounds, and you have to expect almost a near perfect night to beat
a team like Notre Dame, and we just didn't have it tonight.  
  
Q. Samantha or Bethany, it seemed in the first half you were able to keep
pace with them. But it seemed every time they needed to answer, they had an
answer, and then it was a little overwhelming. What was it they were doing
that allowed them to do that?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think they're just a really good team. Obviously, we were
looking to stop their runs and go on runs of our own. But some of the time we
couldn't do that as well as we could have or should have, and they capitalized
on that.  
  
Q. Samantha, can you talk a little bit about what a challenge it was to try
to run the team and on one hand, scoring, rebounding, assists all those
categories were there. But you had a tough time with the turnovers as a team
and personally. What did they do defensively that made that part of the
challenge?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think that trap gave me a lot of trouble. I didn't give us a
chance. In a lot of those situations, I didn't handle them the right way. But
they had pretty good ball pressure, and I let it disrupt me too much. That's
pretty much what it was. I wasn't composed enough, and we, as a team, at some
points weren't composed enough. We turned the ball over, and our time for
opportunities to kind of chip into the lead a little bit and then let them
score again. So it was a defensive effort along with the turnovers.  
  
Q. Can you talk about where you build from this and how do you look ahead in
the next couple of years?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think we have a good core coming back. Obviously, losing our
three seniors is a huge hit to us. Two starters with names like Morgan
Johnson, Jaime Printy, that's not going to be easy to fill, but I think we
really have some good people to come back and build off of, a lot of
experience still coming back, and we're a team that's willing to work really
hard. We work really hard all the time: Preseason, postseason, during the
season, in the summer. So we just have to keep that attitude and build on what
we have.  
  
Q. Lisa, can you talk a little bit about how much potential Samantha has
over the next two years to grow as a player?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, she's had the advantage of being able to come in here and
be a starter since her freshman year, and I think that's a real advantage to
just have that experience to come in here and play. She's been able to play in
three NCAA Tournament games now, I think that's going to be tremendous for
her. This year I think her leadership, she deferred a little bit off of the
floor, and rightfully so, to our seniors, and next year she's going to have to
pick up some of the slack there, become more of an off‑court leader, a vocal
leader, as well as an on‑floor leader.  
So I think the future‑‑ and I know Sam turned the ball over too many times
tonight, but I love having her lead our team, and I have full confidence in
her leading our team the next two years.  
  
Q. We talked about how balanced Notre Dame was. But just talk about how
tough it was to guard someone like Kayla McBride? It seemed when you guys got
a run, she always had an answer. And it just seemed that you cut it to six or
you cut it to eight, she would hit a couple of big three ‑pointers at the end?
  
COACH BLUDER: In the first half, that was the case. She had 24 points in the
first half. We held her to four in the second half. So a little bit better job
there. So, yeah, she got loose for too many shots, especially in the zone. She
had three threes in the zone, once again Player in the first half. And she
wasn't shooting that great from three‑point range coming into this game, but
we proved to everybody that she certainly is somebody that needs to be
reckoned with outside there.  
Yeah, every time we kind of got it close in the first half, she'd come up with
a big score in the second half. Got stagnant, and then they scored from the
free‑throw line way too much in the second half for us.  
  
Q. Now that you've spent a long weekend with Notre Dame and seen them up
close twice. I wonder if you could assess their National Championship
chances?  
COACH BLUDER: I think they're tremendous. That's what I told the team after
the game is that it was a great season for us. Don't hang your head about this
loss. Everybody seems to always remember your last game. It's not right
sometimes to always remember your whole season by one game.  
But I told them, we lost to a great team out there today, a team that's
probably going to be playing in the National Championship game. They have such
great balance. They have really good teamwork. They pass the ball really well,
and probably don't get enough credit for their defense. I think their defense
really bothered us, especially their pressing. They kind of set the tone with
that. Their ball pressure was very good. Their help side defense was very
good. They're not that tall, but they do a good job fronting and providing
help side.  
So I think that they have a great team that plays well together and they have
all the components. Don't have that huge center, but they make up for it.  
  
Q. What did you say to the seniors as they came out?  
COACH BLUDER: There is not a lot of time when they're coming to the bench
there. I told Jaime not to cry. She started to do that. But I just feel
appreciative of everything they've done for us in the last four years.  
  
Q. What is your view of the Iowa future after this tournament and this
season?  
COACH BLUDER: You certainly hate to lose those three seniors. Two of them are
starters for us. But at the same time, Bethany played really well for us
tonight. I think she showed signs of what she can do on a consistent basis.
That's when you go to Bethany. She's had these sporadic performances, but we
need consistent play out of Bethany. And hopefully we'll get that out of her
this summer and next year, because I think she's got a lot of ability.  
Sam at point guard, great experience there, so I feel good. We're sitting good
at the point and the center position. Theairra had a nice game for us at
times, takes the ball hard for us and doesn't back down from anybody. So we
returned three starters, but you could almost say four starters with Melissa
Dixon coming back as well. So I feel good about what we have returning.  
  
Q. What was different about Bethany's play tonight? Was it just confidence?
Was she more open? What did she do differently to get you guys the big buckets
there?  
COACH BLUDER: Bethany has been like that most of the year. It's like she can
have some really, really good games, and then kind of hide for the next five
games. I think Bethany understood that we needed her tonight. She gets some
confidence. She hits a couple of those short corner shots and gets confidence,
and it's amazing what confidence can do for a kid. That's how you get on a
roll offensively.  
We just couldn't get Melissa on a roll tonight, and couldn't build the
confidence there. So I'm really happy with Bethany having the game that she
did tonight.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: We are thrilled to be here this morning. Had the opportunity to
work last night and that was a lot of fun for us. I just remind the team
before we came in here about, that was a great victory last night. That is a
team that beat Duke just two weeks ago, a team that beat Big Ten championship
Penn State. That was a really good win for our program.  
Really, really happy for our seniors, proud of our basketball team but also
proud of our fans. The Hawkeye fans were amazing last night. We had the
third‑best attended site in America of the 16 sites. Again, it was loud in
here. They were behind us. We could feel it. Their energy was wonderful, and
just looking for that same type of energy and atmosphere in here again
tomorrow night against Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Seven wins over ranked opponents this season, and you look at the way you
finished last night, clearly when you're on, you can pretty much play with
anyone. How do you bottle that and get that for 40 minutes like you'll
probably need tomorrow night?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think you're going to‑‑ you know, could be the last
game of your season. You don't want it to be. So if tomorrow doesn't get you
up for anything, nothing really would.  
Playing against a team like Notre Dame, obviously a great team and
nationally‑recognized for being a great team. Just you've got to be ready for
it. We had nothing to lose going to this game and we are just really excited
about the opportunity that we got.  
  
Q. Morgan, talk a little bit, right now Florida Gulf Coast, everybody is
talking about them because they are Cinderella and they have shocking people.
Do you ever think about how it might be good for your sport overall if you
guys could pull off a win over Notre Dame, because people would pay
attention.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think it's a great opportunity, looking at the bracket
yesterday, there was just four upsets in the bracket. Just for women's
basketball in general, it would just pull, draw the nation's eyes on us as a
program and women's basketball in general. So it's a great opportunity for us
to prove that women's basketball has something to give to this nation.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, you're veteran players, you played AU ball at
the highest levels. What's the different between the kind of elite teams, not
necessarily UCONN or Notre Dame, but the teams that make it to the Sweet16 and
make it to the Elite 8 and teams that just get in the tournament, what is that
next step? What do you see in those teams that are not there?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I would say playing for 40 minutes. You have to be able to
play 40 minutes. In a tournament, obviously it's March Madness and anything
can happen. You have to be ready for 40 minutes of basketball, and you have to
put your best game on, otherwise, you can go home.  
We have seen it in the men's tournament, two seeds have been knocked out and
one seed has been knocked out, so you just have to be ready and take every
possession like it's the most important one.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think we are consistent in fundamentals all the time. They
don't have to worry about boxing out because that is something that's a
sustained thing through their entire season. So just having those fundamentals
consistently are important to get them to the next level so they can focus on
other things.  
  
Q. Morgan, there's a difference in the rebounding numbers; can you talk
about how important the rebounding will be for you and how do you close those
numbers out?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think we just have to execute on boxing out, and I know
that's really always the answer, but going after the boards after you box out
and just being consistent with that and not having them let out, coming out
straight out the gate and letting them know we are here to battle and we are
going out on the floor with everything we have.  
  
Q. Sam, Notre Dame is a team that scored almost a hundred points the other
day. Do you want to play an up ‑and‑down game with them or try to slow it
down?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think we just have to play in control with whatever we
do. We are going to look to push when we can. You can't force anything too
much against them. Can't give them any extra opportunities. But I mean, if we
can push, we would like to. But you just have to be controlled, make them
work. Got to score within two, obviously; they can put up big numbers.  
  
Q. You pride yourself on having balance on the team and you look at Notre
Dame and they have players like Skylar and Jewell Lloyd, a freshman. How do
you have to counter their balance, as well? Seems that's going to be
definitely a challenge.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: I think that we just have to be‑‑ everyone has to be on point.
There can't be any let ups with who is on the floor. Just continuing to move
people in and out of the rotation with flawlessness and just everyone being on
point, because all of them are good. They play for Notre Dame and so all of
them have the ability to score and do good things.  
  
Q. In recent years, has there been a women's basketball upset that you guys
remember or that you kind of followed or got into it at all?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: No, not that I remember. I think it's a huge deal, even when a
No.1 gets knocked out, even if it's by a No.2, which technically isn't that
huge of an upset. The last two years have been the same through No.1 seeds
with those four teams up there. It does not happen very often in women's, and
I think I was telling somebody before, maybe Coach, but we need a little more
'Madness' in women's basketball, too, so why not start with us.  
  
Q. Seeing stuff on tape, what makes you think you can win this game?  
MORGAN JOHNSON: To be honest, I think we just have the ability to turn it on
when we play good teams. We normally play at the level of competition, and if
that happens that's going to be awesome for us. I just think that we have this
belief inside of us that we can do anything and that we can win this game, and
I think that is just belief in ourselves and in our program. It really just
gives us the ability to do amazing things.  
  
Q. Going with the same thing, how big or how good for women's basketball
would you guys be winning Tuesday?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I think it would be tremendous. Obviously for our program
it would be amazing. It would help in a variety of ways, but also I do think
it would be great for the sport of women's basketball. I think people want the
upsets. People get excited about the Florida Gulf Coasts and why not let them
get excited about the Iowa Hawkeyes after tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you talk about dealing with Notre Dame's balance offensively? And is
there a certain area you want them to shoot from? Do you want them to take a
lot of three ‑pointers?  
COACH BLUDER: It's impressive, their balance is something I really love
because it's something we try to stress in our basketball team and I think all
good basketball teams have that balance, have that inside‑outside attack. But
yeah, we would love to force them to take more outside shots. Yesterday I
think they had 56 paint points, and it's hard to win a game when you're giving
up that many high‑percentage shots.  
  
Q. Their only loss was at home against Baylor, so they have not lost on the
road, beat Connecticut twice at their place, at Tennessee. You're hosting; how
do you make it tough for Notre Dame to play here? Seems they are not rattled
on the road, so how do you try to get them rattled tomorrow?  
COACH BLUDER: Every streak comes to an end sometime. They have won 27 in a row
and that has got to get boring, doesn't it, for them?  
So you know maybe they will take it for granted. Maybe they will be in a
situation where, you know, they are highly favored‑‑ there's nobody in America
that's betting on the Iowa Hawkeyes except for those women that are in that
basketball locker room right now. But I told them, there's going to be a lot
of people cheering for them and behind them to win this game, because I think
everybody would like to see an upset like that.  
  
Q. They will go on a run and a spurt, and the teams that can stay
competitive seem to handle it better. How do you go about that, as far as time
‑outs or whatever, trimming down a big run by Notre Dame?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, you only have so many time‑outs that you can use. Yes,
that's the first thing you think of. But also, I think changing up your
defense, trying to change the looks that they are getting through changing
your defense has got to be the next thing, because you can't just keep burning
time‑outs. You're going to run out of those. Hopefully get a spark like
Melissa provided for us last night and getting the crowd into the game through
our own offensive production would also be really good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding and just how critical of an area that
will be tomorrow night?  
COACH BLUDER: We talked about that with our team and it is really one of the
keys in my opinion, because Notre Dame is such a good rebounding team and they
have a lot of people that hit the boards. Last night, we didn't do a very good
job on the rebound, but it didn't hurt us, because they didn't make us pay for
them. Tomorrow, Notre Dame is quite capable of making us pay for them. And so
we have got to make a conscious effort of boxing out, getting a body on
somebody.  
You know, last night, Wilson was a load to box out. She had us out‑weighed by
a lot and she was a tough, tough person to box out, and give her the credit
for doing a great job in there.  
  
Q. What's the difference between, say, a team ‑‑ it's the same thing I asked
these kids, between a team that makes the NCAA maybe or is on the verge of
making the NCAA, and the teams like Notre Dame that are sort of perennial
Sweet16 kind of teams, not necessarily like the elite teams, but that just can
make that extra step. What do you have to do to make that extra step?  
COACH BLUDER: I think it's consistency all year long, because if you're
consistent all year long, then you tend to get those top four seeds, and we
all know if we have those top four seeds, our ability to advance in the NCAA
Tournament is a lot stronger, a lot more likely.  
So I think just having that consistent play all year long gets you the higher
RPI and will get you the easier seed and get you the easier pass to the
Sweet16. Notre Dame certainly has that. I think that you have to have
consistently, in not only your wins, but I mean, they just score at an
unbelievable rate and they defend, too.  
So having both sides of that is excellent. They just have so many different
people that can score. But in my opinion, it's just having that consistent
output all year long in the win/loss column.  
  
Q. What did it mean last night for you guys to win first time in a couple
years in an NCAA Tournament game, but winning an NCAA Tournament game here at
home, what did it mean for you and the team?  
COACH BLUDER: And winning it big, too, that was pretty fun as well. Having the
opportunity to be able to enjoy the last couple of minutes and not sit on pins
and needles, but to enjoy it. It meant a lot to our players. Our seniors,
again, it gives them another opportunity to wear the Hawkeye uniform and play
in Carver‑Hawkeye Arena, and again, last night proved to us and Hawkeye fans
that we can do that.  
  
Q. If you're looking for the upset tomorrow night, how big a role will three
‑point shooting play?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, I think that we are going to have to find a way to score
with them. They just are explosive offensively, and so we have got to knock
down shots. We have got to hit those threes tomorrow. It's important for us to
be able to do that and we have to force them into taking more contested shots.  
If they get those type of paint points‑‑ yes, they are going to take some
threes and they are definitely going to make some threes, they have some good
three point shooters, but we would rather have them shooting from there with a
hand in the face than in the paint right now.  
  
Q. We talked about the good of the game and the good of the women's game.
Skylar has 300,000 Twitter followers, more than any male or female college
athlete. How has she been an ambassador to the women's game?  
COACH BLUDER: She's been a terrific ambassador. She's been the face of women's
basketball this year. It's great that we get that kind of coverage and that we
have somebody that embraces that role.  
You know, she's a tremendous player, but she also seems like she's a really
cool kid and a good human being and she's embraced that role of being that
star power for women's basketball this year. I think she has more security
here than Barack Obama when he comes, and that's okay for us, because we need
somebody like that in women's basketball.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 25, 2013

  

### [Natalie Achonwa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21816)

### [Jewell Lloyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25261)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach McGraw does not have an opening statement so at this time
we will take statements for the student athletes.  
  
Q. July, maybe talk a little bit, as a 1 ‑seed, how do you maintain a focus
no matter who you play, and not so much overconfidence, but maintaining a
level, how do you guys do that?   
JEWELL LLOYD: I think we just had to focus on our goals and what we want to
accomplish. It's just another game for us. We focus like any other game and we
should be fine.  
  
Q. Natalie, could you talk a little bit about what it takes to be able to
handle the challenges of the road and the challenges of a quick turnaround?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: I think it's all about your mental approach and how you take
your day‑to‑day basis. We have a day in between to kind of refocus and look
forward to the next team in Iowa, and I think it's about how we take this day
and how we utilize this day. Coach does a great job of setting us up for it
and we'll look over it today and just kind of prepare for tomorrow.  
  
Q. And the challenges of the road?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Iowa has a home‑court advantage here, everyone knows that.
We've played a lot of great away games this year and I think it's just about
focusing on what we are going to do and how we are going to play, and just try
to take the crowd out of it.  
  
Q. In general, what challenges does Iowa provide?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Iowa has some post shooters and a big presence overall. They are
a smart team and run a motion offense. It's just about playing team defense
and it's like a shell drill (ph) for us, so making sure that we are sticking
true to our principles and playing great defense.  
  
Q. For either one of you, do you watch the other women's games, or when you
watch the men's, do you ever root for the underdog? You're a 1 ‑seed yourself
but do you get caught up and root for the underdog like anybody else?   
JEWELL LLOYD: You always want to watch a good game, really, and it's like
watching basketball and to see the outcome, that's basically all I've got for
that.  
  
Q. Natalie, I don't know if you've had a chance to look at Iowa, or if you
watched much of the game last night, what do you think of Morgan Johnson?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: They are very tall and lean. One plays back to the basket but
they work well together and work with their team and their motion. I think
it's just going to be about being physical. Iowa is physical and we are going
to play physical and it's just about who out‑thinks their opponent, basically.
Both are very smart teams and it's just who is a step ahead.  
  
Q. Jewell, you had Butler and Newsome yesterday and now a tandem of Printy,
Logic, Dixon; what do they challenge defensively compared to Tennessee
Martin?  
JEWELL LLOYD: They are all good guys and they can shoot the ball really well.
Logic is a good passer, so just containing the ball with her. So sticking to
our principles on our defense and we'll see where that takes us.  
  
Q. Tomorrow is an 8:30 game, it would be 9:30 your time. What do you do
during the day and how do you stay sharp for such a late game?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: I think we played some big Monday games this year, and we had
some late games already.  
It is a long day. Game days are always long days when you have a night game.
It's just about getting your feet up, resting, watching some film and just
spending some time relaxing and mentally preparing for the game. You don't
want to get too relaxed where you're sitting around all day; but just the same
approach we've had for other night games.  
  
Q. Jewell, on Sunday what did Coach talk to you about during the game about
identifying shooters and can that carry over to playing Iowa?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Talk and communication, making sure we find them in transition,
always have a hand up and like I say, stay with our principles on defense, and
it really comes down to our D that we always work on in practice and that will
transfer over in games.  
  
Q. Natalie, you had a nice milestone yesterday, 1,000 points in your career,
now that's kind of out of the way and keep your focus on each opponent?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Yeah, definitely. I didn't know I was that close though. It's
a great milestone to achieve and I'm blessed to be a part of that 1,000 Club
at Notre Dame. Now looking forward to the next game and kind of putting that
behind me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the offensive balance of this team and do you just
react to the way the game is going, or do you have some thoughts going into a
game on who is going to have some advantages when it comes to scoring?  
JEWELL LLOYD: I think if we just move the ball unselfish, we've got to be
smart with the ball and I mean, that's basically‑‑ stay true to our game plan
really.  
  
Q. This week everyone is talking parity and such with the men. Is the
women's game missing that a little bit do you think?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I thought you saw some minor upsets yesterday. But
overall, I think when you're playing on a neutral court, anything can happen.  
So I think in the men's game, there is a lot more parity than there is in the
women's game, but you saw that all year long, with who is No.1, the rotating
thing. Where in the women's game, the top five didn't really change much all
year long. But I do want to go on record saying that I did not hope (ph) for
any 16 seeds in the first two rounds.  
  
Q. You built this program, and there were times when the program was not the
kind of program that was sort of automatically put into the Sweet16 and the
Elite 8. What's the difference now between teams that almost always are making
the Sweet16 and the rest of the field?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think success of the program is judged on how you do
in the NCAA Tournament. We have been to ten Sweet16s and I think we were a
good program, but I don't think we got the notoriety that we would expect
until we got to the Final Four back‑to‑back.  
So four Final Fours and I think finally, our program is on an elite level. I
think it takes that really to get the respect from the people in the country.  
  
Q. (No mic).  
COACH McGRAW: They have to be better. I think our recruiting has definitely
changed and we are getting more McDonald's All‑Americans on our team. You have
some special players like you have with Skylar, but you have to have good
players around them like Kayla McBride and Jewell Lloyd and Natalie Achonwa,
you have to continue the recruiting, that's the rough part of the program, you
have to continue. It's a job that's 24/7, 12 months a year, never ends, you go
from one class to the next, and you have to continue to bring in elite level
players in order to sustain that.  
But for us, it's always been about chemistry more than talent, and there are
some top players in the country that we don't really want on the our team.  
We want them to fit in and play well together and be unselfish and
team‑oriented. So for us, it's a lot more about the fit of the player than
where they are ranked.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a little time to digest yesterday's game, what was
your evaluation of that, and I guess overall, where your team is now in
reference to trying to make a run here?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, offensively, we were on. We shot the ball extremely well.
Eight turnovers in the game, and you know, I thought it was a very good game
considering we had not played since, I think 11 days since our last game. I
thought we would be a little rusty but we really came out and looked sharp and
I was really pleased with that.  
Defensively our team defense has done a lot better. I think Butler had just an
outstanding day but still managed to hold them to 60 points and beat them by
30. Overall I was pleased with the rebound and the defense with the exception
of some individual parts on Butler.  
  
Q. You have a young lady who grew up nearby in Des Moines, can you talk
about Markisha, and what do you see for her in the future and her role with
your team and maybe her development, how it's gone?  
COACH McGRAW: She plays a really big role for us. She comes in behind Natalie,
she's playing some quality minutes. She played quite a bit in the BIG EAST
Championship game against Connecticut when Natalie got in foul trouble. She's
a steady presence in the lane, works extremely hard, wants to be very good and
she's very, very coachable and I think she's improving dramatically.  
She has been a defensive physical player for us. She's the best screener on
our team. The guards love playing with her because she sets a great screen.
She's the one that is not afraid to bang inside and I think she's got a really
bright future with us.  
  
Q. Just going off your question, is it more difficult to sustain being an
elite program rather than getting there? And do you see any up ‑and‑coming
programs, do you see challenging Connecticut yourselves, Stanford, Baylor,
etc.?   
COACH McGRAW: I think it is difficult to sustain. I think you get there‑‑ we
got there in 2001, and it took us a little while to get back. And you know, we
went to a few Sweet16s in there, but it wasn't quite the level we wanted it to
be at. So I think we are back there now because of our recruiting.  
And I think you are seeing a little bit of a changing of the guard. You know,
I think when teams are able to win at Connecticut and win at Tennessee, I
think you can see that the two marquis programs in women's basketball are
being challenged a lot more frequently now. And I think around the country,
with the leagues changing, I think that's going to change things. I think with
us going to the ACC, it will be interesting to see how the new conference, how
Connecticut fairs.  
I think the ACC will be a really strong league for us and hopefully that will
become the best league in women's basketball.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the evolution of this year's team? You had to
replace three starters from a year ago and you had three freshmen coming in
and another that had not played the year before, and a phenomenal growth from
the early part of the season, can you talk about the depth, the strength and
the quality of the team from top to bottom in the course of the season?  
COACH McGRAW: We have a lot of questions coming into the season, losing three
really good players, three starters, four seniors and two WNBA first rounds,
so we had a lot to replace. We started talking about that in April and what we
needed to do to replace them. Natalie has made great strides and we knew Kayla
McBride was going to be a great player but having an All‑American year has
really solidified her spot nationally.  
But you have freshmen coming in that are untested, they are great players in
high school but you don't know how they will react at the college level, this
level especially. Lloyd had a phenomenal season, Rookie of the Year, one of
the best in the country. Michaela Mabrey, surprise player, injury last year
that did not allow her to play as a freshman, gave us great minutes and
continues to give us great minutes. Michaela gave us great minutes off the
bench.  
So our freshmen continued quite a bit along with Ariel Braker, an unsung hero
to us. I think our players have really developed throughout the year, they
have gotten better and more confident and I think we are growing as a team.  
  
Q. Will it take another generation of kids for the women's game to be where
the men's game is?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't think you see many game‑changing players. I think in the
women's game, there's a few at the top that can come in, but you know, you
look at Connecticut, the No.1 recruiting class in the country, Jefferson, No.2
player in the country, Top‑10 player‑‑ it takes a while to adjust to the
college game.  
You have to be a really special player to come in and make a significant
contribution as a freshman, and I think the number of players that can do that
nationally is pretty small. So, yes, I think it will take another generation.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, this is kind of the scenario you didn't want was
playing a home team in the second round. What are the pitfalls of that for you
guys?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think we've been road‑tested and we're battle‑tested. We
are undefeated on the road, so that's kind of the message we are sending our
team in going to Connecticut.  
We have gone to a lot of tough places on the road. So we know what that's
going to be like. The crowd is going to be against us and there are going to
be a lot of people cheering against us. You would hope that we get some Notre
Dame fans out there to balance that out, but we're ready to go.  
  
Q. What can you say about the balance of Iowa? You had Samantha Logic
yesterday had a double ‑double, Melissa Dixon had a couple of three‑pointers
to get them back in the game; what can you say about the balance of Iowa and
is that going to be a challenge for you guys?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, Samantha Logic had maybe the best game of her season so
far, double‑double. That's a fantastic accomplishment for a guard to have, and
she played extremely well. She's the key to their team. Her assist to turnover
ratio is impressive.  
She runs the team, she's a part player and makes them better. I think she is
definitely somebody that's a challenge for us. You know, Printy and Dixon,
great three‑point shooting ability and so you have to go out and guard on the
perimeter. And then you have the inside presence.  
So they have got a really good balanced team. I don't think you can leave
anyone to go double anyone else. I think you have to really play them straight
up. So I think it's a challenge for us defensively.  
  
Q. Skylar was just warming up stretching yesterday and fans from Iowa and
Miami took pictures of her stretching. She has 300,000 Twitter followers. What
has she meant overall to the game in general?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's the face of women's college basketball and it's
been great for women's basketball, because we are attracting a fan base that
we've had ever had before: People in the entertainment industry are watching
our games. The casual fan is now tuning in to see what Skylar is going to do.
She's got the headband nation following her.  
I think she's done great things for the game and I think the WNBA team that
drafts her is going to hit the jackpot because they will see a rise in ticket
sales, communities, wherever they go. Every game we went to this year, we
probably set an attendance record for most of the players we went because
people just want to see Skylar, and she gets a bigger cheer from the opponents
than anybody. Usually you would expect some boos in that but she really is
very well respected nationally and it's been a great thing for women's
basketball.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  69  
MIAMI - 53

  
COACH MEIER: Well, I think I jinxed them in the press conference, when you
asked me the key to Iowa and I said Samantha Logic, because, boy, she must
have heard that. She was phenomenal.  
I don't sugarcoat much and I think it was a shockingly poor performance by us,
on the offensive end, just shockingly poor. And when I saw that, I'm trying to
compliment my team because we were just clicking and so confident and so great
in the time we had off together and just really felt like we solved a lot of
our issues.  
So I'm shocked in a very positive way. Disappointed for them but just can't
believe our percentages, even today in the shoot around, we shoot over 80
percent on the free throw drill we did and can he aim out and didn't get over
50 in crucial moments.  
I have a lot of faith in this team, and I'm really disappointed. But I can
tell you, Iowa has got some basketball players, basketball players, they play
basketball, they are composed. The ball means more to them than it means to
us, and that's a heck of a compliment to them. Their guards controlled the
game the whole game. They were strong with the ball.  
We were very loose with the ball and we were staring at Pepper, like, that was
our offense and I thought she responded to that call. But we're more than
that, and that's why I'm so disappointed and shocked.  
But you know, I don't want to take anything away from Iowa offensively. A lot
of their defensive game plan caused us to hesitate and get on our heels and
really not be the aggressive, quick‑strike team that we need to be in the
first half of our offensive possession. So very, very, very disappointed and
just really, like I said, shocked.  
  
Q. You were able to work the ball inside early in the first half, did you
feel like you had gotten some control or had the momentum then? And then what
changed in the second half? Why were you unable to get inside?  
SHAWNICE WILSON: I did feel like I had control. I just felt like we went away
from what was working and I was getting the ball inside. Just kind of working
through our offense, I think we went away from that. I think that's like the
main thing. But I felt like I had control inside.  
  
Q. Morgan, Coach mentioned that their defense caused you fits. What was it
about them that kind of threw off your offensive game?  
MORGAN STROMAN: We just weren't being aggressive, the aggressive team we
normally are on offense and that shut us down and we needed to score.  
  
Q. Defensively, you guys were pretty strong the first half and it seemed
like they were having a little trouble there with your athleticism, but in the
second half, they got open for threes, particularly Dixon made three in a row
in a short period of time. What changed? Did they do anything differently than
they did the first half or did they just execute better?  
MORGAN STROMAN: No, they still played their game. We knew that they had great
shooters and we were open and they were able to hit them.  
  
Q. You said a minute ago that the ball meant more to them than it meant to
us. You did out ‑rebound them, I think by 16; was that what you were talking
about or was it just loose balls? Elaborate more on that.   
COACH MEIER: Well, 24 turnovers, and I didn't see a press. We just really were
very loose and very much‑‑ I thought our guards spent a lot of time with their
shoulders, one shoulder to the rim instead of two shoulders to the rim. So we
played a lot of perimeter reversals and didn't really get a piece of the
paint. We are good at that.  
They had two guards that had 36 points and we had two post that is had 30.
That was the game. I thought our interior defense was phenomenal with Johnson,
but we know that was it. Our two posts probably had to have more than 15 each
for us to win it, if that's how it was rolling with us. And I think in usual
times, we were just about to get a great look inside and we were a little
careless with the ball, passing on our heels. It really hurt us.  
Then we had so many‑‑ we had 25 offensive rebounds and only turned into 17
second‑chance points. That's almost hideous. I mean, you've got to get those
balls and you've got to put them back in. It can't be‑‑ 25 offensive rebounds
has to be at least 25 points.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Melissa Dixon coming out, two three ‑pointers?   
COACH MEIER: Well, you know, that's what she does and I just think that's one
of the more dangerous people coming off the bench in the country because of
her mental toughness. She can just come in cold, come off the bench cold and
strike you down.  
I have high regard for their mental toughness and high regard for the IQ of
their guards. This matchup, like I said, I really thought it would come done
to their guards handling our pressure and getting a little bit free and
hitting down a antibiotic time shot and how many points could we get in the
paint to counteract that. That's what I thought it would come down to.  
I'm really pleased with our rebounding numbers. I mean, we really did that
part, Part A; but we didn't turn that into success Part B, and they did. They
got an open three in a crucial moment, they hit it and that's a huge credit to
them and their coaching staff. They did a great job.  
  
Q. I noticed Iowa's changed defenses several times, man, 2 ‑1‑2 and a
different zone in there, too. I'm sure you expected that but did that disrupt
your offense any?   
COACH MEIER: I mean, I guess you could say yeah, I wasn't upset‑‑ I wasn't
like rattled by it or anything, but maybe the rhythm. They did a nice job
picking their spots there. But you know, we had our vision. We had vision. It
wasn't‑‑ it didn't feel like our vision was taken away and that's why we lost
our composure. Perhaps a matter of our timing.  
Just want to say, did a great job, Iowa hosting this event, just big‑time
classy place, classy environment, great administration. Thank you for having
us.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

NOTRE DAME  97  
UT MARTIN - 64

  
COACH McMILLAN: I thought that the game was ‑‑ and I don't know, I don't have
the running total thing. In the first half, there was about four minutes to go
maybe, I don't remember, it was about a 6‑point game and Notre Dame had to go
to a triangle in two because they couldn't guard these guys. I thought that
was a tremendous tribute to what these two are able to do.  
But you know, they are a great team, and we got killed on the glass. Rickiesha
got hurt; just slaps you in the face because she's the only one that we had
that could go in there and try to rebound with us. I think that we may have
set an NCAA record on rebound margin.  
But it was‑‑ once we kind of lost control of what we were trying to do,
couldn't get it back. And we talk all the time about three possessions is
going to be a game, and the three possessions were when they had to go man
because they couldn't guard these guys and went to a triangle. And when we
couldn't get back, it just kind of snowballed from there.  
But I thought that Notre Dame's quickness bothered us, I thought their size
bothered us, and I thought that there was some problems that we couldn't
simulate that we didn't have much of an answer for.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what a game like this means against Notre Dame? I
think it was one point shy of an all ‑time record for an opponent against
Notre Dame.   
HEATHER BUTLER: Well, it definitely meant a lot, because coming in here,
everybody is like, who is UT Martin, nobody knows who we are. And going
against the No.1 seed team, you want to come out here and prove that, you
know, we can play with Notre Dame, and we are just going to give it all we got
and that we are a team with heart that plays hard.  
Coming out here, they are a very good basketball team, obviously, and I think
what Coach said, we got destroyed on the glass, that's what killed us. But I
think it definitely meant a lot and we definitely learned a lot from this
experience.  
  
Q. What did you do going in after the first couple of minutes? The size
seemed to affect you and then you adjusted. What did you do to adjust to
improve?  
HEATHER BUTLER: Well I'm used to going against bigger guards, but bigger,
athletic and quicker‑‑  
COACH McMILLAN: Everybody is bigger than you.  
HEATHER BUTLER: As I said, I'm used to it (laughter). But obviously what I was
doing wasn't working.  
And so I had to just tell myself, okay, relax, just take your time, go in
there and if you have a shot, shoot it. And if not, kick it out. I finally
relaxed. I was kind of like a little too tense in the beginning, all over the
place, but finally I told myself, okay, if it's there, shoot it.  
  
Q. When you're banking in threes, do you feel like that you're on your game
then as far as shooting?  
HEATHER BUTLER: Yeah, I mean, it feels good when the backboard helps you out a
little bit. Like I said, I just shot it with confident and I mean, like I
said, if the backboard helps you out, it is kind of a good shooting night.  
  
Q. Coach referenced about four minutes ago, you were down by seven, what
happened in those last four minutes?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: We wasn't getting back like we normal lay was in the game but
then they would take a shot and miss it and they would get the rebound and put
it back in. That's mainly what happened. That's what I thought happened.  
  
Q. When you were banking those shots in, think the first one that went off
glass, I don't know if you realized, but you gave like a Michael Jordan shrug
and smiled; did you realize you were doing that at the time?  
HEATHER BUTLER: When I banked it in, yeah, kind of like: Hey, I mean, what can
I say. I mean, like I thought it was completely off. I thought it was going to
break off and go out‑of‑bounds but it didn't, so it kind of shocked me, so
that was my reaction to it (smiling and shrugging shoulders).  
  
Q. You and Skylar are usually the top scorers in the game. How did it feel
to keep her down around your level, because you were a low scorer in this
game, too.  
JASMINE NEWSOME: I really didn't think about it that much. But going into it
we were just saying keep her and No. 21 from scoring and make somebody else
score, so that was our goal. I'm pretty proud that we did that but at the same
time, we didn't rebound very well.  
  
Q. When one or the other of you is on, maybe is making a lot of shots, do
you try to really work hard at setting the other one up? Were you really
trying to get Heather the ball because she was knocking them down?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: Yeah, basically. Most of our plays are ran through one of us,
and if one of us is on, that's who is going to get the ball the most. We
usually feed off each other but today I was kind of slow and she was on.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what Heather did out there today against
a team that's been pretty reputable on defense this season?  
COACH McMILLAN: Well, anybody that watched this game, Heather, I think we list
her at 5‑5 or 5‑6\. She's not; she's about 5‑4 or 5‑3, and what that young
lady does is absolutely amazing. I was fortunate to get to coach her in high
school. I was fortunate that she followed me to UT Martin and I'm fortunate
every day I get to be around her.  
You said something about the banked shots going in. I don't know if she's
banked one all season. But one of the things that I know is that when you do
things right and you do them right and you do them right, things tend to
happen good for you.  
And you know, you would think banking a shot, she's not on; and that when she
banked the first one, I said, we are going to start throwing her the ball
because she'll be mad at herself because she banked it and she'll start
putting them in, and she did.  
You know, the challenge that she has every game, is amazing, and you know,
Notre Dame is no different. The thing that I do know is that she sees that
challenge all the time, and she kind of relishes in the opportunities. She's
one of those rare kids that looks at situations and says: What can I do to be
my best in whatever given situation I've gotten. And she got an opportunity to
play against All‑Americans, and I would think‑‑ (looking down at stat sheet) I
can't see, I apologize. I'm getting what happens at 45 years old. I would
think, 37 points, pretty good day against a No.1 seed.  
You know, the thing about those two is that Jasmine is going to be the one
that is the most he excited for her. So really, she put on a little show, and
I wish we could have had some rebounding help to maybe change some of the
outcome of some of those plays.  
  
Q. Was it strictly a height issue on Notre Dame's part as far as the
rebounding is concerned, or were there some other factors that played into
that?  
COACH McMILLAN: Well, I think the first thing was that Rickiesha sprained her
ankle in the first six minutes of the game and she averages about 12‑‑ well,
she's been averaging about 11 or 12 rebounds a game for us over the last ten
games, and she's also our biggest kid in there that will disrupt the other
team just because of her size. So when she went out, we were not a little
worried, we were a lot worried.  
But what Notre Dame is, people don't give them enough credit for, they are
long. You know, their wing span is a lot longer than their height. They are
not a big team, but their arms are so long that they get to stuff that they
are not supposed to get to, and they are so athletic that it's hard to keep
people in front of you.  
And you're just talking about great basketball players that see things that
you don't see and put you in situations where you have to help and where you
have to help, and now they have a rebounding advantage and they are going to
take advantage of that. It's a snowball.  
I'm disappointed that our kid didn't battle more on the boards. I would have
expected more fouls on boxing out or more fouls going up for second shots or
stuff like that. Would have expected it. But I didn't get it except for my
little 5‑6 guard that comes in.  
So I'm a little disappointed in our post for not giving it more of a battle.
But they are a great rebounding team and they have always been a great
rebounding team because of their athleticism and they are so deceptive. They
get to stuff that you don't think they will get to, what, eight alley‑oops in
the game, that's pretty good.  
  
Q. You said yesterday inside was going to be a struggle but obviously you
had faith in the guards, but could you have even imagined a game that Heather
had today, 37 points like that?  
COACH McMILLAN: Well, I wouldn't have expected‑‑ I'm going to be mad at her
because she missed three free throws. She could have had 40. We have to have
that game from our two guards, we have to, because that's what we are built
around.  
The matchup for us was a nightmare because there wasn't a player on the Notre
Dame team that we thought we could take a lot of advantage from, and so I
thought that Butler and Newsome were going to have to have monster games in
order for us to be able to compete, and they did that.  
And somebody said it, I guess four minutes to go, it's a 6‑point game, and
they went to a try anal and we missed four straight wide open shots that kids
have to make, and they went down and scored. And I thought that that kind of
turned the whole tied of the game.  
But you know, to think that those two guards could go out as a 16 seed and
combine for 52 points and one of them get 37, you can't ask any more. What
that says is that I need to fire my recruiting coach, whoever recruits
rebounders, and we need to find somebody that can go get on the glass, and we
have got to find some people that can make some more shots. You can't get into
a 1‑16 matchup and expect much different, because of the way‑‑ the culture
that we are in.  
And I thought that there were some things that needed to go differently that
didn't. Some of my predictions were correct. It's just, you've got to play
yourselves out of this game in the middle of the season, and that's what we
didn't do this year.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  69  
MIAMI - 53

  
COACH BLUDER: I'm just really happy for this basketball team. They wanted this
win. Our fans were terrific today. They came out and supported us and we
really fed off that, especially in the second half. I thought it got very loud
in there.  
Sam Logic, I mean, she really was extraordinary today. Again, there's not many
point guard in the country that are going to average double‑double with
rebounds and points.  
Melissa Dixon was a great spark off of the bench for us again in the second
half. First half we kind of had some unusual lineups in there with some foul
trouble and we withstood that and we also withstood their 25 offensive
rebounds, which was kind of tough to swallow. But when you look at how many
points they scored off those offensive rebounds, you can see they only scored
17, and we scored 15 points off the offensive rebounds, so in the end it
wasn't that much of an advantage for them.  
Very, very proud of our basketball team and excited to be able to stand and
play again on Tuesday night in Carver‑Hawkeye Arena.  
  
Q. Sam, after Coach Meier's comments about needing to stop you yesterday,
did you feel kind of responsible to take the game into your hands tonight?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I don't think to take it into my own hands, just to be
composed and not let whatever they are going to try to throw at me rattle me.  
Obviously I have a great team around me and they can't just focus on one
person, as I said, and it just ended up that it was me tonight‑‑ that you
can't stop anyone, and anybody could end up being the leading scorer and it
just ended up being me today.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about staying composed when they got very helter ‑skelter there
in the first half and maybe you were the one calming influence. Talk about
your role in that, how did you prepare?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: That's what the role of a point guard is, just being the coach
out on the floor, being the director of everything. When it was going like
that, you just had to take a deep breath. We had the home crowd, we were not
playing well, we had foul trouble in the first half and only down one. We just
really had to stay in the game and pull away at the end. But ending the first
half well, like Coach said, different lineups that we are not used to was
really big.  
  
Q. Melissa, it seemed like your guys really took off when you hit those
threes early in the second half. Halftime, you had no points, two fouls and
three turnovers and somehow you were able to turn that around. Talk about that
stretch, about a minute and a half where the game really changed.  
MELISSA DIXON: I was really rested going into the second half (laughter) we
ran our set plays really well. They switched on a couple of the screens and
allowed me to be open and my teammates made some really good passes to me.  
  
Q. Talk about that a little. How do you find that ‑‑ how did you find it?   
MELISSA DIXON: You just have to have a short memory and you just have to know
the next one is going in and to have that confidence that the next one was
going in, and I was able to do that in the second half. And my teammates also
had a lot of confidence in me, so that helps a ton.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about the confidence this team has facing a team that tries to
press you?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, it's really helpful, you can't really, again, key in on
one person that‑‑ we have Jaime, B and Melissa, we can all bring it up and or
when Patricia came in or Kathy came in and played some big minutes in the
first half; just to be able to guard that is difficult. Instead of having one
person that you rely on to bring the ball up, like we can run and do our
offense through anyone, so that's really huge.  
  
Q. This is for Sam or Melissa. When you are the home team and you've got the
crowd, could you guys feel a little bit that that crowd was waiting for
something to happen and maybe when Melissa hits the shots, then they can
finally let loose; could you guys sense that?  
MELISSA DIXON: Definitely, we had the best fans. Our Hawk fans are incredible
and to be able to play on our home court was so huge and they were behind us
the whole time so that really helped I think.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, definitely in the first half, we just tried to get back
into it more. When we started off the game, they were great and then we let
the lead get away from us a little bit.  
But going into halftime and coming out in the second half, you really want to
start strong and that gives you a little bit of momentum and gets the crowd
into it, too.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Melissa, her output there, you guys were down seven,
did you feel that the game was starting to slip a little bit before she caught
fire a little bit?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It was pretty early in the second half still, so it wasn't
slipping in our minds. We just knew we had to get our defensive stops. We ran
our sets, like Melissa said, really well and we had the utmost confident in
her coming in even though not playing a lot in the first half, to do what she
does best.  
Knocked them down definitely got the crowd back into it. It never felt like it
was slipping away or anything, especially when you have shooters like her on
your team.  
  
Q. Sam or Melissa, any preliminary thoughts on your matchup Tuesday with
Notre Dame and the challenges going up against them?  
THE MODERATOR: Sam, we'll start with you.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, you think about it a little bit, seeing them win before
we did. But obviously before the game, we were focused on Miami. Now we get to
think about it a little bit more.  
Again, we have a home game. Hopefully have a great crowd behind us again. But
we have no expectations or no pressure on us, I don't think, having a team of
that calibre on your home floor is just something to gain from.  
MELISSA DIXON: I think we all think that we don't have anything to lose and we
have this incredible opportunity to have Notre Dame come play on our home
court. So that helps a lot.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a game where you had 53 rebounds on you?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, for us to get out‑rebounded by that margin and still find
a way to win, I feel very good‑‑ I don't feel good about the rebounds but I
feel good that we found a way to win despite that, even though the heavy
rebounding advantage for them.  
But it is amazing they have 25 offensive rebounds and only have 17 points
where we have 14 offensive rebounds and 15 points. So it really did not turn
into that much of an advantage for them, even though they were ‑‑ obviously we
don't want to give up that many offensive rebounds.  
Good commercial, Bob, that's on the air right now.  
  
Q. What were you doing defensively to disrupt what they wanted to do?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I hope we had something to do with it. I think our zone
spread it out, getting hot hands, made them make some cross‑court passes that
they really didn't want to do and I think it took some time off the clock for
them.  
I'm extremely happy that we have 16 turnovers and they have 24 turnovers. I
thought coming in, we kept hearing, defense, defense, and then we kind of
turned the table on that as far as the turnover area.  
  
Q. What was the big difference in the second half?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, you know, we got down seven and then Melissa Dixon came to
play. You know, she has three threes in a minute and a half, I believe, during
that stretch. And then Jaime Printy got one from not far down the time line
there.  
You know, we had an 18‑point swing I believe in six minutes and when we hit
some of those threes, it really got us going. I think that's when the crowd
did get into it.  
Somebody asked that earlier, but I think when Melissa hits those threes and we
are down seven and all of a sudden she hits two threes and we are down one, I
think this place was ready to go and they got behind us and I think then we
were just on a roll.  
  
Q. Can you talk about winning an NCAA Tournament game on your home floor,
does that feel good after five years ago you couldn't do it?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it feels really good. You know, any time you win a game,
it's great. You win at home, it's special. You win in the NCAA Tournament,
it's amazing. And it's amazing for our seniors.  
Those three seniors get to play another game in Carver‑Hawkeye Arena and that
means a lot to them. So I'm glad for those three seniors that they get another
opportunity to suit up and come out the tunnel in Carver.  
  
Q. What about Notre Dame?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I have really not looked forward to them. I've always
been‑‑ my philosophy, one game at a time, and I have assistants that do that
for me and they will have a report for me when I get up there.  
But I'm not a person that looked ahead so I have not watched any film on them
and I am probably the only person in America that has not seen them a whole
lot on TV. They have been on TV in the Bluder house, but I have also been
doing homework with my children and doing dishes and things like that when
they are on, so I really haven't sat and analyzed them.  
  
Q. This is kind of off the game, but in this year, prime example, you don't
see the upsets early on; why is that? Is it because you're playing on home
court?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, there are 15 home court sites this year, so there are
quite a few. But I don't think that's any different than what we've had in the
past. We have always had kind of significant home courts. You know, there's
not‑‑ you know, there's just not as much parity in women's basketball as there
is in men's basketball right now, and that's unfortunate.  
And you know, until we get the parity‑‑ and it's getting better. Because it
used to be, you could talk about three teams that were going to make it to the
Final Four and you knew those. Now, hey, we are talking about eight or ten
that could possibly make it, and I think that's good.  
But yeah, we need to get the parity between the ten to 50, would be really
nice.  
  
Q. A couple times after you got that lead, Miami got it down a little bit.
What did you tell the team to keep that going, keep building?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we got it down to nine at one time after we got a
significant lead. We talked about the team, they are going to come out and
press and they are going to start changing up the defense and doing some traps
in the full court and bring up the intensity on the defense.  
So just keeping our composure against them and we said three frees, defense,
box out and obviously didn't help work too well, but taking care of the ball.
Those were the three keys in the last, eight, ten minutes for us and in my
opinion was keep playing the defense, keep trying to box out, and let's just
take care of the basketball.  
  
Q. I know you probably weren't paying too much attention to what else is
going ton in the tournament, but that's now six Big Ten teams that are in the
second round, about as many men's teams that advanced. The men get a lot of
press obviously and talk about how strong they are, but how strong can you
speak to is the women's side of the Big Ten?  
COACH BLUDER: And you're telling me that all six of our Big Ten teams won in
the first round for women? That's tremendous. So six teams stand in the Final
32.  
You know, this year, we were the second‑best rated team in the conference, or
in America, and I think this kind of proves that. Obviously we'd like to move
it up a notch, but very, very happy with the success. It has to be the best
success that we've had in the NCAA Tournament for the Big Ten Conference,
that's tremendous.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

NOTRE DAME 97  
UT MARTIN - 64

  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Butler had probably the best individual game anybody's
had against us all year long. She was phenomenal, 37 points. We went to the
triangle too late in the first half to try to contain her for a little bit. I
think we slowed her down for four minutes but she played extremely well. What
a great performance by her.  
I was really pleased with our offensive play today. I felt we got great
balance in the scoring column with Natalie Achonwa, Jewell Lloyd, getting
their career high, Kayla McBride getting a double‑double. Really pleased what
we were able to do offensively. Shot the ball extremely well. I thought we got
a lot of good shots, a lot of good layups and attacked their zone very
efficiently.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk a little about today's game? It seemed like you
scored every possible way there was to score. Can you just talk about what you
took advantage of out there?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Think we are a very unselfish team and we move the ball really
well and we find the open person, so I moved and cut and we had great passers
and they found me right under the basket and my shots would just fall in.  
  
Q. For any of the players; they got within four points of you guys twice in
the first half there, and then you just sort of jetted away from them, what
was the difference there?  
THE MODERATOR: Kayla, will you tackle that one?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think it was just getting our transition game going, and it
started on defense. They missed a couple shots and they got our transition
game going and getting easy layups.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about the accomplishment of reaching the 1,000
‑point mark for your career? And second, just talk about the rebounding margin
today.   
NATALIE ACHONWA: I'm really happy to have the opportunity to reach 1,000
points. I didn't even know until someone told me after the game.  
And in terms of rebounding, I think that was one of the things we wanted to
take advantage of. We wanted to make sure that we picked up as many offensive
rebounds as we could, as well as on the defensive end. I know K‑Mac had a
double‑double so she did a great job on cutting even from the three‑point, to
get a couple rebounds.  
  
Q. Kayla, just talk about trying to guard Butler? I know you were one of the
players ‑‑ how frustrating that was, she banked in two three‑pointers, she had
a four‑point play; can you talk about what that was like to try to slow her
down?   
KAYLA McBRIDE: She's the top scorer in the nation for a reason. She can score
in a lot of different ways. She's very quick off the ball screen and she knows
when to pull up and when to shoot the three and when to go all the way to the
basket. She's a great player. We had a lot of trouble with her as everyone
saw. So you know, give her a lot of credit, she plays hard and she's just a
great player.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Jewell did out there today, alley ‑oops,
3‑pointers, put backs, all the different ways she can score?   
KAYLA McBRIDE: Yeah, I think Jewell can score in pretty much any way possible.
She knows when to cut. She's learning. She's a quick learner. She can hit the
three. She can shoot the pull‑up. She's a bigger guard and she can post
smaller guards up. She can score in a lot of different ways. She is moving
without the ball, cutting, getting offensive rebounds, she did it all. I think
she had a really strong game tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about, obviously Butler goes off with this monster game
and yet you guys still win by 33 and there was really never a point in the
second half where the game was in doubt. Can you just talk about how good your
team is that despite this monster effort of hers, you were able to win pretty
decisively.  
JEWELL LLOYD: We just had to stay together and when we come together as a
team, we play really strong and defensively. You know, talk and communication
is always a big thing. We get better at talking and stuff like that, but we
played really a tough defense and stay together‑‑ I think, you know, we can be
one of the best teams around.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding today, just having a margin like
that?  
COACH McGRAW: Huge, 49‑14, honestly I didn't even see the numbers until
afterwards. I knew we were doing a pretty good job. I thought offensively we
really went after it. Aerial Braker I thought did a really nice job inside.
You know, I think that we're capable of getting to the back board and boxing
out, and I thought we did a really good job defensively. They only got five
offensive rebounds and so that was definitely one of our goals tonight. Really
pleased with that.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate a little bit about Jewell Lloyd, career high, and just
the different ways she can score?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, you go into your first NCAA Tournament game and you
wonder how the freshman is going to do. You look back at her previous career
high against Baylor, and you think, she's definitely a gamer. I think she'll
be ready. But you never know if she's going to come out nervous, and she did
not. She had a phenomonal game.  
The thing she's going doing really well is moving without the ball, and that
is a hard thing for a freshman to learn. And she's really doing a great job of
cutting and moving when Sky has got it, and they are finding her around the
rim which is something that we want to take advantage of more.  
We worked on looking at her for the lob, especially against the 1‑3‑1 and I
thought we were really effective in that but she did a really good job
offensive rebounding, which she's really been working on that, as well.  
So I was really pleased with her overall effort and just how she didn't stand
around and settle for jumpers. She really went after the basket and I thought
she was really efficient.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Natalie reaching 1,000 points? And then can you talk
about McBride, she's really been on a tear here at the end of the season.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, Natalie, I was so happy for her to get her thousandth
point. Looked at that earlier in the season and wondered if it would happen in
the Tournament.  
She's doing a really good job of scoring around the basket. I think she's
looking to post up a lot more. She's rebounding more, offensive rebounding put
backs and doing a great job from the free throw line.  
So it's nice to get that out of the way, because I know that she knew she was
close, she didn't know how many she had, but it's nice to get that done so
that we can really focus on our next opponent.  
And Kayla McBride, she's an All‑American. She's playing great basketball.
She's played well all year long, very steady, very consistent and did it all
tonight, really happy, mostly with the rebounds for me, and that was the
biggest thing for her.  
  
Q. When you look at Jewell's game, 15 shots on the 27 points, some people
might look at Butler's 37 on 30 shots; but talk about her efficiency on the
offensive end.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, she really got great looks. She took two threes but the
rest of her shots were right around the basket. She's starting to use her
jumping ability. She's posting up a little bit more which is something we've
been working on with her, so if she can shoot the ball that efficiently, we
can get her the ball more and get her more shots.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Morgan Stroman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25234)

### [Stafanie Ydestrom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25235)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH MEIER: Everything that's been done in the history of the sport, really
neat for our players to understand the halfcourt, how it started, so we are
really embracing that. Very, very thrilled to be at such a classy site, so I
want to thank the university of Iowa and the NCAA committee for the bracket.  
Unfortunately we are a little bit used to playing on someone's home court and
it's not anything that is, you know, detriment. We love crowds. We love
playing in big moments, big games, and we have done it all year in the ACC.  
So we are ready for this. And we really feel, of all the teams, I think in the
nation, we have had a long time since we have played a game, but it's been
great for us. And sometimes I haven't felt that way in this position, waiting
so long to play an NCAA game.  
But this particular team, and my entire coaching career, I've not had a team
that wanted to get better so much. And every opportunity they wanted to get
better, they embraced, every practice: Coach, let's watch film; Coach can I
have time; Coach, give me something to work on; Coach, what can I do
differently in the NCAA Tournament that I wasn't doing all year. That's my
team. They missed a lot of their spring break, spent a lot of time together,
spent it in the gym and they have been happy.  
And so for me, I know that we have done our job in terms of we are ready to
play our best basketball of the year, and we know we have got a great opponent
ahead of us in the University of Iowa.  
  
Q. Morgan, what have you seen in Iowa's post play, specifically, Morgan
Johnson?  
MORGAN STROMAN: They have really nice size and they are versatile. They can
just come out and shoot a 16‑, 17‑foot jumper, and that's really all I've seen
on film. But we are just going to use our quickness to beat that.  
  
Q. How do you excel playing a low game in the tournament?  
STEFANIE YDERSTROM: I feel great about it. Like Coach says, playing in front
of a big crowd, and I'm just excited. I've never been to Iowa before, and it's
something different and that's what the NCAA Tournament is about. So, I'm
excited.  
MORGAN STROMAN: Same, as well. Just excited to be back playing. It probably
didn't really matter where we were playing. Just ready to play. No more
practice.  
I love practice, though, but, you know, just being out there on the court and
just my teammates, it's exciting to be back out there.  
  
Q. Coach Bluder has been pretty adamant the last few years about not liking
the time away between the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA. Seems like a lot of
the big conferences, including the ACC, do play that same weekend. You seem to
be embracing it; how come?  
MORGAN STROMAN: It's just time to get better. We have so much time off where
we can have our team chemistry and get better individually and just enjoy the
moment before we get in the game, but then you have that anxiety where you are
just so ready to play again.  
It has its ups and downs but it's time to get better as a player and as a
team.  
STEFANIE YDERSTROM: I agree, just embrace that opportunity to get better in
the tournament. Anything can happen so you have to get ready. You can't really
change it, so you might as well just make the best out of it.  
  
Q. Coach, Iowa has been a little streaky. In what you've seen, what is the
key when they are playing well?  
COACH MEIER: I can't tell you everything‑‑ Samantha Logic is critically
important. That Purdue game, they are unbeatable when she plays that way.  
I thought that was one of the best responses by a women's basketball team the
entire season where they had their backs against the wall, coming off a
five‑game losing streak, and just their demeanor, their mentality. They were
so determined to win that game, and that's what kind of launched them I think
into the postseason.  
I look for stuff like that. I have a ton of admiration for a coach and
coaching staff that can get their kids off the mat like that and get that
response, at Purdue. But that was by far her most incredible game of the year.
I think that's the first thing that jumps out at me is her play.  
  
Q. You've beaten Duke and Penn State; when you're playing well, what in
particular are you doing well?  
COACH MEIER: You know, details, communication and toughness, that's it. So we
have a young backcourt. We've been spoiled the four years prior; I knew who
had the ball and I didn't have to call many plays, or they made it on the fly.  
This year, it's been in the details and communication. Those things go hand in
hand, the communication, a quiet team is a certain is team, a loud team is a
certain team, and that's where we fluctuate and that's when we don't play well
versus we do play well.  
And then our toughness is just something that I think, you know, there's no
question in those particular games and games where we really, you know, let's
just say out before my ranking or something like that, we were tough as nails.  
  
Q. I think you have some ties to the University of Iowa, some siblings. Can
you explain that?  
COACH MEIER: I don't know if you want to know this‑‑ I wanted to come here. My
high school coach, he had to bring me in‑‑ I have two sisters‑‑ well, anyway,
I could give you a whole bio. But, Brady Bunch: Widow and widower got married,
eight of us, and two of them matched up as twins and they went through school.
I had two sisters that graduated that both came here and then I had a brother
that's two years older than me that came here.  
I spent a lot of time here. I did all the trips in the Van with mom and dad.
True story, my high school coach said: I think you're kind of good, because
some schools are looking at you, where do you want to go and I said,
University of Iowa, because I was so close with my family and I had so many
siblings. I was great at the time but probably wasn't good enough‑‑ I'm not
bitter‑‑ (laughter).  
  
Q. Who happened to be the coach at Iowa?  
COACH MEIER: Coach Stringer. I still have the letter‑‑ no, just kidding, I
don't. (Laughing).

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA

## March 23, 2013

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's been a great season for us so far. We're thrilled with the
No.1 seed. We had just so many great things happen for us this year, led by
these two right here, Skylar and Kayla McBride have had fantastic seasons and
now we're anxious for our second season to begin.  
  
Q. Skylar, first off, how are you feeling?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I'm fine.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you just talk a little bit about the challenge of playing
against smaller guards? How successful have you guys been against that this
year?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think we've come a long way for that. They're great guards.
They can create a lot on offense, and we have to be able to contain them, the
bigger guards, the post. Everybody is going to have to do their job.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about being a 1 seed that may be playing farther away
from home, in Iowa territory?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I mean, it doesn't really matter where we have to play. We're
here, said and done, and I don't think you worry about that now. It's just
about worrying about University of Tennessee Martin.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Yeah, I have to agree with Sky. I think we've played in a lot
of different environments coming out of the Big East and even the
non‑conference schedule that we're pretty much ready for anything.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk a little bit about what you expect (inaudible)?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Absolutely. I think their confidence has come a long way. If
you look at Madison Cable, Markisha Wright, Michaela Mabrey, they've
contributed in so many different ways, and I think we're going to need them a
lot down the stretch.  
  
Q. Skylar, in terms of the 2,000, 500, 500, what area are you most pleased
with with that accomplishment?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Probably the assists. It is great to create for people. To get
500 assists, and 500 made baskets, you've got to credit the teammates for
that. Over the years I've had the luxury of playing with people that just
moved so well without the basketball. Natalie Novosel, Becca Bruszewski,
Brittany Mallory, Kayla McBride, Natalie Achonwa, the players I've been able
to play with over the years, Lindsay Schrader, just been great players, just
to name a few. It's movement without the ball, and I think that's what
ultimately matters, not just finding them but then being able to catch and
finish.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the mindset you have to have, the lessons you've
learned from playing six games each the last two seasons in the tournament?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well I think we understand what it takes to get there, and I
think, like Kay‑Mac said, just the conference schedule that we play is so
tough, and I've said this before, you're playing elite level Final Four
through 16 games all the time, and I think ultimately that's what really
prepared us for the tournament, coming in with such a tough conference. Eight,
nine teams go every year the past couple years, and it's just been a great
conference to play in and help prepare us.  
And then Coach McGraw does a great job of making sure we're prepared one game
at a time, and I think that mindset is important because you don't look too
far into it. Last year we could have gotten anxious and looked to the
championship with the expectations on our team, but we kept that
one‑game‑at‑a‑time mindset, and I think that's helpful going into the
tournament.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Absolutely, and I think with our team, players like Kayla and
Natalie, Ariel, who have been to the championship every game, they can help
the younger kids out, and myself and Kaila Turner, also. But the upperclassmen
experience that we've had in the tournaments and our success kind of helps the
freshmen because they feel like they have people that have been there and done
that, and it kind of eases their mind.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this team's mental toughness, just the ability to keep
your composure and all those comebacks you've had this season?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Yeah, I mean, I think at the beginning of the year a lot of
people looked at us as a young team, not as experienced as most teams, even
though we have a lot of upperclassmen who have experience. But I think the
confidence and belief that we can win every single game, I think it's carried
over to the younger kids, and I think that their confidence has grown a lot,
and they can go out in different situations and be ready for anything, and
that's what mental toughness is. We've come a long way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenges of Tennessee Martin and the two guards,
Butler and Newsome?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Two of the best guards in the country, both in the top 10 in
scoring. They can shoot the three, they can put it on the floor, they can
attack the basket. Their assist‑to‑turnover ratio is good. They're as good a
guards as we've seen all year long, and it's going to be a challenge for us
trying to contain them.  
  
Q. Is this the kind of game where you try to get to their bench? Is that
pretty much where the battle lies?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think at this point I think most people are
shortening their bench and playing probably six or seven people, so I don't
know that that's as much a factor right now. I think everybody wants the best
players on the floor as long as they can keep them there.  
  
Q. How would you characterize the play of Markisha Wright this year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She was thrilled. She was the most excited person in the room
when she saw we were coming back to Iowa. I know the ticket requests are going
to be unbelievable for her. She's had a great year for us. She has played a
big role in recently the Big East Tournament, the last game against UConn with
Natalie Achonwa in foul trouble, she came off the bench and did a great job,
is good at defending. She's a physical post player, like what she's doing on
defense. She's a really smart player, picks things up really quickly, really
pleased with her progress this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jewell Lloyd's development? I know she's a freshman,
but it seems like she's already been tourney tested, so to speak.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she really has. She's been in some big games and she's
played well, had a career high against Baylor. She played well on the road in
a lot of games we've had. I love her attitude. She wants to get better every
game. Every day at practice she wants to get better. She keeps asking what she
can do to get better. She is an incredibly talented player who has unlimited
potential and definitely a bright future at Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Did some of the men's upsets Thursday and Friday help get this team's
attention?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's always good to see that. Of course we're cheering
for all the No.1 seeds. But I think it's good because I think it's a
realization that that can happen to you, and I think it puts you on guard a
little bit more.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of your inside players and also about
Carol Owens, just what gifts she has as a teacher?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Carol is the best post coach in the country. She's a phenomenal
teacher. She played the position, she knows exactly what they need to do, and
she is great about delivering her message. She challenges them, and they know
she cares about them but she can get on them pretty hard, and they respond
really well. Natalie Achonwa having the best year of her career, regional
all‑American. She is going to be just a force for us on the block. Ariel
Braker, I don't think you can say enough about the progress she's made this
year, definitely our team's most improved player, kind of the unsung hero of
the group doing what she does best, defending and rebounding and never trying
to step out of her role, just trying to do whatever she can to help the team.
But her progress has been phenomenal this year.  
And Markisha Wright, same thing, I think great growth as a player, has gotten
better almost every day and has given us really quality minutes this year.  
Really pleased with our post game overall this year.  
  
Q. On this 26 ‑game winning streak with some tough competition, what have
you learned about your team or what's the most exciting thing for you about
that winning streak?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the resilience. They're an amazing group. They come in
after a win and we're going to watch what we did wrong. We don't really look
at what we're doing well so much as how we can get better, and this is a team
that relishes that. They love to be challenged. They want to get better. So I
love their attitude coming back to practice every day with an eye on the goal
and never wavering from it. I don't think we've looked past anyone all year
long. We've risen to the challenge in all of our big games and have just had
some amazing wins because of the confidence, I think, of the group, certainly
led by Skylar.

### [Heather Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25229)

### [Kevin McMillan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25228)

### [Jasmine Newsome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25230)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH McMILLAN: We are excited to be back in the Tournament for our third
straight year. It's a tremendous accomplishment for these guys to have come as
far as we have with some of the issues that this team has had to go through.  
They have put us on our back for the last month of the season, and you know,
you don't want to be playing a 16, as you can see from the games that are
going on today. But the opportunity to be back and the notoriety that it
brings your university, we're real proud and looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how well you and jasmine play as a tandem,
because you're both prolific scorers and assist ‑makers and all those steals.
  
HEATHER BUTLER: Well, we definitely I think go well together on the court,
because she's a very good ball handler, and she definitely goes to the hole
very hard. When she does that, that kind of opens up for our shots on the
outside and for my shot.  
And so when she does that and goes to the lane hard, then we get our shots on
the outside. And if they don't help on us, you know, then she gets to go to
the lane. I think that definitely, we are very compatible with each other on
the court that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the matchup with Notre Dame's guards,
what are concerns and where you see some advantages for you guys?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: I haven't really thought about that, advantages, because I
haven't really seen them play this year. But I think we match‑up very well
with them, because like I'm sure they won't like really be worried about us.  
We are just going into the game with the mind‑set that we have nothing to
lose. Like we have played against good guards before, so I think we are
prepared for it.  
  
Q. You've played Stanford, you've played Baylor; does that take away a
little bit of the "wow" factor, playing a No.1 seed?   
JASMINE NEWSOME: Yes, I believe it does, because like I said, we played those
teams so we know what they are getting ourselves into.  
HEATHER BUTLER: I think definitely, that's why we schedule the big teams
during the year, Baylor, Stanford and Purdue and all of the big teams to kind
of prepare ourselves for the end of the season, for like tournament time right
here. And I definitely think that it got us prepared for now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the transition game, what it means to your
offense, and how efficient you guys are at that this season?  
HEATHER BUTLER: Well, during the beginning, we kind of looked to push the ball
a lot, and kind of toward the end, we kind of like looked to slow it down
sometimes and kind of speed it up when we had a good shot on transition.  
But I think coming into this game, I think that we've just got to be smart
with our possessions. If we have a fast break against, what, on five or
something, then we need to take it. But if not we need to slow down and run
our offense and execute and get a good shot.  
  
Q. You guys have won eight in a row, what's been the key to your success
during that winning streak?  
JASMINE NEWSOME: I think it was like one day in practice or something, Coach
came and said that he was like basically going to take over and we were going
to play the way we were supposed to play. Basically we knew that we had to win
games to like get a top seed in the OVC tournament and then once we got to the
OVC tournament, like we didn't want to lose. We didn't want to go home.  
  
Q. To both Jasmine and Heather, once you realized, whether it was freshman
year, or sophomore year that you guys kind of had the ability to become the
scorer you both are now.  
JASMINE NEWSOME: Oh, start with Heather.  
HEATHER BUTLER: First year when you're coming in, I didn't know what to expect
at all. Going against bigger colleges and bigger girls, because I wasn't used
to that in high school. And once we started playing those bigger teams, and we
started scoring, I definitely realized, okay, we definitely have a chance to
play with these people.  
And ever since, you know, playing that first big team, I remember realizing,
like Vanderbilt, we played Vanderbilt and I remember thinking, we can play
with these girls. We can't get intimidated. We've just got to go out there and
just play ball.  
JASMINE NEWSOME: Basically I just wanted to prove that I belong on the court
with bigger names, people. I just wanted to go out there and show people that
maybe overlooked me that I belong on the court with the same players.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Notre Dame's inside game and the challenges Achonwa
and Braker pose for you?  
COACH McMILLAN: Besides the fact that they have an inside game and we don't,
would be the first challenge. Those kids are overlooked. The guards get so
much attention for Notre Dame that you overlook those guys, and you can't,
because I think that‑‑ that may be a little bit of a key. You saw when Achonwa
got 20 and 20 a couple of games ago, you tend to think that that's a weakness;
and I thought the last time they played their last game in the championship,
that's where Connecticut tried to expose them was down low and it didn't work.  
So if that's not a weakness, we know the guards weren't a weakness, somebody‑‑
y'all have an idea what the weakness is? Give us some help here, guys. I do.  
I think that they are very team‑oriented players. They are not worried about
the spotlight. They are not worried about anything. They are kind of
blue‑collar kids. They do all the grunt work, I guess you could say. They are
the kind of kids that you have to have on your team if you're going to make a
run, and when you've got people that will sell out to doing the job that those
guys do, you see a great basketball team.  
  
Q. What's going to be the most critical element for your team to be
successful, the transition game, the ‑point shooting?   
COACH McMILLAN: The officials. If the officials blow the whistle, it's going
to be a different type of game. You know, we traditionally get to the free
throw line quite a bit but we play‑‑ this is the third NCAA Tournament, we
played Baylor, we played Stanford, we played Purdue and what happens in the
big game is that we shoot about half as many free throws as we do in any
other, normal game. But we don't run anything different.  
The teams are bigger, but the handshaking and the bumping is the same as it
always is. I don't know if it's that they think because you're in a
bigger‑name game that those are not as many falls or I don't know what. If we
average ten free throws, which is what we've done when we've played big teams,
it's going to be ugly.  
And the opportunity for us is, what if those two little guards that were
sitting here can get‑‑ we did it with Baylor. And if we can do it again with
Notre Dame, get them in foul trouble, and get them sitting over there on the
bench; I would like to see those guys sitting over there watching more than I
would to see them out there playing. They are great guards and I enjoy
watching whenever I can, but I would rather see them sitting over there.  
Butler and Newsmoe have the potential to cause some foul problems for people,
but the big question is going to be, are they going to call it. Last year in
the NCAA Tournament, playing Tennessee we said going in, we didn't want to be
intimidated, especially being from Tennessee. We told our kids to foul the
first possession, foul. I said, I don't care what you do; you've got to foul,
because we have to send a message that we are not going to be intimidated.  
And I had a little girl that fouled four times and the fourth one was called.
And she came over and apologized and said, "Coach, I grabbed her onceand they
didn't call it."  
I said, it's going to be a long night for us if they are not going to call
that. I'm not understating it; that's going to be the biggest thing, are there
going to be chances or four kids to get to the free throw line. If we are
shooting two free throws or four free throws, there's no way. We don't have a
prayer.  
And they are so good defensively, my gosh, they can switch everything. They
can defend us anyway they want to on the perimeter. They can change up ways
they defend. There's no real weakness for us to exploit, which is the
challenge. We don't want playing the big teams when they have a big slow post
kid even if they are an All‑American, so they will come out and try to defend
the kids on the perimeter, so we will try to do that. Or they may not have two
guards that can defend on the perimeter ‑‑ well, Notre Dame can do all those
things. There's challenge after challenge after challenge that's lined up for
us. We are going to need some help.  
  
Q. Were those two overlooked in the recruiting process because of their
size? How were you able to get them?  
COACH McMILLAN: If you saw them when they walked out of here, they looked more
like cheerleaders than basketball players. They are both interesting stories.
Butler played for me in high school since she was a ninth grader. I coached
her. When you ask her, when I got her, I said, you're going to have to shoot
for us.  
And she says, "Coach, that's not what I do, I'm a point guard, I don't shoot."
We started practicing and I sat her on the bench and we started practicing
without her. And we took a water break, and she said, what are you going to
do; and that was the last time I ever had to tell her, don't shoot and.  
What she did after that was phenomenal, broke state records, did all kind of
stuff. When I got the job at UTM, she was the one that we wanted to come with
us, and for obvious reasons. Being 5‑4 or 5‑5, you are going to be overlooked.
But she's a tough matchup to keep the people in front of you.  
So I had a connection with her, having coached her in high school, and the
strange thing was that jasmine was from milling ton high school in Tennessee
which is where I started. That's where I had my first job, and her family knew
that I had been there before and had done some research and her dad and I
talked, and he wanted her to come up there and play.  
And so you know, to get both of those kids was just a phenomenal coop for us,
but they weren't choosing. They only had two or offers on the table when they
were seniors, so I don't think today it would be that way because two Top‑10
scorers on the same team is probably not going to get overlooked but we were
fortunate that they were.  
  
Q. How has your team grown from the start of the season?  
COACH McMILLAN: We had a team last year that was in the tournament, and we
started four sophomores. We were in the tournament two years ago against Duke,
we started five freshmen I think.  
So we have gotten a little older. Well, at the end of last year, after this
game last year, we got home and the next day I had two walk in that quit and
just didn't want to play anymore. They are just going to school right now
getting to work on their degree.  
And that really put us in a bind because we had not recruited to fill that,
and so this year was a challenge at the beginning of the year because we were
trying to fill some holes that we didn't know we were going to have. So that
got us a little bit of a slow start.  
And plus we had scheduled thinking we were going to have those kids and be a
mature team heading into that process. Playing Stanford and Baylor, we had two
freshmen out there, and Lord, help those kids, golly. But then we've lost kids
for the season at various times, and every time we seem to think we are about
to get going somewhere, we lose another kid for the season. And I think at one
point we were down to seven players.  
I think we may be back up to eight right now, I don't know, we'll go in the
locker room and we'll see. And it's been a challenge, and she‑‑ her answer
was, you asked the question to Jasmine what was the change, what happened, and
literally that is what happened. I'm laughing, because I knew the kind of
answer you were looking for, and that wasn't it, but that is what happened.  
We just walked in one day and said, look, guys, we know what we can do, we
know this is the kind of team we need to be. Let's get rid of all this other
mess and let's go. Those two bought in and did it. It's been a strange year
for us with as good a team as we've had, with all the injuries and all the
different things, it's just been something that's every time you turn around,
you expect something else to hit you.  
This team, that's why I didn't think they would have the wherewithal to make
it back. That's why I'm proud of what they have been able to do.  
  
Q. USA Today released the voting for the coach's poll and you and a lot of
other coaches, after Notre Dame beat Connecticut in January, was still putting
Connecticut ahead of Notre Dame. Can you elaborate on your voting philosophy,
if you don't mind?  
COACH McMILLAN: That is a hard pole. I didn't think it was that hard until I
did it, because, it took me about till the middle of January to get
comfortable with the way I was voting. It's the first time I've done it.  
And so, what I did, and it was not right, and I guess I probably shouldn't be
saying this, but I would look at what‑‑ I would vote and I would look at‑‑ the
next week would come out and compare how it was and whatever, and I think
there's only one week that I was a real intelligent voter and I looked at, how
did I vote the week before and changed that based on the results. I let myself
get tainted too much by what‑‑ the pole came out, if that makes any sense.  
So it took me about till mid‑January to become an intelligent voter, where I
was looking at the way I thought it was and then taking the results from the
week and putting it back into the way I thought it was, rather than going with
what all the other voters were doing.  
Does that make any sense? They send you a list of how everybody did, and,
well, I would look at that list and I would vote based on that list and it
took me until mid‑January to go, I don't care how everybody else is voting and
do what I think it should be, which is what I should have been doing at the
beginning, which I guess was pretty dumb.  
I don't know when I put Notre Dame 2, but the truth is I would like Notre Dame
and Baylor to go play again and see if we might flip that vote. We've played
Baylor and Stanford, and now we'll play Notre Dame. And they are all great
teams. For a while there, you can vote those guys 1 through 4 and don't worry
about it, and especially when you saw them play each other, you saw that
happening. Hope that wasn't a bad answer, if I don't get in trouble‑‑ it was
honest.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

### [Morgan Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21475)

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: Well, it's great to be at home. Obviously this time of year,
still in the NCAA Tournament but to be at home is pretty special. This
afternoon was kind of weird, I'm at home cleaning my kitchen, not sure if
that's what most coaches are doing at NCAA Tournament time. That's what I was
doing. The team is coming over tonight for dinner. Unusual day for us, as far
as NCAA Tournament goes, the day preceding those.  
We are really looking forward to having the opportunity to host and have this
tournament on our home court. I think it's a great privilege for us to be able
to host. I want to thank our administrators for doing all the extra work that
has going in to putting on a tournament like this, securing the bid and then
also all the work that they have done in putting on a first‑class tournament.  
I think the fans, the Hawkeye fans that come out are going to see some great
basketball and they are going to enjoy this national tournament here in Iowa
City.  
  
Q. The seniors want to leave a legacy and now that you're in NCAA Tournament
time, advancing past the first round, what does winning a game mean to maybe
how you guys want to end your career?  
JAIME PRINTY: Since I've been here we've only won one NCAA Tournament game,
and that was my freshman year. Being able to play at home and in front of our
own fans and on our home court is a huge advantage for us and we are all
really excited. Just hope we come out and win this first one so we have a
chance to play again at home.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: It's just an amazing opportunity, any opportunity to get to
play here on this stage in March Madness is really extremely awesome. We are
excited to play that game and as seniors we want to go out of this building‑‑
one at a time, but we are excited for them both.  
  
Q. What have you seen from their center, pretty solid player.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: She's really tall. She's 6‑6 and she moves her feet well, gets
up‑and‑down on the floor really well so transitioning is going to be key
against her. She also likes to turn and get this quick shot. She's a good
shooter and just being able to pressure her is going to be really important.  
  
Q. Their coach kind of talked about, she thought the way to shut down the
Iowa offense is to keep you from distributing the ball. Have you had teams do
that? How do you counter?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think you can't really focus too much on one player on
our team. We just have so many different weapons, so many different games,
that I don't think a team can really completely stop our team stopping one
player. You definitely just have to use the tools that I have around me to get
our offense going and keep everything under control. So they can try to; but,
it's not just one player on our team obviously.  
  
Q. They are a pretty good offensive team, what are you going to have to do
to counter that?  
JAIME PRINTY: I think we just need to play the style of basketball we like to
play and get each other involved and really have a variety in our offense.
They also like to press a lot and we have been working on that a lot this
week, breaking the press with confidence and taking care of the ball. I think
that will be huge this game.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I agree, I think we do a good job moving the ball‑‑ if we keep
moving well and break their press (inaudible).  
  
Q. Having these tournament games here at home, does that seem to increase
the amount of time when you guys are out and about on campus or at the grocery
store, whatever? Do people mention this? Does it strike you as more of a local
happening?  
JAIME PRINTY: Yeah, I've been, I mean, out and about and a lot of people have
told me they are really excited to watch you go and how excited they are that
we get to play at home; that they are going to not have to travel to come
watch us play. That's exciting and hopefully we'll get great support from our
fan base.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It's nice to have it close to home and also for a lot of us,
not a far drive for families, and that helps out a lot, too. But our fan base
is great all the time and having a national tournament hosting it, definitely
hope will increase that.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: We all went to the men's game last night and we got a big
standing ovation. You just can tell that the Hawk fans are really here to
support athletics, whether it's men or women's basketball. They have been
supporting us this whole time, whether it's Tweets or on Facebook. They have
done a great job showing us they are here to support us all the way through.  
  
Q. It's been 16 days since you're last game, and I know Coach has been
against a long layoff; the Miami people said they embraced the break, gotten a
lot better. What in your mind ‑‑  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think we have focused on what was hurting us a lot,
especially against Nebraska, Big Ten Tournament. Just boxing out, which we'll
really need to focus on tomorrow. You know, and just going through all of our
stuff and everything like again. But on the defensive end, especially, I think
we have been focusing on improving ourselves in that aspect.  
MORGAN JOHNSON: A lot of what Sam said; we worked on, everything, back to
basics a little bit. We just continued to grow with the program, go back to
those basic fundamentals and work on those every day. That's been really good.  
JAIME PRINTY: A lot of times during the season we don't have time to work on
yourself because you're always getting ready for the next opponent. That we
can we had where we didn't know who we were going to play yet, we focused on
ourselves and worked on things that could make a difference in these upcoming
games, so I'm pretty thankful for that.  
  
Q. At the men's game, you were wearing ‑‑  
MORGAN JOHNSON: Yeah, everything's completely fine. It's just totally
precautionary. Everything's good.  
  
Q. Before the end of the season, you lost five straight, you beat Indiana,
Northwestern and you beat Northwestern again. In that win streak there, did
you start to see what we had seen from the team earlier this season? Because
it looked like with the struggles that was not looking good for your
tournament hopes at that point.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, it's all how you look at it. I look at we won four of our
last five; I look at it the other way around. In our last four‑game stretch,
we had two games against Top‑25 teams and we had three games that were on the
road, and we went 3‑1 in that series. I think that's a really good. And so I
think at the end of the year, we got things together, we played very well, we
ended up winning four of those five games, so I think things are good.  
  
Q. So much of what any season comes down to is what is done in March. How
much do you talk about that? Like Jaime said, you had the one victory when she
was a sophomore. How much do you talk about that; hey, let's make a run or
what do we do to make a run?  
COACH BLUDER: No, we don't talk about making a run. We talk about winning one
game at a time and that's all that really matters is the next game that we
have ahead of us. We are just happy to be playing at home. Yes, we'd like to
play two games at home, but right now it's all about one game at a time.  
  
Q. What's on the menu? You said the team was coming over for dinner
tonight.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, you know, some of the favorites. I'll give you a hint: I'm
not cooking, so they will like it, and they probably won't get sick, so that's
good. A little lasagna, a little chicken, good stuff.  
  
Q. You've had time to kind of spend a week on Miami, what's the scouting
report on them, without giving too much away.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, excellent defensive team as you know, just by looking at
their numbers. Excellent defensive and rebounding team. Their center is very
good. She's been playing really well, especially in the last few games. Her
numbers have really went up. She has been shooting the ball very well on the
paint.  
So then, you know, their press is something that we have got to be thinking of
because it's something they have done a lot of, and we have seen it on and off
during the year, but not consistently.  
  
Q. There's a number of coaches who have kind of proposed the idea of playing
the first couple of rounds ‑‑ home court situation. Why is it important for a
team to have the opportunity to host games?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, everybody complains that there's not enough parity in
women's basketball, and this is the only way we are going to develop more
parity is by having more home sites and not just the same 16 sites every year.  
If we do that, that's the way it used to be and we went away from that because
it wasn't good for our sport, so I don't know why we would go back to that and
it wasn't good and we went away from it. I think we want to continue to grow
our game.  
We have to grow parity, and that means improving the teams that are 16‑100 or
16‑50, and those are some of those people that get to host now. And the Top‑16
are definitely getting their share of host opportunities, as well.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA  65  
IOWA STATE - 60

  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all I certainly want to thank everyone at Gonzaga,
did an amazing job; the people of Spokane, Washington, it was honor for Iowa
State to be here and I want to thank earn, Joel, his entire staff, amazing,
amazing event. Gave our kids memories of a lifetime, and it was an honor to be
here and play in this facility and be around these people.  
Certainly want to thank the NCAA Committee for giving us the opportunity to
play in this tournament.  
Certainly want to congratulate Georgia. That's a great basketball team. It was
a great women's college game. That's what the NCAA Tournament's about.  
And I'm very, very proud of our team, very proud of our effort, and one or two
missed shots here or there, that's this tournament. But certainly proud of our
effort and excited the way they represented their school and their fan base.  
Thank you to everyone for everything they did. It was an amazing event.  
  
Q. So what's the range of emotions after the final stretch, and what were
you thinking as you made the 19 ‑1 run and then they come right back, what was
going through your mind?   
ANNA PRINS: I mean, I think when you're in a situation like that, you know, I
think honestly I don't really remember it.  
All I knew and all we knew as a team, that we needed to keep pushing the ball.
We needed to keep playing the way that Iowa State plays. And you know, it was
a really fun stretch at the end when we started to hit shots and, you know,
started to get back in the game.  
You know, unfortunately, it didn't end the way that we wanted, but I think you
know, this will be a great memory for all of us and I'm just really proud to
hope be alongside these girls and it will be a great memory.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, everybody was just really excited. It was a fun game.
We lost to a great team, great players.  
I mean, just to play against a team that tough, especially our last game, I
mean, there's not a better way we would want to go out. We gave it our all. We
left everything on the court. We never gave up, especially in the end. That's
just‑‑ I mean, I'm proud of each and every one of us.  
  
Q. Chelsea, at 51 ‑37, some of us down on the press row were thinking,
you're running out of gas out there. But were the players thinking that, could
you tell that you still had an extra burst in you?   
CHELSEA POPPENS: As a team or‑‑ yeah, we never give up. It's been in our past
few games that we've been through, we've never backed down. We've always just
kept going, kept grinding. Kept trying to make one shot after another.  
There's never a point in time where we're completely gassed. We have so much
heart on our team that just being down isn't going to stop us from trying to
come back, working harder. There's always going to be a little bit of energy
left for us, enough for us to leave it all out there.  
  
Q. Can you walk me through that shot awed, 60 ‑59, they had just taken the
lead and you got into the lane, was that a play call or anything, and what did
you think of the look you got? It looked decent but there was a lot of bodies
in there, as well.   
NIKKI MOODY: It wasn't really a play call. The play broke down and Coach
Fennelly always says, try to get out of a bad play. I saw the lane and just
tapped it.  
  
Q. Anna, after you took that four ‑point lead was there defensively anything
you didn't think you did as a team that you regret, or is it just Georgia
making some big shots and nothing you can kind of do about it?   
ANNA PRINS: Well, I think when it comes down to it, Georgia is a great team
with a lot of great players on it. They made big plays at the end. You can
always look back and say what if, what if, but like Chelsea said, we gave it
everything we had, and I think as a whole, just trying not to look back at
what we didn't do but what we did do.  
And again, Georgia is a great team and I think they just made some great plays
at the end.  
  
Q. Did you feel comfortable with the distance of that three ‑pointer with 18
seconds left?   
ANNA PRINS: Well, I mean, I knew that time was running out and we needed to
get a shot up. You know, I'm disappointed it didn't go in, but you can't look
at that.  
  
Q. Can you just sum up what this season has meant to you, just to get that
second place finish and 24 wins this year?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, this past season has been great. I couldn't ask for a
better group of girls to have‑‑ like for Anna, too, for our senior year, we
had so much great chemistry. We all were there for each other, we played for
each other, we played to have fun and we played for the right reasons.  
It's just great to go out, like end our Iowa State career with such a great
team, such good memories and so much bonding. The season's been great and
really successful, and I'm just really happy to have made it this far.  
ANNA PRINS: It's been an amazing year, I know Amanda Zimmerman, Chelsea and I,
we've had a lot of talks where we are super proud to be on this team. I will
never forget this year‑‑ sorry (eyes tearing up).  
This has been the most amazing experience of my life, and I will take a lot
from this. I feel completely prepared to go into life now. I can't even put
into words how much this whole experience has meant to me.  
Coach Fennelly and the girls and the coaching staff and just everyone who has
done so much for us, I'm just so grateful and I will always remember this. So
yeah, I can't really put it into words.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked the girls, that wild final nine minutes where you come
back and then they hit big shots, how do you put that into words? Have you
seen anything like it?  
COACH FENNELLY: They call it March Madness for a reason. That's college
basketball. That's the way the game should be played. A great women's college
game in the NCAA Tournament, great for TV.  
Certainly appreciate the Gonzaga fans coming out and hopefully we gave them
their money's worth. You know, our kids kept playing. It's 51‑37 and I got
into them a little bit, and just challenged them to finish. We take great
pride in finishing everything we've done, good and bad. And they did and they
gave themselves a chance to win, Georgia came back, hit some big shots.  
Probably haven't in a long time shot the three ball like they did today; but
that's what great players do, hit big plays, hit big shots. We hit them, they
hit them.  
But what I told our players is, whatever happened in that 51‑37 time, to the
time the game ended, whatever they did inside themselves, take with them the
rest of their life, that was special. Average teams don't do that. Average
kids don't do that. The kids who wear an Iowa State uniform do that, and I was
very proud of that fact.  
  
Q. You were up, 56 ‑52, was it just a testament to Georgia, as well‑‑  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, 6:52 they got a dribble drive, kick to the corner. Barb
hits a shot, tough shot, and then we are up one and there's a scramble play.
Pop ends up on the floor and her man, Armstrong, is trailing, and we just
couldn't get there in time. It was a scramble and Kidd hit a big shot.  
Kind of like us, we hit a couple open threes in transition and then they came
right back, but two big plays. And they ran the back big play for the lob and
we didn't defend that great. You know, like Anna and Chelsea said, there's so
many plays that go either way in a game like this, but our kids competed, and
that's‑‑ I've always told them, you know, when the season does end, be able to
walk out of the building with your head up and appreciate your effort and your
teammate's effort.  
Anyone says Iowa State didn't compete like crazy tonight, come see me. I'll be
out in the hallway real quick, so we'd love to talk to you now that the season
is over.  
  
Q. The string of three ‑pointers they made in the first half, you came out
in a 2‑3 zone; what was the strategy going in, and did you expect that
shooting?   
COACH FENNELLY: We were trying to change defenses a little bit. We tried to
play zone, because we wanted to stay out of foul trouble.  
The strategy was, they are not a great three‑point shooting team. You look at
their numbers, they are 27 percent on the season, and we wanted to keep people
in front of us. Jasmine James hits two, and she's hit three all year. That's
NCAA Tournament basketball. A couple other kids, same thing.  
But we tried to change defense, because we wanted to stay out of foul trouble.
We were really worried about them pounding it at us. And we got to halftime,
the score tied, felt pretty good about it. The plan was to play a lot of man
the second half; if we could get to the second half, that's kind of what we
did.  
Defensively we were okay. I don't have any real problems with it. Kept them
off the free throw line, almost every three they made is either a great play
by one of their players or a coaching mistake by me. The two threes that
Jasmine James made, for sure, is on me because I said don't cover her on the
three‑point line. She's 3‑for‑28 on the season; I'm going to let her shoot it
every time. So those are the things that you have to do this time of year, and
great teams make plays, and they made them and they deserved to win because of
it.  
  
Q. You also really clamped down on their leading scorer for the season,
Hassel, and she was looking quite frustrated for the first half; was there
something special you were doing there?  
COACH FENNELLY: The thing you try to do with a great post player like that is
limit her initial position, don't let her get two deep.  
And then Anna did a great job; and Chelsea, we just said, make her score over
the top of you. She has a lot of counter moves. Don't let her push you up the
lane and shove you up the lane and get a lob. Make her hit a tough shot over
the top of you. And I thought for the most part, they did a good job of that.
For a kid that gets the looks she get to go 3‑for‑12 defensively, that was a
pretty good effort.  
  
Q. When you look at the season's big picture, do you see your image
reflected in this team, how they approach stuff, kind of more big picture?  
COACH FENNELLY: My image? Oh, no. If it does, that's a huge compliment to me,
because that's an amazing group of kids, and I love coaching this team. They
gave me something back that I thought I lost. I really‑‑ I mean that.  
To be around them every day and to see how hard they worked at things, and the
progress they made, and the way they cared about one another, and the way they
wore a uniform that means so much to so many people, amazing. It's hard to end
it. It's going to end sometime, but there's no regrets. Just I told them, no
excuses, no regrets. We have none, and we are very proud of that.  
  
Q. What was it that you lost, you said that they gave back?  
COACH FENNELLY: I lost a little bit of belief in people understanding and
wanting to do things the Iowa State way. There were kids on our team in the
past that didn't get it that weren't fair to the Lindsays of the world and
other former players that had worked to hard to build a program that is so
special, with so many special people. There's no way to quantify that. And I
did not want to be involved or around people that didn't get it and understand
it and believe it and live it and love it, and this team did. I will always be
indebted to them before that.  
Everyone at Gonzaga, thank you so much and everyone at Spokane, amazing,
amazing. The atmosphere here was fantastic and thank you forgiving our kids
something they will remember the rest of their life.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA - 65  
IOWA STATE - 60

  
COACH LANDERS: It was very much the game that we thought it would be, and we
have nothing but respect for Iowa State and the job that they did. They were
very good tonight. They shot the three ball very well. They took advantage of
their size in the paint and Prins played that out exceptionally well. Just a
well‑coached game from Iowa State's part. They did what they needed to do, and
really did a nice job with it on the defensive end. They were on point.  
You know, we didn't get as much as we would like to have gotten out of
ourselves offensively or out of our sets, but our players really did a nice
job of making plays throughout the game, and particularly at the end of the
game when we had lost the lead.  
But it's the kind of game that we thought it would be. I thought Iowa State
defensively was very good. I thought that Georgia defensively was
extraordinary.  
  
Q. I saw you looking pretty impressed by a stat there ‑‑  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: Jasmine James with eight rebounds, that's crazy.  
  
Q. That's actually the segue to my next question. You guys had spoken of
wanting a legacy, to change something towards the program, can you go into
that a little bit and what did you see out of that tonight?  
JASMINE HASSELL: You said change, right? I think our seniors, when we first
got here as freshmen, our theme was change. Ever since then, that's been our
theme kind of because we came in at a point in time where Georgia needed a
little change, and as you see, we continued to change and do some big things
for Georgia.  
JASMINE JAMES: One of the things that had to do with change was getting back
to the tradition of Georgia basketball and the tradition of Georgia basketball
is Sweet16s, Elite 8s, Final Fours, competing in the National Championship
games, not just to go to the NCAA Tournament.  
So to win this game tonight and to be making that step to be going to the
Sweet16 and trying to compete in order to try to work to get to the Elite 8 is
definitely a step.  
THE MODERATOR: Georgia's 20th trip to the Sweet16, third all time in NCAA
history.  
  
Q. The third senior in this group is not on the podium, but can you talk
about an Marie's play tonight? Seemed like she was all over the court even
with four fouls.  
JASMINE JAMES: I think Anne Marie was huge today. She really made some great
plays and knocked down some huge shots that allowed us to gain momentum as
well as keep momentum. Whenever we really needed something that I felt like it
was her or Cobi, they were both huge today.  
But Anne Marie, she was great, and it's definitely great to be able to see her
play as well as she did tonight. I feel like she's been battling with her
ankle injury all year and now here it is, that's the Anne Marie we know and so
it was great to see her back out there like that.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I definitely agree with Jasmine James. She played awesome
tonight and did what she had to do.  
She said in the huddle we had, she's like, "Guys, this can't be our last
game." Of course, she's a senior, and just to see her come out and give it her
all was amazing.  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: I think coming off a game like she did yesterday, it's a big
statement of who she really is and how good she can really play, and she just
had a real big game for us tonight.  
  
Q. When you see that the team only had five turnovers, and Iowa State was
commenting that they were just going to let you shoot the three pointer, and
so I wanted your response to both of those things.  
JASMINE JAMES: First off, to comment on the turnovers, you know, it was one
thing that we focus on is try to take care of the ball as much as possible. At
this point in the season, the NCAA Tournament is a possessions game. You can't
just throw away possessions and throw away the ball and lose opportunities to
score the ball. So overall, we did a very good job of taking care of the ball.  
And as far as them letting me shoot the three pointer, we won by five points,
so I hit two (shrugs shoulders). It is what it is. (Laughter) It must have
been a good move. It wasn't‑‑ I mean, it worked out well for us, so I'll take
it.  
  
Q. How about going to the line twice late in the game as a freshman; how
many nerves were boiling in you or did you feel comfortable?  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: All of them were boiling. But I knew it was time to step up
and like I practice them, just try to knock them down, and I did, but I was
nervous.  
  
Q. The length of Anna Prins looked like it was so tough to go against
tonight and seemed like when Anne Marie started driving to the basket you got
a couple put backs and that got your confidence going in the second half; can
you talk about that?  
JASMINE HASSELL: Oh, yeah, she was big, but like I say all the time, it's not
about me. It's about Georgia, and tonight my teammates stepped up and I'm very
proud of them. They did what they have to do, and I'm just proud to be a part
of the Sweet16. We still won and all my teammates played great tonight and I'm
just glad we went to the Sweet16.  
  
Q. You guys haven't been the best three ‑point shooting team throughout the
season. Has this kind of shooting been I guess‑‑ been there, capable of this
throughout the year, and why was it tonight, you guys were so good shooting
from beyond the arc?   
SHACOBIA BARBEE: We just‑‑ we're good shooters. All of our guards can shoot
the three. We have four men that can shoot the three. It's been there all
season. It's just that we just have to be consistent with it starting now.  
And tonight, we knew that we had to knock down the big shots. You're wide
open, you've got to knock it down and hit it. That was just a big focus.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotions of the team during that 19 ‑1 run by Iowa
State late in the game? How did you guys‑‑ with you are you able to withstand
that?   
JASMINE JAMES: I think we did a good job of sticking to go. It was like we had
two time‑outs during that period and every time we went to the time‑out it was
just like, we're okay. Good teams make runs, it's okay. Just go out there, try
to lock down on defense and execute what we need to do on the offense.  
I don't ever think there was a point like we were worried. We knew that we
needed to go out there and just buckle down on defense and just‑‑ and
everything will take care of itself.  
I think just everybody did a really good job of sticking together and keeping
each other up and making sure that nobody got down about anything, and we just
stayed focused on the ultimate goal, which was being able to come out with the
win, and we did that.  
  
Q. You had spoken this season about the ability of your players to provide
things in the game that don't show up in the stat sheet, and it just seemed
like Anne Marie sometimes tonight, getting loose balls, it just seemed like
that exemplified that; can you just talk about that a little bit?  
COACH LANDERS: Yeah, she's really smart, and as a player, she's really easy
for me to communicate with, because she gets me; Cobi gets me; Tiaria gets me.
And when I say that, it's like you say something one time and they are good to
go with it.  
Other players get me, but they have to ask, is this to understand what you're
saying, is this what you want; they get me first time.  
To give you an example of what Anne Marie did tonight. We said, we don't mind
giving up the two. If they are going to throw it inside, just be sure she
shoots over your belly‑‑ I mean, Anne Marie was great. Every shot that Prins
shot was contested. Prins was terrific. She did exactly what she needed to do.  
But here's what you're talking about. Then there would be a guard driving
somewhere that she leans over to help just enough to get it stopped, and then
go back to her man; sometimes go back to her man and knock the pass down. She
gets that.  
Hassel is being posted inside; she's opened, pointing at her man, pointing at
Hassel, cheek down, trying to discourage the ball from coming in. She gets
'help.'  
And then the other thing offensively, now tonight ‑‑ let me brag for a minute.
We were terrific on defense. We were really, really good. Prins killed us.
Nobody else did. And we made that decision earlier. We'll give up some twos
inside. Let's just not give up a load of threes.  
We gave up a load of threes, but boy, we shut everything else out. We guarded
all their stuff, that they did us; they were really good defensively. We
couldn't get Hassel in the position that we need to get her in and get her the
ball. And at her size, you've got to get her the ball at the right place,
right time, right‑‑ because she's not going to be able to go over somebody
6‑7\.  
So they were really good defensively. Gets down to the last three minutes,
what does Anne Marie do? Reverse the layup, drop a three. And then Cobi, she's
a freshman, she doesn't even know any better, she drops one on top of it and
we're back in control. Just makes plays.  
It's frustrating because sometimes you can run plays for them, get them wide
open, they make you look horrible if you miss it, put them in a position where
they have to make a play and be a hero, they can do that.  
  
Q. That last three minutes, it was very up ‑and‑down, back and forth, there
wasn't a lot of stoppage. Why did you feel comfortable just letting your
players go and not maybe trying to take a little bit more control at that time
and use a time‑out?   
COACH LANDERS: Because when we were in transition, everybody looked good.
Nobody looked panicked. Nobody looked like they were in a hurry. We had five
turnovers the whole night. JJ did a terrific job of running our basketball
team.  
And if I call a time‑out, what was I going to say to them? Nothing we called
worked. If they can make a play in transition, it might be better than calling
a play and a time‑out.  
  
Q. You've spoken about this team's focus, and going back after the Texas A
&M game, there's a story about how after a bad practice, you locked the gym.
Did the focus augment after that or did it really increase?   
COACH LANDERS: It got better. The message I think was received.  
With young people today‑‑ I've got great kids, you can tell that, can't you?
I've got unbelievable kids. I mean, they are wonderful. But with young people
today, their memory is‑‑ they are just‑‑ they don't remember things very long.
That's just the way it is.  
It's a different world. This is the Internet. This is the tech generation. I
mean, think about what they do. They play video games and if they don't like
the way it's going, they restart it. They just push restart and start over.
Their memories are not very long. It never has to be. They get instant
information off of their cell phone. They don't have to look for anything very
long.  
And the sad piece of all that, what I see with young people in this generation
is they don't understand how to invest. They are not real invested in anything
because all the information that they need in their world, all the
entertaining that they need, it's on their fingertips all the time.  
When I was in college, you sit in front of the radio for an hour and a half
waiting for your favorite song; they have 300 of them on their belt. It's
real. They wait for nothing.  
Their memories aren't real good. It was that piece, locking them out of the
gym got their attention. It was good for about two weeks. Then you've got to
play the game they play. You've got to push restart. You've got to change the
game. Invent something different. Get their attention and then go with that
and then a week, two weeks later, you've got to come up with a different song
and a different dance.  
You know, the one thing that I will say for them, is the one thing we don't
change; if you're going to play at Georgia, you're going to play really,
really hard and you're going to be unselfish, and that piece is consistent. We
may change some things around, but you're going to be a good person and you're
going to play really, really hard and you're going to play unselfish.  
And that's what you've seen with two teams here. You've seen a team come out
totally focused on the defensive end. I don't know what you thought, but as
their coach, I think that they are spectacular defensively. Iowa State is a
great offensive basketball team, great. I have no doubt that we can guard
them, size and everything. I didn't know really‑‑ you never know exactly how
it's going to look.  
But now that it's over, it looked kind of the way I thought it would. I knew
we would give up stuff inside because of the size and because we are going to
have to pressure.  
You know who was terrific, who goes totally unnoticed? Tiaria Griffin. I mean,
this little joker just plugs in right under the ball. And you can't get away
from her, and it's constant. I mean, that kid, that point guard at Iowa State
is really good. Couldn't get away from her, 40 minutes, every minute she
played.  
And what it does, it allows everybody else on your basketball team to get up,
have a chance for a deflection. Or if you are going to be a half a step late,
that could have cost us a three, you know. But you're not because Tiaria has
got so much pressure on the ball, takes another hand‑‑ and that's where it all
starts, with her.  
I'm sorry, I rambled. Did I use all my time? Can we go now?  
But Iowa State is really, really good. I really hated that somebody had to
lose. I'm glad it was them but they are really, really good. I mean, they were
well coached tonight, guys, Iowa State. Did they ever say they got frustrated
offensively, any at all? Because we did. I hope they did, because they sure
frustrated us.  
Anything else? Thanks.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Iowa State, press conference for the game tomorrow 6:30 against
Georgia. We have Coach Bill Fennelly, as well as student athletes Anna Prins
and Chelsea Poppens.  
For Chelsea and Anna, if they want to give their reactions to last night's
game after having a night to absorb it and watching some video of it, just
your reaction.  
ANNA PRINS: Well, obviously we are really excited. It's always a lot of fun to
keep moving forward in the tournament. We were able to play in a great
atmosphere and get the W, and I don't know, it was a really fun game, and I
think we're all really proud of ourselves, and, I don't know, just excited to,
again, move forward.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Like she said, we're excited and I'm proud of my teammates
and the way we conducted ourselves throughout the game and just maintained
pressure and didn't back off and just kept going. It was a really fun game,
fun crowd. It's just exciting just to be able to go on to the second round.  
  
Q. Anna, just to be a senior and have a chance to go to the Sweet16, what's
that mean? And two ‑part question, what does it say about a team that could
potentially advance there?   
ANNA PRINS: Well, I mean, it's exciting to think about, but I mean, you know,
I think in the Tournament, you have to think about the game that you're about
to play and not necessarily, you know, what could be.  
And I think, you know, like I said before, we're just excited to be at this
point that we're at and, you know, ready to go to practice in a little bit and
learn about Georgia and what they have to offer on the court.  
You know, just‑‑ I don't know, just trying to enjoy as a senior, enjoy the
moment that we're in, and with the girls; it's definitely an exciting time.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I feel like she basically covered every area of it. I'm just
excited to keep playing. Obviously we want to make it further, but we have to
look at the present and focus on the now.  
  
Q. Starting with Chelsea, looking at Georgia ‑‑  
CHELSEA POPPENS: We haven't really gone over scouting reports or practice yet,
but they are going to be a tough time and I know we are going to have to be
able to stick with their pressure and be able to guard them inside and out. I
know they have quite a few good three‑point shooters. We just have to play
good defense and hold our own.  
ANNA PRINS: Like Chelsea said, we haven't gone much over them, just little of
the scouting reports, a little of that. But just watching them yesterday, they
are a great team. And they have got some tough physical players, drivers,
three‑point shooters, but we'll learn more about them later today and just
excited to play them.  
  
Q. What can you take from the game with Georgia yesterday, anything
specifically you're looking for in watching that game.  
ANNA PRINS: I don't think, I think I just noticed the team as a whole. They
did look physical and I don't know, it was a fun game to watch. We were there
for the first half of the game, so didn't get to see the second but I think
that's mostly what I talk out of it, great rebounding team, too, I noticed
that as well.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I noticed they are really good and quick on their feet and
they know how to get to the right people at the right time. We are just ready
to go up against them, try to is see their weaknesses just go at it.  
  
Q. Coach Landers mentioned yesterday that they don't minding being
aggressive, is that something you relish and what goes into playing a team
that's aggressive and hard like that?  
ANNA PRINS: I think playing a team that is really aggressive, I did notice,
too, they did a lot of trapping. I think it's being able to attack pressure.  
I think one thing we learned from the game, Gonzaga game, and they did a good
job of pressuring us, trapping us. I think just staying calm and not letting
pressure rile you up, I think is really important, because that's what causes
turnovers. I guess focusing on the way that we play is going to be the most
important thing to focus on.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Like she said, I mean, Gonzaga did a really good job of
putting pressure on us, and I'm sure Georgia will go about that same way,
trying to put pressure on us and force us to make turnovers.  
We had quite a few turnovers yesterday, and our goal is just to reduce that
amount and have more poise and be able to better attack the basket.  
  
Q. Can you speak a bit of the experience of coming halfway across the
country to try to get to play in the same place the following weekend?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: It's just a great experience to be able to like stick around
the same place. It's a great atmosphere and Gonzaga has great people. We have
been walking around town and everyone has been super friendly, super nice. And
just being able to ‑‑ just to be able to stay in the same place, it's a
challenge.  
At the same time, you've got to maintain like school while you're gone if you
have to stay here and you have to be able to organize yourself and keep the
goal at mind.  
ANNA PRINS: Yeah, it's a great experience. I know a lot of us were excited
when we found out we were coming here. I don't think a lot of us have been to
Spokane. It's a gorgeous place. Like Chelsea said, really nice people.  
I think it does help to be able to continue in the same spot. I don't know, I
have just been enjoying the scenery. I'm Colorado, and pretty similar with the
mountains and stuff. So it's nice to be back in kind of a familiar atmosphere
as far as the scenery.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Fennelly, and he can maybe answer the same
question we first started with: Any more reactions from last night's game
after looking at a little video?  
COACH FENNELLY: I mean, not a lot of sleep last night obviously for the
coaches. The way we do things is we want our players to enjoy the experience,
and sometimes when you get in these events, the game ends and you're so
focused on the next one.  
So we told them: Go to dinner, relax, enjoy themselves, watch the men's games.
We give them a scouting report that they could look at. We haven't met with
them yet because we wanted them to watch our men's game, enjoy that, and we
will literally go over some stuff here in the gym and then watch some video
when we get back.  
But this experience is one that you talk so much about as a coach, as a
player, administrator, fan, media, and if you don't enjoy it, it kind of goes
away. So we try and let them enjoy the win, it was a great environment, a
great evening. Everyone was into the game from the start, and one of those
atmospheres that women's basketball needs more of, and it was fun to be a part
of it last night.  
  
Q. What concerns you most about Georgia, the quick scouting report.  
COACH FENNELLY: The biggest things always with Andy's teams is they are
extremely physical, one through five. It's not just Hassel and Butler (ph) in
the post. Their guards are big, strong kids. They attack the basket. They are
going to defend us like crazy. You know, they are a team that doesn't shoot
the three point shot a ton. They drive the ball at you, points off turnovers.  
You know, a Georgia team is a Georgia team. The names change a little bit but
the personality doesn't because of the way Andy coaches and the kind of kids
he gets, but they are going to defend with great energy and they are going to
deny all over the court.  
You know, I thought Montana played them really hard. You're going to have to
make some shots, try to rebound the ball a little bit. But their depth is a
concern for us a little bit. They played a lot of kids yesterday, and
obviously we only played six. For the most part our kids were tired, a lot of
ice baths and stretching last night.  
I don't know how much we'll get done in practice today, but the Georgia
mind‑set, they are built for the SEC. It's like every team is built for
certain things, and Georgia is built for an SEC team, and Andy's teams are
always the same way. We have played them twice in the NCAA Tournament a long
time ago; we lost to them in the Final Four, and then we lost to them a few
years ago in Minneapolis.  
So, tough to score against and you'd better rebound the ball.  
  
Q. Can you think of any current ties between the programs that you know of,
players or anybody down the line?  
COACH FENNELLY: Shannon Becker, the trainer for Georgia, was my trainer with
the USA team when we went to Australia, when we went to China with the World
University Games team. I think the game, I mentioned that we lost in to go to
the Final Four, my defensive ‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ Kelly, Coco Miller,
All‑Americans. I think they both got about 30 on us.  
And Georgia has recruited a little bit in the Midwest, so we see them. They
have recruited Minnesota. Andy and his wife, Pam, are really nice people. I
have seen them on the Nike trip, and he and I both love Diet Mountain Dew.  
He's just one of those characters that our sport has needed for a long time,
but not a lot‑‑ we haven't played them much. I think those are the only two
times we've ever played them was in the Tournament. But someone that we have
known for a long, long time and someone who has done a great job of building a
program. You know, he's going into the Hall of Fame for a reason, that's not
by accident.  
  
Q. How would you describe the difference between a team that's built for the
SEC and maybe a team that's built for the Big12?  
COACH FENNELLY: That's a great question. I think our league with the exception
of a few teams, we don't see as many full court pressure defense. The SEC is
really going to get up into you and guard you a little bit more. They are
rebounders, drivers.  
The scores, if you look at their scores historically, they are a little bit
lower than ours. I think our league is, offensively, we have been a little bit
better top to bottom. But I think that the other thing that I think you see
over time in the SEC this year and the rosters I've seen, they have some great
size. They have a lot of kids 6‑2, 6‑3,6‑4, and our league doesn't have as
much of that.  
We have Brittney Griner which everyone talks about, but from a broad base of
schools in our league, our league has become very guard‑oriented for the most
part. So we don't see that consistency and depth of size that the SEC will
have.  
  
Q. We were talking last night briefly with Coach Landers about his early
impressions of you. He paid you a compliment and said he thinks this is one of
the best teams you've had in a while. Your response to that?  
COACH FENNELLY: I would agree. I think it is one of our better teams. We have
been in seven straight NCAA Tournaments and that's a great thing, and I'm very
proud of that. I think there's only 13 schools that have done that. But we
haven't had a team that I thought realistically could go past one or two
rounds of this tournament.  
We are more balanced. I think it's a team‑‑ it's been one of the most fun
teams I've ever coached. They are easy to manage. They get along great. They
are enjoying everything about this experience. And that makes it‑‑ coaching, I
love my job, but sometimes you love it more than others and teams you love
more than others. You know, just like your kids I guess at times.  
But this team has been really fun, and they have kept everyone loose, and I
think everyone who is engaged with them have enjoyed being around them. And I
think it's not an accident that our team got to come to Spokane and to
Gonzaga, because the people here are just like home, and they appreciate the
kids, they are friendly, the fans. I don't know how many people went out to
dinner last night: I'm not glad you won, but we like your team and everyone
was really gracious until the men's team lost and then it became really a bad
night‑‑ we've been there, believe me.  
But it's been a team that's fun to coach, and I think we are probably a little
more skilled than we have been in the past.  
  
Q. Speaking about the fun nature of this team, can you talk about Anna
Prins' engagement? That just seems like such a fun moment.  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, the Cliff Notes version of it was about two weeks before
Christmas, Ryan, her boyfriend, now fiancée, came to my office and he said,
"Coach, I have a favor to ask you." And he said he wanted to propose and he
wanted to do it on the court, because Anna's family was going to be there, and
the basketball family, the extended family, her coming to Iowa State was a big
part of her life and he wanted to share it with people.  
So we decided to do it during our tournament and he gave me the ring before
the game, and I was like a nervous wreck the whole time because I wanted to
make sure‑‑ luckily, we played someone that we beat really easily and I wasn't
even thinking about the game.  
After the game was over, I just took the microphone and I think our fans
thought we were just going to say happy new year to everyone, because it was
December 30th. And I said, "There's someone here that wants to do something,"
and he walked out. And I turned around and I said to Pop, "She's going to say
yes, isn't she?" That would have been embarrassing.  
But it was great. I've never been a part of that, and I don't think I ever
will. He put a lot of pressure on the other boyfriends to come up with a way
to propose. But it was a special moment for their family and they were all
there and the kids were a part of it. It was very unique, fun.  
THE MODERATOR: You must have had to ask the seven‑foot father first; right?  
COACH FENNELLY: I would hope so. You'd better ask the seven‑foot father. Yes,
he had it all cleared and he was ready to go and the whole family was there.
It was a neat moment, it really was, and it was neat that our fans got to see
it.  
  
Q. You said you've gotten it done with one and a half guards in term of ball
handling, but how have you gotten it done with six kids and such a thin bench?
Tell us about it.  
COACH FENNELLY: That's been hard, we've had to do some things, manage our
minutes. I think Pete Link, our strength coach, who is in his first full year,
deserved a lot of credit for getting them ready.  
We have been very smart, literally, since the second week in January in how
much we practice. Our practices are very, very short, to the point. A lot of
walk‑through, a lot of video, and you know, the kids that are playing
understand they are going to play. We have had to do some things defensively a
little different to stay out of foul trouble, because obviously like last
night, I think there's five minutes to go in the game, and Anna and Pop both
get their fourth foul, so we have had to manage that a little bit.  
But you know, it's a group that can handle the minutes, and it's just one of
those things that, you know, I tell them all the time: You're young, you're
fine, you can do it. They would rather play, anyway, and I think it's just the
nature of our team. I wish we had someone in the seventh or eighth spot, but
right now, and for most of the year, we haven't, and tried to manage it.
There's been games it has hurt us, that's no question and that's a concern for
tomorrow. I think this time of year, Pat Riley, I play nine, (inaudible)
eight, I trust seven, I believe in six, I'm going to throw the ball to five,
I'm going to call plays for four, and we all kind of get to that point; your
benches get a little shorter.  
That was the other thing yesterday, the officials, like Bill, keep them on the
bench. The time‑outs are so damn long. They get plenty of time to rest. But
seriously, the biggest thing is, manage your foul trouble and manage your
practice, and I think we can get to the end.  
  
Q. Back to Anna Prins real quick. You spoke after the Big12 tournament just
how integral a role she played in your team's success. Can you talk about her
surge of late?  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, it's been one of those things, that I think a lot of us
have been waiting for maybe. She's playing like a senior. She had two and a
half games in the Big12 tournament as good as any player we've had here. And
she did it against Caroline Davis, Nicole Griffin and Brittney Griner, not bad
players.  
And just really played with a‑‑ and Anna is one of those kids that is very
cerebral in her approach. And she, I think, like she's mentioned many, many
times to many of the media people at home is, I think she does realize that
her career is about over, and she's just going out and playing. And now as a
coach, you're like, you couldn't figure that out when you were a sophomore,
because a lot of them don't, and that's okay, too.  
Pop has been the opposite at times. She gets so nervous at being a senior,
fearing the end is near, it's inhibited her play at times where it's kind of
freed Anna up. And I think the games in the Big12 tournament, we did get in
foul trouble and Anna didn't, and played extended minutes and kind of had us
on a roll.  
But she's played very, very well in the postseason, and it's good for her to
do that. She's finally stayed healthy. This is the first year she's been
healthy all year, so it's neat to see her go out this way. I think it's good
for her and it's good for our team, certainly.  
  
Q. The Georgia loss in the Elite 8, does that stick with you ever? Do you
think about that again, or do those fade from your memory when you're that
close?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, it never fades, never, never. Think about it all the time.
There are certain things in life, they are always in your head, some things
are good and some things are bad, and you know, there's a lot of those games
that I think that's what makes coaching so great and what drives people crazy
is you can't let it go.  
And I think if you do let it go, you're in the wrong profession. You shouldn't
let it go. It shouldn't haunt you or make you miserable, but I think it should
motivate you and keep you grounded or whatever you want to say.  
There's many times I've thought about that and a few other things. And
especially when you're that close, you know, to something. We have beaten
Connecticut and that's surprised some people and then you're 40 minutes away
from going to the Final Four and then you get beat. No, I don't forget those
things. I wish I could. I'm not very good at that. I'm not very good at a lot
of things and that's one of them.  
  
Q. You mentioned kind of Pop is sometimes uptight. They have been playing
well lately. Is there anything you say heading into this game so they play
free and loose or that you've said to past teams that you think might help?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know, there are some things that have been said and
done that probably can't be repeated in the public and to be honest with you,
Kidd and Maddie have kind of become the things that they do and say and think
and whatever.  
It's like yesterday we walked out of the locker room and one of the nice
people in the hallway said: "If loose is good, you're in good shape." It's a
loose group. It really is. They really are, and I think that's good. There's a
lot of things that I have to do to stay out of the way, and I think a lot of
times, when you get to this point, you want things to go so well for them that
you make it worse for them.  
So I think they have had the ability to do that, and we have met a little bit
less, so we have kind of tried to‑‑ because sometimes, you can just give them
information overload and it's just like, come on. You overcoach it, you overdo
it, and I think we have tried to take the other approach; and, look, here are
two or three things that we have to think about and do, and the rest of it,
let's go compete and somebody make a shot at the right time.  
That's what this tournament is about. And especially in a one‑day turnaround,
you could be meeting all last night‑‑ whatever. I don't think that's going to
work. And I don't think, again, they get to enjoy it as much. They have got a
scouting report under their door before they went to bed last night and the
first time we will talk about Georgia will be in about 20 minutes.  
And it's the coach's job to get them ready, and it's their job to absorb it.
We'll practice, we'll have a short film session, meet tomorrow and let's go
play. Some teams, that's not a good idea, but this team, that's the best way
to manage it, and they have taught me that, I haven't taught them that, they
have taught me that and we have just followed their lead.  
  
Q. So many coaches talk about having seniors and leaders as an extension of
themselves on the court. With two seniors that start and obviously a third on
the team, can you talk about that dynamic?  
COACH FENNELLY: Our seniors have been really good. I think it's very
important, and I talked, at length, ad nauseam about being an Iowa State
senior. I'm a very senior‑oriented person, they are on all of our posters, all
of our media stuff. They understand the Iowa State way. There's a way we do
things at Iowa State; not saying it's right or wrong, but there's a way we do
them, and those kids have to translate that to the group.  
I tell every single senior when I meet with them at the beginning of the year:
Your goal is to leave a piece of you behind. You want to be remembered for who
you are as a player, and as a person. People will‑‑ there are seniors that
people still talk about at Iowa State, there are some former players. We want
them to be those kind of people and then teach the others, and I think they
have done that.  
Obviously Pop and Anna on the court have done a great job. Amanda Zimmerman is
a phenomenal teammate, has not played much, but the people on that bus and in
the locker room know how much they have meant to the team.  
We would not have gotten here without the dynamic on and off the court work of
those three kids.

### [Anne Marie Armstrong](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22149)

### [Jasmine Hassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21800)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
Q. How do you feel carrying over the defense to Monday night's game?  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: We played well. Our main focus is coming out hard on
defense and pressuring them. I think we did a good job of it the second half,
coming out and staying composed and just staying with that pressure, and I
think it eventually got to them about midway through the second half.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I totally agree with Anne Marie. We came out and executed our
game plan as far as playing defensive pressure and using that.  
  
Q. JJ, think you can carry that over to Monday?  
JASMINE JAMES: I just think that the way we played yesterday was great,
defensively and offensively, and it's important for us to be able to carry
that over into our game tomorrow, so I feel like that's definitely a good
start.  
  
Q. JJ, what stands out when you take a look at Iowa State this morning?  
JASMINE JAMES: One thing that I would say stands out is their size and the way
that they go about using it. I mean, they have players who have had pretty
good height but as well can step out and shoot it. They shoot the ball very
well. So more than anything, I just would say probably their size and their
ability to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. You saw the number of turnovers that Gonzaga was able to force on Iowa
State; do you think that you guys will have a similar ability to hassle them
like Gonzaga did?  
JASMINE JAMES: It's definitely a focus of ours, every night we go out on to
the court, to remove (ph) the other team as much as possible and to try to
cause as many turnovers as possible, so that will definitely be a focus of
ours. Not because of what Gonzaga did, but just because that's what we do. So
we are definitely going to go out and pressure the ball and continue to play
great defense like we have been.  
  
Q. I know all three of you will be playing in your ninth NCAA game, if you
can just talk a little about that experience from the last few years.  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: Just the legacy of the Georgia program and what Coach
Landers has done here going into the NCAA Tournament, and then when we get
there, just one game at a time. Every game is important, and we learned that
last year; you just can't take any game for granted, and you just have to show
up as well prepared for the game you're playing as you're going to show up for
the next one.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I totally agree with Anne Marie. Just being grateful to go to
the second round and do what we need to do and not taking it for granted, and
just focusing on what we need to do game‑in and game‑out.  
JASMINE JAMES: I think the experience is definitely a good thing to have but
it doesn't mean much if you don't really use it.  
So I think that one of the things that will be important is that we continue
to play and continue to practice, that we utilize the experience that we have
and we continue to talk up the younger players and we continue to keep our
team motivated and we continue to be ready to go.  
  
Q. Last night ‑‑ (inaudible) had the sprained ankle coming into the season,
how tough was it to deal with that and was it a long recovery process?   
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: Last night the biggest thing was just the frustration
with it, just coming in ready for senior year and just felt like I was really
prepared and just set me back a little bit. I think I'm definitely 100% ready
now. I think the biggest part is just the mental aspect and not being able to
do things the way that I had the year before and just finally getting back in
the groove.  
  
Q. And obviously ‑‑ (inaudible) leg injury, not sure what it was, did you
offer any advice? Seems kind of like a perfect thing a senior with a freshman?
  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I think the biggest thing is just your attitude. You
know, you've just got to stay positive, and she's fought through it and she's
had a really good attitude towards it. She comes to practice and she's still
struggling with her injury, and she still wants to do the sprints the same
shape. And I think that's just the way she's approaching her injury and just
the attitude she has really helped her out.  
  
Q. For the forward, what's going to be the key to keeping Iowa State off of
the line where they are just killing people on the free throw line? Try to be
tough and pressure them and also to stay out of foul trouble?  
JASMINE HASSELL: Some has to do with them but also has to do with our defense.
You have to play good defense to help with the guards pressuring the ball and
making it hard for the injury‑‑ just playing smart and being the aggressive
and not fouling, like you said. Just play hard.  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I would say with the four out, one in set, totally
pressuring‑‑ I just blanked out. No. 55, the 6‑7 girl, does a really good job
of reading for the next pass. So just pressuring her as much as possible and
not let being her use I guess her height as she does half of the court.  
  
Q. Does Iowa State remind you of anyone that you've seen in SEC play or do
you see any similarities between them and teams that you've played before, and
what can you draw from that?  
JASMINE JAMES: Yeah, I think that when we look at Iowa State, you just kind of
see bits and pieces from every team in the SEC almost. It's not like one
certain team.  
So I wouldn't say that it's really anything that we haven't seen before as far
as match‑ups and defensive schemes and things like that. But I definitely
can't just pick one particular team. They definitely have pieces, bits and
pieces from several different teams.  
  
Q. I know they are 14 ‑19 inside the paint and made 52 percent for the game;
any that strikes you, what you saw in the SEC, great shooting teams like that?
  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I would say just the post playing SEC, really physical
and I think that's something that we can relate to. Kelsey Bone (ph) shoots
really well from the floor, Bashaara Graves (ph), people like that are used to
banging in the post and shooting high percentage and I think that's something
that we can relate to as a team.  
  
Q. You and Iowa State played in the '99 regional final and you guys won. Do
you remember much of that game and anything that stands out about that
matchup?  
COACH LANDERS: Actually, I do, and I don't have great recall on a lot of games
but I do remember that game, because I think any time you have a player who
lights someone up like Kelly Miller did that night, it sticks.  
Iowa State, then, played almost entirely match‑up zone, and Kelly Miller, who
was a great player for us, scored over 2000 points‑‑ I forget the total, do
you know? Was it in the 30s? 33, yeah. She was terrific. She moved around the
perimeter and really did a great job of finding the open areas and catching
and shooting.  
And you know, it made it just really difficult for them defensively, and I
remember it, because I was so concerned about it going in. They did such a
good job with that zone. And you know, Kelly pretty much punched our ticket to
the Final Four that night.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that the height stuck out, you had not watched a lot
of video yet. Having seen more stuff, what besides the height sticks out to
you about this Iowa State team?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, things that don't really surprise me, you know, Anne
Marie made mention of something that probably goes unnoticed by casual
observers. The thing that‑‑ let me start over.  
They orchestrate well what they want to do. Billy has always done a terrific,
terrific job of coaching his teams, and this team is certainly no exception.
It's well thought out, it's well schemed and it's well executed, and it's well
called by him at appropriate times to take what he thinks the defense is going
to give up next. They really do a good job of that and their team executes
very, very well. They don't rattle very easily.  
Then I would go to this: You can have great sets and great schemes, but
players understanding how to best capitalize at the end of the day is what
makes them successful.  
Anne Marie alluded to something a moment ago that is so important that
probably would go unnoticed by a lot of people. Most players, when they have
the ball, are looking at something and seeing yes or no with the next pass.
Iowa State is looking at that going, yes. It might not be yes, I can make this
pass to Chelsea in the post, but it's, yes, if I pass the ball over here,
Chelsea is going to be wide open.  
They do a great job of reading the defense in the post and then moving the
ball right or left to the correct person who has the assist that's going in.
They are really, really good at doing that. They play within themselves. They
don't take bad shots. The shooters shoot. The schemes, they do what they need
to do with their schemes, screen, cut, to get their shooters those shots. But
they always have the interior option with the post up regardless of whether
you defended that cut that might lead to a three or not; well, they have a
second option they are going to. The point play is very, very good.  
It's very, very difficult. I've coached a long time, and told our team last
night when we were watching some film, it's hard to wrap your head around 220
assists. You look at a stat sheet and you look at an assist column, and it's
three digits. And it's not one hundred, it's 200. So she understands her role
and performs is very well.  
So there has to be‑‑ that has to be addressed as best we can. But it's a
complete basketball team with parts within it that can be moved around to
different positions. So they create a lot of problems or a lot of challenges
for you defensively.  
  
Q. Going back to Merritt Hempe, you said barring her injury this season, she
might have been a starter at this point. Can you talk about just having to
deal with the injury, how she's progressed and do you envision playing her
tomorrow?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, here's the downside of the injury. I've said forever,
fall is important to a basketball team. Preseason practices is where, what, 70
percent of what you're going to be, develops. It's where you become what
you're going to be during the season. And when a freshman misses it‑‑ it pains
me greatly when a freshman misses a day of practice, because I tell them, you
miss a day, it's like you're missing a week. It's tough.  
Juniors, seniors, I tell them, if you don't know what we're doing by now, you
weren't going to play, anyway. (Laughter). But for a freshman, there's just so
much on their plate; and to think that she missed weeks.  
You know, she's playing on her own abilities. She's playing with what she
brought from high school. She isn't playing with what we were able to give her
and develop in her. So that's a setback. There needs to be a continued
development of physicality, of aggressiveness, of a mental toughness.  
You know, she's trained and to some extent, she's okay with it, but it's not
where we want it to be. It's not where Cobi is, it's not where Tiaria is. And
it's simply because‑‑ it's not her fault and it's not my fault; if you're not
there, we can't do anything with it.  
To the point, tomorrow, she always has something to give. You know, I think
her size tomorrow, obviously could be important to us. Her rebounding ability
to be important to us. And the great thing about her, one of the great things
about her, and the fact that she wants to contribute something, will be a
great benefit tomorrow.  
You know, she's one of those kids that give us depth, and going into
tomorrow's game, that could be an asset because typically Iowa State does not
play a lot of people. And we tend to play nine or ten.  
  
Q. Bill was asked earlier about the differences between the Big12 and the
SEC, just the leagues and how they prepare you for the postseason. What are
the biggest differences that you see that might kind of be a pendulum swing in
the game in that sense?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, I don't know that either team has a real
advantage simply because both of those conferences are very, very competitive,
and both of those conferences‑‑ and this is‑‑ until you've walked in their
shoes and had to deal with this game in and game out, you can't appreciate the
next statement; I'm really sincere when I say this, being honest.  
Those teams in those two conferences are so well coached, you're challenged
every time you prepare your team. I suspect Billy is out there tweaking
something right now, changing something, putting a wrinkle into something.
We're going to go out there in a few minutes and do the same thing, because
I'm confident that Iowa State will be ready for what we like to do. And I'm
confident that we will be ready for what they like to do.  
Those are the leagues that we play in that challenge you in that regard. You
have to do that. If you don't, then you're going to run into teams that are
just better prepared than you are and your team is going to be at a
disadvantage. And I'm sure I speak for Billy and me on this, neither one of us
want our teams to be at a disadvantage.  
But from a competitive standpoint, Big12 is very, very good, Southeastern
Conference is very, very good, very good with athletes, very, very good with
outstanding individual players and both leagues are very well coached.  
  
Q. Following up more specifically what he was asking, Bill was trying to say
that their conference was more offensive ‑oriented and he thought the SEC was
tougher defense and tougher in general. Do you feel that way?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, I really can't speak like Billy can to his conference,
but I can speak to our conference. Our conference is very defensive‑oriented.
We play some ugly games in our league. We play some games that's hard as a
coach to get through, because of it.  
The scouting is over the top, the preparation and then the defense that people
go out and put into play with the knowledge that they have of their opponents,
it makes us very much a defensive league. And as far as the toughness piece,
you just have to be tough. You don't have a choice. If you're not tough, then
our league will grind you down.  
  
Q. Browsing the schedules, you both play in real tough conferences, and this
year, at least, non ‑conference, like Iowa State, you didn't schedule real
tough. What's your scheduling philosophy on how to approach that when you're
in a tough league like that?   
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, it's not the league necessarily that drives it.
We know what we are going to get with the league and we know we have no
control over the scheduling.  
Our schedule this year, we thought we had built really the perfect schedule
for the team that we were going to have. We have been short‑handed the last
three or four years. We have been very thin.  
We've played‑‑ you know, JJ played more minutes than anybody in the conference
in the last three years. We played over time games where she played 45
minutes. We've had a number of‑‑ in games, a year, two years ago, we've had
players in our starting lineup, three players that played 40 minutes, one
player played 38 minutes. We've been thin.  
And with this freshman class coming in, we felt it was important to build a
schedule where we could get them on the court in games and get them game
experience and get them to a point where when we got to the conference, they
could help us solve that depth problem.  
And I think we've been successful with that. I would say this: We thought
where we were disappointed with our schedule, we thought a couple of those
teams would be better. Georgia Tech has been a Top 15 team; this year, they
were not. Rutgers is a Top 15 team; this year, they were not. TCU
traditionally is a very, very good basketball team, and this year, they
struggled a little bit.  
So we had some games on there that still yet challenged us, really. But over
the course of the season, their seasons probably did not go like they
traditionally have gone in years past.  
  
Q. You have a matchup Spokane will really enjoy.  
COACH LANDERS: I think it will be a great basketball game, I really do. I
think to see if‑‑ there's a part of me, and coming from our league, all of the
things that we just talked about and defense being the focus and all that kind
of stuff, it's not going to surprise me if it's that kind of game, but it
really isn't going to surprise me if it's not, it's going to be interesting.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

IOWA STATE  72  
GONZAGA - 60

  
COACH GRAVES: First of all want to congratulate Iowa State and Coach Fennelly.
They are a terrific team. Every time there was a play that teed to be made,
they made it and that's what great teams do. I respect Coach Fennelly
immensely and he's a great role model, and I like that team. I really like how
they play and I wish them well.  
As far as Gonzaga, I told the kids in the locker room, first and foremost, I
mean everybody but one team feels the same after that last game.  
And we have a lot to be proud of. I think at the start of the year if you
would have told me we had be 27‑6 at the end of the season, I would have said
you're crazy.  
But I'm really proud of our team. I thought we made huge strides this year and
it was evident by getting to the NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately we came up
short tonight but I was proud of the effort and told our two seniors that I'm
really going to miss them. I thought they were great leaders and great
teammates this year.  
You know, we played hard and in the end, we just didn't make enough plays. I
thought we had opportunities, but 33 games, we've given up 70 or more points
one time, and it was tonight. Our defense was tested and unfortunately we
didn't pass the test.  
  
Q. Haiden, I think you hit your first 3 ‑pointer of the game and it seemed
like you guys really struggled from the perimeter tonight. How much of it was
their pressure defensively and how much was it you guys just missing open
looks?   
HAIDEN PALMER: I think a little bit of both. Just not missing shots that we
usually knock down. They had a little bit of pressure but even some of the
open looks just happened. So we tried to get it inside more and do some of
those things, but normally those are going in.  
  
Q. They had you for ten steals, so were you guys thinking that was going to
be the way you could beat this team is with the defensive intensity and
getting the crowd behind you?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, definitely. They have a great offense. They execute so
well, post players, shooters. So we just wanted to pressure them, do our best
to take them out of their offense but credit to them, they still made a lot of
good plays, even under pressure. So we still did our game plan but not good
enough.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you thought the three pointer was going to be a big part
of their arsenal, too.  
TAELOR KARR: Yeah, that's what they are known for. They have those three
inside kids, but they are always known to be a three‑point shooting team. 22
went off on us, Brynn; I know her from high school days. We lost track of her
a few times in the zone and she made us pay, along with other ones, too.  
We just had a few too many mental breakdowns in man and zone, and they were
scrambling and went late in shot clock. But then they hit timely shots at the
he have end. I think we played well, he with played hard, tough. We played
pretty physical considering with how big they are, but they just hit big
shots, so give them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Taelor, you played your last game in a 'Zag uniform, what are you feeling
right now?  
TAELOR KARR: Sad. It's tough to go out like this. But like Coach said, a lot
of teams except one. You have to give Iowa State credit, they are a good team
to go out on and I couldn't be more proud of my teammates. Played hard. So I
couldn't ask for better teammates, for sure.  
  
Q. You guys forked 23 turnovers, that's a pretty significant amount. What
wasn't working defensively for you guys?  
COACH GRAVES: I just think we made a few break downs late in the shot clock.
You know, we felt we had to do something like that. You see how we're built
inside where there was no way we are going to be able to go toe it toe with
them so we had to be able to make it some kind of a full‑court game and some
kind of a scrambling kind of game. It was almost feast or famine. We have to
steal or we gave up a pretty good look to them.  
Give them credit, they did not miss, every time they had an opportunity, they
made the most of it. And if you look at the stats, you know, really the
rebound was a factor but when you shoot 32 percent, you're going to give up a
lot of defensive rebounds but it really came down to the field goal
percentage. That was the disparity.  
And ten steals, that's got to be among the best ever, right, in a tournament
game. Where are the stats people out there.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, 32 percent from the field, was it the looks for you ‑‑
not getting great looks, or was it just one of those nights where the ball
wasn't falling?   
COACH GRAVES: Again I think like Haiden or one of the two said, it's a little
combination of both: They are long, and that size is noticeable, it's there.  
But the honest truth is I liked our looks tonight. I thought we had some
pretty good looks and we had some good second shot looks in the paint, one of
those things, the pressure of the moment, perhaps, defense, but when you're
playing teams like Iowa State or anybody in the NCAA Tournament, those things
can't happen. You have to step up and make shots and make plays and that's
what good teams do, and that's what Iowa State did tonight.  
  
Q. I know Shelby had early foul trouble, but then she sat for most of the
game, so what was going on there? And then, also, give me your perspective on
the efforts you got from your bench, people who really stepped up.  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, 25‑0 bench points, that's considerable. Had several
freshmen in the game tonight.  
You know, as far as Shelby goes, sometimes some teams are better match‑ups for
others and quite frankly, Keani and Shaniqua did a good job, and Stephanie
Golden, as well, they were playing better. So as a coach, you have to make
that decision, who you're going to go with.  
I thought honestly, I thought defensively, we had some letdowns in our post
area. You know, Williamson was open too many times in that corner, and we
weren't getting that coverage. So maybe you guys don't see what we're seeing
as a coach and we know what responsibilities we're trying to cover.  
But the future's bright. I mean, you look at this is a young basketball team,
including our transfer that's been sitting out this year. We have 11 freshmen
and sophomores. That's a good group that's coming back. So I like where we're
at.  
  
Q. You're real aggressive on the perimeter. How much of those good looks
they did get was because of that, and how much was because of stuff you didn't
do? Were you kind of leaning that way, knowing you might give those up?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, we are the type of team that puts a lot of pressure on the
basketball. We try to make things happen.  
Often times, we do give up some good looks because of that. You know, it's one
of those trade‑offs but we felt going in and game preparation, we were not
going to be able to sit back in a softer zone or man‑to‑man and give those
inside kids good looks.  
I thought early in the second half, that's where they got that lead. They did
a nice job of getting us‑‑ pinning us deep and made easy baskets, and so we
had to then kind of extend the defense a little bit and try to make some
things happen in that regard.  
And for the most part, hey, Iowa State doesn't get turned over 23 times very
often. And we made a lot of those count. We just didn't make enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Ten steals is four away from the NCAA record.  
COACH GRAVES: Four away, my goodness. Well, I'll tell Haiden it was closer.  
THE MODERATOR: And one away from the school record.  
  
Q. Speaking of, like you said, 11 sophomores and freshmen ‑‑ Meghan Winters,
could you have asked for a better senior leader, and Taelor Karr and
everything she's meant to the team the last two years?  
COACH GRAVES: I'm proud of all our seniors, Meghan Winters is an amazing
teammate. You have to have one of those players, we call her kind of a mother
hen. She gets everybody organized. She makes sure everybody is where they are
supposed to be and always does it with a smile and is a great leader. She won
115 games here in her four years and went to Sweet16 and Elite 8; twice
Sweet16 and once Elite 8, that's an amazing accomplishment for her.  
As far as Taelor goes, what a godsend, when she decided to transfer and come
here, she has‑‑ you know, she's become one of the favorites. People love her
here. Teammates love her and play for her. I'm really going to miss her.  
I'm telling you, she put her stamp on this program in two short years, and
that's difficult to do especially with the great players we've had through
here. She's so poised, has so much class and plays so hard. I'm really going
to miss her but, boy, she taught those young kids what it's like to be a
winner and what it's like to play hard and what it's like to play with class.  
I really appreciate Taelor and we are going to miss both Taelor and Meghan,
great question.  
  
Q. It's going to be the first time in five years you're not preparing for a
second round game. Any thought what tonight and tomorrow night is going to
feel like?  
COACH GRAVES: I might sleep. You know, those that know me, I don't sleep
during the season. If I get four hours in a night, that's a great night. Maybe
I'll get seven tomorrow.  
It's disappointing. You know, it really is. I don't have many hobbies other
than going to watch my kids do things. And I unfortunately won't watch much of
our tournament. It's tough after. But I'm really pulling for Iowa State.
That's a class outfit. Bill Fennelly is as good as there is, and those
players, they play the game the way the game is supposed to be played, so I
will be secretly rooting for them.

### [Chelsea Poppens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24893)

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

IOWA STATE - 72  
GONZAGA - 60

  
COACH FENNELLY: That was a great environment for a women's college tournament.
The staff here, Joel Morgan and all the people here have done an amazing job
of creating a special atmosphere for the student athletes. The fans are great;
they know when to cheer.  
It was a great game. We beat a very good team in a tough environment and just
excited that we get to keep playing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about going against that defense, and why did you find
success throughout the night?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: I think with the zone pressure, Gonzaga did a very good job
of forcing the ball out of Nikki's hands, and whenever they did have it, they
would trap so she didn't have it, so they forced the team ball‑handling
aspect.  
We did a really goodjob of having players attack the zone; that way I was
getting open looks and other girls were getting open looks on the perimeter
and we were able to hit those shots. Everyone did a really good job of not
only making plays but making plays for their teammates.  
  
Q. Chelsea, there was that little burst to start the second half that got
you up by nine; what had you talked about to get going there in the second
half?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Just coming out strong. I mean, not backing down. We knew
that they were not going to back down. So we just had to come out, do our
thing, especially as seniors we needed to lead our team. Everybody just played
well together.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys were pretty excited in the game, but why does this one
kind of mean a lot to you guys after last year, too, kinda?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: Well, one, at this point in the season, any one is big,
because the next time you lose, you're done.  
And Coach really emphasizes not only is it the end of a season but for three
girls, it's end of their basketball career here wearing Iowa State jersey. So
kind to have play for them and know it's a huge win that we are having on the
road in a great environment and against a really good team.  
But at the end of the day, we celebrate this tonight, but tomorrow it's back
to work and looking forward to the next game.  
  
Q. Did you ever feel there was one certain turning point for you guys? It
was a weird game because you gradually pulled away in the second half, but is
there anything that stuck out in your mind as being the big difference?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Not exactly. We all just kept working hard, kept going at it.
I mean, there was awhile there where we were not playing very good defense and
we just stepped it up and just started grinding away.  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: Really, I think it was just turnovers that kind of were
taking us out of the game and letting us lose our lead. Honestly, the part I
thought, we really all came together was the one turnover in the corner that
was Hallie and Nikki‑‑ whenever she stepped over the base line, and we kind of
knew at that point that what's when the crowd was into it. And the easiest way
to stop a run like that is just do something good, do something positive.  
So to push the ball down and get shots, just to make up the bad stuff with
good stuff, you kind of have to even it out. So I think that was a real
turning point, and we all came together and knew that we needed to pick it up.  
  
Q. Brynn, did you get any sense that they were putting so much focus on the
inside players that it was opening stuff up; that you were able to slip out
and surprise them a little bit?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: Well, I think at the beginning of the half like when Pop
would take a few drives to the basket and we get to the ball on the inside and
she would get fueled, they knew we were looking to go to our inside game.  
But I think those two did a really good job of forcing the outside defenders
to help on them, that way it give us open shots. So really it because not
necessarily us finding our own shots but it was making our defense help them
that they got us the open shots that we got.  
  
Q. What's it say about the team that this was a difficult matchup in some
ways for you because of their pressure and that you did overcome it; what does
that say in your mind?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, it's kind of been the M.O. of this team for a long
time. They really do like each other. They work hard at it. The numbers, you
know, turn the ball over 23 times on the road, usually don't win those games,
but we defended well as we have been. We shot free throws well as we have
been. We made some shots at right times and it was a very difficult
environment.  
But I think playing in the Big12, our kids were a little more prepared for it
maybe than some other people. We beat a really good team in a tough place, but
the balance was good, every kid contributed, and I think it was an effort that
our team has kind of been given the last six weeks of the season.  
And as Brynn said, you know, we have three seniors that really enjoy the
moment and you want to keep playing, and we're very, very fortunate and
appreciative that we get that opportunity that we get to come back to practice
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Was there anything about Gonzaga that maybe you had not picked up and
caught you a little bit by surprise?  
COACH FENNELLY: Their halfcourt pressure defense, not by surprise, but they
really stuck with it. We kind of kept thinking they would change defenses
more.  
It was hard for us. We had a hard time getting by that first wave. When we
did, we got some shots, but I don't know if I've ever coached in a game where
a kid gotten steals. But you know, we take 27 less shots than them, but we
shot it well enough. We made our free throws. We continued to guard with a
purpose, and never panicked.  
Our team at times gets a little crazy and like most times, but I never really
thought that they showed that today. Maybe that one‑‑ we were up 31‑24 and
they scored a couple transition baskets. We had that glazed look in our eye,
but other than that, they handled it great and it was‑‑ they communicated that
to each other, and they have learned how to do that.  
  
Q. Like you said, picking your spots, in that second half, obviously
turnovers were a story, but you had that stretch I think from the second or
third media time ‑outs where you didn't have a turnover and stretched the lead
from three to nine; what does that say about the character of the team, just
grinding it out?  
COACH FENNELLY: That's kind of our team. For the people who have not seen us,
we are not the most aesthetic thing to watch sometimes, and we drive our fans
crazy, because we do turn the ball over.  
But our kids understand what they need to do, and we've always told them,
embrace who you are, don't apologize for what you're not, don't try to do
something you're not supposed to do, move on to the next play. And they have
done that.  
And we have overcome this a lot this year. For a team that's pretty good, we
turn the ball over way too much. But we have found other ways. That's kind of
how life is, you know, if you're not good at something, figure out a different
way. And for our team, the way we figured it out is guard decent, make free
throws, make some threes, and have three seniors that give us the leadership
and understanding of what it means to be a good team.  
So at this time of year, you want to see that happen, and certainly we made
enough shots today against a really good team to win the game.  
  
Q. Did you say anything to Nikki? She had I think that was probably one of
the more stressful games of the season. Just what can you say about her and
did you say anything to her?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, I really didn't. I think she was under duress the whole
game, and she's been that way a lot.  
But the only thing I told her was, this is where point guards‑‑ you know,
everyone talks about great point guard play in the NCAA Tournament. I told
her, part of what happens tonight will be a definition of who and what you're
going to be, not just today, but down the road.  
And she struggled near the end of the half. She was frustrated, and I didn't
have a chance to say anything to her because her teammates did. I think when
she hit that three, you know, she knows and our team knows, everyone knows,
the whole world knows, we have one person that can dribble on our team. And
Kidd can dribble a little. So we have one and a half.  
So I mean, everyone knows it. It's no surprise, and that's why, you know,
Kelly is such a good coach and you try to trap her and get the ball out of
Nikki's hand. But we got it out enough and made enough shots and got the ball
in the post. She had 11 assists and that's part of what her job is, and she
guarded really well today.  
  
Q. How do you balance shooting quickly against a team like that so you don't
have to be under duress? And then when you shoot quickly, it makes the game
faster against the team; did you tell them anything about that?  
COACH FENNELLY: I told them, shoot it before you throw it away. I just said,
shoot it. You have to look at it, let it go. Because every pass was an
adventure there for a few minutes, and when the ball is out of Nikki's hands
and people are making decisions, if you had an open look at it, we were
shooting it.  
We were going to play the game, and even when we were up eight or nine, I'm
like, let's go, let's go, play faster. We were tired but I just felt like our
best opportunity was to score before they had all five. If Nikki is looking at
five defenders in front of her organized, that was not good.  
So we just said, let's go, and I don't care if it's eight seconds into the
clock, 28 seconds into the clock, you have a shot that you shoot every day in
practice, shoot it. Luckily, we made just enough.  
  
Q. Palmer tonight, was there something you guys adjusted to on defense or
what did you see from your team the rest of the night?  
COACH FENNELLY: I thought we defended her pretty well. We were going to give
her the three, try to make her stay, shoot tough twos. Part of our defensive
philosophy is tough twos and don't foul. She's the kind of kid if you got her,
she's hard to guard, and used her length a little bit. But just said, stick
with the plan make her shoot the three. Not that she can't shoot a lot, but
she's 24‑for‑94 in the season and 1‑for‑8 tonight. We wanted to make her do
things she doesn't normally do, and she's taken a lot more shots that aren't
threes. We had to live with that a little bit, but that's the way we play. We
are kind of numbers geeks when it comes to that, and that's the way we played
it and I thought we defended her pretty well.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA  70  
MONTANA - 50

  
COACH LANDERS: You know, I think for the most part it was very much what we
thought it would be, a very physical and aggressive basketball game. I think
physical, because Montana enjoys that style, I think aggressive, because we
enjoy that style, and it was a very hard‑fought game by both teams.  
I was really pleased with the way our basketball team defended from the
beginning of the game to the end of the game, and I felt like that the desired
effect of that defense probably set in at somewhere around the 13‑minute mark
there in the second half.  
I felt like that we started to benefit from having played it the way that we
had played it at about that point with maybe Montana missing a few more shots;
us doing a better job of rebounding the ball, and then getting out in
transition and creating some plays.  
But overall, just a very hard‑fought game. You know, nothing but respect for
Montana, because they fought the fight. I thought as the game wore on, our
quickness on the defensive end started to separate us from them.  
  
Q. What does it mean to be able to advance to Monday's game after today's
win?  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: It's an honor because not a lot of teams get to make it to
the second round. It's just a good feeling.  
JASMINE HASSELL: It's a good feeling. We're pleased. But now it's time to
focus on the next game, and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. The game was at 38 ‑36 with you guys ahead, when suddenly it seemed like
you guys put the pedal to the metal and took off; can you talk about the 20 or
so run put on there?   
JASMINE HASSELL: I think the key to that was defensively. We started turning
them over, so there for we started making plays on the offensive ends. We all
started just buckling down and played good D.  
  
Q. How much talk was there maybe in the last 24 hours about what happened in
the first round last year and did any of those thoughts at all creep in when
they got within two and you guys made your run to pull away?  
JASMINE HASSELL: To be honest, last year wasn't brought up. And personally,
when it came to that tie, whatever, I didn't even think about it. I just knew
that our opportunity is now, and it's time to go and just there's no reason to
think about last year. Last year is in the past. It's time to move on. We are
in a new tournament, new team, so that's what we did.  
  
Q. Tell me about your first experience in the NCAA Tournament, this is your
first game. What did you think?  
SHACOBIA BARBEE: It was everything I expected, especially playing against
Montana, all the coaches already said that they were going to be physical, and
they brought all that physicality to the game. It was just a good feeling.  
  
Q. How did she do, Jasmine?  
JASMINE HASSELL: She did great (smiling).  
  
Q. What was the defensive goal? It seemed like you guys really tried to
extend your pressure and get in the passing lanes a lot, make it difficult for
them just to get even set into their offense.  
COACH LANDERS: Yeah, the extension wasn't by design. Our pressuring the ball
led us further and further away from the basket, which was a good thing,
because you know, if you go back and watch the first couple of possessions, we
are playing hard pressure on the ball at the three‑point line. And as the game
wore on, the ball started to slow down and kind of wait and hesitate and so we
had to go out and extend it.  
But simply put, the idea tonight was: Let's get as much pressure as we can on
the point. Not just on the bounce, but let's pressure her to the point of
release of the pass; so that we give ourselves a chance to get up in the
passing lanes and possibly deflect. And then, let's do that, all right.  
So we have A, pressure, pressure the point; B, let's get up in the passing
lanes and try to deflect, and as we are doing that, let's be aware of backdoor
opportunities and let's guard the backdoor. I thought we were really good the
first five minutes of the game right there. They threw the ball two or three
times on backdoor cuts, and then they kind of settled in, didn't want to throw
anymore, which is a great thing and allowed us to deny a little harder.  
And then let's stay focused. We did most everything we wanted to do. Let's
stay focused on 10, let's stay focused on 22, the perimeter airy offensive
players, and then let's not give up the three.  
Well, the three ball is where we became undisciplined. We accomplished every
objective we had defensively other than cleaning up after ourselves,
rebounding the ball. They got far too many offensive rebounds but they are
very good at it.  
And allowing as many threes as we did‑‑ you know, they were very good. You
have to give Montana credit for some of it. They were very good at taking
advantage of us being undisciplined. At times, we left our man, chase someone
else, and almost every time, they came back and found the open man and knocked
down a three.  
So that was the only piece of the objective we didn't meet.  
  
Q. Looking ahead at Iowa State, what concerns you?  
COACH LANDERS: Everything. At first glance, you have to be concerned about
them in every way. You know, they have unbelievably good height. They have an
exceptional point guard. They drop the threes with incredible efficiency, and
they do that throughout the lineup. Are you kidding me, six, seven, dropping
threes, wow.  
They are very well coached and they execute their stuff in the half court, and
when they want the three they know how to go about getting it. If they want to
put one of their giant kids up, they know how to do that, they are very good,
as most of Billy's teams have been, if not all of them have been good.  
You know, I know Iowa State, and I really think this is Billy's best team in a
long time. They are really good.  
  
Q. Since we are on the topic of Iowa State, they look like they played you
six kids, you go 11. Is depth going to have to be a difference for you
tomorrow, too, Monday?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, we are who we are and they are who they are.
Now you're introducing me to something that I'm not‑‑ I can't agree or
disagree with you because I don't know. I mean, okay, so they played that many
kids. Is that what they normally do? Because I don't know. I'm asking you.  
You know, because if that's what they do, and they do what they do, we do what
we do; you know, and we'll know more after we've played the game whether it's
an advantage or disadvantage.  
You know, really, today, I thought our depth was an advantage for us, because
our people came off the bench, played very well and made defensive plays. They
were locked in when they went on the court. They knew what we were doing. Just
couldn't see any drop‑off. They were very, very good. If they do that again,
Monday, then they could be an asset to us.  
But I don't know what ‑‑ how many people they normally play; if they play six
or seven, maybe we can wear on them a little bit. Maybe not, maybe not; maybe
they will slow it down.  
  
Q. I had asked you yesterday about your freshmen input this season and you
had spoken about Griffin and Barbee ‑‑  
COACH LANDERS: Do you like them?  
  
Q. I mean, four assists and no ‑‑ I don't have the final count, but no
turnovers for Griffin and I saw that play from Barbee at the halfcourt, you
must have loved that.   
COACH LANDERS: You like them, don't you.  
  
Q. Kind of my angle I'm going for.  
COACH LANDERS: We like them. (Laughs). You can see what I was talking about.
You know, I mean, they have a good sense, a good feel for the game. They are
tough kids defensively. They both have some growing to do offensively.  
You know, we'll get there with the offensive‑‑ they are very good offensive,
they have skills, they can shoot the three ball, they can put it on the deck.  
Knowing when you can make a play, and when it's not play day, is a big piece
of that transition from high school to college. I mean, most of these kids in
high school can make a play any time they want. Now they try and make it and
they end up, you know, in between three opponents trying to figure out how
they got their, what their name, and where they are at. That's a piece that we
have to continue to work on.  
But yeah, we love those kids. Marion is going to be a good one, Marjorie
Butler played well today. They have made us better.  
  
Q. One more on Iowa State, if you don't mind. Do you view stylistically how
you play and Iowa State plays similar in any ways, or do you think you are two
totally different teams?  
COACH LANDERS: I haven't watched them enough to really be definitive. I think
that what little bit I've seen, they are a team‑‑ they are team that I don't
know if I've seen enough to even say this, but they are a team that executes
very, very well. They flow into what they want to do. They are smooth
offensively.  
You know, and honestly, I had not watched them enough defensively to tell you
whether they are tough or sneaky or what, so I don't guess I can answer your
question. Yeah, all I know is they are big; they are really, really big; big;
big.  
Tomorrow I'll watch some tape and give you some better answers.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:

## March 23, 2013

  

### [Katie Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25207)

### [Robin Selvig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25206)

### [Alyssa Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25253)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

GEORGIA  70  
MONTANA - 50

  
COACH SELVIG: Well, hats off to Georgia. You know, they are just a really,
really good basketball team and they are really good on the defensive end. You
know, I thought we executed pretty well. I thought we got enough shots to stay
in that game but I think it was 38‑36, and all of a sudden they scored quick.
I mean, they made plays when we had a little momentum going and you have to
give them credit. They have a lot of weapons and they play hard. Proud of my
ladies effort but hats off to Georgia.  
  
Q. Twice there in the second half, you pulled within two, the last being 38
‑36, Katie, what happened that it got away from you guys?   
KATIE BAKER: Like Coach said, they just made some plays and big plays and
basketball is a game of runs. You know, you're not in it all the time. They
got a wig momentum swing their way, a couple footballs, a couple big shots,
hit a couple big threes and just like that they are ahead again. But that's
basketball for you.  
  
Q. Katie, could you talk about how unique of a challenge it is trying to
cover Hassell; they are quick and they are thick. Just talk about that a
little.  
KATIE BAKER: Yeah, I mean, it's a different game down there, you know, in the
post play. It's very physical. I liked it, actually, getting able to battle
with such great, outstanding SEC posts down there. But it's different. They
are big. It's a team effort, though, and I think we did well for the most part
of helping in. We got a couple jump balls, but that's the game for them.  
  
Q. Alyssa, can you just talk overall about the game today, I saw the team
doing a lot of smiling there until the very end, imagine you wore proud of
your effort?  
ALYSSA SMITH: That he, that's one thing about our team this year, we are
always going to work hard. And you know, like Coach talks about, before we go
out on the court, have fun when you play hard, and that's true for me, and I
can speak on behalf of our entire team and we definitely worked hard tonight.
That's why it's difficult to lose, when you work your butt off.  
So, they are a good team. They played hard, too, and it wasn't a lack of
effort; it wasn't a lack of trying. It's just, you know, we didn't score as
many points as they did.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, I know it's fresh, but can you guys sum up your
careers as Lady Grizzlies.  
ALYSSA SMITH: You want us to start crying again?  
KATIE BAKER: You know, wow, I mean, what a blessing to play for the University
of Montana; and to meet the girls that I have and the runs that we've done.  
You know, thinking back to this last year, even capping it off with winning
the conference and winning the tournament, you know, it was a picture perfect
senior year for us, I can say. But it really just has been the best
opportunity, the best career, best decision that I personally have ever made.  
ALYSSA SMITH: I mean, ditto. I think that anyone who gets to play for the Lady
Grizzlies program is extremely lucky, and it's been a ride. It's been a roller
coast.  
But I mean, I definitely learned a lot and not just about basketball but about
life, too, and I can speak for myself, I've come a long way since freshman
year, and the ending of the season is like a new chapter of my life. I think
basketball ends, a new chapter starts, no more scholarship checks, I don't get
to see my teammates every single day.  
Playing for Rob has been one of the coolest things, one of the coolest
experiences I've ever been a part of. There's a reason why he was Coach of the
Year, there's a reason why we won the Big Sky Championship and there's a
reason why we're here today.  
Yeah, I mean, it would take forever to sum it up I think completely, but I
wouldn't have had my last four years any other way.  
  
Q. After you get out early and spend a lot of energy trying to come back and
trying to tie the game, talk about how tough it is when you can't do that.  
KATIE BAKER: Yeah, it's frustrating when you dig yourself a hole. And like I
said basketball is a game of runs. They get up, they make a few big shots,
they take the lead as it seems and it seems like you're down. But I mean, then
we hit shots and we come back or we get a stop on defense.  
You know, that's why I love the game of basketball. Hopefully if you're
playing hard and your fight is there, we had multiple chances. We had some
good shots and good looks tonight, and you know, they just weren't falling for
us.  
And it is frustrating but like Alyssa said, it wasn't for a lack of effort and
it wasn't for a lack of fight. I can speak for everyone that we left it all
out on the court.  
ALYSSA SMITH: I think one thing is, you know, we got a lot of stops on
defense. We out‑rebounded them, I'm pretty sure we out‑rebounded them. I could
be wrong but anyways, I mean, we didn't convert as well as they did. We didn't
score off the steals. We didn't score off their turnovers and that was a huge
thing for us.  
We got a lot of great looks and they just didn't fall for us. That's
frustrating, because who knows, on any other night, sometimes those shots do
fall for us. But they applied a lot of pressure, which is something that, you
know, I mean, they are an athletic team and they are quick, and we have played
against teams like that earlier on in the season.  
But it is tough to play against and it kind of gets you out of sorts
sometimes. It's hard to come back against a team like that, especially when we
do dig ourselves a hole, we have to be able to convert, which we weren't able
to do tonight.  
  
Q. I don't know what your game plan was, but I imagine you did everything
you wanted to do except make shots maybe.  
COACH SELVIG: Yeah, and you have to give some of that to Georgia. They are
pretty good defensively. I thought we did a pretty good job of getting shots,
but we had 11 turnovers at the half and that was their pressure that did that.
We haven't seen as good of pressure as they have put on us this year and the
kind of pressure; so we end up with 20 turnovers, which against them isn't
horrible.  
We had enough good shots, so that game could have gone‑‑ we could have stayed
with them. What they did is when those spurts, like when we were at two, that
score, they transitioned a couple of those to steal a basket and nail a three,
and they did it so quickly, and we never scored that quickly. It was just
tough.  
  
Q. What was the attitude of the team at halftime?  
COACH SELVIG: Yeah, I mean, we are pretty fired up. We had a slow start in
that game, and we finally started coming back and making shots and finally
started getting some stops. There were stretches in this game where they had a
hard time scoring. They still end up getting 70, because boom, boom, they
scored so fast.  
But I think, what was it at half, 32‑25, that's very manageable, and that was
after a slow start for us. I felt we would get better against their pressure
just because we threw it around the gym a little bit early, because I think we
were a little excited.  
So they were fired up. We came out, the start of the second half is always
important and I thought we didn't take control of the game but we certainly
were assertive and got it right down to where it was hopefully going to go
down to the wire type game.  
But again, Georgia did a heck of a job, they hit big shots when they needed
it, and they hit two threes when they needed it and they started getting into
Hassell late there. They played better than us. They had more weapons to score
tonight.  
  
Q. Maybe not what you wanted there at the end, but having all those young
girls, what does this mean for those girls moving forward?  
COACH SELVIG: I think it's valuable. Being in the NCAAs, which we've had the
good fortune to be some and I think we were two years ago, I think it
motivates the kids. It's a great atmosphere here.  
Gonzaga, because they have a great following, it's a great atmosphere, we are
playing the SEC, one of the premiere programs in the nation, we played them
toe‑to‑toe most of the game and those are the kind of things that should fire
you up.  
We always play ten‑deep, we didn't have Shanae; wish we would have had her
tonight. But a couple kids who have not played as much got in tonight and they
played well in practice. I think the experience is valuable, not only to be a
better basketball but just for your college experience. I'm very happy that
our kids get to do this.  
  
Q. Looking at this group of seniors that you're going to be losing what have
they meant to you for your time here?  
COACH SELVIG: They are serious basketball players. They want to win, they want
to compete, they want to get better, and they are great people. I mean, it's
all you can ask for as a coach.  
And as they said, and it is really true, there wasn't‑‑ actually all four of
them, there wasn't a drill in practice or a minute in a game where they
weren't competing like crazy, and that's what I ask of them; they don't play
perfect, but it was never for lack of effort and they are just why you coach.
They are great people and fun to be around and they have enriched my life.  
  
Q. Specifically, talking about Katie and Alyssa, very emotional for them.  
COACH SELVIG: Yeah, it's always hard. They accomplished a lot of what they
wanted‑‑ they were so determined this year, we are going to bring the
tournament back to Missoula and go to the NCAA; we went to quite a few; we
didn't go to a couple.  
They were so thrilled when we did that, and they‑‑ you know, we lost some
games where we didn't play very well this year and I'm sure some people
probably thought we weren't very good but they never ever‑‑ they knew what was
going to happen. I didn't know we were going to do that necessarily.  
I told them, I said, you guys made believers out of me. In fact, every time
they lost a game, they came back with a vengeance, and bounced back, where you
might get discouraged they got motivated. Alyssa and Katie, can't remember a
drill that it wasn't giving everything they had. Boy, that's fun to be around.  
  
Q. If you could say something about Torry, it seemed like she came a long
way at point guard?  
COACH SELVIG: She played well tonight, had a little shaky start, turned it
over. Their pressure was not all Torry's fault, but she made big shots.  
What Torry's become, you look at her and think, she doesn't look very fast and
quick; she has become a really good defender. She did some brilliant things on
defense tonight, not only pressuring kids that look an awful lot quicker than
her but she was in help and her mind‑‑ she's someone I never said for two
years that she ever did anything good on defense.  
The lights clicked on for her, and so I'm really proud and she's become a
play‑making guard. She kind of scoots around out there. I thought she really
played well tonight after that little bit shaky start.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 22, 2013

  

### [Jasmine Hassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21800)

### [Jasmine James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22148)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We want to welcome you to the third press conference today.
Today we have Georgia Lady Bulldogs Head Coach Andy Landers, and we have
players Jasmine Hassell and Jasmine James.  
We'll start with questions for the student‑athletes and get to Coach after
that.  
  
Q. This is for Jasmine Hassell. I just want to ask about your defense. You
guys have played great defense this season. What do you like about it? Just
talk about the pride there in how well you play defense.  
JASMINE HASSELL: We play defense well. We've always had a hunger playing
defense. Defense leads to offense. I love playing the defense to help with the
offense. We just like doing that, and that's what we hang our hats on.  
JASMINE JAMES: Just to kind of go off of what she said, I kind of agree it
leads to easy offense for us. If we don't have a great offense, we understand
that, if we go to the other end and we get stops and get steals and stuff like
that, and it may be able lead to easy points for us to get us going.  
Defense has been a big thing for us all year long and will continue to be as
we work our way through the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Jasmine James, it seems like it's been a long time since you played a
ball game. Could you just talk a little bit about that.  
JASMINE JAMES: I think that you can look at that two ways. I think that you
can look at it as you're not really playing games, you're practicing, or you
can look at it as a good thing because you're not playing games, you're
practicing.  
When you're practicing, it's giving you opportunities to improve on the things
that you need to improve upon as well as just try to get better as a team.
We've had quite a while now since our last game to try to get better. I think
it's been a good thing for us.  
  
Q. Jasmine Hassell, I know you ended the year with a real strong
performance. How does that play into your game, having the layoff, after
having such a great finish to the season?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I think as a group, we all just have gotten to regroup and do
what we need to do to make this journey through the NCAA Tournament. I think
we're all excited and ready to go.  
  
Q. Ladies, what can you tell me about what you know about Montana? Start
with you, Jasmine Hassell.  
JASMINE HASSELL: Well, they play defense, and they play offense. We know that
we have to play hard. We know that we have to execute and do the small things.  
JASMINE JAMES: I'll say this. Montana is a good team. They're here in the NCAA
Tournament.  
As we've taken some time to look, we've identified who some of their key
players are, of course, and just understand that they're a real good
all‑around team. They shoot the ball really well.  
We understand that we're going to have to come out and play hard and play good
defense in order to come out with the win. But we do understand that Montana
is a good team.  
  
Q. I know you both have been in the NCAA Tournament quite a few times. Coach
Landers has been there many, many times. Talk about the experience that you've
had previously of being in the NCAA Tournament and how that will help you
today. Go ahead, Jasmine Hassell.  
JASMINE HASSELL: We have been here a lot of times, and we don't want to take
that for granted because to be in the NCAA Tournament, it's a big thing.  
As far as experience, it will help us because we kind of know what to expect.
Once again, we don't want to take it for granted. We want to take each game
one day at a time and do what we need to do.  
JASMINE JAMES: I agree. We've been here now, this is our fourth year in the
NCAA Tournament, and it's definitely something that you can't take for
granted. Having the experience is a good thing. You come in your freshman
year, and you don't really know what to expect. Here we are seniors, and we've
been here every year now. It's like we know what to expect so we can talk to
the other players about what it is we need to do, and we know how we need to
come out and how we need to perform. So having that experience will be a good
thing for us.  
  
Q. J.J., I was just curious if you have any feelings on having to play
Montana three hours from Missoula. You're a higher seed than them. Does it
bother you at all?  
JASMINE JAMES: I wouldn't say it really bothers us much at all. In the SEC,
you have to go out night in and night out playing in front of crowds of
thousands and being able to come out with wins. I think it will be a good
thing, period, to have a good crowd, whether it's their fans or our fans. So
I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Have either of you players been this close to the Pacific Northwest
before? Or do any of your teammates have any connections with anybody out west
here?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I don't believe so.  
JASMINE JAMES: I don't think so.  
  
Q. Just a shot in the dark.  
THE MODERATOR: No other questions for the student‑athletes. Appreciate your
time.  
Now we'll open it up for questions for Coach Landers.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. I'll ask you what I asked the players. You can't help but be
impressed with allowing 53 points a game. When the defense is clicking, what
do you like about that side of the ball for your team?  
COACH LANDERS: I think the first thing that I've appreciated about our defense
and about our basketball team in general is that it's been very consistent.
Our team has done an outstanding job of making the effort to do things that
not everybody wants to do. That's probably what impresses me the most.  
When it's really clicking, we're doing the things that not everybody wants to
do. We'll step in and take a charge. We'll leave our man to help guard your
man. We spread the floor to eliminate the possibility of transitions, just a
lot of little things going to making it as effective as it has been.  
Probably when you look at it, to be more specific to your question, probably
when I look at it, what impresses me about it is that we really do spend a lot
of energy. When I look out on the court and I'm watching our team play, they
expend a lot of energy getting it done. They're not a group that we have to
beg during time‑outs to play hard. They tend to play hard every time out.  
  
Q. Andy, how well do you know Robin Selvig, and how kind of rare is this
opportunity to have two coaches who have so much experience and success?  
COACH LANDERS: We're old, yeah. You know, how well do you know Robin? Okay. I
ask you that because I feel like I've known Robin for a long time, and I have.
And I feel like that I know him‑‑ I feel like that we have this connection,
but I can't say that we've talked a lot.  
When we've had the occasion to, whether it's been recruiting in the summer or
playing in the same tournaments, our paths have crossed. We sit down, and we
visit for a few minutes, and I've always enjoyed that. But because we both
have been at this for such a long period of time and I met him a long time
ago, I feel like it's an old friend, but it isn't. That's why I asked you how
well you knew him.  
My take is that ‑‑ first of all, we're, what, 2,000 miles apart. So it's not
like our paths cross a great deal, but I have great respect for him. The job
that he's done in Montana commands respect.  
I think when someone has been able to stay at a place, maintain a high level
of competitiveness as long as he has, it also makes a tremendous statement
about him as a person because most of us mess it up somewhere along the way.
And Robin is just a class guy. I've really enjoyed the relationship that we've
had.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess it's hard to predict what will happen once the ball is
tipped off, but you can't help but look at what Montana has done now
defensively. That's an area where they take pride.  
COACH LANDERS: They're very good.  
  
Q. It seems like it's tailor ‑made for a game in the 50s, but could you just
talk about their defense.   
COACH LANDERS: I would love to. They're very, very good. I think a lot of
things make them effective on the defensive end, but first of all, they're one
of the few teams that tend to switch everything when they're in man to man.  
So opponents, I would suspect, unless basketball in this part of the country
is very different from everywhere else we've been‑‑ and I don't think it is‑‑
not many teams switch 1 through 5. They do that. So that's an adjustment that
offensive teams have to make. You have to address that offensively, and most
offenses aren't designed to take advantage of switches. They're designed to
screen and get cutters open. So they're very, very good at what they do there.  
Then if they choose to go to the zone, it isn't your traditional zone. It's
your matchup zone. And they do a very, very good job with it. So defensively,
you have the box. The box for defense in basketball is man to man or zone, and
it's not as if Montana is doing something abstract. They're not. They're just
outside the box.  
They're switching man to man and their matchup zone. So they require a
different preparation and a different mindset, and I would suspect‑‑ there's a
couple of teams in our conference that play matchup, and when you only have a
day or two days to prepare for those teams, it's a real burden.  
Now there isn't anyone in our conference that switches everything 1 through 5
and/or also plays matchup. So I can imagine the challenge that that presents
to the teams that they've played during a regular conference schedule where
games are two or three games or two or three days apart.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any team on your schedule that is similar to Montana?  
COACH LANDERS: I haven't looked back‑‑ I'll think for just a second, or I'll
try to.  
From a defensive perspective, no. From an offensive perspective, there are
two, three teams in our league that enjoy the three as Montana does and also
have excellent two‑man capabilities with an outstanding wing and post player
and versatile post players. That piece, their offensive tendencies will not be
too foreign to us.  
  
Q. Coach, when going up against a team from a smaller conference, how much
do you think your strength of schedule helps you in a game like this?  
COACH LANDERS: I hope a lot. But, again, you don't ever know until the ball is
tipped up. First of all, you don't know how your team is going to play. You
prepare for them to play well, but they don't always play their best game. You
don't know how the other team is going to play.  
Your question is a fair one, and it's a good one, but it isn't one that we
answer or try to posture with ourselves. We've played a lot of teams who
weren't in the Southeastern Conference who were very, very good. There's just
a lot of good teams out there. Montana is one of those teams.  
You don't have to be from the ACC or Big 12 or wherever to be a quality team.
Montana is very well coached. They're very disciplined in what they do.
They're well drilled in what they do. And what conference they come from isn't
anything that we feel is important. That we come out and attempt to play the
best we can play is what's important.  
  
Q. Coach, you incorporated so many freshmen this season. I was reading
through the media guide, and you kind of said leading into this it was going
to be interesting to see how that adaptation process would go. You must be
almost so proud and impressed by how that's gone. Can you just speak about the
growth of the freshmen this season.  
COACH LANDERS: It has been a lot of fun. We felt like for the last couple of
years ‑‑ this really isn't what you're talking about, but I'll set it up.
We're excited for a lot of reasons, and this is just part of it.  
The last couple of years, we've been a thin basketball team. We haven't had a
lot of depth. We've gone to NCAA Tournaments with seven kids, with eight kids,
with nine kids. We brought in a freshman class, and we had returning a big
senior class. We really thought it was a great opportunity for us to create
some depth by depending on our seniors and getting the freshmen involved,
ready‑‑ first of all, getting them ready to play in, and then giving them an
opportunity to play early on and bringing them along. That was the plan.  
What we didn't know was that we had a couple of freshmen who were exceptional,
exceptional in their head, that they could actually come out and look at me
while I'm talking, as you are, and get it, if I told them we needed it.  
Deep cut, take three steps, and back door, then throw your basket hand up in
the air, they got it. You don't have to draw it up. You don't have to create a
drill. They got it. We realized that very early in practice. We had a couple
of kids that were just going to come really, really quick with their
development.  
Cobi Barbee and Tiaria Griffin. Barbee has started every game. In fact, was
named to the All‑Defensive team in the Southeastern Conference as a freshman,
which is really a heck of a note. Griffin has started the last month or so
because she's one that needed to develop a little bit more and has, but she's
also one that has listened, who has, when you asked her to do something,
turned around and done it.  
And then the big thing, where those two are really, really different, is when
you come back the next day, they still got it, and they're still doing it. You
don't have to repeat it.  
And then the third one, Merritt Hempe, had she not hurt her foot, she might
have been starting right now too, but she was out like seven weeks or
something ridiculous with a foot injury. But when she went out the first time,
she was our leading rebounder and was really doing a nice job as well.  
So it is an exceptional group. And while we thought they were going to be the
depth piece, they've allowed us to have more depth, but they've actually moved
up the pecking order and become primary players for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start our second conference today with Gonzaga.  
We'll begin with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Taelor, coming from the Big 12, what scouting report have you given about
any players that you might know off of Iowa State?  
TAELOR KARR: Just overall that they're a great team. They've changed a lot. I
haven't played against them for two years. I remember they have a lot of skill
inside and out. They have a great coaching staff. Always well‑prepared. They
play hard. They've got a lot of good kids inside, a lot of experience. Their
seniors, guards can shoot it, they're quick.  
We need to hustle, play hard, see what we could do. Other than, they're a
great team, and we're going to have to match their intensity, for sure.  
  
Q. Haiden, we know that Gonzaga has been at the tournament now for four
straight years. Think about a lot of experience for the Gonzaga program.
Really you three are the only ones with a lot of tournament minutes. How do
you think that's going to play out?  
HAIDEN PALMER: I just think we have to show that leadership on the court, stay
composed, confident, because we've been here before. Iowa State is a great
team. We know we have to come focused, play hard for 40 minutes. It's a good
goal for us to have out there, help uplift our other players and help them to
play their game.  
  
Q. Jazmine, as a point guard, in watching their point guard, what she's been
able to accomplish, what do you see there?  
JAZMINE REDMON: I'm sorry. I'm nervous. She has a lot of assists. She's a
really good point guard. I feel like a lot of people can take good from what
she does. She's a really good point guard and she leads their team in assists.
She's just a good point guard, I'd say.  
  
Q. Taelor, having played in both conferences, how would you compare the
differences playing in the Big 12?  
TAELOR KARR: Both are great conferences overall. I think the 12 is a little
bit more physical. That's one thing we're really going to have to key in on
for this game. Like I said, they have three inside kids that were all Big 12
selections, they're seniors, they play a lot of minutes. Our posts are capable
of that, but they haven't had to do that a lot this year. Definitely worried
about their size, their physicality.  
We're capable of it. We just got to hustle, play hard and see what happens.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be at home here at Gonzaga, to be able to play in
front of your home crowd?  
JAZMINE REDMAN: I feel like our team is privileged to be playing at home.
Really excited. We're just thankful that we got to play at home front of our
fans.  
HAIDEN PALMER: Same thing. I feel like it's an honor to be able to play in
front of people that believe in us. We want to give them a good show, make
sure we're playing our game, playing with passion, playing hard, give them
something to be excited about.  
TAELOR KARR: Same thing. Just feel great to be playing right now, being in the
tournament. There are a lot of players that are home, their seasons are over.
We're very excited about that.  
Playing in front of the home crowd here is great. My senior year, last time,
last go around, I want to play my best, see what happens.  
  
Q. Haiden, one thing that Iowa State mentioned is they don't play a lot of
pressure defense that Gonzaga does. Do you think that can give you a leg up in
this game?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Both ways. They have some things we have to take away. We have
things they have to take away from us. That's one of the things. I know we
want to try to pressure them to play aggressive and hard just because they
play such a physical game. We need to step up on our side and match their
intensity, match their physicality.  
  
Q. Has there been any mention, talk about how this is a similar setup to two
years ago where you not only got to play the first two rounds at home, but
you're in the regional played across town at the arena?  
TAELOR KARR: We talked about it, it's been mentioned, but we don't want to
focus on anything except this game tomorrow. You're not guaranteed anything
but tomorrow's game. We have to go play hard. If we get that done, we work on
Monday. We don't want to look too far ahead. See if we can keep going, play
some more games in Spokane, that would be awesome.  
  
Q. For any of the student ‑athletes. When you look at Iowa State's front
court, have you faced a team you can draw comparison to?   
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, Iowa State, they have aggressive post players. We have
some tall post players as well. We just want to make sure we match that, play
just as aggressive. I think that's key for us. Like he was saying, us three
are the ones that played a lot with experience. We need to make sure our post
players are up to par and just excited and believe in themselves because we're
supposed to be here just like all the other teams.  
We want to play aggressive, play with confidence, kind of take that positive
they have away from us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student‑athletes and continue with coach.  
  
Q. What was that moment like this morning when you had three coaches in your
office, the amount of success and history right here?  
COACH GRAVES: You know, it was a thrill. That's terrific company, just like I
said. Three Hall of Fame coaches really. I feel like the poor schmuck in the
group.  
People I look up to, it was humbling to have them all there. I think that's
unique, to just have a chance to talk for a little bit, the four of us, while
the rest of the group was in the meeting.  
Coach Fennelly I've looked up to for years. He's a great coach. I followed
him. We were both assistants at one time together. To see what he's done is
just incredible, what he's built in Ames and before that even.  
Coach Landers and Coach Selvig, they're legends. I think there's only five or
six coaches in the women's game who have coached more than a thousand games,
and two of them are here. That's incredible.  
It was neat for me. I was like the little kid who wants the autograph. Do you
guys mind if I get a picture? That's something I'll remember forever. Not that
I'm young. I mean, I'm 50. A bunch of old guys in this little quad.  
  
Q. The night of the draw, you were immediately pointing out their size
inside, speculating about what you were going to do. With a guard covering a
big person, how will that play out?  
COACH GRAVES: I don't know. We'll see tomorrow. We have a plan for them. We've
played some teams that have that kind of size. We have a 6'7" player in our
conference, too, but not with three players. We're going to have to be
creative. We're going to have to switch up, see some lineups we haven't played
with a lot together tomorrow.  
But I'm confident in our team. They're competitors. We'll compete. We'll do
what we can defensively. My staff, I trust them and I think we can come up
with a good game plan. I don't want to reveal that now, but anytime you play
Iowa State, from all the tape that I've seen, I'll tell you, they execute as
well as any team in the country, and they do a nice job.  
I'm sure they've seen every kind of defense against that versatile frontline.
We're going to take a little bit of what other people have done and mesh it
into what we need to do.  
I'll tell you, they use that advantage very well.  
  
Q. Haiden mentioned Ohio State with the tall frontline. Can you take from
that game when you're game planning for this one?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, we draw on every opponent we've played. That's the team
we've become. I can say in the Ohio State game, it didn't end well for us. I
think we're a different team.  
From those people that have watched us day one, we were pretty ugly in
November and December, our inside kids have really improved. That's where
we've made our biggest stride. I think we'll be able to handle that a little
bit better this time around because we are more experienced.  
But this is a formidable frontline, there's no question about it. We're going
to have to be on our game and we can't do it one‑on‑one.  
  
Q. One of the secrets to your success has also been your bench. Do you see
that as an advantage heading into this game?  
COACH GRAVES: I think this time of year there's always an X‑factor. You look
at their best players, our best players. Oftentimes in things like this, they
cancel out, maybe that player you didn't expect to step up does. I don't know
who that is. We've had a different one it seems like every night.  
I'm just hopeful that somebody does, somebody has that game where you go, Wow,
you really needed her tonight. We'll see how that plays out. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. This is a terrific free ‑throw shooting team, Iowa State. What's happened
there? Even Haiden doesn't shoot that well from the free‑throw line, and you
think she would.   
COACH GRAVES: Hopefully there aren't very many fouls then tomorrow on either
side, and that might work to our advantage.  
You're right. We always have late‑game strategy, who we need to foul late in
the game. There's nobody you can put on the line on their side.  
As far as we're concerned, if you look at our percentages, listen, we shoot
better at the end of the game, I'll tell you that. The kids who are in the
game, you look at their free‑throw percentages, they're a little bit better
than you might think. Definitely been an issue this year. What do you do about
them? We make them in practice, so...  
  
Q. How is Taelor? Is she back to 100%?  
COACH GRAVES: I think she's doing fine. I don't think she's 100%.  
This time of year after 32, 33 games, I don't think anybody's 100%. That's why
I like the fact we have some depth.  
But she's tough. She's a tough young woman. Like she said, she's a senior and
she's going to give it everything she has, lay it on the line, as they all
will, as Iowa State will.  
  
Q. Bill was saying earlier, watching you on tape reminds him a lot of you
guys. Do you see that similarity watching Iowa State? Does it help you prepare
knowing they're a lot like you or is it a little tougher?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I'd like to think it's a little tougher because we play a
good style of basketball.  
What I like about Bill and his program is I think they play the right way.
They share the basketball. It's a finesse still, even though they are very
physical. But they have skilled players. I think that's the way the game
should be played.  
I've been very impressed with them. They don't have many holes, which
frustrates me. We're going to have to find some.  
But, yeah, I do think we're similar. I mentioned to somebody earlier. We were
a Midwest school or they were a West Coast school, we'd probably recruit each
other a lot because we like the same kind of players, it looks like. I think
we coach similarly.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Chelsea Poppens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24893)

### [Anna Prins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20665)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome everyone to Spokane and Gonzaga University
for the press conferences today. First one we have up is Iowa State. We have
with us today, Bill Fennelly, the head coach. Also, the student‑athletes we
have with us are Chelsea Poppens and Anna Prins.  
We'll open it up for questions, first of all, for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Start with Anna. One of the concerns that Gonzaga had coming into the
year was the inside play. So what have you noticed, as an inside player, that
they have? Do you think they've made their strides along the way?  
ANNA PRINS: Something I noticed, just watching film, they do have some girls
that are taller, which, I don't know, it's exciting for me because I like to
play against taller players, and they're very good.  
So I think‑‑ I'm not really familiar with their season as a whole, but they
looked really good to me. I'm just excited to play.  
  
Q. Chelsea, just your general reaction to being the 5 seed and being
recognized for 23 wins this year, but then having to go play somebody on their
home court in the first round.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: We're just happy to be able to make it this far and be able
to be one of the few teams that are still competing at this time. We're just
ready to go in and play our best.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you guys are used to coming to this tournament. Gonzaga is used
to coming to the tournament too. So how do you think that's going to play out,
all the experience that the players have in this situation?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: It's going to be a fun game. Everybody knowing what to
expect. Giving the freshmen a new experience, and they're having fun with it.  
Just being able to compete against such a great team who know how to play, and
it's going to be a good challenge. That's what we're looking forward to.  
  
Q. Anna, you're averaging about 20 points over the last four games to kind
of close the season. What's changed for you during that stretch where you've
been able to have success scoring?  
ANNA PRINS: I don't know. I just think‑‑ I mean, it definitely is different
being a senior, just realizing how close to the end you are.  
I don't really necessarily look at it as an individual thing. I think just it
helps that us as a team, we're playing really well together. The past few
games, it feels like we were really gelling together, and I guess these sorts
of things were happening that normally don't.  
I think just letting go and playing because you realize that there aren't many
games left and you want to get the most out of them as you can.  
  
Q. Chelsea, they always get good support here at Gonzaga. You get good
support at Iowa too. What is it like for Iowa kids growing up thinking about
where they want to play and how they end up at Iowa State?  
CHELSEA POPPENS: I mean, I came from a small town, and just being able to play
at a D‑I school was fantastic, and Iowa State had great aspects of it that I‑‑
that came into play when I decided to go to Iowa State.  
The atmosphere, the program, the people there, the coaching staff, the
teammates‑‑ it was kind of like a big old family‑based program, and that's
what I liked about it. The town is a big town, but it has a small town feel.
Everyone is there to support you, and the fan base is just amazing there.  
That all came into play when I chose Iowa State.  
  
Q. For either player, do you have any connection to this area or any
connections to the Gonzaga team that you've become aware of?  
ANNA PRINS: I just found out I have some family here I didn't know about. On
my grandma's side.  
  
Q. [No microphone].  
ANNA PRINS: They're actually Gonzaga fans, obviously.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: No. I have a few family in Seattle, but they're coming to
support us. Other than that, I don't really have any connections here.  
  
Q. Maybe both players, starting with Chelsea, tell us about how playing in
the Big 12 this year, especially playing against Baylor, helps you to play on
this kind of stage.  
CHELSEA POPPENS: Playing in the Big 12 with all these great teams, everyone's
tough, anyone can win on a given night. It just depends on who wants it more.  
And just being able to compete against each and every one of these teams has
just been a great experience in our four years. It's really prepared us for
like playing against other teams in the NCAA Tournament. It's just been great
to compete against the best.  
ANNA PRINS: Ditto. I mean, I agree with Chelsea, everything she said.  
The Big 12 is a great conference to play in. Every game, like she said, is a
challenge. It's really fun to play in this conference. You can play against
some of the best players in the nation every night that we play, and I think
it does definitely prepare you for later in the season, especially right now.  
Just kind of giving you that confidence that you can compete against the best.
I don't know, it's been a fun ride.  
THE MODERATOR: No more questions for the student‑athletes. We'll excuse them.  
Now we'll be able to direct questions to Bill Fennelly. I'd also like to
mention that Matt Schultz is the sports information director. He's right in
the back.  
Now Coach Fennelly.  
  
Q. Bill, what are the major challenges when you are the higher seed but
you're coming in to play someone on their home floor?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know that the seeding really has anything to do with
it. The challenge is we're going to play a great team.  
When you get to the NCAA Tournament, you know you're going to play a great
team. I don't put much stock in where the game's played. We played in a lot of
great venue. I think our kids are going to enjoy the atmosphere.  
It's like we have a great fan base at Hilton, and certainly they do here. We
get to play in front of a sellout crowd. We play in the Big 12, as the kids
mentioned, and we played great environments, but our focus is playing a great
team. Wherever you play them, you play them. That's the NCAA Tournament.  
That's not something we focused on. I told our kids every year we've made the
Tournament, that number just decides what color jersey you wear. I don't
really pay much attention to it.  
We're honored to be here. It's a great program. Coach Graves does a great job.
The people in Gonzaga are tremendous. They run a great event. Everyone in
Spokane has been tremendously gracious to us. It feels like home. The people
have been really nice.  
We're honored to be here. We're honored to be part of this event. Hopefully,
we'll give the folks a good game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bill, along the lines of the earlier questions, Gonzaga opened the year
knowing they were strong at guard, concerned about the inside play. Have you
seen that at all in what you've seen looking at Gonzaga?  
COACH FENNELLY: No. I think what's happening, their post players are young,
and I think what you hope for in any team is that the older players, your
experienced players, the guards for Gonzaga, help those other kids come along.  
If you think they play a good schedule, you're playing Louisville and Ohio
State and all those people, and their post players are developed. I think they
feel much more comfortable than they did earlier in the season.  
Obviously, we focus more on what's happened later in the year. We haven't
really paid a whole lot of attention to what they were doing early. When you
have kids that are skilled and they're comfortable and they played a lot of
games now, they're not redshirt sophomores or freshmen anymore. They're
experienced players in a good system.  
Kelly's kids have always gotten better. They know how to play the game.
They'll present a good challenge to our team, no question about it.  
  
Q. There is a very big gap in the teams between free ‑throw shooting
percentage. What makes for such a good free‑throw shooting team as yours?   
COACH FENNELLY: That's a good question. We shoot a lot of free throws in
practice. We focus on it. It's something that we take very, very seriously. I
think that it's like a lot of things, there's a pride that goes into it, and
you don't want to be the one that misses.  
There's a lot of work that's gone into it. Chelsea, for example, was in the 50
percent range when she was a freshman, and put in a lot of time and effort to
where now she's one of the top free‑throw shooters in this league.  
For our team, it's been a way that we need to manufacture points. We're not
going to turn you over. So we've got to figure out a way to score the ball.
For us, the free‑throw situation has become something that we've taken great
pride in.  
We had a couple of high school coaches at practice the other day, and they
said they've never seen a team shoot so many free throws in practice. We made
the decision with as much time as you have in practice, to use that time to
shoot them, and our kids take pride in it. It's been an asset to our team.  
  
Q. Kelly made a comment on the draw day that it feels like a spring chicken
with three other coaches there at this site. You're kind of a spring chicken
compared to the other two too.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you very much. I don't feel like it, let me tell you.  
  
Q. Anyway, what is it like to be at a place where you've got so many veteran
coaches?  
COACH FENNELLY: When you start thinking about Andy Landers and Robin Selvig,
those are hall of fame people, let alone hall of fame coaches. We sat in
Kelly's office here a minute ago and took a picture, and he's poor mouthing
all these great coaches. There's a lot of trophies in his office too.  
So it's a great thing. You're honored to be a part of this event. They're good
guys. They're good people. I've had the pleasure of knowing them on a personal
basis. I got to know Kelly a little bit better on the Nike coaches' trip. As
good a basketball coach as he is and those other people are, they're better
human beings, and what they've done for our sport, what they've done for
college athletes, college student‑athletes is incredible.  
Obviously, this time of year, people focus on how many games you've won and
whatever, but the thing that they've done for young people is probably more
important. So it's fun to be a part of it, and certainly fun to be around guys
like that.  
  
Q. You probably talked with your coaching brethren about playing here at
Gonzaga because they've been able to use this atmosphere very successfully in
the past. What did you get from them as to how you need to have your team
approach this game?  
COACH FENNELLY: The night of the selection, I probably had 20 text messages
saying congratulations, and you got a terrible draw.  
It is what it is. We're not going to make any excuses for it. We play at home,
and we have a great home environment. We played on the road in some‑‑ when
you've got to go to Baylor and Oklahoma and all those other places, they're
not a whole lot.  
We piped in music in our practice facility. We have the Seattle Seahawks
soundtrack and piped it in at practice. Everyone had a headache for three
days. But they have a great fan base, but those fans can't score. They can't
guard you. You've got to play.  
The kids are going to decide the game. I think our kids are excited to play in
an environment where the teams are appreciated, and it's an exciting time, I
know, for Gonzaga basketball with their men's and women's team.  
Our men's team is playing tonight. We're excited about that. It will be fun.
Like I said, you just hope you play your best, and hopefully that will happen
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What is going to be the toughest challenge for your club out there,
playing in the game itself?  
COACH FENNELLY: The way they defend is going to be a problem for us. They're
very aggressive. They change defenses. They're very balanced on offense.  
Someone asked me who on the schedule do they remind me of? They remind me of
us a little bit in the way they approach the game‑‑ balanced scoring, share
the ball, play the game right, play the game hard. They play pressure defense
more than we do. We're going to have to find a way to take care of the
basketball.  
When you go on the road, you can't beat yourself. Your offense can't beat
their offense. You've got to make plays at the end of the shot clock, and all
you've got to do is look at the NCAA Tournament yesterday in the men's games.
Someone's got to make a play. Someone that maybe you don't expect to make a
play. That will be the challenge for us tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the Coach.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate the time.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 22, 2013

  

### [Katie Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25207)

### [Kenzie DeBoer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25208)

### [Robin Selvig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25206)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started here with Montana head coach Robin Selvig,
and also the student‑athletes we have with us today would be Kenzie DeBoer and
Katie Baker.  
We'll start with questions directed to the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Katie, you can't help but be impressed. They allow about 53 points a game
against SEC teams. Tell me what you see as keys offensively to getting open
shots.  
KATIE BAKER: Yeah, I know that we're really going to focus on limiting
turnovers. Every possession you have is gold because of that front court that
they have.  
So really just limiting your turnovers, being patient, working the ball
around, getting good open looks is really just going to be the key, especially
against that zone.  
KENZIE DeBOER: I agree with Katie. She said it all. We have to be strong.
Blocking is going to be a big factor for us.  
  
Q. Katie, have you guys played anybody on your schedule that might be
similar to Georgia?  
KATIE BAKER: Earlier this year playing Villanova and UNLV down in that
tournament in Vegas. They were big, strong girls, and quick, different style
of offense than what you see in our conference. So that can be the only real
comparison I have.  
We've played some good games. I feel like we've played a tough schedule. And
Temple we played at the very beginning, they were that fast‑paced kind of
game.  
In comparison, those would be the games.  
  
Q. Katie, how different a team are you from the one that came here two years
ago and played UCLA in the first round?  
KATIE BAKER: I mean, for us seniors, we're older. We have played together for
a while now. I feel like this team, I mean, when you look at personnel, we're
the exact same team as we were last year, which I think has helped us
chemistry‑wise.  
So everyone really knows their role and everyone has a role on this team. But
everyone has owned it. What's great about this team is there's no one person
carrying the team. Everyone contributes and everyone has a special part.  
So I think that's a little bit different aspect of the team from 2010 or '11.  
  
Q. Kenzie, were you able to watch the men's game last night? Anything you
could take from that game going into Saturday?  
KENZIE DeBOER: We all watched the men's game together. It was tough seeing our
boys struggle out there.  
What I got out of it was we need to be confident. I think our boys lacked a
little bit of confidence. I think they were scared. I think us being older,
having a lot of seniors, experience on our team, I think that will help us to
have some confidence, go out there, know we can play with a great team.  
  
Q. As a 14 seed two years ago, you came within a few whiskers of upsetting
UCLA. Here you are again two years later. What will it take this time to pull
off that first ‑round win, Katie?   
KATIE BAKER: Like I said, kind of composure. Really valuing every possession,
because each possession is super important, and confidence. We're the
underdogs. We have nothing to lose going into this game. I think knowing that,
playing like that will really help us to our benefit.  
But we really, kind of like Kenzie emphasized, play Montana basketball. We're
going to come out with a fight, play like it's our last. So we have kind of
that underdog tone going for us.  
  
Q. After being here two years ago, how nice is it to be able to come back to
Spokane and play for your close fans, Katie?  
KATIE BAKER: Such a blessing. Quite a journey here. To come back and be here
our senior year has been a picture‑perfect season for us through the ups and
downs. I think the only thing to end it great would be to make a dent in this
tournament, so...  
  
Q. Kenzie, how great is it to be so close to your fans?  
KENZIE DeBOER: It's great. I'm actually from Washington. A lot of my family's
coming. We have such great support from our Montana fans. I think a lot of
them are going to make the trips over here, which will be awesome to see them
supporting us in the crowd.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student‑athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Selvig.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your defense, how unique it is.
Coach Landers talked about how unique it is you're able to switch all five
players.  
COACH SELVIG: Well, I haven't always had teams that could do that effectively,
but we've had a number of teams that could. It's kind of grown into something
we like to do.  
I like to think we have some versatility on defense. Georgia is a more
versatile team because they can throw such different looks at you.  
We play man and zone. This year for the first time we've been about 90% man
and 10% zone. Hopefully we can find one that works tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your senior leadership going into this. What
are you expecting out of Kenzie and Katie?  
COACH SELVIG: I know what I'm going to get out of them. We're going to get a
team that competes and plays hard. We've got our hands full with Georgia,
that's obvious, just as we had our hands full with UCLA a couple years ago. We
had good senior leadership then.  
I don't think we're going to be afraid. I think they're looking forward to
this. They're excited for this. They lived and died to get back here this
year, their senior year.  
I think we're going to get a heck of an effort out of them. Now, hopefully we
can find somebody to make a shot or two and make it interesting.  
  
Q. With both teams really strong defensively, can you talk about what kind
of a game you expect the style to be tomorrow.  
COACH SELVIG: It will be a battle. I think Georgia, they've probably always
been good defensively. I think they're pretty physical. I'm kind of glad we
just came off the Northern Colorado game. That's just a slug 'em out from the
start. Stepping into the NCAA tournament, you don't want to be going, Oh, they
let you do this and that. These ladies are big and strong.  
We got to be ready for a battle. That's one thing these ladies have always
risen to. We're going to compete, fight tooth and nail for every rebound,
every loose ball. That's the nature of this team.  
We got here pretty much 'cause we defended people every night. Georgia
probably will say the same thing. You look at their record in that league, the
number of points they've given up, it's really remarkable. It's not very many.  
  
Q. Because of the defensive strengths of both teams, how important is your
guys' ability to hit some shots from the perimeter, hitting threes lately?  
COACH SELVIG: I think it's important. What you're not going to get on Georgia
is any easy baskets. Probably not going to get transitions unless we get a
steal or two. They're so solid fundamentally and they play really hard. He's
got enough depth. They're not going to get worn out.  
When we get good looks, we got to make 'em. When we're good is when we find a
couple kids making shots. We've done that a lot this year, but I think the
three would be important.  
I don't think we're going to get a whole bunch down low. We have a number of
different kids that can do that. So I do think that's critical.  
  
Q. Coach Landers talked at length about your relationship over the years.
How does it feel to be part of such a big legends' club here in Spokane?  
COACH SELVIG: I don't know about legends' club. I've watched them for years
and years and years. We went down and played at their place in a NCAA one
time, a 16 seed, got to play them on their home court. I don't know if that
was a good thing or not.  
He's recruited up around Missoula. I had a chance to visit with him a lot.
They played in the regionals. We hosted the regionals, I can't remember what
year it was, but Georgia was at our place, Texas Tech. A program I've followed
quite a bit. I admire what he's done.  
For one thick, we pride ourselves at our program as being good defensively,
and I think Georgia does the same.  
Bill, I've known for a lot of years, too. Of course, Kelly. It's a fun group
of coaches here to be around.  
  
Q. Kelly felt like an infant this morning with you guys.  
COACH SELVIG: That's Kelly saying that. He's not really an infant anymore. I
think he's doing okay.  
  
Q. I had the pleasure of covering Katie Baker for four years in high school.
What a player, and even a better person. Can you talk about her impact at
Montana, what she's meant to your program?  
COACH SELVIG: Well, Katie is really a wonderful person. She has been a
blessing to coach. She's positive every day. She went through knee surgery and
she never was down one minute. She lost 15 games one year. She had her
appendix out one time in the middle of the season.  
She's very strong. A bad game, she doesn't come in without a smile. She's a
great friend for all these ladies. She's a great teammate.  
You know, it's been a thrill to have her. And she competes every minute of
every game and every second of every practice. What coach doesn't love that?  
  
Q. Kaylee Valley (phonetic), a recruit you've signed, in the same mold as
Katie. You recruited her maybe to be a point guard. Can she have an impact
with you guys?  
COACH SELVIG: Pretty excited about her. She's the kind of player we like to
get. She's a versatile kid, maybe point guard. She could play inside, play a
lot of different places at our place. She's also a young lady that really
competes and will be good on both ends of the floor.  
Next year we have a lot of open things. We have four seniors, three that
start. I have redshirts returning, there's going to be competition. I've seen
Kaylee play a lot. She was at our camp. Very excited about her chance to come
over and be a heck of a player.  
  
Q. Can you talk in general, your team seems well ‑equipped to handle
Georgia's physical style. Could you talk about how the game has evolved over
the last years and how you approach that as a coach.   
COACH SELVIG: You know, it's not a game for the meek, and it hasn't been for
quite a few years.  
The difference is, a lot of times when we got to the NCAA, played someone in
the top 20, there was a big difference between strength, speed and quickness.  
With my team this year, I think we've got pretty good strength. We're not as
athletic as Georgia, speed and quickness, things like that, but we have one of
my stronger teams.  
We won't get knocked around that much. We might get knocked around some. But
that's the nature of what this game's become. Endlessly people are watching
and they're sitting down by the floor at a women's basketball game, they can't
believe how physical it is.  
But it's been that way for a while. Usually those really physical teams were
in the Final Four, and there wasn't so many. Now there's a lot more parity.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SELVIG: Thank you.

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  93  
Louisville  60

  
MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais from Louisville, head coach Jeff Walz
and student‑athletes Sara Hammond, Antonita Slaughter, and Shoni Schimmel.  
We'll begin with a statement from Coach Walz.  
COACH WALZ: I'd just like to first congratulate UConn and Geno, his entire
staff. They've done a great job. They're a fantastic basketball team, and we
knew that coming in here. They played as well as I've seen them play this
entire year tonight, and they shot the ball as well as I've seen them shoot.  
We knew coming in here that we were going to have to try and make them take
some 3s, and they took some 3s and they made some 3s. We just didn't quite
have enough tonight. But it's not because we didn't compete. And we didn't
compete‑‑ and we competed for all 40 minutes.  
I'm proud of every single one of our players. It's without a doubt going to go
down as one of the greatest runs in women's basketball.  
To be a 5 seed and knock off a 4, then‑‑ but the No. 1 of all 1s in Baylor and
then a 2 in Tennessee and then come back and beat Cal, I don't think anybody
can argue that, you know, unfortunately we just came up one game short.  
But I'm proud of my players. I'm proud of everyone. I'm proud of my staff
support staff. And we're going to hold our heads high and we're going to be
proud of what we did.  
And I'm really proud of our two seniors in Monique Reid and Shelby Harper.
Mo's had the opportunity to the play in two national championship games.
Unfortunately we didn't come out on the plus side of either one of them. But
it's an experience she'll always have.  
And I'll told these players this is something that they'll remember for the
rest of their lives and I was privileged to coach them and be a part of it.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For Sara, I wonder if you could speak to the difficulty of contending
with Breanna Stewart and what specifically you were trying to get done and
what you would have liked to have done better.  
SARA HAMMOND: You gotta give credit to her, her being a freshman coming in, in
the spotlight in a national championship. She handled it very well. She's a
tremendous athlete. She's a freak of nature. She's got a wingspan that's close
to Brittney Griner's, I think.  
And she's a hard matchup. She can shoot the 3, she can take you off the
dribble or post you up. So she did a tremendous job. And her teammates did a
tremendous job of getting her open and getting her the ball.  
But our whole game plan was to limit her touches and not let her rebound. And
she was relentless on the boards tonight. I gotta give credit to her and her
team.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you talk a little bit about the attack they put on you
personally, I mean, the way they contained you?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Playing in the Big East you kind of know each other, and so
they kind of had an idea. We've already played before, so they knew what to do
to stop us, and that was kind of limit my touches and not really let me shoot.
Because they saw the day we played Cal, the same thing happened.  
And my teammates did a great job of doing what they needed to do, and that was
score when they needed to. We just came up short, and you can't really ask
much of anything because we gave it all we had.  
  
Q. Having done what many believe was completely impossible, and having built
up such faith in your team this year, you've got much of this team coming
back, what do you think it's going to do for you next year?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think it's us still believing in the fact that we did make
it this far and we are losing two seniors. But, hey, everybody's coming back,
and so that's bad for everybody else because we did make this run at the end
of tournament, and it's just going to continue into next season and we're just
going to get better and grow as a team and learn from this and hopefully be
back next year.  
  
Q. Sara, Coach talks about throwing the first punch. UConn did that tonight.
Describe kind of the feeling that was like and how difficult was it to
emotionally regroup after that.  
SARA HAMMOND: Honestly, I thought we kind of came out and fought with them
there at the beginning. They're a great team. They made it to the championship
for a reason, but we did too.  
But they executed their game plan to perfection. They tried to take away
Antonita and Shoni' 3s and kind of get up in their face, and they made other
people take shots. And then when you look up at the scoreboard and you kind of
see they're going on a big run, I mean, yeah, you're down 18 or whatever, but
we never stopped fighting. We went to timeouts and we huddled. And Coach and
all of us, we gathered around each other and said the reason we're here is
because we kept fighting and we never gave up, and we're not going to quit
now. We made it to a national championship.  
We never quit, no matter what the score was.  
  
Q. For Antonita, I wonder if the way the game got out of hand, does that
make you think there was something you didn't do, or was there just a talent
discrepancy that you weren't going to be able to overcome?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Personally I think that my teammates‑‑ I think they fought
the hardest. We just came out short tonight.  
And we're not going to hang our heads. We did the unthinkable. So we're just
going to work through the summer and just come back next year and get better.  
  
Q. Can you tell us how your seniors are handling the loss? Do they have
perspective the way you do, or are they more upset?  
SARA HAMMOND: I think they're glad that we got to the national championship.
No one believed in us this whole time. Everyone expected Baylor to be back in
the national championship. And we did the impossible.  
I don't think‑‑ none of us are hanging our heads, and they're not hanging
their heads either because they went out, they were the last ones to practice
the last day you could practice, and that's a great way to go out, knowing
that you're the last one of two teams to end the season still playing.  
So I think they're proud of all of us and they're‑‑ a great way to go out.
Obviously we didn't go out on top, but it was a miracle run in this
tournament, and I think they're going to remember that the rest of their
lives. And when we look back‑‑ Coach always tells us 20, 30 years from now
we're going to be texting and emailing each other talking about this and what
we did.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. With their 3 ‑point looks, what was your thought process in terms of what
you're trying to take away from a team that can score in that many ways?  
COACH WALZ: Well, that's part of the problem, and I've said that, I've talked
to my staff about and we said that from day one. What makes them so unique is
their ability to score from all five positions on the floor. You got to kind
of pick your poison.  
I told our players, too, we're going to have to try to make someone shoot the
ball that normally might not. But the problem is when you go 13 and 26 from
the 3‑point line, it makes it tough to defend you.  
And that's really what happened tonight. I thought Kelly Faris was great for
them. She always doesn't get a lot of the props because she doesn't do‑‑ she
might not always be the high scorer, but just how she plays, how hard she
plays. She defended so well. And then she goes out there and goes four of
seven from the 3‑point line.  
I think we started off in the second half and made a little run, and she comes
down and hits back‑to‑back 3s to counter any kind of run we were trying to
make.  
They're a tough matchup for anyone, and especially for us when we're as thin
in the post as we are.  
  
Q. Jeff, after the win against California, you told ‑‑ I believe it was an
ESPN sideline reporter‑‑ court‑side reporter: Why not us.   
COACH WALZ: Yep.  
  
Q. In a nutshell, why wasn't it you tonight?  
COACH WALZ: Because we didn't score enough points. They scored 93, and we
scored 60. That's kind of‑‑ if you don't score more that the other team, it
ain't gonna be you.  
  
Q. More succinctly, Jeff, was there something that you could say ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: No. I mean, they played great. They go 13 of 26 from the 3‑point
line. They defended well. They chased Shoni and Antonita and did a really nice
job of pushing them off the 3‑point line.  
We ended up going 5 for 23 from the 3‑point line. And that's normally not what
we do. We've been a much better 3‑point‑shooting team, especially the past
three weeks, than we were tonight. And I knew coming into this game we were
going to have to make some 3s. We just don't have the post depth right now
with all the injuries that we have to be able to just pound the ball down low.  
So I'll give credit to them because they defended extremely well.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked a couple days ago about Breanna Stewart and talking to
Jim Boeheim and sort of having a sense of how good this player is, but it's
one thing to sort of know what a player is like in high school and on tape and
another thing now to coach against her. Can you give us a sense of how
dominant a performance you think this was and just how difficult it is to game
plan against her?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, it's extremely difficult. You know, I've seen her
play in the summers a bunch and in high school. She's just a phenomenal
player. I think Geno saved her for the tournament because he didn't play her
as much throughout the year. So I guess he knew what he was doing.  
But she's a spectacular player, and we knew that. I think what you've seen
from her in the NCAA Tournament, especially in the Final Four, is what all of
us had expected the entire year, to be honest. And I think she got injured at
one point and then was going through just some growing pains as a freshman,
but she sure figured it out at the right time.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talk a little bit in your opening statement, but just the run
you guys had. Geno said up on stage that the only team playing better than his
guys in the tournament were you having won those games and just what you've
done. And I know it's after coming off of the loss, but just what this run has
meant for Louisville and just basketball in general, seeing a team thatgets
here ‑‑ no 5 has ever gotten to the finals before.   
COACH WALZ: I think it's great. I give all the credit to our players, to my
staff, in believing in what we thought was possible. We came out every night‑‑
I mean, we came out tonight with the plan to win. We had planned to be the
ones out there celebrating. We weren't coming into the game thinking there
ain't no way we could win. Because if you do that, there's no sense to show up
and play.  
So we go, you know, we're the 5 seed, we win the first one. Then we aren't
supposed to beat Purdue; we do that. And then nobody ever thought we'd come
close to beating Baylor. But we knew in order to do that we were going to have
to do something special. 16 of 25 from the 3‑point line was pretty special.
Then you go out there and you beat a Tennessee team that everybody thought
we'd lose again, and we don't. You come in here, you beat Cal. And, I mean,
things are going good.  
The one thing that I wish I could change is the two opportunities that we've
had here to play in for the national championship, you're playing against a
conference opponent. The great thing about this tournament is you normally get
to play somebody that hasn't seen you. And they can watch you on film; we can
watch people on film.  
Like we watched Cal. Clarendon, I thought she was really good. But in person,
she's a lot better than what I had seen. She's a lot quicker and does some
more things.  
But you get in here, you play UConn, and it's‑‑ it's a tough task. But we
thought we had the opportunity to compete with them. I thought if things went
well‑‑ and we were going to have to get some breaks here or there. But the run
that we went on I think is remarkable and it's something I'll always remember.
And I've told our players: When we walk out of this place, we're walking out
with our head high and we're proud of what we've done.  
  
Q. Jeff, you cut it to 16 points and Stewart hits a 3 ‑pointer and you turn
around and you just kind of shake your head like: What else can I do? What was
that emotion, and was that kind of resignation there?  
COACH WALZ: No. They just made big shot after big shot. Starting the second
half, we come out, we score. Then Faris hits a 3. We come back down the floor
and score again. Faris hits another 3. Then we hit back‑to‑back 3s and get it
to 16. And Stewart comes out and hits about a 22 ‑‑ a 23‑footer. And it's just
a big time shot.  
And at that point in time I was like if we can get one more stop and get down
and score, all of a sudden it kind of makes the game a little more
interesting.  
But unfortunately we were never able to get it to where a shot actually
started to matter. And what I mean by that is when you're up 15, 16, that rim
looks really big. You get it to 10, you get it to 8, and all of a sudden
there's a little bit more pressure on you. And we could just never get over
that hump and get it to that.  
  
Q. Jeff, are there ways you can build off this run that weren't available to
you in 2009 because of who you lost from that team?  
COACH WALZ: Of course.  
I think what this does for us is I think it shows people that our '09 run was
not an accident. And where I'm hoping that this really helps us build is in
recruiting. I'm hoping there's some players out there that realize, hey, look
what they've done at Louisville in the past six years. We've played for two
national championships in the past five years.  
And in order for us to continue to make runs like this and then to come into
the situation and be able to beat Connecticut is we're going to have to
continue to recruit and get players that can come in here and push the ones
we've got, and then we'll put a team out there where we're competing to win
this game.  
  
Q. Jeff, to kind of elaborate on that, can you speak to this team's
potential next year? I know it's kind of hard now, but considering who you
guys have coming back and the injured players you that you didn't have?  
COACH WALZ: I'm really excited about that, but at the same time I've got to
make sure my players understand that we just went on a pretty special run. And
if you're going to sit here this spring and summer and think that same thing
is going to happen without going back to work and getting better individually,
it's not going to happen.  
I challenged them in the locker room after the game. I said, Hey, this is
unbelievable, something you'll never forget. I'm not going to forget it
either. But if you're satisfied with this, that's not what I want.  
I've had the opportunity to coach in the national championship three years,
once as an assistant, and we were out there celebrating, and now twice as a
head coach, and we're still one step away. You've got to climb that next step
to be able to cut the nets down.  
And that's our goal, and I told our players that. And, you know, I think they
want the same thing. And we understand we have to have the same type of
improvement from each player as we did this year to be able to make that next
step, and hopefully our incoming recruits will be able to help. And then
hopefully, again, we'll be able to continue to recruit some special players
that want to be a part of this.  
Because‑‑ I mean, I'm not sure‑‑ I think we counted. I think there's been
eight schools, I believe, in the past five years that have actually played in
a Final Four. In our game, it's not easy to get to this game that we've just
played in, and because of the fact that we're continuing to recruit and
continuing to get players to believe in what we're doing‑‑ and hopefully we'll
see the dividends when we sign our next class and the class after that.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking of the talent that you already have, could we get your
thoughts on how Sara Hammond rose to the occasion tonight when both Slaughter
and Schimmel were being contained by UConn?  
COACH WALZ: I thought Sara came out and competed. We're still going to
challenge her. She settled a few times for fade‑away shots. When she's got it,
she's quick enough and strong enough to drive to the basket, try to absorb the
contact and try to get 3‑point plays.  
But the progress she made from her freshman year to her sophomore year, it's
remarkable. And I challenged her to make those same strides to her junior
year. Because if she does that, now all of a sudden we're getting better.  
It's the same thing I told Jude Schimmel. I thought Jude has done great job
for us. And now she has to continue to improve. You could just go down the
entire line.  
So we're honored to have the opportunity to play for a national championship,
but we're not satisfied with the results. So we're going to continue to get
back to work and hopefully be able to be the ones that are out there
celebrating.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  93  
Louisville  60

  
MODERATOR: Joining us on dais from are Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma
and student‑athletes Kelly Faris and Breanna Stewart.  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Auriemma and then take questions for
our student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thanks. I don't know what I can add to what we just did. I
told Jeff after the game, it was an amazing run by them. Incredible for them
to be in the situation that they were in, and I want to congratulate them and
Jeff and his staff and their kids.  
And for the last month leading up to that was a little bit of a struggle. In
spite of our record, it was a little bit of a struggle for‑‑ I know for Kelly,
for Stewy, myself, the coaches, you know, nothing that you could see, but it
was a struggle. It was a struggle for us internally to get connected and to be
the kind of team that I knew we could be.  
But this last month has been everything and more that I could ever hope for
with this team and these players. And they deserve this. They really do.
Sometimes you stumble upon a championship, sometimes the other team hands it
to you. But this particular group, especially Kelly, she deserves this
championship because she competes for a national championship every day in
everything she does. And I'm really, really happy for her. Stewy? Eh
(laughter).  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Kelly, Coach talked about sometimes you stumble sometimes like that. What
made this team do you think reverse itself by your standards in the last
month? And was there ever a true moment ‑‑ any moments of doubt that it would
not happen?  
KELLY FARIS: I don't think so from our standpoint. I think a lot of people on
the outside doubted it. We had our ups and downs where it was frustrating, and
there were times that I was just mad at the world for the way that things were
going and the fact that I couldn't figure out how to make it work.  
But I can't put into words how thankful I am for this group. And for Coach to
turn this around after the Big East Tournament loss. We sat in the locker room
and he looked at us and he said, You know what? When we get back together, I'm
going to show you how to win a national championship.  
And, sure enough, we're sitting right here. So there's times that I don't know
how the heck he does what he does, but he's pretty darn good at his job and he
figures out a way to get it done.  
And happy to have him on my side.  
  
Q. Breanna, can you take us into your mind when the clock was winding down
and that you saw that you were going to win a championship your freshman
year?  
BREANNA STEWART: It was really exciting. I didn't really know what to expect,
but obviously as the clock was winding down, we knew that we were going to win
the national championship. And I was just trying to figure out who the first
person I was going to hug was gonna be.  
  
Q. Kelly, how much was Breanna's play maybe also a catalyst for what you
guys were able to do after the Big East Tournament, the change that she made
or the change in her, and how much did that change you guys?  
KELLY FARIS: That changed us a ton. I don't think people understand how much
we needed her to get to this point. If we didn't have her, we wouldn't be
here. And we all know that, and I hope she knows that. If she didn't turn it
around and step up like she has‑‑ I mean, we have a freshman that's the MVP of
the national championship game. And that doesn't happen anywhere but here. And
she deserves it.  
And kind of, again, I'm glad she's on our side. I wouldn't want to be playing
against her.  
  
Q. Breanna, how does this all compare to what you imagined in August or
September when you came here about what your freshman year would be and to see
how ‑‑ the spectacular fashion in which it's ended?   
BREANNA STEWART: I think coming in obviously the goal is always to win a
national championship, but really going the whole six months through all the
hard work and all the practices, I mean, this is kind of a‑‑ I don't know,
it's really exciting to be here. And winning a national championship was our
goal, and we accomplished it.  
  
Q. Breanna, I know after the Bridgeport regional you weren't really too
hyped up about winning the MOP there. You were focused on the team awards. You
guys obviously got that done today. Does it mean a little bit more to you to
get the MOP for the entire tournament? How does that feel?  
BREANNA STEWART: I appreciate it. I mean, it's nice. But, still, we just won a
national championship, and I think that's the best thing.  
  
Q. This is for Kelly or Coach. Kelly, you said Coach said he was going to
show you how to win a national championship. What he did do?  
KELLY FARIS: He might want to keep that a secret. I don't know. (Laughter).
I'll let him answer that one.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll start with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, you're pretty good with words. Do you have a favorite one when you
think of Breanna Stewart? Would it be precocious or innocent, or how would you
describe?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She's probably all those, she's probably all those things.
She's just‑‑ she's really, really innocent and in so many ways. She has a
little kid's attitude towards everything that happens. She sees the fun and
the joy in everything, and that's why I'm really thrilled for her, because
there were times this year where all that went away, and I was really, really
worried about her.  
And she got it back and she got it back just in time, and here we are.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said I think a couple years ago at a Big East media day
that wait until Stewy gets here and we're not going to lose many at all, if
any. Now she's here, and the last time you guys won a title in '04 was Diana's
end of her run for you guys. Is this the start of a new run with the freshmen
and the group you have coming back?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. It's so hard to look ahead. So many things have
to go right in the future. Stewy certainly is different than any other college
player that's playing right now. But there are a lot of great players that
were playing this year that didn't make it to the Final Four, didn't win the
national championship. And there's been players that have won it as a freshman
and never won any other one and never even went to a Final Four again.  
I think looking ahead is‑‑ for me, I think the three freshmen that we have‑‑ I
want them to keep getting better and better and better every day. Where that
takes us, I don't know.  
Right now I'm really anxious for next year to start because I want to see what
Bria Hartley looks like and I want to see what Stefanie Dolson looks like as
seniors, because they've been in the middle of this since their freshmen year.
And for them to finally be seniors next year, I think it's probably going to
be pretty exciting for me.  
  
Q. Geno, what Breanna did these last three weeks, your best ‑case scenario,
or beyond what you hoped you would get from her when she started when the
light bulb went on?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mentioned yesterday that I always‑‑ when we recruit
players‑‑ people tell me this all the time‑‑ my favorite time that I love my
players is when I'm recruiting them and after they graduate (laughter).  
When I'm recruiting them, I think they're going to be First Team All‑American
National Player of the Year. And after they graduate, I think back to, man,
what would we be without them. But whole four years that they're there is just
torture.  
The reason I say that is when I saw Stewy play in high school and play U.S.A.
Basketball and play with pros as a junior to be a senior in high school and
dominate those kids, all I could think of was what's she going to be like when
she's in college and learns how to, you know‑‑ how to play and fills into her
body and gets a lot smarter? So I'm thinking, wow, this kid could be
unbelievable. Maybe as good as anybody I've ever coached.  
So that was my thought with Stewy. But thinking that and having it happen,
those are two completely different things. And I'm not surprised that it's
happened, but to think that it would happen her freshman year to this extent,
these last two weeks, that‑‑ that was difficult. That would be a difficult
thing for me to admit that I thought so.  
  
Q. Geno, congratulations first of all.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
  
Q. Obviously I want to ask you about the historical significance of hitting
No. 8. I mean, you tied a great coach today, and can you talk about that as
far as your program and your feelings personally?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, when we started‑‑ when we got to our first
Final Four in 1991 here in New Orleans, we almost acted like, carried
ourselves like, we're thought of as we didn't belong here. The other three
teams were Stanford, Virginia, and Tennessee, so the thought of being in the
same Final Four with those three programs.  
When we left and we didn't win, I thought: What if we never go back? What if
that's that one and done? There's other teams that made the Final Four that
never went back. And I thought: What if that happens to us? What if that's
what Connecticut is?  
And then when we won our first national championship in 1995, I thought: Lots
of people won one. What if we won't win another one ever again?  
So I'm always kind of looking into the future and thinking: Is this it? Is
this the last one? Is this one and done? Are we going to be one of those
programs?  
So to look back now and see where we've come and what's happened at
Connecticut in the last 18 years, I would say, never in our wildest dreams did
we think that that was possible. Halfway through it I still wasn't sure where
it would go.  
And winning tonight I think validates a lot of what we wanted to do, what we
aspired to be. On ESPN they put up a list of John Wooden, Pat Summitt, Geno
Auriemma, Mike Krzyzewski, Adolph Rupp. I'm like: That's not the way it works.
That's not the way it works.  
I never beat Coach K in a game, and I never coached against Coach Wooden. So
the only person I compare myself to is Pat Summitt. And to be there in that
spot with her means a lot to me.  
  
Q. Coach, if I could ask you two things. First, you have eight titles, but
that's eight championship games. Never lost a championship game. What does
that mean to you? And then, also, if you can sort of put in perspective what I
guess ‑‑ I think you've been in contention every year since '95. There's never
been a single season where I think anybody would have been shocked if you
would have won. What that consistency from way back then in '95 means to every
single year be in the mix.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, somebody‑‑ as a matter of fact, somebody pointed out
something that you wrote that kind of captured the essence of what we are at
Connecticut, and certainly how I treat it, that I expect to be in contention
with my team every single year. Ever since 1995, you're right. And everybody's
had injuries and everybody's had bad luck, but ever since 1995 with very,
very, very, very few exceptions, we were number one in the country every one
of those years at one point or another. And I don't know anybody that's been
able to do that.  
And yet, at the same time, the expectation level to win one every year really
bothers me. And I think you were really good in pointing that out. It bothers
the hell out of me that there's this assumption that we should win it every
year or we should lose in the national championship game every year. I don't
think anybody that makes those comments really, really knows how hard it is to
do what we've done.  
And I'm really, really proud of that. Because I know how hard it was to do it.
And with each year that goes by and teams get knocked out and teams that
everybody thinks are national championship teams or programs that should be in
the Final Four and are not, with each year that that happens, I feel even
better about what we've done. Because I know more than anybody else, and so
does my staff, just how incredibly difficult it is to do what we've done. You
had something else?  
  
Q. (Off Microphone)?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Eight for eight? Man, oh, man. You know, the one thing‑‑ I've
said this before, and excuse me if I've said it here before, but I really
believe that coaches lose more championship games than they win. You don't
have your team ready, for whatever reason, mentally usually. And I've been in
the Final Four a couple times when we've lost where mentally we weren't right.
But we've never been in a championship game where mentally we weren't right.  
And all eight times that we've won a national championship, I felt like my
team was mentally ready to win a championship. And I think that's something
that I'm really proud of; that we don't show up in championship games not
ready to play mentally or physically.  
  
Q. When you say to a team "I'm going to show you how to win a championship,"
what do you have to show them and where‑‑ how long in your career, Geno, did
you understand what you had to show them?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, remember after we lost at Notre Dame in at that triple
overtime game and you said to me, You gotta be the most miserable 30‑and‑3 guy
in America, right? I think if you're not careful at Connecticut, you have this
thing hanging over your program that losses are not allowed, and kids become
afraid to lose if you're not careful. And at Connecticut we've always played
to win. I think that's another reason why we play well in these tournaments;
we play to win. We're not afraid to lose. But that takes some getting used to
at Connecticut.  
And I thought that for a large part of this season too many times our team was
feeling the pressure to win, the feeling of are we good enough, what if we
don't live up to other people's expectations of ourselves. And a lot of that
has to do with me. A lot of that has to do with our coaching staff. Because
too many times at practice they didn't live up to our expectations as coaches.
Usually mine.  
And it got to a point where I could sense it, I could feel it that it was
holding us back. And as soon as the Big East championship game ended, I sat
down with our coaches and I said: All that's going to change starting right
now.  
You don't know if it's going to work, but I tried to make them feel like,
listen, all that stuff's behind us now. There's a lot of teams going into the
NCAA Tournament. 64. And there's a lot of teams that think they can win it.
But we're Connecticut. And we go into the NCAA with a different mindset than
everybody else. And they're so young, dummies, they believe me (laughter).  
  
Q. For the last month back home we've been busting your stones about how
come they can't win a close game anymore.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know, I know.  
  
Q. Turns out you didn't have to.  
COACH AURIEMMA: By the way, I went back and checked my media guide after you
guys were killing me about that crap, and in my first four years at
Connecticut, we played 47 games that were decided by eight points and less.
And we won like 80 percent of them. So anybody out there from Connecticut,
shut up.  
  
Q. Did you think you would be able to run ‑‑ to win‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. Well, I mean, when we saw the bracket, obviously, you
know, when we saw it, we were really, really concerned, because obviously the
1 and 16 game you don't worry so much about. Vanderbilt is a really good team,
but we're better than Vanderbilt. But when I saw Maryland, Kentucky, and Notre
Dame, probably, and then Baylor, I thought, man, this‑‑ I hope I didn't set
these guys up for a big letdown, because this is gonna be really, really,
really hard. And you hate to play teams that you've already played in the NCAA
Tournament.  
But sometime during that Vanderbilt game something clicked, and we just got
this thing about us, this aura about us that we got now. I don't know where it
went, I don't know what happened to it during the season, I don't know how we
lost it, but there was something in that Vanderbilt game. And then it happened
again in the Kentucky game, and it happened in the Maryland game where I knew
we got it. We got it. We got everything we need right now to win this whole
thing.  
And I'm not going to sit here and tell you that, you know, that if Baylor had
been in this game against us, you know, we win by 30. So things had to break
right a little bit for us too. But that's just the way the tournament goes.  
  
Q. Geno, in '95 when you won your first championship, it caused a tremendous
amount of interest in the sport. Since then there's maybe a feeling right now
that the game has plateaued in terms of injuries and the quality of play. Do
you agree? And, if so, what can it do to get better on both levels?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Man, that's a topic for a lot of discussion, and a lot of
people have talked about it and I've certainly thrown out my share of ideas,
which people have‑‑ some agree with, some have said that I'm an idiot.  
I think, like any other sport, the product that you put on the floor has to be
excellent. And you have to aspire to be really, really good, which means you
don't have a majority of the teams in college basketball shooting 40 percent
from the floor.  
That means that our officiating keeps getting better. That means that our
coaching keeps getting better. That means that these kids that are being
coached in high school, AAU, whatever, keep getting better; that they work on
their game; that they learn how to be really, really good players instead of
just whatever. Like you see a lot of kids. Like if they win, they win; if they
don't, they don't.  
There's got to be a commitment to being great. I think it's happening at more
schools than ever, but I think there is a feeling that we have plateaued.
There's a feeling that we have plateaued. And the interest level has to come
back, and maybe players like Stewy will help in accomplishing that.  
But women's sports unfortunately are going to suffer that. They have from the
beginning, and they will to the end. That's just the world that we live in.
And we gotta fight that every day.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Coach. Louisville got here by volume scoring in a sense,
just shooting lights out against Baylor, volume scoring against Tennessee.
Could you describe what your defensive approach was to containing them in
general? And then specifically in the second half, after Sara Hammond was the
one person doing much damage in the first, you held her to just four points in
the second. What adjustment did you make on her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We really didn't make any major adjustments on Sara Hammond.
We spent so much time and energy guarding Shoni Schimmel and Antonita
Slaughter. We spent so much time and energy guarding those guys. That was our
focus the entire game. And Jude Schimmel when she was in the game as well.  
So whatever anybody else did, we were gonna have to live with it. As long as
those three players didn't dominate the game. And our guards did a amazing job
on those three. Amazing. That, I thought, was going to be the difference in
the game, how well we did against those three players. Because, let's face it,
those three have carried them to this point. Those three in the six games or
the five games before tonight have dominated every guard combination that
they've played against. And we were determined that that wasn't going to
happen tonight.  
  
Q. Is there any player that you would single out for their defensive efforts
in this game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: For us? Yeah, I don't think Shoni Schimmel got a lot of open
looks, and that was Kelly Faris. And Antonita Slaughter didn't get many open
looks either, and a lot of times that was Stewy. We thought her length would
be good enough to keep her from‑‑ plus, we didn't let her get as open as some
of the other teams that she's played against in the last three weeks.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're welcome.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
MODERATOR: From Louisville we have head coach Jeff Walz along with the five
starters, our student‑athletes Sara Hammond, Sheronne Vails, Antonita
Slaughter, Bria Smith, and Shoni Schimmel.  
  
Q. Antonita will you just talk a little bit about the hot 3 ‑point shooting
that you've had so far in this tournament and just at what point maybe you
really started feeling it, and are you surprised that it sort of carried
through this far?  
ANTONITA SMITH: No, I'm not surprised, just all comes with practice and
repetition. And I know my teammates have confidence in me, so that gives me
confidence within myself when I shoot the ball.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you address Monique Reid, the courage she
shows, the injuries she deals with, and how much she helps you guys knowing
that she's always there to fight for you?  
SARA HAMMOND: Mo's been here before. She's experienced the Final Four and what
it takes to get to a national championship. And just her experience and her
fight and wanting to get back there, it just shows that no matter how hurt you
are, what adversity you face, that you can still push through.  
And Mo has proven that to us as a fifth‑year senior. And she wants to go out
on top. So she's played all year long on one leg, and just her fight and that
adversity she's faced I think has really shown to us that anything's possible,
no matter what you're going through. And, you know, we're just thankful to
have her on our team.  
  
Q. Shoni, just tomorrow night's the end either way of an unbelievable run
you guys have had through this tournament, arguably the best to date he's ever
done. What's it going to take for you guys to come home tomorrow night with a
national championship?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think not being done with what we've come out here do, and
that is win a national championship. We've already beat Baylor, already beat
Tennessee, and we beat Cal, the 2 seed, so now we have another 1 seed.  
And we're ready for anything. And for it to be the national championship game,
why not go out with a bang.  
  
Q. Bria, where is the team planning to watch the Louisville men's game
tonight? And should they be successful, I'm sure you're aware of the history
that you guys can make tomorrow. And what does that all mean to the team in
the program?  
BRIA SMITH: It's huge for the program. It's huge for both of our teams if we
were able to pull off both winning the championship. But we're going to watch
it at some‑‑ Crazy Lobster? Crazy Lobster. We watched their last game there,
so we're just going to have a big watch party again.  
  
Q. Along that line, any and all of the players, how much texting, tweeting,
whatever, calls, between y'all and the men's team has there been?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, probably a lot. I don't have Twitter, but I hear from
these guys all the time how much they get and how much tweets, how much
Instagrams, likes and followers and everything.  
Texting, personally it's been a lot, but it's just everybody saying
congratulations and whatnot. So, I mean, I don't know, how many do you guys
have?  
BRIA SMITH: Too much.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Not enough you mean? Keep them coming (laughter).  
  
Q. I wanted to talk to you guys as Coach walked away just about maybe what
kind of coach he is and kind of what he's like maybe away from kind of the
public glare.  
SARA HAMMOND: Coach is a great guy on and off the court. And off the court‑‑
well, on the court as well‑‑ he's always just making sure that we're having a
good time. He cracks jokes with every one of us and makes sure we have smiles
on our faces. And he does go above and beyond to make sure that we need
everything necessary off the court and on the court. And he's there to make us
not only better players but better people and prepare us for life.  
So, I mean, he's just a great guy to be around. And I know he acts crazy
sometimes on the sidelines, but that's what gets us going and gets us excited.
And I think that's why we all came here to play for the University of
Louisville, is because of what Coach Walz promised us and getting us to a
national championship and hopefully preparing us maybe for professional
basketball and preparing us for life.  
  
Q. Just on the funny side about Coach Walz, Coach Auriemma said last night
he thought Coach's shirt last night looked like a tablecloth. I was wondering
if you would agree with that assessment. And, secondly, does he have ‑‑ what
do you guys think of Coach's wardrobe choices?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It was definitely pink. It wasn't red last night.  
SHERONNE VAILS: Yeah. It's okay. It looked like a picnic cloth, but it's all
right.  
  
Q. Coach, taking away your stock answer, what's it going to take besides
scoring more points than them tomorrow night to beat UConn?  
COACH WALZ: That's a great question. We're going to start working on that
today and tonight, and we'll put a game plan in tomorrow. We're going to use
today's practice just to get out there and shoot a little bit, go through our
stuff.  
At times we're a lot better with less. So the less preparation we have, the
less we have to think about things. And sometimes the less you think as a
basketball player, the more you just play on instinct.  
So we're just going to put a game plan in starting tomorrow for our hour that
we get.  
But it's going to take the best game that we played to date. We're gonna have
to play better than we played against Baylor, better than we played against
Tennessee and Cal.  
We're gonna have to play, I mean, 40 minutes of pretty much perfect
basketball, which I think we can. It's like I've said from day one: I'm just
glad it's not a best‑of‑seven series.  
It's just like Baylor. If it's a best‑of‑seven series, I told our kids‑‑ I'm
honest with them‑‑ if we had to play Baylor a best‑of‑seven, I don't think
we're going to win that series.  
But we don't have to. We've got to play one night, 40 minutes. And our goal is
to come out here and play the best 40 minutes that we played this entire
season.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys obviously haven't had a lot of success against UConn.
What would winning a championship against them do for the perception of your
program both locally and nationally?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it would be great. The opportunity to play for a national
championship and win a national championship would be fantastic. But I think
what we've done right now is put our program out there on a national stage.
Our goal is to get to this point every year. And we're going to continue to
strive for that.  
And being our second national championship game in five years, I think says a
lot about our program. To win one, that's what everybody dreams about. I've
been fortunate enough now to play in three finals, one as the assistant to a
head coach.  
And like I was telling my staff, the crazy thing about it is in all three I
played against a conference opponent. At Maryland we played Duke. Now it's
UConn twice.  
The one thing I love about the NCAA Tournament is you're normally paired up
when you're playing against people you haven't played, so the X's and O's part
really becomes a factor, because they haven't seen what you do, they don't
know what you're going to try and do.  
That's not going to be the case tomorrow night. He knows what our players can
do. We know what their players can do. So now it's going to come down to just
flat‑out execution. Because we're not going to be able to surprise them. We're
not going to be able to junk it up. We're going to have to play basketball.  
And that's where it's one player against another player, how many times can we
make sure we try to get them uncomfortable and take contested shots.  
It's going to be a challenge, but it's one we're excited to have. I'd rather
be playing tomorrow night than not.  
  
Q. Shoni, a lot has been made of your run to get here, but when the
tournament began, did you guys expect that you would be playing for this title
on Tuesday?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, definitely it's every girl's dream in the women's game
of basketball is to go out there and play for a national championship. Our
coaches have done a great job of preparing us and getting us to this point,
and they've done a lot of it, but also our team has just come together as one
and just gone out there and played our hearts out, and that's nothing you can
ask more of.  
And for us to be here‑‑ and we kind of had it in the back of our mind. I know
I did. But for us to get here is‑‑ just says a lot about the University of
Louisville.  
  
Q. Bria, in previous games why do you think you haven't been able to beat
UConn?  
BRIA SMITH: Well, the first time that we played them this year we didn't
really execute the game plan as good as we were supposed to. And I think that
now we have more of a focus. It's way later into the season, and we know
what's going to come with the UConn‑‑ with the UConn game plan and everything.
So I think that we're going to be more ready for this game.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wanted to ‑‑ in what ways is your team better than the last
time you guys played them and what do you remember about that game?   
COACH WALZ: I don't remember a thing. I try not to remember anything about
those games.  
We're playing better basketball. I mean, our kids are confident, and there's
really not much more to say, to be honest with you. We believe in what we're
doing. They believe in what they're doing. No one thought we could beat
Baylor. No one thought we'd come back a day after that and beat a Tennessee
team. And I know people picked us to beat Cal, but I think it's because they
just had to because we beat Baylor and Tennessee, so it's like, gosh, if we
don't pick them and they win, we look bad.  
I'm not sure everybody really believed that we'd win that game last night, and
I got a pretty good feeling they aren't picking us for tomorrow night.  
So we're just going to come out here and play, and that's what we've done, and
we're going to have fun doing it.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you walked out on the floor for the first day of practice,
what were your realistic expectations for this team? Geno, he knows what's
expected of him, but what did you expect from your team this year?  
COACH WALZ: Our realistic expectations first day of practice were to be
playing here. I thought we had a talented enough team and a deep enough team
to get to a Final Four.  
Now, I'm looking at that group that first day of practice, that's Asia Taylor,
Shawnta' Dyer, Tia Gibbs, Monique, healthy, as healthy as she could be. And
then all of a sudden Tia Gibbs was supposed to be back mid‑November. She
doesn't come back. Asia Taylor was the same thing. She does not come back.
Then Shawnta' Dyer goes down mid‑December with a torn ACL.  
Mo actually had been playing well in the non‑conference. We just weren't
playing her a lot of minutes. She played about 14 or 15 minutes, she wouldn't
practice the next day, trying to just get her into playing shape when we
started the conference. Started the conference well. And then she gets hurt in
practice and re‑injures the knee, and then it's back to play a game, take two
days off because the knee swells up, take care of that, get the swelling down,
play a game again.  
So once that all happened, it was, all right, let's see what we can do. Let's
see if we can't get through the conference, get through the conference
tournament and see if we can't put a run together.  
And that's what's happened. So when we started the year, I thought we had a
chance to be here. Now, January 5th or 7th, I'd be lying if I said I'm not a
little surprised that we're playing tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: At this time I'll excuse the student‑athletes to their individual
breakout rooms.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Jeff, tell me a little bit about Antonita Slaughter. Her play has
obviously been huge for you guys to get here, but hometown kid, talk about her
development a little bit and what she's meant to you guys during this last
couple weeks?  
COACH WALZ: Antonita has made significant strides from her freshman year to
now. I'm sure she'll tell you, if you have a chance to visit with her, there
were many times her freshman year that I told her she'd stay on scholarship
but she would be the water girl. I told her best thing that she could do in
practice was fill up the water cups for us. Because she wouldn't try. She
didn't give the effort that I knew she had to give to be great.  
Because I'd watch her in high school, and the kid, she could flat‑out shoot
the basketball. But she never looked to drive, she never looked to get in
there and rebound and try and be physical. And I just kept pushing her and
pushing her and pushing her, and towards the end of her freshman year she
started to play a little bit more. Then she ended up actually playing well for
us in the NCAA Tournament.  
Sophomore year, it was okay. She had a good year, not a great year. And then
all of a sudden last summer I challenged her to get in the gym and shoot. I
said: For us to be as good as I think we can, you've got to be a 40 percent
3‑point shooter. And she was pretty well close to that until that last month
where she went 4‑of‑34 through a five‑game stretch. And up until February the
27th, that was the last game she had asolid game, our last home game, I would
say she was the most consistent player we had. I knew what I was going to get
every night. I was going to get about 12 to 14 points, about eight boards, two
or three assists, and she'd play solid D.  
Now, I never dreamed she'd be‑‑ I'm not sure what she's shooting in the NCAA
Tournament from the 3‑point line, but it's got to be 50 percent plus. It's
pretty incredible what she's done. And they aren't standing on the line. I
mean, they're a good four or five feet behind it.  
So I'm excited for her, excited for her progress. And just her entire family
is down here supporting her. It's really neat to see.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering, your official response to Geno's criticism
of your shirt. And, also, if you could just talk about your relationship, what
it's like, with Geno.  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's not ‑‑ it's not‑‑ what I was going to tell y'all, too,
is this‑‑ this will most likely be the last game that I coach here. It's been
a great six years. As a women's basketball coach, you go through times where
you're always wondering what are you gonna do when you're finished. And I've
been to three national championship games. And now that I've got the
opportunity to be a waiter in his restaurant (laughter), I don't know what the
hell else somebody wants in life. So my goal is to become the head waiter. Not
just one that sits in the back. I want to be the best damn one he's got. So
I'm going to talk to him after the game tomorrow night and see when I can
start, see if we can talk a contract through, and hopefully we can get things
taken care of. Because it would be an honor to work in his restaurant.  
I love the guy. He's a great guy.  
  
Q. Jeff, you said other day, I mean, crowing for the Big East and how this
is sort of a fitting end for the conference as it is now and having you two
play. I think six of the last seven years there's been a Big East team in the
championship game. Just talk for a second what it means to have two Big East
teams playing for the NCAA championship and its last year as the most dominant
conference?  
COACH WALZ: It's a special thing. The Big East Conference, it's my‑‑ obviously
my sixth year of being in the conference. And every time you turn on a Final
Four, there's Big East teams playing in it.  
And for myself, obviously it's our second time in five years that we've faced
them in the finals. I don't think anybody could argue that this is the best
league in women's basketball. It's not just UConn and Notre Dame, Louisville
has been in the Final Four the past five years twice. So it's not just one
team that dominates it. You look at all of our programs, you get South
Florida, DePaul, I mean, you just start‑‑ St. John's. You can just keep going
on. If you don't come to play every night in our league, you're going to get
beat. And that's what makes our league so special.  
And the thing that I've really enjoyed about it is you've got every style of
play within our league, which is why I think we do so well in the NCAA
Tournament. You've got Harry at Villanova that's going to run the five out and
back screen you and slip on you, slip screen you to death, and it's just
exhausting to guard. But then when you get to the tournament, there's somebody
like that you're going to face and you're prepared for that. And then you get
the teams that like to run up and down the floor. You get your UConns
executing half court as well as I've seen, but then they'll ‑‑ a pressure
defense is relentless.  
So the Big East has prepared all of our teams to have success in the NCAA
Tournament, and I think it's a fitting end to have two teams playing for a
championship.  
  
Q. You do realize that if you take a job at Geno's restaurant you're going
to have to wear a tie.  
COACH WALZ: He said I don't. I can keep wearing my tablecloth. So I'm going to
get that worked out. That's going to be part of the contract.  
  
Q. Okay. He really seemed to like you and respect you. I mean, he talks
about a lot of coaches, but when he talks about you, you can tell that he
genuinely thinks you're a hell a coach. And I'm just wondering if you could
tell me why ‑‑ about the dynamic of your relationship and how that makes you
feel.   
COACH WALZ: Well, you know, he's always been good to me. The one thing that I
will say is I'm not sure he knew who I was when I got into the league. He knew
I worked at Maryland, but he never knew who I was.  
And I can remember at a Big East meeting where we just had a pretty frank
conversation. It was a good conversation. And I think at that point he was
like, oh, okay, he's not all that bad.  
And then as we've gone‑‑ I mean, I like to have fun. I think I'm pretty
sarcastic at times and I like to give it back to him as well. So he'll give it
to me, and I'll try and throw something back at him. And it's all in good fun.  
But when it comes to competing on the basketball floor, I've always respected
what he's done. I respect how he does things. Even when we had Angel. We had
some great games our first year, we lose I think by four or five in the
conference finals to them.  
And then obviously the following year we're playing in the finals, it's a
12‑point game at half and they score a backdoor layup to end the half, and he
knew it was a ball game. The final score was 20‑ 22 or 23. But even after the
game he's like, hey, I knew it was going to be a harder game than what
everybody else thought.  
But I've always respected him because he's just honest and blunt. Like I like
say, he says what the rest of us think, and I respect him for that.  
  
Q. Coach, Breanna Stewart has been incredible in the tournament as of late.
Could you talk a little bit about her performance and what it's going to take
to stop her tomorrow night?  
COACH WALZ: I'm hoping she misses the bus. She's playing like I think we all
thought she would the entire year. But for some freshmen sometimes it takes a
little bit of time to get into your groove. I watched her play in summer,
watched her play U.S.A. Basketball, and what you've seen in the tournament is
what she's done her entire career.  
So, to me, this is really not all that surprising. And, to be honest with you,
I don't think it's surprising to Geno either. There's a reason he recruited
her and she was National Player of the Year. She's a big‑time player.  
I had the opportunity to sit next to Jim Boeheim at the Olympics, and we're
just talking during the gold medal game. And he was like, wow, you know,
there's this kid that plays open gym with our women at time up there at
Syracuse, she's going to UConn, she's one of the best players I've ever seen.
I'm like, yeah, I know (laughter).  
So it's not a surprise at what she's doing. And she sure makes it look easy.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what Geno has meant to the women's game?
And, also, can you kind of compare and contrast you guys's styles of
coaching?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think what he's meant to our game is a lot of coaches lose
games. I mean, I think I'm 0‑and‑64, something like that, against him at this
point in time.  
Like I said, what impresses me so much about what he's done is he takes really
good players and gets them all to play hard, and then he gets them to buy into
his system and they continue to go.  
Our first year we played them at our place, and they actually were traveling
to Marquette or something so they stayed over and they practiced at our
practice facility. And I'd ask him, Hey, you care if I come watch? He's like,
Sure. Actually my whole team came to watch. And he sat there and talked to me
for the first hour of practice. But what impressed me so much is you had Renee
Montgomery, I think it was Maya's freshman year, Tina Charles, those kids were
out there running practice. He didn't have to tell them to go hard. The
upperclassmen were getting on the freshman, were getting on the sophomores. If
you weren't going hard, he didn't have to say anything because their teammates
are saying it.  
And that's when you know you've got yourself a great program and leaders.
Because as a coach, when you just have to coach and you're not trying to
encourage your kids, Go hard, go hard, go hard, you know it's going to be a
good thing.  
And that's what he's got. He just continues to get leaders after leaders, and
he develops them of course.  
  
Q. Jeff, all dynasties have to end sometime, UCLA, whichever. Can you
foresee anything in the coming years that would knock Connecticut off its
perch? Not that they win every year, but that changed the dynamic, short of
Geno leaving?  
COACH WALZ: No. Right now, no. I mean, Breanna Stewart is a freshman, so we're
dealing with her for three more years. And then again, what I like about them
is they don't‑‑ he's not one to stockpile kids. He doesn't put in‑‑ get 15‑‑
if you look at his roster, it's not 15 deep with 15 McDonald's All‑Americans.
He's going to get three or four each year, and then he builds players that go
around his system.  
I've always been impressed with him. You get players that‑‑ honestly, when I
look at some of them, like some of the ones he's recruited in the past,
they're great players for what he's trying to do. And then you put a Maya
Moore in the mix, then you put a Breanna Stewart in the mix, like you have to
guard everybody on his team. That's what makes them so good.  
And I don't see how that's going to change unless he decides to retire, which
I think he should (laughter). I'm all for it.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you played them the first time, Stewart didn't play. And just
does that sort of throw out that game? And you say you don't remember it or
don't want to remember it, but does that kind of change the plan knowing that
she wasn't even there and now she's on this run that few freshmen have ever
done?  
COACH WALZ: We're going to have to‑‑ we've seen her play enough obviously as
the year has gone on and we know what she can do, but she does throw a little
wrinkle into the plan of who guards her. Because if you focus too much on her,
then who's going to guard Dolson, who's going to score in the low block. And
then I've got Lewis I have to worry about. I mean, and then Hartley and then
Tuck and‑‑ I mean, it goes on.  
So we're going to have to try to figure out something to try to stop them from
getting so many easy baskets. I'm not sure what that is quite yet. I've got a
whole night to try to figure it out.  
  
Q. Jeff, you mentioned Hartley and Lewis. Sometimes I think the expectations
on those kids are so high that when they don't ‑‑ they're not sky high it's
like they're not playing well. Can you maybe talk about it, especially
Hartley? It seems like she has played pretty well during this NCAA Tournament.
  
COACH WALZ: I think Bria has played extremely well, to be honest with you. I
laugh because I watched Geno's press conference the other day and I listened
to his kids talk at the press conference and they talk about how it's been an
up‑and‑down year; they're 34‑4\. I'm like, I'd love to have a up‑and‑down year
and be 34‑4\. Or they might be 35‑4 now. I'm not sure if last night's‑‑ 34‑4t.  
That's just the expectations that are put on them every single year. And it's
a good thing, but at the same time I think everybody needs to take a step back
and say, hey, if 34‑4 is an up‑and‑down year, I'd hate to see what a bad
year‑‑ or actually what a good year is.  
But she's been there. She's been solid for him the entire‑‑ her entire career.
I like how she fights, I like her demeanor on the floor, and I like how she
takes a lot of responsibility for what's going on in their program.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier trying to keep things simple. I know you said
before in Oklahoma City before the Baylor game you were just gonna go out and
shoot. You wanted your kids to just sort of focus on putting the ball in the
basket. Can you sort of expand on that, that maybe sometimes it is better to
sort of keep their minds a little clear before big games like this?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah. It's like when we played Baylor. We weren't going to shut
them down. And we're not going to shut UConn down. I mean, it's about
impossible. So there's no way that we're going to‑‑ if we have a chance to
win, it's not going to be a 60‑55 game. It's got to be 84‑83\. We might have
to try and get up into the 90s if we can.  
And the only way we're going to do that is by shooting the basketball. We're
going to shoot 3s. He knows that. It's not going to be a secret. But they're
going to be out pressuring us too. I've got a feeling they'll probably find
where Antonita is.  
But we're going to have to figure out a way to score points. I know they're
going to score. But it's a matter of can we score.  
And that was the difference in the Baylor game. Everybody talks about how we
guarded Brittney Griner and all that. Again, they scored 81 points, which is
their average. We just figured out a way to score 82.  
So tomorrow night we're gonna have to figure out a way to put points on the
board.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously what's going on in the school right now is unbelievable
with the men's team playing tonight and you guys playing tomorrow night and a
chance for history of only the second program to have both titles. Have you
talked to Rick today at all? If they win, is he planning to show up tomorrow
night? Is there any sort of plan? I know you guys are watching the game
tonight at the same place you watched it the other night, I think.  
COACH WALZ: We're going to be watching at the Sheraton tonight in the lobby.
So that's where we're going to watch the game tonight.  
I've texted with Rick back and forth, just wished him luck. And, again, he
congratulated us. And he's focused right now on trying to make sure his kids
are prepared to play a basketball game.  
He told me if he can make it down for tomorrow, he's coming, which I can only
imagine what's on his plate after tonight's game. It wouldn't surprise me if
he found a way to come down, but if not, I know he'll be watching. He's done
it through the entire tournament.  
It's something special, not just with our basketball programs, but our
football team wins the Sugar Bowl in a game no one expected them to win
either. So our whole philosophy is, hey, we're just going to come out here and
play, and we're going to play hard. We're going to have a game plan.  
But there's no pressure on us to win this game. The pressure is all on them
because they're going to be a heavy favorite to win. And we're just going to
come out and try and get it to where if we can get it into the second half,
get it down maybe the under eight timeout where there's just a little pressure
on them, then we'll see if we can't make a few shots.  
But like I tell our kids every game, you gotta make it a game at half or you
don't have a chance in the second half. So that's really our goal.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions for coach?  
  
Q. Sorry if anybody was dumb enough to ask this, but I was just wondering,
could you talk about the similarities and differences between Rick Pitino and
Geno Auriemma.  
COACH WALZ: They both win a lot. They're both great.  
Rick's been great to me. I mean, I can call him up. I text him. It's not like
I have to wait five or six hours to get a response or a phone call back. And
Geno's the same way.  
So as colleagues, they're both great to me. As coaches, I mean, they're both
fantastic coaches who have had a ton of success.  
And then their personalities. I mean, you have to be confident in this
business if you're going to be successful. And I think‑‑ I laugh because I
really like both of them.  
I think there's a big difference‑‑ and I tell my players all the time‑‑
there's a big difference between being confident and arrogant. And if you're
not confident, you're not going to be successful in anything you do in life.
But at the same time, you don't want to be arrogant.  
And we really work on that. We really talk to our players. And we'll show them
examples of stuff that goes on in the media of, hey, this to me is a confident
person. This is a confident response. This is an arrogant response. So our
players get an understanding of what they're portrayed as. People can hear
somebody say something and go, wow, that's an arrogant answer.  
Because it's important to me. It's important to all of us. I'm a big believer
in first impressions. You only get one of them, so let's make it the best.  
MODERATOR: We have time for a couple more questions, if there are any.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais we have UConn head coach Geno Auriemma
and student‑athletes Caroline Doty, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, Breanna Stewart,
Stefanie Dolson, and Kelly Faris.  
We'll start taking questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Caroline, I don't know if there is such a thing, but are now in official
final game of your career mode?  
CAROLINE DOTY: I don't know if there's a mode to get into it, but definitely
crossed my mind. It's been five years. I don't know what I'm going to be doing
next year. It's a long time.  
I'm just happy to be here and I'm glad the national championship is my last
career game. Hope to go out with a bang.  
  
Q. Who's got Shoni Schimmel assignment tomorrow?  
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We haven't gone over that yet.  
MODERATOR: That might be a better question for Coach at that time.  
  
Q. How much has it helped you guys having played them already and there's a
familiarity of an opponent so in scouting reports it's fresh as opposed to
seeing a team for the first time that you may not know as much about?  
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT‑ATHLETE: It helps. Obviously they're a Big East team, so
we've seen them a couple different times and played them once earlier this
season. But at the same time, that was a while ago. And you know they're going
to change, just as we've changed over the season.  
So there's some things that are gonna be the same about them that we know, and
then we just have to make sure that we're focused and prepared for the type of
play that they're putting on right now.  
  
Q. Stef, sort of the same lines there, I mean, this Louisville team seems to
be loose and feels they have nothing to lose tomorrow night playing the
national championship game. They've been doing that all through the tournament
it seems. Whereas you guys, expectation every year is you come to win a
national championship and compete for it. Do you feel there's more pressure on
you guys to win tomorrow night, or is it you guys are loose and ready to just
play?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think that exactly. We're just ready to play. Louisville
has done a great job beating Baylor, beating Cal, beating Tennessee. They've
come a long way, and I don't think a lot of people expected it.  
But, like you said, they're going to come and play like they have nothing to
lose, and we have to go out there and not really focus on them and focus on
working hard in practice today and then come out tomorrow ready to play and
have fun.  
  
Q. Kaleena, what do you think the most important moment of the season has
been?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Up to this point I think after our Big East Tournament
and just the turnaround that we've made this season as a group, you know, the
confidence level has risen and just our mindset has gotten a lot better as a
unit.  
  
Q. Kelly and Caroline, you guys obviously have a lot of experience playing
in the NCAA Tournament. What would it mean for both of you to bring another
national title back to Connecticut?  
CAROLINE DOTY: It would be a great team win. It would be a great ending to a
great four years for Kelly, five years for me.  
We come in every single year with the mindset and the goal to win a national
championship. So for it to be the last go‑around to be with the teammates we
have, who are playing unbelievable, that would just send us off on a great
note. We wouldn't be more happier.  
But we just gotta take care of business and prepare and really work with the
game plan Coach has for us.  
KELLY FARIS: I would agree. For us it's our last opportunity, and each year is
special and different in its own way, and this year we've had our ups and
downs. And we've had to work really hard to get to the point where we're at.
So I want it just as bad as anybody on this team. And I know we want it for
each other more than anything.  
So like Caroline said, it sends us out on the right note.  
  
Q. Breanna, while you were going through your stretch between the first ten
games and the start of Big East Tournament, do you remember anything
particularly funny or insightful that Coach Auriemma or Coach Dailey said to
you that resonated with you either as a ‑‑ in funny way or in a serious way
that got you going?   
BREANNA STEWART: I was about to say no, not particularly. I don't really have
anything in particular, no, but they always seem to be busting my chops.  
  
Q. Kelly, I was reading up on the last game against Louisville, and I think
you had seven turnovers that game, seven assists. And it was interesting that
Coach pointed out ‑‑ he said you were really upset after that game, you were
really hard on yourself. What are your memories of that game even though you
won? Seems like at least individually you were not happy with your
performance.   
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, I've had a few too many of those games this year. The
turnovers are huge, and you can't have seniors contributing the most to that.  
So, yeah, of course after that game we won, but there's times that you can win
and still feel like you lost a game. It's not all about winning here‑‑ and we
said that multiple times‑‑ it's about how you win. And so as a team you're
happy that you get the win, but individually there's times that you're gonna
be unsatisfied with how you play. And that was one of them.  
  
Q. Can you quantify how unsatisfied you were after that game versus, let's
say, another game this season?  
KELLY FARIS: I don't really remember exactly. But given the fact that I had
seven turnovers, I'm sure I was pretty disappointed in myself in that.  
  
Q. Stefanie, how difficult has it been for you to play through this pain? I
mean, in a realistic sense to ‑‑ I know you haven't been practicing as much,
but how much pain are you in and how much mental stress does that put you
under?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It's definitely frustrating to play with this, but my team
and the coach has done a good job of just supporting me and helping me through
it, because I've never had to do anything like this. Rosemary has done a great
job of taking care of me and treating me, making it feel better every day.  
So I'm just working through it. Like I said, my teammates are helping me out
and doing what they gotta do.  
  
Q. This is for Kaleena. Very few programs have such legendary figures as a
Diana Taurasi or a Maya Moore, and sometimes I think it can be hard when
you're the player that comes in and is inevitably compared to these great
players. How have you sort of dealt with that and tried to just be yourself,
not necessarily get caught up in being compared to legends in your program?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It's easy with our coaching staff and with my
teammates to not really get caught up in stuff like that. Especially playing
on a team like this with so many good players and so many people that are
capable of so many things. You don't really think about yourself.  
Last night was a perfect example of what a great team we have and how many
great players are on this team. It wasn't just one person making everything
happen out there; it was a team effort. So it's not hard at all to look past
that stuff.  
  
Q. Breanna, people have expected so much of you since you were like 14 years
old in terms of playing. Do you ever surprise yourself by what you're able to
do? Do you ever come out of game and go: I didn't think I was capable of
something like that?  
BREANNA STEWART: To think that I wasn't capable of doing something? I don't
know if I have ever surprised myself just because you would think that you
would be the one person that actually knows what you're capable of doing. But
I think there's been moments where there's been like certain plays that you've
been‑‑ or I've been surprised about, I guess.  
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Awesome answer (laughter).  
  
Q. Stefanie, good to see you smiling. You usually come into press
conferences smiling, and you looked a bit in pain.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: What?  
  
Q. Usually when you come into press conferences you're always smiling.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I'm always smiling.  
  
Q. Anyway, my question for you, just talk about the three seniors and what
they've meant, not in terms of leadership this season, but since the end of
Big East Tournament. How key have they been to just bringing everybody back
together, getting on this new page that you've done through the NCAAs?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: They have meant a ton. They have since then spoken to all of
us, saying it's their last year. And we're all going out fighting for them. We
know they want a national championship; we want a national championship for
them. And they've all given up so much and worked so hard for all the years
that they've been here.  
So for any of us to give anything less than our best out there would be a
disappointment to them.  
  
Q. Stefanie, do you think you guys should be favored in this game? Do you
consider yourself the favorite in this game?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I don't think so. I mean, we can't really think about that,
to be honest. We gotta go into it‑‑ like I was saying before, Louisville is
going to give us a great game. Every team we've played in this tournament has
given us a great and tough game.  
And to go into it thinking that we're the favorites‑‑ I mean, they beat
Baylor. So we gotta go into it knowing how hard they've worked to get to the
point that they are and, like I said, focus on ourselves and just executing
offense, defense, and playing together as a unit.  
  
Q. Geno, you guys are ‑‑ you guys are 7‑0 in title games in your career.
This is the first time that you're here that you haven't won a title a Big
East title beforehand. Does that make this one different in a sense that
there's been sort of nothing accomplished this year as far as championships
that may be goals for the team and now you have a chance to sort of right that
by winning the eighth one?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I mean, I guess that's kind of stuff that when
you guys have to come up with‑‑ but I think we won something like 13 or 14 Big
East championships in a row, and I don't remember anybody at the Final Four
saying, well, you know, you won the regular season and you won the tournament
so that should prime you for the national championship.  
I think what happens‑‑ I've always said this. What happens during the regular
season and what happens in the tournament, you kind of have to put all that
behind you. Winning the Big East championship is a lot harder than winning one
game. Winning the regular season Big East championship is a lot harder than
winning one game. I'm sure if Louisville had to play Baylor four times during
the regular season, it would be a lot harder than playing them one time one
night.  
So tomorrow night Louisville plays Connecticut. What happened leading up to
that I don't think is going to have any bearing whatsoever on that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
At this time we're going to excuse the student‑athletes to go to their
breakout rooms.  
We'll continue with questions for head coach. Start right here.  
  
Q. Geno, do you remember a team that's made a bigger jump mentally, meaning
mindset ‑wise, from the end of a Big East Tournament to the start of the NCAA
Tournament more so than this group has?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Maybe not. Maybe not. There's been other times when we've had
to readjust how we do things, who we are and recalibrate, I guess. I remember
in 2003 and 2004 we lost in the Big East Tournament, one time in the finals
and one time in the semifinals, and after that we had to go back and kind of
switch gears a little bit and ended up coming out and winning the national
championship both of those years.  
But, again, I'm kind of torn about all this, you know, because I know we made
some changes and I know we changed a little bit, but, like I said yesterday‑‑
and I know a lot of you guys weren't here‑‑ we didn't have a ten‑game losing
streak during the season and then we had to like fix everything and then come
in as a 9th seed and shock the world and here we are: Holy shit, how did they
get here? You know?  
We won 30‑some games and we beat the ACC champion by 30, the Big Ten champion
by 30, the Pac‑12 champion by 26, and the Southeast Conference champion by 30.
So we didn't sneak into the tournament. We just had to make a couple
adjustments to how we thought and get a couple kids to kind of step outside
their little world they lived in that was not helping them.  
So in terms of how much we've changed as a team, it looks like a lot on the
outside to what you're seeing, but internally it wasn't that much. It was just
a few little things that had to be adjusted.  
  
Q. Geno, assuming that there was quite an excitement from winning last
night, are you concerned that the beginning tomorrow night may take a little
while to get back to where you should be?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It always does. It always does. The great fallacy in coaching
and in everybody's‑‑ it's just another game. No, it isn't. It's the national
championship game.  
So you can try to spin it any way you want, but for both teams those first
five minutes‑‑ look at last night, the first ten minutes, it was hard to get
anything done.  
It's really, really hard. I think tomorrow it will be the same way. I think
it's going to take both teams a little bit of time to get comfortable. I could
be wrong. One team could just start off like gangbusters. But my experience
has been that it's a hard game to play in early on. You really do need to kind
of let the emotions wear off, and that's going to take a little bit of time
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Geno, the question I try to get Breanna to expand on regarding if she
ever surprises herself, if you had the time to text that answer to her, what
would you have provided her with?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I mean, I think the really good players‑‑ I
think the really good players, they expect to be good. So whatever they do,
they expect it. I think the players that aren't that good‑‑ it's like Shaq in
the commercial when he comes out of the car and he goes, That's like how I
felt when I made two free throws in a row: Wow. That's a lot more than I hoped
for.  
The great players, everything they do, they go like, Uh‑huh. I can do that.
Because that's what makes them really, really good.  
So I'm not surprised that she said, you know, I know I'm a good player so when
I play well I'm not surprised.  
I'm sure that the thing that surprises her, or any of those other really good
players, is when they play terribly. That probably is a shock to their system
more than like, wow, I'm surprised I just did that. I think the opposite is
true.  
  
Q. Coach, what on earth did you think it would take to get Heather Buck into
last night's game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why is that relevant?  
  
Q. I was just asking about last night.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why? I mean, Heather Buck is one our players, so I put her in
when I think it's time to put her in. No sooner, no later.  
  
Q. If you go out and win the championship, what would be the most rewarding
thing for you about this particular team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Hmm. Rewarding for me personally or rewarding for this team?  
  
Q. Both ways, I guess.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Whenever I talk about my team, and especially with my team, I
always talk to them in terms of what I think they can be. So when we got
together in October‑‑ actually when I saw them in September during their
preseason workouts with Amanda Kimball, our strength and conditioning coach,
when I would go watch them in the morning, I remember saying to them: I think
this can be a really special group. You guys have a certain something.  
And I saw it in their workouts, the way they acted, the way they behaved, the
way they competed against each other, how hard they went just, the aura they
had with them.  
And they all made a point to mention it to me almost every other day in the
office. They would come to me and they would say, Coach, this just feels good.
It feels different.  
So when I started to think ahead, I started to think of all the possibilities
that this team would have. And then when things got a little bit out of kilter
a little bit and players didn't develop like I thought they were going to,
there was almost the sense of maybe I was wrong. Maybe what I saw wasn't
really what was true. And I started to privately I started to like go, man, I
hope I didn't overestimate what we have here. And I think some of the other
coaches felt the same way, and we just didn't know what to do to get some of
these guys to shake that little bit of doubt that they had in their minds.  
So what would be most rewarding for me, that it wasn't easy, that they were
able to conquer some things that are hard to conquer, which is mostly in your
mind. And if we're fortunate enough to win tomorrow night, that will probably
be my biggest takeaway from that.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said ‑‑ we've heard you say you can't win championships
without great players.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Uh‑huh.  
  
Q. Well, two of them, Diggins and Brittney Griner, are leaving, and they
have one between them. Can you talk about how hard it really is to do what you
guys have done? Because I think we're starting to see it now.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I always thought that. I always thought that while we
were in that run of, what‑‑ from 2000 to 2010‑‑ what did we win, six
championships? Five? Six? We won six championships in ten years. I always
thought during that run‑‑ I said, you know, someday everybody's going to look
back and go: I can't believe that that actually happened. Because the more
time passes and the more you see how many really good teams come up short, you
start to realize how incredible that was and how hard it is to do.  
And I guess this is a perfect time to address that, that having the best
player in the country or having the two best players in the country‑‑ I don't
thinkthe average person out there understands that this is what makes it so
hard, is that Baylor didn't have to play Louisville in a best‑of‑five series.
We didn't have to play Notre Dame last night and then again tomorrow night and
then two nights later. You only have to win one game in this tournament, and
then you have to win another one, but it's not against the same team. So all
you need is one good night and the other team struggles just a little and it
changes everything.  
So to be able to go through that six‑game stretch in the NCAA Tournament year
after year after year and put yourself in that situation to win it, I want to
say it's more than just great players. But when it comes down to it, nothing
else matters if you don't have great players.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk specifically about Bria and Kaleena of maybe some ‑‑
I don't want to say necessarily ups and downs, maybe that's not fair, but just
some of the struggles both of them have gone through this season and then how
well they're playing now in the most important part of the season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Bria Hartley and Breanna Stewart?  
  
Q. No, Bria Hartley and Kaleena.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh, well, I think Kaleena has been pretty consistent. She's
one of the few players on our team that hasn't been set back by either
injuries or some kind of mental funk or whatever. She's been somewhat
consistent. I can say that pretty much day in and day out for five months
she's been the same.  
Bria Hartley is just playing right now like‑‑ she's not even there yet, but
hopefully tomorrow night she'll get there. But there was a level that Bria
Hartley was playing in September that I had never seen her play before. I
thought she was as good a player as we've ever had in our gym during September
and October. And unfortunately things didn't pan out the way I'd hoped, but
I'm a firm believer that when you're as competitive as Bria Hartley is and
when you want to win as bad as she does, you just figure out way to be ready
for the biggest games. And I don't know who's going to play really well
tomorrow night, but she's going to be one of them.  
  
Q. Geno, you've got a lot of great players that you've talked about over the
years. Is there anyone that you could compare in terms of sacrifice and pain
over five years and perseverance to Caroline?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Probably the closest one would probably be Shea Ralph that I
have had similar experiences. Shea, I think what Shea went through, you know,
talk about somebody that could have won four national championships, the four
teams that Shea was on her four years at Connecticut, at one time during those
four seasons we were the best team in the country. And had Shea been
completely healthy all four of those years, we would have won four national
championships.  
So I don't think anybody's suffered from a physical standpoint more than Shea
Ralph has at the University of Connecticut or sacrificed her body more.  
And with Caroline it's been‑‑ it's been maybe even harder, because with Shea,
even when Shea was hurt, she was one of the best players in the Big East and
maybe in the country.  
With Caroline, her position is different. When she's not a hundred percent,
it's very difficult for her to get the things done that she wants to get done.  
But I know right now she does ‑‑ I think right now I don't think there's
anybody that appreciates being here more than she does.  
I still think back to the one year that she played the entire year when she
was healthy and we went 39‑0 and we didn't have a point guard. It was her and
Tiffany Hayes in the back court and we won a lot of games, and I wish I could
have had that Caroline for the whole four years.  
  
Q. Geno, two ‑parter. First one, what it would mean to win an eighth title
and tie the record tomorrow night that Tennessee holds? And the second part
is: When you guys were here last for the championship, it was the end of the
Taurasi era, winning the third straight in New Orleans. Is this the start of a
new era with, if you do win tomorrow night, Breanna Stewart, who is having the
best season of a freshman ever in an NCAA Tournament?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Talking about things that haven't happened yet is never a good
idea. I think tomorrow night when the game is over, if we don't win, it's a
sad way for Kelly and those guys to graduate. If we do win, it's an amazing
way for Kelly and Caroline and Heather to finish their careers at Connecticut.
And if we do win, it's something that Kaleena Lewis traveled 3,000 miles from
California to go to Connecticut to get. It's why Moriah Jefferson came from
Dallas, Texas, to Connecticut, to get one of those.  
So I think if we're fortunate enough to win tomorrow night, it's the first day
of a new life for those guys. When I wake up Wednesday morning, win or lose
tomorrow, I don't know that my life is gonna be impacted that much. I don't
think it's going to be impacted much. When I go to the Masters Friday, because
my son's down there, that will be impactful.  
  
Q. Coach, Antonita Slaughter on fire from 3 ‑point range yesterday. If you
could talk about the challenge of defending that shot tomorrow and how crucial
that will be in order to win.   
COACH AURIEMMA: I watched that game yesterday, and it's just‑‑ he's got to be
a genius, that guy. Because every time I see that kid catch the ball, she's
wide open. And I can understand if it's the first game of the tournament, but
here they are now in their fifth game in the NCAA Tournament and the kid for
40 minutes is wide open every time she catches it.  
So I'm going to have to watch their films really closely and find out how the
hell he does that, because I want to try to do the same thing with Kaleena
Lewis.  
But she has made more big shots in this tournament than anybody I can remember
in any five‑game stretch.  
So all I can say is if we're there and we have a hand in her face and she
still makes them, then God bless them, they deserve to win.  
  
Q. Geno, what happened to Bria? Did she just lose her confidence? What
happens to a player that's playing in an exceptionally high level and then
seems to really dip like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You have daughters?  
  
Q. One.  
COACH AURIEMMA: One. So you're just asking me that to piss me off, right?
(Laughter). Because I got two of them. And I can't explain the stuff that goes
through their heads.  
Bria Hartley, one of the reasons why she was All‑American last year and one of
the reasons why she's really, really good is she is really, really, really,
really stubborn. Really stubborn. One of her greatest attributes is she's
really determined, and one of her worst attributes is she's stubborn. And
she's so cocky and she believes in herself so much. And one of her problems is
she don't listen to anybody. I mean nobody.  
So when she was hurt, she wouldn't tell anybody. So she kept playing on an
ankle that was bothering her, and then it got to a point where she can't
practice for a month. And during that month she realized how being stubborn
and not wanting to listen to anybody‑‑ how much it cost her.  
And when she came back, she tried to get it all back real quick. And when it
didn't happen for her, she just collapsed. Because she puts so much of her
life into it, she wants it so bad, that when she couldn't have it, it was just
was a killer for her.  
But through it all, you know what happened on the back side of that? At the
end of it all, she's learned how to open up with people, tell them what you
think, listen to what they're saying to you, take everything in, pay
attention, say what's on your mind; don't just sit there, don't think you got
all the answers.  
So that's come out of this; that whatever happens tomorrow night, when next
season starts, there's a whole new Bria Hartley out there now that didn't
exist before all this.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit just about maybe how you've evolved or
how you've been able to continue to reinvent this team year after year after
year, you know, and keep them at the top? What's been the key for you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think as you get to a certain age, it's really, really
important that you have really young assistants, young, energetic, incredibly
focused, driven people on your staff. And Chris Dailey is not as young as Shea
and Marisa, but when he started at Connecticut 28 years ago, Chris and I had
this vision of this is how we're gonna do things.  
With me, it's gotten a little lax. Like I don't have the brain power or the
discipline as much as I did to really kind of embrace that as much as I did
back then.  
Chris Dailey has not wavered one iota from that first week of practice 28
years ago and what our demands are on our team.  
And Shea and Marisa just take it to a whole 'nother level in terms of their‑‑
the energy level that they bring and how incredibly passionate they are about
what they do.  
So because of that, as I've gotten older, I've been able to hang on to all
those things, even though, me personally, it's hard for me to hang on to them
because, you know, my life's changed a little bit, and I've been here and
there the last four years with the Olympic thing.  
But Tonya Cardoza, Jamelle Elliott before them, and Chris, Marisa, and Shea
right now, the things that we think were important 28 years ago, the things
that I thought were important when Shea played, those things are just as
important now, and those three people make sure that it's done the same way.
And every player on our team buys into it, and that's why every year we put
ourselves in the position to be at this point during the season.  
  
Q. Geno, this morning Jeff Walz announced his resignation so that he could
go work for you at your new restaurant. Two questions: One, what do you think
makes him qualified to work for you, and, two, when do you think he'll start
at maître d'?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I heard about that, that he had said that. I ran into Shoni
Schimmel's parents on the way over here, and they said they're all for it and
the Schimmel twins are transferring to Connecticut (laughter). Even though
they're not twins. So that's the plus side of him resigning or retiring.  
He doesn't dress well enough to work in the front room of my restaurant
(laughter), so he'll be bussing dishes and taking out the trash in the back
until he fixes his attitude.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the energy level that Louisville is playing
with right now? You said last night they're playing as if they don't think
they can lose. And, also, can you just explain your relationship with Coach
Walz?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I think that's a fallacy too. I guarantee you
they're not sitting in the their locker room today before practice, today
after practice, whenever they're watching film as a team, they're not sitting
there saying: You know what? Let's just go play tomorrow. We got nothing to
lose. They're not saying that. Because I love playing against teams that say
"We got nothing to lose" because we usually beat them by 50. Because you know
what? You know what's at stake tomorrow? National championship. So those kids
and Jeff and the staff, everybody knows‑‑ we got nothing to lose tomorrow?
Really? You got the national championship to lose tomorrow. They know that. We
know that. Everybody that's watching the game knows that.  
So what's helped Louisville get here is they want to win. I don't think
there's this, well, we're just free and clear; we got nothing to lose. They
want to win. Because when you watch them play, they play to win. They're not
out there going, well, let's just see what happens. And they're not looking to
just hang around and see if they happen to win the game. They're playing to
win, and that's why they're so much fun to watch right now. And I've loved
watching them play. I've watched every one of their games.  
As far as Jeff is concerned, I see a lot of myself in him, being an assistant
coach in a great program like he was, then getting your first opportunity to
be a head coach and all that goes with that.  
When I did it, no one was paying attention. He's doing it in a much bigger
arena where lights are a lot brighter. When he started at Louisville and what
he's done there in a short period of time‑‑ how many years he's been there?
Six? You look around the country, who's done a better job than him in six
years? I don't think anybody. I don't think there's another coach in America
that's accomplished as much as he has from where they started in the last six
year than he has.  
And I've tried to‑‑ we spent a lot of time together at the Big East meetings.
And I've tried to help him out a little bit. I told him‑‑ I said, You're so
inexperienced, you don't even know how to get a technical. You say the wrong
things. And I gave him a couple pointers on how to really get technicals. And
he's taken me up on it, and pretty much every time we play them he gets one
just to prove to me that he's a good learner.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit more about the defensive game plan for
tomorrow night, please?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why, are you related to Jeff (laughter)?  
  
Q. No, I'm with Louisville. I'm just looking at ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're with Louisville and you want me to tell you what
thedefensive game plan is?  
  
Q. I'm with the Louisville media. I mean, I'm not ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh. Oh. I'm just funning with you. That's what they say down
South, right, funning? Yeah.  
Well, I've gotten a lot text messages from a lot of my friends in coaching,
and they all seem to start with: Yo, tomorrow night get a hand up.  
So one of our strategies tomorrow night is every time one of those guys
catches the ball on the perimeter, we're going to get a hand up.  
They're really hard to defend. They really are. I don't know exactly what's
going to happen tomorrow night, but I'll make you one prediction. At some
point during the game Shoni Schimmel will make a shot that you will think
she's closer to our basket than she is to theirs, because she does that all
the time against us. She makes shots from ridiculous places against us. And
there are things that Louisville does that you just can't defend. Because
that's just what they do.  
I'm more impressed and more amazed watching them defensively. I thought Jeff
came up with the perfect strategy when they were playing either Baylor or
Tennessee, I'm not sure, when the sideline reporter asked him about what
defense they're running in defense, and he said I have no idea. He said: I
have no idea. I have no idea what they're doing. I don't have any idea what
defense we're in. He goes: And I guess that's good, because if I don't know
what they're doing, then the other team can't figure out what they're doing,
so we're going to stay in it.  
So if they play that defense tomorrow night, we're going to be in big trouble.  
  
Q. Coach, my question was going to be about their defense. Obviously you've
beaten them in the past, but how concerned are you about the different
defenses they play ‑‑ which some coaches call it junk defense‑‑ and your
team's ability to handle it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: He's always got something up his sleeve. I remember the first
time we played them he had his team line up and go the wrong way coming out of
halftime so that we would shoot at the wrong basket. Who does that in a
college game? That's something you do in CYO, right?  
So he had his team line up and go the wrong way, and all my Phi Beta Kappas,
they all went with him. And luckily the ref went, Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
supposed to go that way. He was so pissed because he had us and the ref
stopped it.  
So he's always coming up with something. He's always got something that's a
little unconventional.  
So we're not‑‑ our team doesn't‑‑ we don't try to figure out like every little
thing that you're doing and then have something for every little thing you're
doing. So with the 30‑second shot clock you don't have the ability to come
down and go: I think they're in. Wait, no they're not.  
So we just have a plan of attack, and we attack it. And whatever it is that
they're doing, that's fine. We'll make adjustments as we're moving through the
thing. Because in the end every defense is the same. Every defense is the
same. It might start out looking a little bit different, it might take a
different shape or form at the beginning, but after one or two passes, every
defense is the same.  
  
Q. Geno, will Kelly leave as one of your favorite all ‑time players? And who
would she likely to be guarding tomorrow?   
COACH AURIEMMA: That's a good question, who she will be guarding tomorrow
night. We've kind of varied that recently, like we did last night. Just move
around a little bit.  
Will she leave as one of my favorite players? Absolutely. Absolutely. I think
she's going to leave as a lot of people's favorite player. Kelly's a product
of her environment, her family, where she grew up. If somebody said, hey,
where is Kelly Faris from? Miami Beach. You would say, No, she's not. Where's
she from? Anaheim Hills. No, she's not. She's from Indiana. Yeah, she looks
like an Indiana kid. She looks like a kid from a basketball‑crazy state who
just loves to play basketball, who plays just for the love of the game.  
And I don't think there's that much of that anymore. And she's touched a lot
of people's lives up in Connecticut for sure.  
  
Q. Geno, you mentioned how the spotlight has gotten a little bigger on
women's basketball lately. You look big picture, it seems ‑‑ from the
President doing a bracket on the women's side now and the Vice President going
to the Final Four a couple years ago and obviously supporting Delaware in
their run lately and you have a great relationship with the governor of
Connecticut, is it because some of them have daughters and they're following
more? It just seems pretty neat that some of the top politicians in the
country are big women's basketball fans it seems.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, they're the future minivan voters, you know, soccer
moms. And everybody's looking for that vote, so maybe they're hedging their
bets down the road.  
One of the few audiences that we don't have is that audience that all the
advertisers really, really, really aspire to get, I guess, that 18‑ to 35
year‑old guy who buys trucks and Miller Lite and Bud Light and all that good
stuff. We don't have that audience probably.  
The audience that we do have is when those guys get a little bit older and
they have daughters, then we get them to become women's basketball fans. And
that's something that I think we have to keep doing a better job of growing
our fan base.  
Can we ever attract that 18 to 35? I don't know. I don't know. But the fan
base that we do have, I think we have to do more to strengthen it. We have to
do more to make them more passionate about it. Because as you mentioned, when
they do get involved with the game for whatever reason, they kind of‑‑ they
enjoy it. They enjoy the experience. They enjoy the attachment to the game.
And I think we always have to be mindful of what we're going to do to
strengthen that.  
  
Q. You pretty well answered this question on Kelly a while ago, but Doris
Burke the other day said she represented the heart and soul of the team as
much as anyone she can ever remember playing at UConn. Can you give a couple
of examples of that?  
And last night, the sequence where she got the three offensive rebounds and
then at the end of the first half too, is that what she is‑‑ does that sum her
up?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't‑‑ you know, normally when you talk about players
that have hadgreat, great careers at Connecticut, you can identify them by
something that was great, a great skill that they had.  
And I think Kelly is one of the few players that have come through our program
that when she leaves, they're never going to introduce her as, That was Kelly
Faris; she was a great passer, or she was a great shooter, or she was a great
ball handler.  
For Kelly, it's more‑‑ those three rebounds yesterday, they're indicative of
what Kelly is great at. Kelly is great at putting you in a position to win.
That's what she's great at.  
We had no business last year in the semifinal of even having a chance to win
that game against Notre Dame, and in the last two minutes she just
single‑handedly put us in a position to win that game. She's done that so many
times that I can't even count them.  
So when she leaves Connecticut and people ask me, you know, Who's one of the
best players you've ever had at Connecticut, and I say, Kelly Faris, they'll
say, Why? She was great at making sure we were in position to win every night.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're welcome.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

Louisville  64  
Cal - 57

  
MODERATOR: Joining us from Louisville, head coach Jeff Walz and
student‑athletes Shoni Schimmel, Bria Smith, and Antonita Slaughter.  
We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Walz and then take questions
for the student‑athletes.  
COACH WALZ: Well, first off, I'd just like to congratulate Cal and Lindsay on
a fantastic season. She's a first‑class person. I consider her a friend in
this profession, and I have the utmost respect for what she's done. And I wish
her and her program‑‑ she can continue to build it and grow it and nothing but
success.  
From our end, we got one more game. I told the kids they're stuck with me in
practice for one more day. So it's just‑‑ it's a remarkable group of young
ladies. I'm proud of every single one of them.  
And can't even put into words how proud I am for the adversity that we faced
this entire season with our injuries. Tonight we're down 10 at half, we come
out, we execute perfect to start the second half. We scored I think the first
five, and then we just chipped away and chipped away and chipped away. And we
run a play at the end there, Sara Hammond gets a layup, gets fouled, and we
finally take our first lead.  
And once we took the lead, I knew‑‑ I could see it in our kids' eyes, the
excitement that, hey, we can do this, we're gonna do this. And, like I said,
I'm proud of them.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Antonita, talk about how you were feeling when you got the ball. You were
obviously very comfortable shooting. What gave you the hot hand tonight?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: I just think when I shoot the ball I know that my
teammates have confidence in me, so that gives me confidence within myself.  
  
Q. Bria, there was a moment where it seems like the turnovers for you
personally were piling up, and Coach kind of got into your face a little bit
but also consoled you for a little bit. Kind of what was that conversation
like?  
BRIA SMITH: Well, he basically was telling me‑‑ he was telling me how I needed
to slow down and I needed to stop occupying the ball so much and we got here
by playing team basketball. And we kind of got out of that for a while. So
just to pass the ball more around and get back into the way that we play.  
  
Q. Antonita, you've been one of the team's best shooters from a marksmanship
standpoint most of the season. Went through a little bit of a downturn, maybe
had shooting problems there at the end, had a great game against Baylor, a
little bit quiet against Tennessee, and then really blossomed tonight. Was
there something in particular you did mentally or any other way, tied your
shoes a certain way or whatever, to sort of like get in the right mindset and
bring out the confidence in this game?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: No, it just all comes with repetition. When I was down, I
just keptafter practice just staying after a little later and shooting more.  
And, like I said, I know my team has confidence in me and they want me to
continue to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. Shoni, I ask this question part serious and part fun, okay? Your parents
said they would marry if you beat Baylor. What do you think they might be
saying or will say if you beat ‑‑ if you beat whoever wins the second game?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I don't know. She's up here telling me her brother (laughter).
But we'll see. I don't know. Thing going around is tattoos, so I might make
them tattoo something. Our assistant coach, Samantha Williams, is getting a
tattoo of a cardinal bird soon, so if we keep winning, I heard Coach Walz is
going to get one, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Just can you guys talk about your excitement level to getting to this
point, just how unbelievable this journey has been for you guys?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It doesn't feel realistic right now. It hasn't set in yet.
We're playing in a national championship in a couple days. It's just so
exciting and we've worked so hard to get here, and just like we're ready to
take on anything.  
We've gone through so much adversity through this year, and we're ready to
take on anything. And if that means the national championship, here we come.  
BRIA SMITH: To add on to what Shoni said, this is literally every basketball
player's dream, to be in a national championship. So it feels unreal, but I
think we're ready for it.  
  
Q. Bria, in Oklahoma City I think you guys trailed a total of seven seconds,
and that was at the end of the Baylor game. How were you guys able to mentally
regroup after being down at 10 at half time?  
BRIA SMITH: Just the confidence that Coach has in us and him coming in at
halftime saying that we really couldn't have played any worse the first half;
we weren't playing the basketball that we're used to playing. So just to get
back into what we're used to doing.  
And he had a great play set up for the first play of the game for us‑‑ I mean
of the second half for us. And just building up momentum from scoring and
getting stops on defense really helped us.  
  
Q. Shoni, your defense really tightened up on them in the second half. You
can see they were having trouble with that little 1 ‑3‑1 trap. What did you do
differently to slow them down in the second half?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We just didn't let them get the ball where they wanted to be.
Our coaches knew exactly their scout, so they told us what to do and when to
do it. We didn't really follow the scout report the first half, but we
listened the second half because we didn't want to lose and we weren't going
to be down the rest of the game.  
So just listening to our coaches and executing our game plan is what really
got our defense going.  
  
Q. Shoni, the defense Cal played on you in the first half, can you talk
about that seemed pretty tough and were you getting frustrated?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It's frustrating to be able to have someone right there in
your face the whole time, but we came together as a team and we gathered
ourselves and we did what we needed to do, and that was to go out there and
win. And we did it as a team, and I couldn't be any more happier.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Coach, you flipped the switch for the second half. Schematically what did
do you different when you came out of the locker room?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we really didn't try and change a whole bunch. We did come
out and play some man. But what happened was we finally started to get a
little more patient at the offensive end. We came out, we executed our first
play perfect. Shoni gets a three. We come down the floor, we run our second
set, the second play. Bria Smith‑‑ I believe Bria hits a jump shot.  
We really‑‑ it was probably one of the poorest defensive efforts we've had in
terms of following the scout and being mentally prepared. When we came out in
second half we were in man and I wanted to a double on ball screen, and we
never doubled in our ball screen one time the entire night. And that's the
part that I kept telling them, you know, give me chance to coach. Double the
ball screen so I can at least see what's going to happen and then we can make
an adjustment.  
But I think what happened was we finally started to rebound the ball a little
bit better. Because they were just abusing us on second‑chance points in the
first half. I believe they had 10, and then in the second half they end up
with 4. So we did a better job of staying between them and the ball, but we
scored. We found a way to score. And I told our kids before the game started.
I mean, our goal was to try and score 60 tonight and we end up with 64.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how good this town has been to the University
of Louisville in the last three months.  
COACH WALZ: It's been pretty good. I'll go back‑‑ last year, I know our men
didn't win in the Final Four down here, but just to get down here to play in
the Final Four. You've got your men's program playing in the Final Four, New
Orleans football team wins the Sugar Bowl here, and now we're going to have a
chance Tuesday night to play for a national championship. Been pretty good.
I'll come back and visit.  
  
Q. Coach, you brought Hammond back in with about 8:39 left in the second
half with four fouls. Just since she was a huge factor down the stretch, just
talk about that decision ‑making process there.   
COACH WALZ: Well, it got to a point where‑‑ she's one of our better post
players, and if you're going to win, you've got to have your best players on
the floor. And that's something that I truly believe in. And I said, hey, if
she's going to foul out, she's going to foul out, but I'm not going to keep
her over here for last four minutes of the game.  
My thought was if we can get this last 8 from her, we're going to. And I
thought she did a great job. I mean, she made a few big‑time moves. She caught
and finished for us. She goes 3 of 3 from the free throw line, and I believe
two of them were and‑ones. So just really, really pleased with how Sara
responded.  
  
Q. Coach, were you concerned at all the way they were defending Shoni, and
did you do anything at half time to try and figure out how to spring her?  
COACH WALZ: No. What I told them was we've got to stop dribbling the ball. I
mean, that's all we did was dribble dribble, dribble. I thought they were all
trying to check the air. I'm like, guys, the officials did that before the
game. You're okay.  
And it's all they did. We occupied the ball. It was one person after another.
It wasn't anybody trying to be selfish, but they just kept pounding it into
the ground, and I finally said we don't have a chance to win if you keep
dribbling the thing. You've got to pass. You've got to get it up the floor to
pass. You've got to rip it through in a triple‑threat position and play off
the pass instead of off the dribble the entire night.  
And we finally did a much better job of that in the second half. Antonita
Slaughter‑‑ we ended up with 12 assists on the night, and I think we had three
or four at half. And I think that shows how much of a better job we did.  
  
Q. Jeff, taking the cue from Shoni, if you win Tuesday, what will your
tattoo say?  
COACH WALZ: I'm just going to take a pen and stick it on my rear end and call
it a tattoo. She don't have to know any better. You know, like they‑‑ see,
they're youngsters. You can sit there and tell them you're going to get a
tattoo, and that's great. To me a little dot is a tattoo. So that's what I'm
planning on doing. Please don't tell them. (Laughter). Okay. Because she's
expecting something big.  
We're just thrilled to be here. It's like I said in my opening statement, I
thought when the year started, when we came into June, July, I really‑‑ I was
excited about this ball club. I was excited about our depth. I was excited
about our returners, our freshman. I thought we're going to have a chance to
be really good. And then all of a sudden it's one kid after another after
another. And you just have to roll with it.  
The biggest problem in college athletics in my opinion is everybody lives in
the moment. I mean, we lose to UK in December, you think the world's going to
come to an end. It's just awful. And I'm like, hey, it's one game. That's the
way I approach them all: It's one game.  
Now, once you get in the NCAA tournament, it's not one game because when you
lose you're done. But back in December, it is what it is. They had an
unbelievable year, UK did. I think they would be willing to say, hey, we'll
trade. You can win that game and we'll come here and play for a national
championship on Tuesday.  
Everybody gets caught up in the moment during the regular season. And we went
through some growing pains. We went through some adjustments. We went to try
and figure out who can be where, who can play what, and we finally got things
going. This is my sixth year here, and I'd say five of those six except for
the year we were 14 and 18, which we were decimated with injuries that year
too, we're playing our best basketball at the end of the year. And that's all
that matters.  
I keep telling people we're not in the NBA. We don't have to play the best
four out of seven. It's the one game, one night. And we're figuring out a way
to pull them out and win and play well at the right time.  
  
Q. Coach, not to slight your players' ability or anything, but is, to a
certain extent, attitude, bravado, confidence carrying your team through?
You've knocked off some very talented big ‑name teams. Is that what you're
going to need a little bit Tuesday night? Are you playing a little bit above
yourself right now?  
COACH WALZ: You know what? I wouldn't necessarily say we're playing above
ourselves. We're playing as a team. The great thing about us, you look at our
roster‑‑ I mean our scoring tonight, Sara Hammond gets 9, Antonita gets 18,
Bria gets 17, Shoni gets 10 and Jude gets 9. We're sitting there with five
kids in double figures for the most part.  
You've gotta guard everybody on our team. That's where our lack of depth comes
in. But we've figured out a way to get to the last game of the year without
it. So I don't thinkeither of these teams we play on Tuesday are going to care
that we don't have a bunch of depth to put in.  
But if we can get the ones we have healthy to play their best basketball on
Tuesday night, then we're going to have a chance to win a national
championship.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously no matter who comes through tonight, it's gonna be all
Big East, you know, finals. What's that say about this conference? And also,
then, how do you guys overcome maybe the season? How do you reconcile what
happened during the regular season with these two teams and get your team to
overcome?  
COACH WALZ: I don't even remember playing them. I mean, it's one game now. We
aren't concerned about that. We figured out a way to beat some really good
basketball teams. But we do have‑‑ one of these two are going to win here
tonight, and they're special. They're very talented, well‑coached basketball
teams with some great players on both sides.  
We're going to enjoy this tonight. We're going to enjoy it. We're going to go
on Bourbon Street. I'll tell the kids as long as their back by two, we're
okay. (Laughter). I mean, everybody is saying you gotta get the kids to bed.
No, we don't either. We're going to enjoy it. We're getting a chance to play
for a national championship, so when we get to halftime, we're gonna head out
of here, we're gonna let them go back to the hotel, go out with their
families, get something to eat. And it might not be 2. It might be 1:30. But
I'll have curfew for them and then we'll get prepared starting tomorrow.  
  
Q. I just got here so I'm probably going to ask yousomething you've already
been asked. Talk about Cal, what they did well in the first half and what you
guys had to do in the second half to do what you did.  
COACH WALZ: I think Cal's fantastic. I'm so impressed with what Lindsay has
done with her team, how hard they play.  
We allowed them too many offensive rebounds in the first half. We allowed them
too many points in transition. And then we just dribbled the ball, dribbled
the ball, dribbled the ball. I mean, it wasn't very pretty.  
In the second half, we talked about sharing the basketball with the pass
instead of the dribble the entire time. We tried to mix it up a little more on
defense. We played a little man, we played a little zone. We played a little
zone starting off, switched into man.  
But the bottom line is we finally did a better job of keeping them off the
glass. And when they did get an offensive rebound, they were long offensive
rebounds. They weren't able to just go back up and score.  
I've seen some post players that rebound the basketball, but Caldwell and
Brandon are phenomenal offensive rebounders. They're hard to keep off the
glass. But we figured out a way to do that, and that's why we were able to
finally get something going at the offensive end.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.  
  
Q. Your men obviously are burning it up in Atlanta, and I know that you said
after the Baylor game that your team had been watching the men play in the
locker room. How much is your team feeding off the success that the men had?
And are the men following you and giving any support and love back to the
women?  
COACH WALZ: I mean, the way I look at it, I think the men are trying to feed
off of our success. They've just had a so‑so year this year and they just
happen to be playing well at the end. No. I mean, we're huge supporters of
each other.  
Our athletic director came to me and said, hey, the men's team was in the
hotel lobby jumping up and down and cheering for us. I've gotten a text from
Rick already congratulating us and telling me to tell the players what an
unbelievable job they did. And it's special. I'm very fortunate, very
fortunate to have a men's coach, as high profile as he is, to really genuinely
care about the women's program. It speaks volumes for him, speaks volumes for
his program.  
And the players are the same way. The players have been already texting my
players. And that's what it's about. That's what our entire athletic
department is about. We also support each other. I've gotten the softball
coach, baseball coach, swimming coach, track, everybody has sent a
congratulations text. They're so happy for us.  
And that's what we do. That's why our athletic department is as strong as it
is. So we will be cheering on the men tomorrow night loud.  
MODERATOR: Thank you coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 7, 2013

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  83  
Notre Dame  65

  
MODERATOR: Joining us on stage from Notre Dame are head coach Muffet McGraw
and student‑athletes Skylar Diggins and Kayla McBride.  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm just so proud of this team and what we accomplished this
year and hate for it to end on a game like this when we just‑‑ just played so
poorly.  
I thought Breanna Stewart was fantastic. She was just unbelievable. I think
her and Lewis, obviously, just they killed us. And we contained everybody
else, but we did not have an answer for them.  
And defensively it's probably the most disappointing. I know we can miss
shots, but I felt we could play better defensively. And that was a
disappointing way for this really wonderful season to end.  
But we will try to think back on what we did to get here and be proud of that.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. This question is directed to Skylar. You were not able to get a shooting
rhythm, for whatever reason. Was your concentration then leaning more to
getting your teammates involved and also playing defense, particularly the two
blocked shots, you know, the defensive standard there? So those are the two
questions to Skylar.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yes, it was. My focus was on defense and trying to distribute.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you just talk a little bit about your legacy and just the
entire Notre Dame experience.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, it's been a dream come true, just having an opportunity
to play for my hometown school and right in my backyard for Coach McGraw and
just being able to learn from her every day. Just experiences I've gone
through I'll never forget. The people that I met I'll never forget. And it was
just such and great time. I had a great time going through it. And I wouldn't
want a different group of girls in the locker room, I wouldn't want a
different group of coaches.  
And just the people I've met, I know they will be a part of my circle for
life. And that's just a blessing in itself.  
  
Q. Kayla, the full first ten minutes of the game you guys were 2 for 24 as a
team. Was it the pressure of their defense or were you just missing makeable
shots?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: Give her a second. I'll take a question. Yeah, can you repeat
it? I thought we were‑‑  
  
Q. You got off to ‑‑ I think it was 2 for the first 24. Was it the pressure
of their defense or were you missing makeable shots?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I thought it was a little bit of both. They did a great job of
getting up and pressuring us, and I thought that we got some shots we wanted
at the beginning of the game, some layups and some jumpers that we usually
knock down.  
It was a physical game tonight. I thought it was a little bit of both. You
have to credit their defense and the pressure, making us take quick shots. But
I thought we did get some shots that we wanted and usually knock down.  
  
Q. Skylar, I think you guys had a 26, 25 lead, Lewis went out about 2:55
left, and then they went on a 14 ‑to‑3 run to close the first half. What
happened there?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We just didn't play good defense. And they got out in
transition and they scored in half‑court offense too. We didn't lock down on
defense like we normally do. We just weren't playing like ourselves.  
And, like I said, you have to credit them. They're such a good team, they know
each other so well, and they outworked us.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you share with us a little bit about what Geno said to you
after the game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: He just said don't let this game define my legacy. He told me
that he feels like I've done more for the sport than some people who won four
national championships. And he just told me that I've done a lot for the game
of basketball and I had a great career.  
MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I just want to say thank you to all the fans and the city of
South Bend for the support. Thank you, thank you.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, that first 15 minutes you guys couldn't hit anything, yet still a
one ‑point game. I gotta think you were thinking, okay, we're going to hit
shots, eventually things are going to fall, we survived their defensive stop.
What was the difference that got them going that you guys just couldn't really
get anything going offensively all night?  
COACH MCGRAW: I didn't feel good about it because we weren't executing
anything. We weren't running our stuff. So we couldn't even feel good about
that. We couldn't feel good about, oh, we got a great shot, we just didn't
make it.  
I thought we forced some things and overdribbled a little bit. We're a really
good passing team, and I don't think we moved the ball. We missed some people
that were open.  
And so I don't think we got that confidence from executing.  
  
Q. How does Skylar's legacy, her impact, affect next year's team, teams
after that?  
COACH MCGRAW: She leaves a gigantic hole in the lineup. I don't think any one
person can replace her. I think that there's a lot of pressure on our incoming
point guard to be good right away.  
And I think the rest of the team has to step up a little bit more and realize
what we've lost. I think that the swagger and the confidence that she
brought‑‑ I hope that somebody can step up and replace that.  
  
Q. Muffet, obviously the game is disappointing, but I know how close you are
with Skylar. I wonder if it's just disappointing ‑‑ or how disappointing is it
to see her up here not to get to where I think she ultimately wanted to be?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think she's a champion. I do. I know we didn't win it, but
what she has done for us has been amazing and she's leaves Notre Dame as the
most celebrated and decorated and best player ever, and I'm happy for that.  
  
Q. Muffet, you've played so assuredly all through the season, but especially
in those games against UConn. Was it just maybe the importance of the moment
or nerves? Is there any way to explain how poorly you shot tonight? It wasn't
all defense, I don't think.  
COACH MCGRAW: No, I thought we looked nervous. I did think we looked nervous
coming out. And I think‑‑ I don't know why we did. We've been here before, and
we certainly should have felt differently. And I don't know. I think the way
the game went early on, I just don't think we ever got into that rhythm where
we could get comfortable, and so I think we were just a little on edge the
whole time. And then all of a sudden we're down 10. And we just got in a giant
hole at halftime, and the that really I thought was the difference in the
game.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on it a little bit in your opening, Breanna Stewart
was amazing tonight. How good was she considering she's a freshman under the
big spotlight? How impressive is that to you?  
COACH MCGRAW: It is really impressive to have a freshman have that kind of
game, to be Most Outstanding Player in the Regional and then to come into the
Final Four and just play with such confidence to be the best player on the
floor‑‑ well, on the team for Connecticut. You don't expect a freshman to rise
to the occasion like that. So I thought a phenomenal performance by her.  
  
Q. Muffet, did you say anything to Skylar, at least one ‑on‑one after the
game? Or there's obviously going to be time for that heading forward, but I
wonder if you, as Geno did, said something to her?  
COACH MCGRAW: No. We talked to the group in general and then came down here.  
MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you.

### [Layshia Clarendon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23447)

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

Louisville  64  
Cal - 57

  
MODERATOR: Joining us now from Cal, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb and
student‑athletes Layshia Clarendon and Talia Caldwell.  
We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Gottlieb, and then we'll take
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I credit Louisville, who obviously has been really hot and
they outplayed us in the second half and did enough of the things that they do
well to win the basketball game.  
What I said to our team in the locker room is that we can be disappointed
about a half a basketball that we wish we had back. We could be disappointed
to not be playing on Tuesday night because we really wanted to be playing on
Tuesday night.  
But I'm going to think about that for two minutes, and for the next 10,000
minutes I'm going to think about what this group did for the University of
California, I think forever the legacy they will have left from this year;
that when you come to Cal, you play for the person next to you, you play with
a lot of character, you work really hard, that you make the name on the front
of your chest the most important thing even if you're really, really talented.  
And I'm just so grateful that we got to play into the second to last possible
day you could be playing a game. And we had a pregame meal today and we got to
do walk‑through and all of the stuff just being together, and I'm really sad
that we're not doing that on Tuesday night, but that I wouldn't trade this
team for anything, even though we're disappointed about a half, and I think
our seniors set that tone, and I think the whole team did that this year. And
we're going to fight really hard for it‑‑ to keep it that way because of
Layshia and Talia and Eliza and Tierra and what whole group did this year.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. To Layshia, from your perspective, where was the game lost from what you
could gather?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think maybe midway through the second half. It's hard,
the game's so fast, but there was a stretch where they were really throwing a
lot of junk at us, and 19 turnovers is high for us. We just turned the ball
over. We were kind of getting lost and they were making a lot of baskets,
picking up momentum.  
So I think we just‑‑ the turnovers killed us a little bit and they kind of
took momentum. But like Lindsay was saying in the locker room, we were still
up 6 points; we still had a chance to win the game even though we were not
playing our best basketball.  
So just I think the turnovers and there was kind of a shift and they hit some
shots and got momentum.  
  
Q. Talia, what changed inside in the second half?  
TALIA CALDWELL: I think the junk defenses and we had to mix up things and‑‑ I
don't know. We just didn't get our hand on a lot offensive rebounds we
normally do, kind of bounced off, a little sloppiness inside. Yeah.  
  
Q. Layshia, could you walk us through the last two minutes, because you were
shooting upwards of 67 percent at points during the first half, and then
during those last two minutes it seemed liked you couldn't buy a basket. Did
things just go cold or was it something specifically they were doing on
defense? And from the perspective of a player on the floor, could you just run
us through those last couple minutes?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think, for one, we weren't getting stops on defense. So a
lot of the first half I think you guys saw us get out, we got to run a lot.
The second half they were scoring so much we had to ‑‑ our pace really slowed
down, we had to go against their press, kind of work in every single time, and
it seemed like we were shooting really low at the shot clock because it took
us so long to get down there.  
And the last two minutes, I think a little panicked. I think we just didn't
get the ball inside as much. And maybe credit to them, throwing the traps,
kind of getting us rattled, getting us back on our feet a little bit.  
Definitely their press and their defense we didn't get a chance to run at all
because we weren't getting stops.  
  
Q. Layshia, could you ‑‑ you gathered the team and spoke‑‑ it looked like
you were speaking to them at the end of the game when you were huddled
together. Can you just share with us your feelings and if you're able to, like
your coach, put what this teams has accomplished in perspective, or is it too
painful right now?   
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I can do it. I told them: Don't hang your head for one
second. Not for one second. Because we've just come to far, done too much.
That was my biggest thing.  
And like Lindsay said, two minutes, it's hard to let it go. It's going to hit
you maybe now, maybe later on the plane, maybe when you get back. It's going
to hurt definitely because we new there was mistakes. It wasn't like we just
played someone who's flat‑out better and just literally beat us. We made a lot
of mistakes ourselves. So that's where the hurt kind of comes in.  
But there's‑‑ just when you look at this team, you think about this team, I
just can't help but smile because what we've done is beyond amazing. Like she
said, we've affected so many people and just to see all the good that's come
out of it, all the positive, all the love, and, like she said, the legacy
we're going to leave.  
And I think it's another positive note that we weren't just some Cinderella
team who made a run this year. Like this is what Cal basketball is going to
be, like we set out to make this program known. And I think that's one thing
we've done, and we've done it from a point of love, loving each other, from
the point of having fun or from the point of dancing.  
So when you look back and see that's a legacy you left, yes, it hurts to lose,
but like that's pretty awesome. I don't think a lot of people get to do that.  
  
Q. Talia, can you talk about the last couple minutes? You guys these last
few games, South Florida, the Georgia game where you might not have been up or
you were in a bad spot and you guys kind of played through it and managed to
pull it out, were you feeling ‑‑ even when you look up at the scoreboard and
you're down by 3 with 30 seconds left, were you feeling like you guys were
going to pull this out?  
TALIA CALDWELL: Definitely. I had complete faith that one of those three were
going to go in every time, even when Mik shot the second one, I thought,
That's going in.  
The whole bench, we always believe in whoever is out on that court. So, yeah,
it never was like the game was over. We were like, okay, as long as there's a
second on the clock, even Brittany Boyd pushing it at the end, we're going to
keep fighting.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for head coach Lindsay Gottlieb.  
  
Q. Lindsay, could you go over the various hurts that Brittany had during the
game? Seemed like a back and then a hand. What was going on with her?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Her back tightened up at one point. She got some treatment on
it. And then she jammed her finger pretty badly. I don't know if it's broken
or not, but kind of got the finger caught on a play underneath the basket.  
  
Q. Lindsay, could you talk about the differences in the halves? Seems in the
first half in terms of rebounds, points in the paint, everything was going
your way. And your inside game obviously wasn't as effective in the second
half.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Sure. So when I said I'm only going to think about the game
for two minutes, that was kind of a lie (laughter).  
Maybe every single play, two minutes each I'll think about.  
It's interesting, like a stat sheet doesn't always tell the story of the game,
but I think this one does. We didn't score in the second half. They totally
affected our pace. We had a hard time‑‑ we shot like 60 percent in the first
half, and we had a hard time breaking them down and getting the looks we
wanted in the second half, and so then we didn't get inside touches.  
I thought we tried to go to the boards just as strong the second half. I don't
know if there was some kind of foul calls early on that that sort of changed
the tone of it. And I didn't know that we were doing anything differently, but
it felt a little different.  
And off of our inability to score they got some good open looks in transition.
They made some nice adjustments, moving Slaughter to the 4 at one point. And
then when they would score, we had a hard time attacking their presses cleanly
as we would have liked to.  
  
Q. Coach, you'd mentioned just a few seconds ago Slaughter. Do you care to
elaborate at all on just how she did? I think her stats kind of stand out
there.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Sure. Any time you shoot 60 percent from 3 and hit six of
them, it has a huge impact on the game.  
When I say the stat sheet kind of tells the story, they did what they do a
little bit better than we do what we do. All the kind of categories play out
the way you thought they might. We got 17 offensive rebounds and turned that
into 14 second‑chance points. We had 32 paint points to their 18.  
But we committed 19 turnovers and they scored 22 off of our turnovers, and
they made eight 3s, six by Slaughter.  
So the stat categories are all exactly how you thought they could be if you
were analyzing the game beforehand. They just did their thing in the second
half a little bit better than we did our thing in the first half. And we
couldn't‑‑ even then we could have made a play or two or gotten a stop or two
at the end and still won the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision to bring Mikayla to shoot those 3
‑pointers? Obviously she hadn't been in the game.   
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah. So with 30 seconds to go we were down 3, and we
definitely weren't saying we have to go for a 3. But we really wanted to run a
play that gave multiple options. I wanted to the ball in Layshia's hands, I
wanted Layshia to be either the creator, the decision‑maker, the shot maker,
one of those things.  
And we have a play that is kind of an end‑of‑game situation play that gives
multiple looks at 3s, but the only looks aren't 3s. And it kind of made that
decision to say, all right, we'll put one more 3‑point shooter out there
simply because we weren't getting low‑block touches. It's not like I could
have said, okay, let's go right to the block with Gray, Gen, or Talia. That
wasn't really‑‑ they weren't making that readily available. So we put the
extra 3‑point shooter out there to maybe extended the defense, and I thought
our best look still might be Layshia to the rim. But it kind of gave that
option.  
They did a really good job off the first on‑ball with Layshia to kind of step
it up and then came off of a flare and then it was going to go back to Layshia
on the other side, but two people went with Layshia, and Mikayla ended up with
wide‑open look. I mean, I'll take that look.  
  
Q. Lindsay, as soon as the half started, you guys had a couple turnovers and
they went back down and they hit a couple shots and all of a sudden you go
from 10 to 5. Was that a concern as you get things ‑‑ as things started?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely. I thought we had pretty good luck early on. Talia
got the ball, could have finished, maybe got fouled, wasn't called. I thought
we should have gone up 12 right then. Then they come right back down, hit a 3.
So all of a sudden it's 7 instead of 12 in my mind and I think we turned it
over again and they scored.  
Sure. It's set the tone. You always want to start out‑‑ well, that being said,
it was a concern, but I didn't feel like we couldn't counter‑punch. But it was
not a very good start to the second half.  
  
Q. Lindsay, mentioning the stat sheet, does that include your free ‑throw
performance? All season long you've been a mediocre free‑throw shooting team.
Is this an example where it really caught up with you do you think or not?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: The free throw thing that sticks out the most is that they
took 19 free throws and we took seven. And usually by the way that we play we
get to the free‑throw line a whole lot more. Now, it might even out because we
don't make as many as the opponent in terms of the point differential, but the
thing that jumps out to me the most is, yeah, 1‑for‑7 is a terrible
percentage, but more so that we go to the free‑throw line seven times and the
opponent goes 19. That's just what is uncharacteristic of us.  
  
Q. Lindsay, the fouls really seemed to pick up in the second half. Did that
affect how you would have liked to have used your personnel, especially when
people had three and four fouls?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Didn't affect the rhythm of the game. I thought we‑‑ letting
them score affected the rhythm, I thought our kind of inability to sort of
push the tempo the way that we did really affected the rhythm, and I thought
that there was a whistle like all the time affected the rhythm of the game.  
I didn't think there was necessarily one chunk of time where we were like, oh,
we have to sit a particular player for a long, long time. So in that sense.
But I definitely feel like it ended up being a factor in the second half, just
in terms of how it played out.  
MODERATOR: Great. Thank you, Coach.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 7, 2013

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kelly Faris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21810)

### [Breanna Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25344)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  

UConn  83  
Notre Dame  65

  
MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut are head coach Geno Auriemma and
student‑athletes Breanna Stewart and Kelly Faris.  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Auriemma and then questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I'm glad it didn't come down to the last minute
(laughter). So I was praying for that because I didn't want to screw it up
again and I didn't want my guys to screw it up again. So we're thrilled about
that.  
I said this to Rebecca earlier: When you get to the Final Four, there's only
good teams and great teams left. And you're gonna have to beat them if you
want to win a national championship. I don't think anybody comes here and
loses games. You're going to have to beat them.  
And we knew that going in. And we knew that if we were going to win the game
tonight, we had to beat Notre Dame. We couldn't count at all on them losing
the game.  
And I really believe that for 40 minutes we competed and we played about as
hard as we're capable of playing. And I couldn't be happier for them. I
couldn't be more proud of them. We've come a long way. And this is really,
really, really rewarding.  
And again, you know, the Notre Dame team that we beat is a great, great, great
team. You don't beat us seven out of eight times without being a great team.
So my hat's off to them and the kind of year that they've had, but tonight was
our night.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Breanna, could you talk about your game and about your shoulder a little
bit and how you've just sort of come on here at the end of the season and the
reasons for that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: What do you want, me to answer it for you?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yeah.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Come on. Get this over with.  
BREANNA STEWART: About my game, I don't know, I think that this postseason
I've really gained a lot more confidence. And today was a game that I was
really looking forward to playing. I think all of us were.  
And about my shoulder, it's fine.  
  
Q. Kelly, talk about the journey that this team has undergone from the end
of the Big East Tournament to get to this point and getting this win
tonight.  
KELLY FARIS: We've had some ups and downs starting from the beginning. I think
we've mentioned it before, there's been‑‑ we can almost count on one hand what
it felt like, how many practices that we've had everybody there type of thing.
But when you get to this point in the season, you know that everybody's had
their ups and downs as well and some worse than others.  
So, for us, we just had to turn it around after the Big East championship, and
I think we did that from the younger guys all the way up. And I told them in
the locker room they have no idea how proud I am of every single one of them,
and I mean that from the bottom of my heart, because to see this team just
totally transform, especially the young guys, that's not easy to do.  
And the fact that she comes in and plays her heart off and has 29 points, you
don't see very many freshmen that do that.  
And I think that the big difference for us is just our mentality and we were
able to get contributions from everybody, and that really helps us out.  
  
Q. Kelly, I was wondering if you could ‑‑ you waxed pretty well in
Bridgeport about Breanna's emergence. It's getting frightening now. Can you
just a little talk about what you saw tonight?  
KELLY FARIS: I think this is what we knew was in her. This is what we saw from
the beginning of the year. And then everybody goes through their little lapses
of issues, whatever they may be. And this is what we wanted her to get back
to. This is how she plays basketball. It's how she's always played basketball.
So you guys are just kind of starting to get a glimpse of what we knew that
she had.  
  
Q. Breanna, did you just wake up one morning before the Big East Tournament
and say, all right, now it's time for me to play the way I know I can play?
How ‑‑ if somebody asked you from outside how to explain your play in the last
three weeks, what would you tell them?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I'm not sure if I just woke up and started feeling
better, but I think that getting in the gym with C.D. and stuff like that
really helped just gain my confidence in practice and then put it over into
the game.  
And I think Coach had a little bit to do with it.  
But, wait, what was the second half part of the question? (Laughter). I get
distracted.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Sorry. Just wanted to make sure you got your facts straight.  
  
Q. Kelly, did you think that you guys had it in you to make this kind of
change?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah. For sure. We all knew it. It was just a matter of actually
focusing and turning it around and stop talking about it and actually put it
into action.  
Like I said, we saw glimpses of what we could do at the beginning of the
season. And in preseason. We felt great during preseason.  
So we knew we could do it. And, like I said, it just‑‑ unfortunately it took a
little while for us to buckle down and actually, like I said, put it into
action, but I'm glad we're coming together right now.  
  
Q. Kelly, we talked in Bridgeport about the defense and how good it was
against Kentucky. Tonight you guys held Skylar and Kayla to 8 ‑for‑35 shooting
and for one stretch held them without a point for about seven minutes. Just
talk about the defensive effort tonight. They scored 65, but it was not an
easy 65 to get.   
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, obviously that's something that this program prides itself
on. We take a lot of our momentum from our defense. And going into this game,
that was something that was going to have to be different. Our pressure had to
be that much higher than we've ever played it against anybody. And we knew by
doing that we were going to have to get into our bench and have to count on
them to give us some good minutes as well.  
So I think we came in with a good game plan set up by our coaches, and I felt
like we executed it. And a lot of it was revolved around defensive pressure.  
  
Q. Kelly, is your happiness now ‑‑ does your happiness now surpass the
disappointment that was in your face after the first losses to Notre Dame this
season?  
KELLY FARIS: Obviously those are still going to be in the back of my mind.
When my career is over and I think back to the different games, and the ones
that stand out are usually the ones you lose. Especially at this program,
because there's not expected to be very many of them, so‑‑ but, honestly, at
this point I'm not really worried about all that.  
Where we're right now, this is where it counts. And we've gotten to this
point, so there's no reason to sit here and think about all the past games. Or
even going in to play against Louisville. We can't sit there and think about
when we played them earlier in the season. They're a completely different
team, and we have to be as well.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you all to talk a little bit about the spreadsheet. You
knew Notre Dame would come at you, and they did, they cut it to 6 there. And
you all came up with the answer. You had a couple plays on defense, couple
offensive rebounds. Talk about that a little bit if you could, both of you,
because you both contributed to it.  
KELLY FARIS: I think Coach mentioned it to us in the locker room. Obviously
they went on their‑‑ like you said, they went on their stretch and they picked
up the pressure. And we had a few too many turnovers, but we were able to
count on different players at different times to make the play when we needed
it. If we needed a steal, we got a steal. If we needed a bucket, somebody
knocked one in. And those buckets and hustle plays, they all came in at very
crucial times. So that was huge for us to sustain our lead.  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that obviously Notre Dame is a really good team, and
we know that they're going to make runs like that. And I think it's just how
we answer it and make our own run. Because we went on a run after they cut it
to 6, right? Yeah.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
BREANNA STEWART: I don't remember.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. When you lost to them up at Storrs, we were talking after the game and
you were concerned about how long it was going to take Stewart to adjust to
the physicality of the game. Has she gotten stronger in the last couple of
months, or how has she done that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She's gotten stronger mentally. I think she's gotten stronger
emotionally. Stewy really takes things to heart and she puts a lot of pressure
on herself. And when she wasn't playing well, it got into her pretty severely
and she let it affect her. She wasn't strong enough mentally and strong enough
emotionally to just kind of put it aside.  
And after the Big East championship game‑‑ or I should say after the end of
the regular season, there was a renewed almost kind of I'm not going to settle
for this anymore. I'm not going to allow myself to feel like this anymore.  
And that's kind of rare for an 18‑year‑old to be able to do that. And I do
think that getting in the gym and being able to clear your mind and just go
back to what you love doing, just playing basketball, and then once she
started playing well, it just snowballed. And right now she just has a
tremendous amount of confidence in herself, as she should.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen a lot of really good performances from Huskies in the
past. I mean, she put up 29 tonight, key blocks, in one of the biggest games
that potentially you could play. Where does this one rank in your memory of
big games by UConn players?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Given the stage and what was at stake, I don't know‑‑ I don't
know that I've seen any bigger, way bigger. I know there's been NCAA
Tournament games where we've had certain individuals play great, great, great
games. But I don't remember a player having a better game in this environment,
and certainly I've never seen a freshman have a game like this in this
environment.  
I remember Kara Wolters' semifinal game against Stanford in 1995 where she had
31. That was pretty amazing. She was a sophomore then and it was incredible.  
And Stewy made a lot of free throws after she got banged around with her
shoulder. She's just one of these unique kids that doesn't take herself too
seriously, doesn't demand a lot of attention. And I hope she's got another one
left in her Tuesday night.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked a little bit after the Kentucky game about the job Bria
did defensively on O'Neill, and today I noticed you had her on Kayla McBride a
little bit, and McBride has killed you guys for the last two years I'd say
maybe. Can you talk about ‑‑ I mean, is she a better defensive player than
maybe we've seen in the past, Bria? And her performance tonight, just talk
about that, defensively?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, I think the last two games have been two of her best
efforts. But I think I might have said this after the Kentucky game. We've
kind of narrowed her scope so she doesn't have to think a lot out there and be
involved in a lot of different rotations on defense and just give her one job
to do. And she's been able to lock into it and has played great both games in
Bridgeport, and I thought she was great in the second half, especially today.
She played the whole 20 minutes, and I know she was tired. Hopefully we can
get her some rest.  
But she's a winner. I've always said that. One of the things that worried me
about our team for the longest stretches‑‑ and, by the way, those of you that
don't know us, it's not like we lost ten games in a row this year and we snuck
into the NCAA Tournament. We are 30‑something and 4. So there's been times
this year where we've been pretty good and we've beaten a lot of really good
teams during the season by a lot, so‑‑ just so that we're not the Cinderella
team that everybody thinks we are, the Beauty and the Beast here.  
But I‑‑ one of the concerns that I had about our team was‑‑ I don't know that
we have anybody with the attitude that you need sometimes to win a national
championship. Even Stewy. She gets 29, but it wasn't like an in‑your‑face 29.
It was like it's 29.  
Bria is the only one that we have that really has that kind of cocky attitude
that, you know, in the biggest games I'm the best player. She might not play
the best, but she actually feels that way. And she's the only one on our team
that is like that.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what the standards you have at your program about
being back in the title game? And then also maybe an early comment on
Louisville and what Jeff ‑‑ the run they've been on here?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Our program right now, we're the beneficiary of a lot of
things that have happened over the last 20‑some years. And the players that we
get and the expectation level is such that this is where we're supposed to be.
So the way the program is structured and the kind of players that we get, they
are never surprised that we're where we are. There may be bumps along the
road, but they know exactly what the destination is all the time.  
And Tuesday night‑‑ I don't know, Tuesday night‑‑ we gotta problem Tuesday
night I think because I think Louisville‑‑ Louisville really thinks they're
the best team in the country right now. After the way they've played and what
they've done, and these last couple weeks, they probably think there's nobody
that can beat them. They probably think it will be a huge upset if we win that
game Tuesday night.  
And Jeff's a big part of that. People have issues with me. He's the cockiest
guy I ever met, man. (Laughter). He's the cockiest guy I ever met. He wears an
Italian tablecloth for a shirt today (laughter). I was going to hire him for
my restaurant.  
But, you know, I've gotten to know him really well, and I think we were‑‑ we
were at a certain level relationship‑wise when he first got the job at
Louisville. And I would say probably over the last two or three years I don't
think there's anybody that I respect more for their coaching ability than
Jeff. In our league. I don't know that anybody does a better job day in and
day out of getting their team ready to play than Jeff does.  
  
Q. Italian tablecloth. Good line. I'm sure you answered a question on Skylar
earlier, but I just got here. But I did want to ask you: She's been a unique
opponent for you. You've certainly had a lot of players on opposing teams who
have impacted you, but maybe there's not a opponent who's impacted you more
than Skylar Diggins, and I wonder if you can reflect on her career against you
versus even some of the other players that had an impact against
Connecticut.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know the ironic thing about it is that if you check
Skylar's shooting percentage and all that stuff against us, it's not that
great, including tonight. But what makes her who she is is that invariably
whenever there's a time where she has to get a 3, she gets one. Whenever she
needs to get in the lane and get an assist, she gets one. Whenever she has to
get a steal, she might not have any steals, but then she'll get the two that
decide the game. She just has that uncanny ability to capture the moment.  
And one of the reasons why she's been so successful is she does have that
mindset, like I was saying, that I was worried that nobody on our team had.
And if they weren't in our league, she would just be another player that beat
Connecticut. But because they're in our league and we played them so many
times the last couple of years and they've had so much success that‑‑ yeah, I
would say there hasn't been an opponent that we played against that's had more
success against us than she's had. For sure. For sure.  
  
Q. Geno, how much did how your players felt about the previous three games
leading into this one this year play into what happened tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, nobody wanted to believe me because you lost. But
there's losing and there's getting beat. And I've always said that to my team.
There's a huge difference between losing a game and getting beat.  
And I felt like all three games this year we lost. We didn't get beat. But you
can't say that because we lost the game. So if you lose the game, you got
beat. But when we looked at the three games getting ready for this game, we
all thought they've yet to beat us. I know it's a loss in the loss column, but
we lost all three of those games because in the last minute or whatever, we
didn't execute the things that we're good at.  
And that's why I think tonight we won the game. I don't think Notre Dame lost
the game tonight. And if I thought that they had beat us soundly those three
games, then I would have been coming into this game thinking, man, you know, I
don't know if we can do this.  
But when you look at it‑‑ you know, I was saying this the other day. At some
point the percentages are going to work in your favor. The best 3‑point
shooter in the country gets two wide‑open shots at our place and misses them
both. They've got a kid, Kayla McBride, who's like the 35th best 3‑point
shooter in our league and makes a 3 to tie the game in overtime.  
You know at some point those percentages are going to revert back to the other
way. And we missed free throws at their place that would have iced the game,
both Stewy and Kelly. And you knew at some point it was gonna‑‑ and today it
did. Stewy and Kelly made their free throws.  
So I think it made our players feel really, really confident going into
tonight's game as opposed to I don't think we can beat these guys. That's a
long answer to a short question.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Wait. Didn't you have a question? Go ahead.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you ‑‑ thank you, Coach.   
COACH AURIEMMA: You're welcome.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you whether, in describing the difference between
those games that you lost earlier in the season and this one that you won
quite soundly tonight, you would ascribe it to a different or better game
plan, and if so, would you tell us what that was, or whether it was a matter
of executing the same game plan better.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, Shea Ralph has had the scout for every single one of
these games, so she knows Notre Dame better than she knows the UConn players.
And we felt like there were things in all three of those games that we did
really, really well, that we needed to do it more often tonight. There were
things that we did lousy against them those three games that we had to try to
eliminate those things.  
So the game plan was more about not inventing anything new, not coming up with
a game plan that they didn't know we were going to spring on them. It was just
this is what we did that worked, and we gotta do it more often at both ends of
the floor, and this is what we did that they killed us on, and we gotta
eliminate those as many times as possible.  
So I think we just took the information that we had from those three games.
And then today, the players, as is the case, you know, they made it happen. We
can put any game plan we want on the floor, but those kids made it happen
tonight.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Louisville. Joining us on the dais is head
coach Jeff Walz, Sara Hammond, Bria Smith, and Shoni Schimmel. We're going to
open with a brief statement from Coach Walz, and then we'll take questions for
student‑athletes.  
COACH WALZ: Just really excited to be here and to be representing the Big
East. We're very fortunate to have three teams competing in the Final Four and
then two more up the road in Atlanta. I think it speaks volumes of not just
the women's but the men's basketball also that you've got five of your eight
teams that are still remaining from the Big East.  
So we're excited. We're looking forward to it. And we're going to enjoy it.
Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes first, please.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you possibly describe for us what the last seven days have
been like for you personally and for your program?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It's been huge for our program just to be able to make it to
the Final Four, and even our men's team down in Atlanta, it's a great thing
for the University of Louisville.  
But I could never describe how it feels to be here in the past seven days.
Like it's just ‑‑ it's amazing. And all that hard work we did in the beginning
of the season is now paying off for us, and to be here at the Final Four, it's
amazing.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right there.  
  
Q. Sara, could you talk about rebounding going against a Cal team that's one
of the best in the country? How are you going into the game and what's your
approach going to be for a team like that?  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, the coaches told us if we're going to win this game
tomorrow, rebounding is going to be key, because I think the last game against
Georgia they had 27 offensively rebounds. They're a very athletic team, their
post players get in there and they're relentless on the boards, and their
guards are too.  
We'll have to have that same mentality that we've played against everybody,
against Baylor and Tennessee, because we're going to be the tougher team and
we'll be the team that's more relentless. And we've got to fight. We can't
give up on any loose balls, any rebounds, and we just gotta make sure that
we're putting a forearm in their post players and making sure they don't get a
hand on the ball.  
  
Q. Bria, would you talk about transition defense, Brittany Boyd likes to
push the ball for Cal, and what you have to do there?  
BRIA SMITH: That's also a key we were talking about, just being able to stop
them in transition is going to limit their points, because they do like to
push the ball a lot. And if we can get rebounds and limit them in transition,
it will work in our favor.  
  
Q. Two questions. First, the relationship with the men's program, both
obviously in the Final Four right now? And, secondly, the last two games,
except for your locker room, you guys say no one believed you could beat
Baylor and Tennessee. It's a different feeling here now that you guys have
arrived. There's not that "us against the world" mentality, I would think?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yes, our relationship with the guys is great. We used to play
pickup with each other last summer, but we're still close and whatnot. And
Rick Pitino comes in and he was talking to us at the end of the Big East
Tournament, talked to us and gave us a little motivational speech. And it was
great to hear it from him. And I think that's what got us rolling in this
tournament.  
But what was your second question? I couldn't hear you.  
  
Q. The two games against Baylor and Tennessee, you guys said basically no
one outside the locker room believed you could beat them. Now it's a different
mentality. You guys aren't the overwhelming underdog anymore.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I would say we're still kind of the underdog, being the 5 seed
in the Final Four. Just kind of like we're going to keep that mentality and
continue to go out there and shock everybody. I mean, we're not supposed to be
here. But we're here to play basketball.  
  
Q. Shoni, the basket you made against Griner we've seen 9,000 times on TV
since it happened, was that instinctive or had you been practicing that?
You're coming down the floor, you're looking at her standing there, what's
going through your mind?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: To be honest with you, I saw her on the right side, and so I
took a right and then I went back to the left because I didn't think she'd be
able to get over there that quick. But she made it because of her length. So,
I mean, I just had to do the little circus shot because I just mess around in
practice sometimes doing it and it worked out for me. So‑‑ in my favor.  
  
Q. For any of the student ‑athletes, how were you able to believe that this
was possible when you look at all the injuries you folks had during the year?
Three potential starters. You lose one in December. A couple out for the year.
At what point did you think that this was a realistic possibility for you?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, it was hard for us to do it. But Coach talked to us
about it, they're hurt and they can't come back as of now, except for Monique.
She came back, made her comeback.  
So it was just adversity we had to work through. And at that moment in time
they couldn't come back, so we had to understand that the people on the court,
the people who were healthy, that's what we're going to work with, and that's
what we did. And it's gotten us this far. And I can't wait for those other
three to get back. But I'm glad Mo made it back for her fifth year, and it's
been great for us.  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, I think anytime you hit adversity, that's when your true
colors come out and shows how much heart and toughness you have as an
individual and as a team. And we knew we couldn't do anything about it. We
didn't have time to sit around and sulk and be kind of like, oh, well, we wish
we had them. We made no excuses for ourselves and we didn't think about it
really.  
The coaches did a good job of saying they're hurt, we wish we had them. But
Coach just focused in on the people he can use on the court. And we came
together as a collective group and knew with the 10, 11 people we had we were
going to use what we had and everybody was going to use the best of their
ability, because each one of us can bring something to this team that's going
to help us win.  
And I think throughout this tournament everybody's just blossomed. And you've
seen what's happened and how we've beat these teams.  
  
Q. Sara, what about your defense has made it so effective in Oklahoma City?
Held Griner without a field goal in the first half and Simmons I think went
scoreless in the first half. Is it completely different game plans as far as
what Coach puts together? What has made it so effective?  
SARA HAMMOND: I think it's different game plans, depending on the team. We
don't play the same style of basketball every game. It just depends on the
team. And the coaches put together a perfect game plan for Baylor and for
Tennessee.  
So, I mean, we have the best coaching staff in the country. I'd put them up
against any other coaches in the country and I'd still choose ours every
single day.  
I think the great thing about Coach is he got us to believe in that game plan.
Brittney Griner, she's 6'8" of course. Everybody's trying to figure out how to
stop her and her team this year. We're physical with her and we were going to
force other players to step up on their team and make them feel the pressure
and feel that they had to make the shots. And it worked for us.  
And Tennessee, I think the same thing. Meighan Simmons is a great player.
She's co‑SEC Player of the Year. And I think we were just going to try to keep
the ball out of her hands, get her frustrated and, you know, came out with a
win. And it's all thanks to our coaches.  
  
Q. Shoni, Bria, when Coach Walz explained the game plan to you for the
Baylor game and laid it out for you how you were going to beat Baylor, what
was the most ‑‑ the thing that was toughest to believe could happen that you
could shut Griner down or that you needed to make 16 or 18 3‑pointers to win
that game? Because both of them seemed to be a little difficult to achieve.   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, actually, we‑‑ the first play that we rolled up, our
jump ball, was that we were going to have four people back on defense. But I
was going to be standing at the other free‑throw line just waiting for someone
to toss the ball to me for a layup. We didn't get that because we boxed out
for the jump ball.  
But we just believe in everything that our coaching staff says. And the game
plan‑‑ I guess the hardest thing to believe that we were going to be able to
keep Griner off the boards from scoring and everything, but we were able to do
it. And we came out with a victory.  
  
Q. To all three of the ladies, as much as you guys are being here in the
Final Four, you're the team that kept Baylor and Brittney Griner from being
here. How much do you relish that achievement and how much have you fed off
that to get you guys to the next couple of days, hopefully?  
SARA HAMMOND: We're just really excited to be here. Baylor, they're a
tremendous team. They won the national championship last year. And that's a
compliment to them, because everybody's been trying to get to their level and
trying to compete with them.  
But I'm just going to say it again, the game plan that our coaches put
together and us being able to believe in what they were wanting us to do, I
mean, it's just an honor and a blessing to be here right now. And we're just
going to enjoy this moment. We're going to remember it for the rest of our
lives. And hopefully our job's not done. We're looking to win a national
championship here.  
BRIA SMITH: Well, definitely to add on to what Sara said, they are a great
team. And we're really blessed to be here. We executed the game plan, and
that's how we're here right now.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Same thing.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you give an assessment of the Cal guards and how you think the
‑‑ the importance of that matchup in the overall context of the game?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: They're a great basketball team and their guards are what gets
them going, and I think they have a good set of guards and they'll be able to
give us a good run for our money. But they have a lot of pushing the ball and
they know how to get out and run and they rebound well for being guards, too.  
But I think we've just gotta give them a run for their money and continue to
keep playing Louisville basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Had a question right here. No? Yes.  
  
Q. I know it's sometimes difficult to talk about yourself, but could you for
a second give me a sense what you think especially during the postseason your
impact on this team? And I'm sure it's more than just the point, it's also the
attitude, inspiring the team, if you could talk about that?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, I think kind of just being like the older classmate out
there on the floor most of the time, being a junior. Like I just take that
leadership and continue to keep leading on the court and off the court and
just keep talking to them and just keeping them calm and being a normal
teammate, your friend, your sister, whatever you want to call it.  
I'm just out there to help this team win a basketball game, and I'm going to
do whatever it takes to talk to them and tell them stuff and talk to my
teammates and just be their friend and go out there and win a basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right over here.  
  
Q. Shoni, when you do so well in environments like this, your life tends to
change in a lot of different ways. I'm wondering how your life has changed. Do
you have a Twitter site that's blown up like Skylar Diggins or what?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: No, I don't have Twitter.  
  
Q. I don't know where I heard this, but your parents just got married? What
was going on with your family? You have eight siblings or something? Can you
tell us that story?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: My parents have been together for 28 years but they've never
had the time to actually tie the knot. So they had a ton of kids, eight kids,
and they just never really had the time to go out and do it because they're
out coaching us or teaching us how to play basketball and stuff. They never
had the time.  
But it was Easter Sunday and my dad's like, Anything can happen. So my mom was
like, All right, if you guys beat Baylor, I'll marry your dad. That ended up
happening and they ended up getting married the next day after‑‑ in between
our games, the Baylor and the Tennessee games. It was incredible to hear that
and to actually have that happen for them because it's 28 years and they
finally did it.  
  
Q. (Question Off microphone)?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: That wasn't in my mind. There's no doubt in my mind that we
were going to win. So it didn't really matter.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything for the student‑athletes? Okay. Thanks, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Coach, congrats on getting here, my friend.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.  
  
Q. Two questions. First off, the fact that you guys are here, you've been
here before a couple of years ago. Can you compare the two runs you had to get
to the Final Four with the team you had a couple of years ago and this one?
The second part is also teams get hot in basketball. They make shots and such.
Is it a detriment you guys have had seven days off after having that
unbelievable weekend in Oklahoma City?  
COACH WALZ: First part of that question about the two teams that we've had
that have made a Final Four in five years. You know, our first team you had
Angel McCoughtry on it, arguably one of the best players in the Big East and
in the country, her sophomore, junior, and senior year. And then we had
Candyce Bingham to go along with her, Des Byrd ran the point for us. We knew
we were good. We were preseason top seven, top eight. We were in the top five
three‑fourths of the year. That was a team, I think, people knew was going to
have a chance to compete to make a Final Four.  
Now, us with our upset of Maryland in the Elite Eight game, I'm not sure
everybody expected that. And then we go on to the Final Four and upset
Oklahoma. Those two ball games I think were very good games. I think people
that were around the game and understood it knew, hey, they had a chance to
win.  
Now, this team, I mean, I'm willing to bet not many thought we'd beat Baylor,
and after we did that, I'm not sure there were too many that thought we could
come back and beat Tennessee. So with the two teams, this one here I think
more so shocked everyone of what we've done.  
And I'm just as proud of this basketball team as I am our '09 team just for
the fact of all the injuries that we've been able to withstand and the players
have stepped up.  
What was question two?  
  
Q. (Question Off microphone)?  
COACH WALZ: Oh, yes, I'm not worried about that, because we actually started
to play better in our first game in the tournament against Middle. And that
carried over to our Purdue game. We had a week off until we went to the Sweet
16. And we've continued to play well. And we've continued to practice well. So
I'm expecting us to continue to play well tomorrow.  
But it is a bigger stage. When you go out there, there's a little more at
stake and a little more pressure.  
  
Q. When was the last time you spoke to Rick Pitino, and can you recount that
conversation?  
COACH WALZ: I texted him this morning actually. We were going back and forth
wishing him luck and he was wishing us luck and telling us to have fun and
stay loose. Coach has been great. He's been great to me. Ever since the first
day I arrived on campus, I went in and had the opportunity to meet him. And I
sat down with him for 10, 15 minutes. And since then, if I've got a basketball
question, I can pick up the phone and call him. I can call him on his cell,
text him, doesn't matter what time.  
And when this is over I'm sure we'll do the same thing we do each summer, get
out on the golf course a couple of times. It's kind of the way he supplements
his income. Because he sandbags, boy, I'm going to tell you.  
  
Q. Jeff, speaking of Coach Pitino, is he loaning you one of his suits for
tomorrow or are you going to have your open collar ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: No, no, I'm not going with ‑‑ no. I'm wearing the same thing I
always wear. I'm wearing my dress shirt and that's it. I'm trying to get it
approved to be like a baseball coach and just wear a uniform.  
  
Q. You made that switch about 21 games ago, I guess, to have Bria be the
primary ball handler, Shoni did, too. What precipitated that change and how
has that obviously worked out for you?  
COACH WALZ: I'm just trying to get the ball out of Shoni's hands some. Just
trying to take some pressure off her. Because she was having to bring the ball
up the floor against pressure. And most teams are playing full‑court man and
we're trying to set some screens for her, but she was still having to expend a
lot of energy bringing the ball up the floor and then was being caught on the
score also.  
So I called Bria in and I said, I'm going to put you at the point. She had
done some in high school. It's not her natural position. But she was fine with
it. And she has done a great job for us, does a really nice job of allowing
Shoni to play without the ball, which has improved her shooting percentage.
Since we made that move, Shoni's shooting percentage has gone up.  
And then what happens for us, too, when I put Jude in the game, I'm out there
playing with basically three point guards. Jude obviously goes to the point,
Shoni goes to the 2 and Bria moves to the 3, and what's allowed our transition
game to improve is whichever one of those three gets the outlet, we're going
with it. We're not having to go find the so‑called point guard and throw it to
them. They all know they've got the green light to push it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Cal? You had a couple of really high ‑profile wins;
they've grinded it out a little bit more to get here. What do you think about
Cal?  
COACH WALZ: They're very talented. Lindsay's done a great job with them. We've
had some, I guess you could say, high‑profile wins, but they are 32 and 3.
They haven't lost too many ball games. They're a very physical basketball
team. Their post play is as good as I've seen on film. I love how aggressive
they are going to the boards. Their guards push the ball in transition.  
We're going to have to do a few things. We're going to have to do a few things
well. We'll have to get back in transition, make sure they don't score easy
baskets, which I'm sure they're going to score some. It's just a matter you
can't give them 14, 16 points in transition.  
And we're going to have to figure out a way to keep them off the offensive
glass because they rebound the ball so well. And then they get to the
free‑throw line. I mean, I think they average‑‑ in their wins, they're
shooting about 24 free throws a game, and that's something if we allow that to
happen tomorrow night, it's not going to be a good result for us.  
  
Q. Do you think you're doing something novel or revolutionary when you put
that defensive plan together to stop Griner? Had you ever seen that attempted?
And, secondly, what is it with this jacket and tie? You just have trouble
accessorizing? Or why don't you wear them?  
COACH WALZ: The first one, everybody talks about our defensive effort that we
did against Baylor. We held them to 81 points. They average 81 points. So in
my book it's called average defense. So we just did not allow Brittany to get
40 or 50. So Odyssey Sims, instead of averaging 12, gets 29.  
My whole plan is when we go play somebody, I'm trying to take away your best
player. And then if somebody else can score 25, then I'm going to lose.  
As the game progressed, I kept telling our kids: I don't think they can make
enough 3s to beat us but I know Brittney can make plenty of 2 and 3 pointers,
so we're going to continue to give their outside shooters open shots, and if
they make them, we lose.  
But the whole key to it, instead of worrying about how we guarded Brittney,
how we did this, maybe everybody should start asking how do we score 82.
Because there's not been one team in the four years that Brittney Griner was
at Baylor that scored more than 82 points. We scored the most points in four
years during her career.  
And I think that's where it all comes from. And I told our players before we
went into the game: I don't care about how we're going to stop them, because
we're not. They're going to score. We have to figure out a way to score it.
And I thought 70 would be enough. Obviously I was wrong. But I was like: We've
got to figure out a way to score, and that's what we were doing.  
And what Bria said‑‑ our plan for the tip is I figured they'd get the tip, but
Bria did a nice job stepping in front, stealing, and she goes down and scores.
And we do our little press, and when it got to half court, I sent Bria down
there to our end. We're playing 5 on 4, because I was like: I don't care; we
give up the basket, we're going to throw it the length of the floor and score.
We were going to keep doing that until they either put someone back and we
made it a 4‑on‑4 game. Or they just said, okay, we'll see if you can keep
throwing that pass.  
But it never got to that, because we actually‑‑ we stopped them a few times.
And then the whole key to winning is if we can continue to go 7 for our first
10 from the 3‑point line, I think we'll have a chance to compete with most
teams.  
My wardrobe, I can't stand wearing a coat and tie. I used to get out there and
I used to wear it. And I thank Tom Jurich because when I came for my interview
six years ago, I was in my jacket and tie. When I went to meet him and he
said, If you don't take that tie off, you're not going to get this job, I want
you just to be relaxed and be yourself, so I said, That's great.  
And then one day a year and a half ago I was going to do a little speaking
engagement, just had a button‑up shirt on and dress pants, I said, Do you care
if I wear this to games? He said, I don't care what you wear. I said, Sounds
great.  
So that's what I've gone with. And it's comfortable. I enjoy it. And I'm going
to continue to wear it.  
I'm trying to start a trend. It just hasn't picked up.  
  
Q. Jeff, with your defense there's times where it looks like you'll switch
in the middle of a possession. Without giving away too many trade secrets, how
often is that something you continue to do throughout the game, only in spots
where you see certain matchups, kind of what plays into that?  
COACH WALZ: Really what plays into that is who we're playing, personnel, who
is on the floor for us, and then most of the time honestly as the game starts
to progress, our players, some are playing man, some are playing zone. Our
Tennessee game, at one point in time my staff is sitting there yelling: What
are we in? What are we in? And I turned around and said: I don't know. Shut
up. Who cares? They're playing hard. And they started laughing. And I'm like:
Guys, at this point in time they're communicating with each other. And if we
don't know what we're in, they obviously can't know either.  
And it's worked for us. It's like I said, our goal, when it comes to scouting
and coaching, is you gotta try to figure out a way‑‑ and it's not just my
goal. I'm sure it's every coach's goal‑‑ make somebody that normally doesn't
score score to beat you.  
And that's what we're going to continue to try and do. Some games it works;
some days it doesn't. We've lost eight games. There's been eight it hasn't
worked very well with.  
  
Q. Two questions. How important was it for you to get a trio of referees
that allowed physical play? And, secondly, Mark Cuban said he would consider
taking Brittney Griner in the second round of the NBA draft. You proved you
could be physical with that player and take her out of her game. Would you be
an analyst for a moment and talk about the possibility of her even being
remotely on NBA?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I'll start with the first question. You know, when we went
into the game, our game plan was not to try to sit there and foul her every
time she got the ball. Our game plan was to try to cut down on her vertical
space. We wanted to make sure that we crowded her when she had it so she
didn't have the room to pivot and move. And we did that.  
They pay three officials to officiate the game, and then they pay us to coach
and the players play, and then you adjust how the game's called. And that's
what we did. I mean, we didn't do a very good job because we had three players
foul out. So there were plenty of fouls called. And that's how you have to
play. There's going to be games more physical than others. Some games they
call the handshake; others they don't. And you have to be able to go and
adjust as the game's going on.  
For Brittney, she's a great player, there's no question about it. She's one of
the best that's ever played this game. I just know from having the opportunity
to have sat there and played a little bit of Division II basketball on the
men's side, I mean, it's pretty physical. And then I can only imagine what
it's like in the NBA. I would think it would be a little bit of a stretch for
her to try to sit there and try and go out and play in the NBA. I'm not sure
how she would fare against Dwight Howard. I mean, she might be okay.  
In our game, I would hope that she'd just stay with the WNBA because she's got
the opportunity to make a huge impact and continue to improve what we already
have. And I consider it a very good professional game that I'd hate to see her
try to go over there and do that, and I'm not sure it would be really for her
or would it be for publicity to try to say, hey, look at what we did in
Dallas, look what we've done. I'm not sure which it would be. But I hope she
goes to the WNBA, and there's no doubt in my mind she'll have an unbelievable
career.  
  
Q. How have you seen Shoni's game evolve this season, even during this
postseason?  
COACH WALZ: Well, she's just matured over her three years right now. She came
in with flair. That's what she does. She can make an unbelievable shot.
Unbelievable pass, but what she's doing now is she's starting to understand
time and score of games, knowing when to make that back behind the back pass
and when to put up a circus shot, as she called it.  
That's all I challenge her with. I understand how she plays. I recruited her.
It's the one thing I told her when I recruited her: You can play anywhere.
You're talented enough to play anywhere, but you can't play for anybody.
Because some of the shots she takes and some of the passes she makes
somebody's not going to keep her in the game.  
I go back and I tease her all the time. For the first game of her college
career, we played Tennessee at home and she turned it over eight times in the
first half. Not the game, the first half. I kept her in: Shoni, keep going,
babe. It's you. Because she needed to get a feel for the passes I could throw
in high school now I can't throw right now. They're quicker, taller, bigger,
stronger athletes that I'm playing against.  
And as it's progressed through her career, she's adjusted to all of that.
She'll still make an unbelievable pass and it will be a layup and she might
throw one out of bounds, but with three minutes left she's not going to throw
that pass.  
  
Q. Follow up. Why?  
COACH WALZ: Because I let her play. I let kids play. Some coaches think I'm
crazy, but I want them to go out there and have fun. I think this game should
be enjoyable. I think the kids should have fun. I work them hard in practice
now. But when it comes to the game, they're going to take some shots that
aren't great shots. And that's okay.  
As I tell our players, I go watch high school games and I watch games on TV
and it's a one‑point game. Team's down one, the kid goes to the free‑throw
line to shoot two shots. They miss the first one, and you hear the coach yell
out: Focus, focus, you can make it. Well, and I'm going: No kidding? What do
you think the kid's trying to do, not focus?  
So I'm on the other side. I'll yell out the kid's name. Like when Monique Reid
went to the line to shoot her two shots, she looked over at me. I said: Can
you miss again? And she laughed. Because the worst thing you can do is make
them tight. And that's what I try to do. Like when we have kids throw up an
air ball, when they'll run by me, I'll be like: Just try to hit the rim; we'll
get a half a point.  
You want them to play and you want them to laugh, and that's what we do. Some
people might not agree with it, but that's how I like to coach. That's why I
think Shoni enjoys playing at Louisville. And hopefully we'll continue to get
players that want to come in here and have the opportunity to show a little
bit of their personality while they're out there playing.  
  
Q. Two questions. What impact has the Kevin Ware situation had on your team
and your players? And, two, I know you're one of the schools that are leaving,
but are there some bittersweet feelings on your part to be leaving the Big
East?  
COACH WALZ: The first one, we all were watching the men's game when Kevin Ware
went down. It was just a sad moment for him. It was one of the most horrific
injuries I've seen on TV in a sporting event.  
When I talked to the kids before we went out to play, I told them: It's a
basketball game. I mean, when the‑‑ at the end of the day it's just a
basketball game. So let's go out there, let's have fun, and just give it
everything you got for two hours, 40 minutes of basketball, and whatever
happens, happens.  
But when we walk back out here after the end of it, as long as we can look at
each other and say we gave all we could, that's all you're asking. Because you
have a kid like Kevin Ware from Atlanta that wanted to have a chance to go
back and play in a Final Four at home that unfortunately he can't play, but
he's with the team, which is great.  
We just learned‑‑ and I realized at that time we coach a game. It's a sport. I
mean, I love what I do, and I'm going to try to do it to the best of my
abilities. But we're going to make sure we're having fun.  
And then your other one, I'm sorry?  
  
Q. (Question Off microphone)?  
COACH WALZ: About leaving? Yeah, it's sad, especially when you're sitting here
looking at three teams playing in the Final Four. You've got, like I said, two
men's teams playing in it. The Big East as we know it, this is our last year.  
But if you're going to have a final run, I don't think we could have made it
any better. Everybody can argue this league's the best, that league's the
best, but at the end of the day it's what you do at the end. And we've got
three teams in the Final Four, and I think that says enough forward about our
league.  
  
Q. Jeff, how would you evaluate the UConn ‑Notre Dame game? It's very rare
to see a team play another team four times in a season. You know these teams
about as well as anybody. I wonder how you would evaluate that game.   
COACH WALZ: It's going to be a battle. If we're fortunate enough to win the
first game, I'm hoping it goes about ten overtimes. I mean, I'm looking for
that BW3 commercial where something happens. You keep going overtime,
overtime, overtime, because I want them tired.  
But it's been an unbelievable three‑game series for those teams. Anything can
happen. There's no question about it. But Notre Dame should be playing with
the confidence of knowing, hey, we beat them three times, but at the same time
I'd be going, dang, I wish we wouldn't have beat them three times. I mean,
it's tough to beat somebody four times in a year, but if anybody can do it,
they can do it.  
But UConn's playing really well right now. Stewart's playing so much better.
And that's a big X factor for their team. But Skylar and Kayla and Jewell
Lloyd and Achonwa, they're still playing great, too, so I'm expecting it to be
an unbelievable game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais is Notre Dame head coach Muffet
McGraw. We'll have student‑athletes Skylar Diggins and Kayla McBride.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You have an incredible basketball resumé. There's one thing missing from
it, and that is the national championship. How much would it mean for you to
get two more victories and win your first national title?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It would mean a lot‑‑ I say this over and over‑‑ not only to
me but to our team and our program, the city of South Bend who has been
supporting me my whole life, the university, Coach McGraw. It would just mean
a lot, so many things so much bigger than myself. And the opportunity is here
now. And, like I said, I'll keep saying it: We're going to leave it all on the
court and try our best to get to that position where we can fight for a
national championship.  
  
Q. Both players, this is obviously the fourth time you've played UConn. You
know them so well. Have you found it more or less difficult to pay attention
in the scouting report and focus in on what you have to do as opposed to a
team that maybe you hadn't seen before?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I don't think there's that much change. I think there's a few
things here and there. We see on film what's wrong, we adjust from there. They
couldn't have changed that much in about a week and a half. So we just try to
go out there and play hard and play with intensity.  
I think it makes it‑‑ I think we pay attention more now than ever. I think
you're at the point of the season where every detail matters even more. And we
know so much about them, and likewise with them for us.  
But we just have to make sure we come out and still execute our scout defense
and our keys to the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the level of confidence that you guys have playing
against UConn, especially you won seven out of eight, four straight?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: You know, UConn is a great team. I think we just go out there,
we have confidence in ourselves. I don't think that their games really matter.
This 40 minutes matters the most out of any other game this year, and that's
how we're looking at it.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I agree.  
  
Q. You and Kelly go back to senior All ‑Star games, U.S.A. Basketball. Could
you talk about the last four years, on‑court battles, maybe how ferocious
they've been, and the respect you have, both ways, you and Kelly have for each
other?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: She's a good player, one of the hardest workers I've ever
played with and somebody that never stops. She's like the Energizer Bunny. I
think she's fun to play with because you love when teammates go out and just
play as hard as they can every possession. That was my experience with her.  
  
Q. Skylar, I want to get a sense for the winning attitude, the mantra that
you carry, along with the team. Where did that start for you, how long ago,
and what's helped you progress to where it's at now?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: When I was at a very young age my dad tried‑‑ he was super
aggressive with me. He was in sports, and he kind of‑‑ my mom used to say how
rough he used to play with me and what have you, but he was very competitive.  
And then my mom, she never played basketball. She was a cheerleader, gymnast.
But if we played card games, if we played Monopoly, if we played anything, we
weren't stopping until she won. And she always encouraged us to just try our
best and you don't have to be the best but you have to be your best. And she
was so competitive in everything she did. So kind of both of my parents.  
  
Q. Who is the most well ‑known person to reach out to you this week to wish
you luck?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, I had talked to Lisa Leslie. I talked to Nancy
Lieberman. And on Twitter, Trey Songz told me good luck. I thought that was
pretty neat. For those who don't know who Trey Songz is, he's a singer.  
  
Q. Skylar, half the state of Connecticut is debating how deep you are in
UConn's head now after all that's happened. Is that something that you like to
plant a seed of doubt in the opponent, or is that something you don't even
care about?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yeah, I don't think it matters. Not to me. I think right now I
don't even think the past three games matter. I don't know if the tables have
turned maybe because they're a team, when you play against them, they can get
in your head. Because anything about Connecticut basketball, you think about
the championships and All‑Americans and what have you, and I think we've
overcome the intimidation factor. I don't know how you feel K‑Mac.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I have to agree, we have a lot of confidence in each other,
just a belief we can win. Not just with UConn, it's been every game this year.
We've just taken that momentum and just kept playing hard.  
  
Q. Everybody talks about how this game might be different. I'm wondering if,
Kayla and Skylar, maybe you could talk about how the last three were similar.
Did they play out in a similar way? Were the matchups the same? Was there a
lot of difference between the last three games played? And as Jeff was saying,
UConn has only lost 11 games in five years and seven of them to Notre Dame. Is
that incredible to you guys after what UConn has accomplished?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: What was the first question? I'm sorry. It was like two long
questions.  
  
Q. Skylar, how similar were the first three games?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Okay, gotcha. I think all three of the first three games were
decided within the last couple of minutes. And I think both teams had an
opportunity to win the game. I was proud how my team just made big plays
towards the end. If you remember in Storrs with Ariel Braker with the block,
and she got the final rebound to finish the game, and then South Bend, the
three overtimes, just making plays, K‑Mac with the 3, and to put us into
overtime and the countless amount of plays made in the three overtimes. And
then finally in the Big East Tournament, the last defensive play that our team
had and the presence of mind to sprint down the court after we got the steal,
make the layup, and then sprint back down and match up.  
I think the game was decided in the last couple of minutes and just our
ability to make plays.  
  
Q. Has it been total business for you, or have you had a chance to soak up a
little of the culture? If you have, why is that important to get some little
breaks in from the grind?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We talk about that all the time. This is a business trip for
us as far as basketball goes. But we want to enjoy this experience. This is so
much fun being a part of this team. We're in such a blessed position to have
the opportunity to play for another championship.  
And this is an exciting time for me. I'm a senior, and I keep saying I want to
soak it all in. I know the team went to Bourbon Street saw a little bit. And I
was saying how we ate the crawfish, it was looking back at us. Had eyes in it
still. The food is great, the people have been great. It's been a fun
experience so far.  
  
Q. Skylar, when you talk about that intimidation with UConn, what did it
take for you guys to get over that and put together this run you're on right
now?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: When you're playing against them you can't just focus on them
and the front of the jersey. You have to really focus on what you want to do
and executing your game plan. And I think we've been the aggressors for the
most part the last couple of times we played them. And I think that helps us,
when we're just worried about us, what we're going to do, and what we need to
do to win the game.  
  
Q. Sky, two years ago you guys were in this position they're in having lost
three times to them in the regular season and beat them in the Final Four.
What was the mentality for you guys? Was it, okay, we know we can still beat
this team and they're sort of in the position now where they've lost to you
three times this year and now they're trying to knock you off for the first
time?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: For us, we felt we had nothing to lose. I think that was our
mindset that we play, we're the underdogs, we had nothing to lose.  
When we come into this game, I don't feel like we're the underdogs. I still
feel like Connecticut is America's team and they're going to cheer for them
whether we beat them 20 times in a row.  
I think we approach this game with the mindset that we can beat them because
we have before. At the same time they're a great team. And we didn't win by
20. Like I said, the game was decided within the last couple of minutes.  
So if we're able to make some runs of our own, sustain their runs, make big
plays and believe in ourselves, fight adversity, make some big plays at the
end of the game, we'll be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll take some questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Muffet, Skylar said their attention level has been good. How would you
grade it over the last two or three days?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it's been really focused. I think it's a lot of
intensity. I think there's a lot of awareness of the scouting report and what
we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach, Skylar came to you as a great high school player, but she wasn't a
great player at least to the level she is now the first day on campus. How
does she become the player that she is now?  
COACH McGRAW: She's somebody that's a student of the game. She loves to watch
film. We watch a lot of film. We talk a lot. We draw stuff up on the board
together. We kind of talk about ideas and different things and experiences.  
And I like to watch the game from the point guard perspective. So I stand at
half court so I can be in her ear I think the entire practice and what are you
seeing and what do you think and what could you have done differently here.  
So I think a lot of back‑and‑forth conversation about things and here's some
good things that you did, here's some things you need to work on. And just
also having Niele Ivey on the sideline as a former point guard going through
the same thing. I think between the two us we've done a lot with her.  
  
Q. I know you've answered various versions of this question over the course
of the year, but here you are in the Final Four with three Big East teams
here. Talk about the pride of the conference and obviously the mixed emotions
of this is it.  
COACH McGRAW: We certainly think the Big East is the best conference in
women's basketball. We've proven it this year to have two No.1 seeds, and then
Louisville join us in the Final Four is a great accomplishment for the league.
It's great that we're doing it in the last year together. I think it's a
fitting ending for us to go out in a big way, and we're really proud of that.  
I think the Big East has elevated our team and our program. Since we joined
the conference we've really become one of the nation's best teams.  
And so it's a little sad to see its demise, but we're looking forward to big
things for us, too.  
  
Q. Muffet, why have you and Geno stayed civil when other coaches in this
situation may not be so just because of how the rivalry has been, how heated
the games have been? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems to
be stability and like between the two of you. Is that correct, and, if so,
why?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think I don't really read anything that he says. I think
that helps. I try to stay away from anything that's controversial. He would
love to try to get some things going, I think. But it's really not in my
nature to go back and forth like that. So I think we do remain civil. I think
having Philly as a common denominator‑‑ I think we both understand each other.  
  
Q. Muffet, how much has the dynamic for UConn changed in the last few weeks
with them playing Moriah Jefferson as much as she has this week and the
emergence of Breanna Stewart?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think both of them are playing much better. And I think
the expectations are high coming in for someone that's ranked No. 1 and No. 2
in the country. Everybody expects that you're going to come in and be a great
player right away.  
And different kids respond to that differently. It takes some of them longer.
We were fortunate with Jewell Lloyd that she was able to come in, really make
that statement, and join the starting lineup immediately as one of our best
players.  
So I think they've come a long way. And they're playing really great
basketball right now. I think Stewart, to be the most outstanding player of
the regional tournament, that's quite an accomplishment for a freshman.  
So I think they're definitely playing better now and playing probably like
everyone expected them to at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. Would you speak to Louisville and what qualities they have that allowed
them to get this far?  
COACH McGRAW: I think confidence would be the keyword for them to go into
Baylor‑‑ that game, and just shoot the ball as well as they did.  
And Shoni Schimmel is a very confident lady, as the leader of that team, and I
think they have a little bit of a swagger to them.  
And I think that's something that you need when you're playing against a team
of Baylor's caliber.  
  
Q. Two years ago you guys were in this position UConn was in having lost to
them three times and beat them in the national semifinals. This year is a
little different because every game was down to one possession or triple
overtime. Mentally, how is it better to have your team able to focus to maybe
beat a team a fourth time since all three games were so close ‑‑ I think two
years ago the teams were a little more distant, that, okay, maybe there's a
little confidence UConn had that they could still beat you?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we came out of each game, with, wow, we didn't play
well. Here's some things we can do well. Here's a some things we can do a lot
better. I think we learned a lot from each game because they were so close.  
So I don't think we have that feeling of we've beaten them so easily, because
certainly it wasn't an easy game. So I think it's a different mentality than
it was two years ago.  
  
Q. Muffet, could you talk about the vibe of this Final Four. Lindsay
Gottlieb joked that that game tomorrow night is the undercard because you guys
have played so many times in such tough games. But you had good things to say
about Cal when you played them at the end of last year. Are you surprised to
see them here? What do you think about sort of the vibe of this Final Four
grouping?  
COACH McGRAW: I'm not at all surprised to see Cal here. Last year I thought
they were severely underseeded to be in the 8‑9 game.  
We just barely beat them at home in a great game. And I told her next year
they'd be a top 10 team for sure and certainly a team that's on the rise. And
they've really exceeded the expectations in just her second year. I think it's
exciting for them first time to be here.  
I don't know the vibe. I don't leave my hotel room much. I don't know what the
vibe is on the outside, but I think that the game between us and Connecticut
is such a big rivalry game in the country, that, sure, the national‑‑ ESPN and
everybody's pretty excited about having that game on TV. And it is a sell‑out.
So I think it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Muffet, you say you don't read much what Geno says, which is probably a
good thing. About a month he was addressing a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in
the state, and he told the audience that there was no way that Notre Dame was
going to beat UConn a fourth time, and pretty much guaranteed that they were
going to win the game. Did that get back to you?  
COACH McGRAW: No, the guarantee for these championships, ‑‑ and so that was a
great motivational speech that I'd never have to give to my team. So I think
that was something that we did see.  
  
Q. Muffet, at the beginning of the year you talked that you liked this team,
but you did say you didn't expect, I shouldn't put words in your mouth, but I
wonder if where they are has turned out to be a surprise based on where you
thought they would be at the beginning of the year?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought after the Baylor game I changed my whole thinking on
this team. I came out of that game. We lost the game.  
It was relatively close. And I thought we played really well, did some really
good things. And so I gained a lot of confidence coming out of that loss. And
I really looked at the team a lot differently and where we could be.  
We went from there to play Texas A&M in a tournament in Vegas. And I thought
they were a great team. And we managed to beat them. And coming into early
January and beating Connecticut in the Storrs first game.  
And I think from that moment on, we felt totally different, like we got here a
lot earlier than we thought we would. I think our expectations changed in that
time.  
  
Q. What did you saw on this team that made you feel like that? Was it
something they were doing on defense or just a mindset?  
COACH McGRAW: I think a little bit of both. I think the mindset was there, the
confidence. I think that's what we saw that we went in, we executed what we
needed to. We made shots when we needed to.  
And I think certainly Jewell Lloyd had a lot to do with that. I think early on
Kayla McBride. You knew Skylar was going to be there. You expected big things
from her. But to have the rest of the team step up, I think that was the big
difference.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Cal we have head coach Lindsay
Gottlieb, student‑athletes Layshia Clarendon, Talia Caldwell, and Eliza
Pierre. We're going to start this morning with an opening statement from Coach
Gottlieb and then we'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Hi, everyone. Thanks for being here and covering us. We are
thrilled, to say the least, to be practicing on April6, to be here, having a
lot of fun with our team. We're soaking it all in. The people of New Orleans
and host committee have been wonderful so far. We're looking forward to
getting out to this open practice today.  
Personally I've watched a million of these since I've been a coach. It's
really a thrill to be here, but especially to be here with this group and this
team. There's no one else I'd rather be around, and we're excited to play
Louisville tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions and please state your name.  
  
Q. A lot of attention being made to the guard matchup in this game and your
role as a defensive stopper. Does that get you excited, you could have an
impact on a game of this magnitude with your role?  
ELIZA PIERRE: Yes. I don't know‑‑ yeah, it does. I think that they're very
skilled, and we have skilled guards. But I think I'm really excited to do what
I guess I do best.  
  
Q. No matter what you do, how much baton passing have you done with Brittany
Boyd in terms of leadership and preparing her to sort of maybe take over this
team from a guard spot going forward?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't know if I've necessarily thought about it that
specifically. I think our whole senior class has done a great job just kind of
instilling hard work, just being yourself, always bringing on every single
rep, just being a good leader, leading by example kind of thing, more than me
specifically passing on to Boyd.  
I think that's a really good role that we've all kind of played as Talia has
passed the baton to Reshanda Gray and Eliza has passed it on to all the rest
of the guards. I think we've done a good job of that.  
  
Q. How much have you seen Louisville play? In particular, in tournament
they're shooting 50 percent the last couple games from the 3 ‑point line. How
are you guys going to have to adjust your style for that?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: We've seen them hit a lot of open 3s, a lot of dribble
penetration, get by, force rotations, and then wide‑open shots. Our goal is to
get them in front for contested shots, which we have the guards to do without
a doubt.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask Talia a question. Louisville likes to get up and
down the floor. Of course you guys also. But how big will the rebounding be,
you and Reshanda, as far as slowing them down? You guys get a lot of offensive
rebounds in particular. Is that something you really focused on in this
game?  
TALIA CALDWELL: Yeah, definitely with every game because if you make baskets
it slows them down, of course, just from a schematic standpoint.  
And we feel like if we're not going to make every shot that the guards make or
that we make, we might as well put it back on the offensive rebound side and
take opportunities.  
They're also scrappy. They've got a lot of O boards the past few games, so if
we box them out and make them take one contested shot each possession, I think
they'll be good for our favor.  
  
Q. For each of you, where were you watching the Final Four last year? And at
what point did you realize this could happen this year for you?  
TALIA CALDWELL: I did not watch it. If I'm not playing it, I'm kind of a sore
loser, I'm done. So I was at the rec gym playing pickup that whole week. I was
just disgusted seeing all those teams. I felt like we should have been there,
even last year, and we would have competed and could have won the whole thing.  
So it just motivated I know me personally for next year and I wanted to work
on my game asap.  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: The same, I didn't want to hear about it. My sister texted
me about it. I was like, Stop talking to me kind of thing. I think we were
getting out of church and someone was telling us about the game. Sore losers,
hate to lose. Didn't want to watch.  
It's hard. I think you love the game so much and you're not in it, you don't
want to see the other teams.  
But I did come to the Final Four my senior year of high school. So that was a
really cool experience to see it in St. Louis, but didn't watch last year.  
ELIZA PIERRE: I guess I'm the sore thumb over here. I watched it. I watched it
because I know some people on the teams who played last year. So that's the
reason why I watched it. But I don't think if I knew anybody I would have been
watching it.  
  
Q. For any of the players who want to answer, obviously it's a big deal for
the Big East to have three teams out of the four. What's the perception of the
Big East on the West Coast? What's your thoughts on the conference as a
whole?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think a really good conference. You have so much talent
out of UConn, Notre Dame, Louisville. Respectable conference. I think we
respect every one of our opponents from the Pac‑12, SEC, the Big East. We know
there's a lot of talk about East Coast basketball, how physical they are, how
every game, night in, night out, like Skylar mentioned last night, it's like
an NCAA game for them. So really good conference. Really good names to play
with.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Gottlieb.  
  
Q. Hey, Lindsay, how do you balance the first time here for the team versus,
okay, it's a business trip and we have two games to win to become national
champion?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think the easiest thing has been to be how we've been all
year, and my philosophy and this team's philosophy, which is enjoying every
moment that we can being together, being with this team, and then at the same
time focusing and locking in when it's time to do so.  
So I think a lot of coaches who maybe aren't that way all year go, okay, now
it's the Final Four; how are we going to handle all the madness and then be
able to play? Well, that's what we do all the time. It's just on a larger
scale.  
So I think for us that's not the huge transition. It's just them being used to
more people there when we get off the bus and more lights and more cameras.
But the idea of enjoying it and focusing is something that we're accustomed
to. And I think that it's benefited us.  
  
Q. Such a big step forward for Cal basketball. What's this week been like
for you in terms of who you heard from and the interest that you're getting
and so on?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean, it's unbelievable. It's like a dream come true for all
of us. I've said that I absolutely believed in the talent in our locker room
and that we were capable of something like this. And at the same time I'm very
conscious of the fact that it's really hard to do it and a lot of things have
to happen right.  
And I think the reason it's been better than I ever imagined is because the
people I get to do it with, and that's from my staff to the team to our
administration and the Cal community.  
I'm also very keenly aware that there are so many great coaches who never get
to experience this. And I've been sitting here at Final Fours watching, and I
definitely have these pinch‑me moments like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be in
open practice. I'm getting text messages. Muffet and Geno gave me the most
genuine hugs last night when they saw me, which is really cool. And from
across the country I'm getting text messages from coaches and people and men's
coaches I know saying, hey, we're following, this is so great.  
So I'm very grateful and appreciative for this opportunity, really happy for
our players. Seeing their smiles and them light up with all the stuff that's
happening is probably the most gratifying.  
  
Q. Coach, could you follow up on who those men's coaches were that reached
out to you?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: A lot of them sort of connected to Cal. So obviously our men's
staff has been incredibly supportive. I've got e‑mails and text messages from
the former staff, Ben Braun and Louis Reynaud who were there before, Sonny
Dykes, our new football coach, Jeff Tedford, our old football coach, Dennis
Gates who's a great alum and Cal grad who's now coaching at Florida State. I
got a couple of texts last night from a UCLA ‑‑ former UCLA assistant who I'm
friends with who went to Santa Barbara, our Santa Barbara men's coach, Bob
Williams, and I could go down the list. It's really cool.  
Adam Duritz, the Counting Crows lead singer, was texting me last night from
Australia: I knew when I planned this tour I should have arranged the dates
around the Final Four.  
I mean, things like that, it's just the Cal community is so excited. A lot of
people. I could go on and on. But it's really just a thrill for me, and just
to be able to share it with these people.  
And then personally people from my childhood and things like that. It's so
much more meaningful when you share it with people. And I love that this team
is so accessible and so relatable that everyone feels part of it.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to follow up. For those of us who don't see you on a day
‑to‑day basis, how would you describe the collective personality of your team?
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think there isn't one collective. I think they're
individuals. I would say it is a group that genuinely enjoys life and playing
college basketball. I've gotten a million comments here from the support staff
and volunteers: Your team's the most fun. Your team's the best to be around.  
Got a lot of comments at the banquet last night that they're just the most
comfortable. I'm very secure in the fact they play for the California across
their chest and they're truly about the team and about each other that I'm
okay that one of them has a mohawk and the other one has pink braids and the
other one has brown hair and that when they're wearing stuff where you can be
an individual‑‑ some of them wear skinny jeans and some baggy jeans and some
wear the prom dress last night and some don't. It's a really unique group that
is just comfortable in their own skin and comfortable playing for Cal.  
I think collectively they're really smart. We're at the number one public
university. They're very socially conscious. They're aware of things beyond
basketball. They play really hard. They're super competitive. They get most
competitive about things with their teammates, like "don't say something bad
about my teammate" kind of thing. And they just genuinely‑‑ they dance every
day.  
They can break out into kind of song, but it's just really a neat kind of
mixture of serious and focus on basketball and school, and then a whole lot of
fun also.  
  
Q. Lindsay, what sort of outside activities have you been able to enjoy here
aside from the schedule of events?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, there's a lot of things scheduled, and those things are
fun. It's not like we've been off doing our own thing. But when we got here,
there was a New Orleans kind of Jazz band welcoming us walking in and king
cake and just the welcome there. Yesterday we had the media stuff and the
salute dinner. We tried to mix in like our meals even at the hotel having
gumbo and local sort of style things.  
I think maybe on the way back from practice today we were going to do a
sightseeing tour. But the main thing we haven't got to do yet is Cafe du
Monde, trying to fit that in somewhere, trying to soak in the flavor of
everything.  
At the same time obviously it's a business trip and there's a lot of scheduled
things and trying to keep the normalcy of our game prep while we kind of mix
in these other things.  
  
Q. Rebounding is a big part of your team's success. How important will that
be tomorrow considering Louisville doesn't have that kind of interior game you
guys do?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: It's going to be incredibly important. It's certainly a part
of our identity, huge factor in our success all the time. We don't take it for
granted. They'll tell you in the locker room every single game somehow find a
way to weave that into a key to the game. I try to say it a different way:
Rebound like they've never seen anyone before. And rebound only like Cal can.  
I don't take for granted that we're pretty good at it. We emphasize it all the
time. But I think it will be a factor.  
  
Q. You've been pushing a rock up a hill for a long time, that being your
neighbor to the south. You've beat them in the regular season. You're here and
they're not. Do you feel like you're up over that hill finally?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I think all along we've got such a tremendous respect
for Stanford. And even going through this year, Tara and I shared text
messages through the postseason. I've told her: You make it look easy, and
it's not easy. I have respect for the consistency of excellence.  
That being said, it's been for us about trying to create another elite program
in the Bay, trying to make Cal basketball one of the programs across the
country that gets to do things like this.  
So we see it as, wow, we've achieved one of those goals. We've gotten Cal to
the Final Four. We are in the elite. And we think that's great.  
It doesn't really kind of factor in for us, oh, and Stanford's not here. I
think we were just focused on us getting to this level. I think they've been
supportive of us trying to get here. And we hope for years to come that we're
at this level, and if that means competing with them more regularly, then
great. But it doesn't feel any better that they're not here; it just feels
great for us to be here.  
  
Q. Lindsay, when you run into an opponent that has recently developed a
persona as a team of destiny, is that something you're cognizant of to talk to
your players about, prepare in a special way, or do you not care at all and
just focus on yourself?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: We care about what they're running and how they're getting
those open looks. And, yeah, sure, I'm cognizant of the fact they're hot and
why are they hot and what do we need to cool that down. We talk to our players
about that, but it becomes more about specifics of how we want to defend them
or what they've been doing well and not‑‑ I think our kids pretty much think
we've got a good thing going, too. We focus on what we do well and how to slow
down the opponent, and that's like just the kind of normalcy of our prep.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I hope you get your beignets at some point. The expectation is
Baylor would be the team you're playing. Since you're playing Louisville,
obviously that's a team ‑‑ impressive they beat a team like Baylor. Does it
make it any harder, though, to take them‑‑ not take them seriously, but to be
prepared in the way you want to be, because they accomplished this great thing
but they're not the team that everyone would have expected to be here?   
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean, I think we're in the Final Four; you know that your
focus has to be completely on the team that you're playing. And there's no way
that any of us would‑‑ we haven't taken a game lightly all year. We had to win
every single Pac‑12 game after splitting Stanford to get to the championship,
whether that was the next top team or anyone else.  
So this team has a real mentality of whoever's in our way is the most
important game in the history of the world. That's kind of how they have
approached it.  
So absolutely we don't‑‑ we're not thinking about Baylor. We're not thinking
about anybody else but Louisville and all the things they do well and what
makes them such a serious threat to us, and those are the things we're trying
to be ready for.  
  
Q. Coach, Louisville has done a good job of kind of taking away other teams'
stars, and in their defense, at least in the half court, it looks like they
could change from ‑‑ in the middle of a possession. Can you talk about that
and describe exactly what makes Louisville's defense so tough?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's exactly what you mentioned. I think they're
really good and they're at their best when they're making you uncomfortable,
when they make you off kilter. I think Jeff does a really good job of figuring
out what's going to make another team uncomfortable and trying to play to
that.  
And so we've talked about not being rattled by their changing defenses, not
focusing on what they're doing and focusing on kind of the looks we're trying
to get and how we're trying to play.  
We have faced a number of different kinds of defenses that either try to slow
down Layshia or pack it in on our post or do some kind of junk defense, box
and one and triangles and two. And we've faced various things like that
before.  
The key with our players is not letting them dictate how we want to play on
offensive end, and I think that's what they're so good at doing and it leads
to their offensive production when they're turning you over.  
  
Q. Along the line of not playing Baylor, seems like this tournament you've
been a little bit fortunate, didn't have to play Texas Tech on its floor. Got
away with the fouls against South Florida, and you didn't have to play ‑‑
Gonzaga didn't make it to its own regional. Didn't have to play Stanford.
There's an old saying about being more lucky than good. Do you feel you all
were lucky in who you didn't have to play?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I definitely agree that a lot has to go right in order to get
to this point. But I also think there's a huge impact that our players have in
making things go right. I thought Fresno State was a terrific 15 seed. I
thought South Florida was one of the best teams we faced all year. That's a
team that took Notre Dame to overtime.  
And I thought LSU and Georgia were tremendous competition for us. So have we
won pretty every single game? No. And I think we can play better. But I think
the teams that were in front of us at each stage were really formidable and we
had to get the job done. And so I think we looked at the task at hand and got
it done and feel very excited and fortunate to be here. But "luck" isn't the
kind of word that comes into it in my mind.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you think Layshia has been overlooked nationally; and, if so,
why?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yes, 100percent. Absolutely. I just‑‑ she's an All‑American.
She has had an All‑American type season, consistently, and now she's helped
take her team to the Final Four.  
When people ask me what's the difference between us this year and last year,
the players that returned were all better. And Layshia has played like an
All‑American all year, which is what you need in order to go from being really
good to being the elite.  
I don't know, is she overlooked because we're on the West Coast and people
don't see her as much? I think at times if she was wearing one of these other
uniforms she would be one of the biggest names in the country.  
But I think she's quietly and steadily earned that respect from the people who
really watch basketball and who really know. So I think some of it is a West
Coast thing. I think some of it is the fact that we've kind of splashed on the
national scene this year and she wasn't necessarily on that stage for all four
years.  
I think another piece of it may be our balance; that we haven't needed her to
score 25 every game; that she's really good at distributing and playing within
the flow. I could go on and on. And she's an unbelievable student‑athlete. She
was the Scholar Athlete of the Year in the Pac‑12\. She's a tremendous
teammate. She plays both ends of the floor. There's not more, I think, one
person could do for a team within the context of being at this level.  
  
Q. Did you ever imagine that you would be coaching a team to the Final Four?
How did you prepare the Cal team to make it this far this season?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: That's a great question. Did I ever imagine it? I did. I don't
know what you dream about. But a lot of people have asked like, as a kid a
friend and I would take like a fake tape‑recorder and we would do imaginary
press conferences.  
And she would dream about playing in the Final Four, which she got to do, and
I would dream at some point start thinking about coaching here.  
When I watched other coaches coach in this kind of setting, I've said: Wow,
what would it be like to do that? And you visualize it in your head, and yet
it's still better than I ever imagined.  
In terms of the team, I think what I did is I gave them a belief to prepare
them for this. When I first got the job I said: We have everything we need in
this room, we just need to believe it.  
We need to work really hard, and I think that's the best way to prepare them,
because now I can look at them when we were leaving Berkeley for New Orleans,
I said: You just need to pack yourselves. You need to pack your heart and your
toughness and your jump shot, your rebounding and just bring us.  
And I think that's the best way to prepare them is to make them feel confident
and comfortable in who they are and the way we've done things.  
  
Q. Who was the friend who made the Final Four?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Her name is Hilary Hike. It was Hilary Howard. Played at Duke.
She was in the'99 Final Four, the team that knocked off Tennessee. Just kind
of a neat story. She's the one who introduced me to Joanne Boyle, who was her
assistant coach at Duke, who then hired me.  
Kind of a funny story, because Geno really recruited her very hard. She ended
up going to Duke. And our high school coach now is really good friends of
Geno, runs his restaurant.  
I joke that I have a job because you went to Duke and our high school coach
has a job because you said no to Connecticut. And now she and her whole family
are here. It's kind of fun. We joke: Wow, we both ultimately made a Final
Four. Pretty neat.  
  
Q. You're an East Coast person. Could I get your thoughts on the Big East,
them having three teams here. And Geno really ripped the president for
destroying the conference to chase the football money. What's the West Coast
version of what the Big East is going through in terms of the realignment?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: From being an East Coast kid growing up, I grew up watching a
lot of Big East men's basketball, Syracuse and Georgetown and you know Seton
Hall and the great games. My first coaching game was Syracuse when I was 21
years old. So really familiar with the passion for basketball, the commitment
to basketball.  
There's a lot of great teams, obviously UConn and Notre Dame have sort of
carried the banner, and then everyone else has sort of risen to a higher level
because of the success that UConn had. It's a great conference. We're excited
that they let us join the party here from the West Coast.  
But I think the college athletics world is changing. We're really excited
about the Pac‑12\. I think there's so many incredible schools and great things
going on. But you look at the conferences breaking up from the nostalgia
standpoint, it's a little sad. But new rivalries will develop. And I guess all
we can do is kind of go forward and hopefully get some new good rivalries.  
  
Q. So I was wondering like how do you encourage your students, like your
team to keep up the good grades and still be good in basketball?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: That's a great question. They know from the minute that they
step on campus and probably even when I'm recruiting them that the academics
is just as important as the basketball, that they go hand in hand; that
they're both a priority.  
We help them schedule their time so that they have class and practice and
study hall and weight training; that everything is a priority all at once. And
I think more than anything, I think when they know that it's important to me
and the whole program, it's important to them as well. And they do a really
good job of balancing both, and we talk about their classes and we talk about
the basketball.  
But I just think positive motivation is the best way to do it, to let them
make them believe what they can achieve when they end up with a degree from
Cal and playing on this basketball team.  
  
Q. Lindsay, when you ask questions, when you were the reporter, were you
rude, and did you have gravy stains on your lapel?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely not.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how much film have you watched on Louisville the last couple of
days, and are there specific games that you've keyed on to try to learn
something about them?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I've watched a lot of film. And you always try and get sort of
a diversity of film to watch. I like to watch teams that play defense the way
we play defense so I can see kind of what they do.  
I have specific coaches that I kind of, their game plans resonate with me;
this is where this person did this or that.  
And then I look at obviously teams that we're successful against them and
teams where they were really successful, knowing what you have to not do. So
obviously I always start with the most recent games.  
I've watched all their tournament games, obviously. And I kind of look at some
other games within their conference, of teams I'm familiar with and how they
defend.  
Are you asking me for those teams specifically? Honestly, like I always watch
how Notre Dame and UConn guard people, because I think‑‑ not that we do
everything the same way. I like to watch how Stanford guards people, not that
we do everything the same way, but you can get a sense of what they're trying
to do and how did that work.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2013

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kelly Faris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21810)

### [Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23275)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Connecticut, head coach Geno Auriemma,
student‑athletes Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis and Kelly Faris. We'll start with
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Proper pronunciation is Mosqueda. No, no, you got it right.
I'm glad you did. I don't know what that means in Mexican‑‑ that's Mexican for
something, but I'm not sure what it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Spanish. We have a question right here in the front row
(laughter).  
  
Q. Kelly, you and Skylar have been playing together summer All ‑Star teams
and U.S.A. Basketball. Could you describe the rivalry and maybe the mutual
respect you two earned over all these years?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, I don't think I'm the only one. I think quite a few have
played with a different people along the way that we come across. And it makes
it more fun. You always love playing people you know or grew up playing
against and you know their type of personality and how they are on the court.  
And she's a very competitive, smart player. So it just makes it that much more
fun to play.  
  
Q. This is for both the players. Coach during the middle of the season
seemed to indicate that this was not one of UConn's standards, one of the best
teams. Did that motivate you all in any way and did you think there was a
grain of truth in it?  
KELLY FARIS: I think he tries to get something out of us every single day.
With everything he says, he's constantly trying to get a response from us. So
when he makes comments like that, of course it's going to get under our skin a
little bit and make us want to prove him wrong. He's somebody that you want to
be on his side, and you want to gain his trust and his respect.  
So that's definitely something that we take to heart. But at the same time you
have to be careful not to let it get too much into your head. Use it for what
it's worth and for the positive.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Yeah, I agree with Kelly. We've been working toward
that all season, and I think we're finally starting to get the hang of it and
getting confident in ourselves and playing well.  
  
Q. Kelly and Kaleena, why do you expect tomorrow night to be different from
the three previous games we've seen you two play?  
KELLY FARIS: I think we've said it multiple times. I think coach says it a
lot. It's not about the Xs and Os between us. We know each other like it's the
back of our hand. We've played them so many times throughout the year.  
And this is it. This is one and done. And the stakes are high. So we just have
to learn from our past mistakes. And the games we've played against them we've
lost by‑‑ I don't know what the total point was, but it's not very many. And
we've had our opportunities and we just didn't finish it off.  
We know we're right there. And, like Kaleena said, we've been working really
hard to prepare for this game and building our confidence. I think we're in a
much better place than we were before.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Like Kelly said, the little things is what seem to
kill us in those games, in those big games and finishing them off. There's
spurts in the games before where we played great and we did everything we were
supposed to do. But when it came down to the wire, it just didn't end the way
we wanted it to.  
We've been working on making sure that didn't happen. We've putting ourselves
in positions like that in practice and being successful. And if it comes down
to that tomorrow, then we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Kelly, this is for you. As a senior, you come to UConn to win
championships, and you took one when you were a freshman. So much has been
made about Notre Dame losing in the last two years. What about the frustration
for you and your other seniors of not having any championships since then and
knowing now this is your last shot?  
KELLY FARIS: Obviously the past two years haven't ended the way we would have
liked. And I think the hardest part was to send the seniors out on that type
of note.  
So we know how it feels. And, like you said, this is it for us. And we don't
have another opportunity for the seniors to get it. And this is our last
chance. So we're going to leave everything out on the court and make the most
of it.  
  
Q. Kaleena, you went through this last year. Could you talk about how tough
it is for freshmen to go through that first year but also to develop the way
Breanna and Moriah are developing and to peak at the right time?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Yeah, it's definitely something that is a hard process
going through your freshman year, especially jumping from high school to
college basketball. It's just completely different. The game's faster. It's
more aggressive.  
But I think now they're definitely peaking when we need them to. They're
playing great and their confidence level is high. And regardless of what's
happened during the season, they've gotten better and they've risen to the
occasion at this point. This is when they need them most. The fact they're
playing great right now is awesome for our team.  
  
Q. Kaleena, being the fourth time you played Notre Dame, this week, leading
up to it, practice, film work, things like that, do you find that you're sharp
and intense and focused on them because you know them so well, or is it a
little bit ‑‑ I don't want to say maybe boredom set in about it?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: No, not boredom at all. Definitely still watching them
as intently as I did the first time, especially now it's a little easier to
watch film and know what I'm looking for having played them so many times.  
And just trying to make sure that, if anything, the mindset's right before we
go into the game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll start with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Kelly was referring to the fact that you say things that inspires the
players, either directly or to a third party that they hear and read and gets
them going. Muffet said today that she had read or heard something you said
before the Big East Tournament about Skylar and used that to motivate the team
to ‑‑ in the Big East championship game. You always say what's on your mind.
Are you ever worried that opponents might use it to their advantage?   
COACH AURIEMMA: I wish I was smart enough to do that because I don't remember
what it was that I said that inspired Skylar. But I'm glad I helped. I'll
always do whatever I can to motivate players.  
So whether they're on my team or the other team, I just want to be known as a
great motivator. I'm glad I'm still working on it. But I don't know what she's
talking about. I don't remember what I said. I wish I did.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Jefferson and Stewart are different
players now and how do you get freshmen to develop so they can thrive in the
tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know what the exact answer is to that question. A lot
of times the process has a lot to do with what each individual is made up of.
I didn't do anything with Kaleena last year from October to the Final Four
last year. I didn't do anything different. And this year, whether it's Moriah
or Breanna Stewart or Morgan Tuck, my approach wasn't any different. But their
personalities are much different than Kaleena's.  
So a lot of times it's how much are they able to handle and retain, what are
they able to let go off, how long can they keep their confidence. Those are
things that freshmen struggle with.  
And I think as coaches, you know, you try to evaluate that and you say, okay,
how much leeway can I give this particular freshman and how much do I have to
hold them back a little bit because they're not quite ready for it yet.  
And this year was a real struggle with all three of our freshmen, because so
much was expected of them to have to perform at a real high level. And maybe
they felt some of that throughout the season. And that doesn't exist anymore.
And I don't know if it's what I did as much as what they've done.  
  
Q. Along those lines, do you feel the start that Stewart had to be here and
her pedigree coming in maybe exacerbated what was a normal process for
freshmen to go through, that sort of the physicality picks up in December and
the conference play, the usual things happen? Do you think there was more made
of that than the normal freshman process for them to go through?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's nothing normal playing at Connecticut. So for Breanna,
everything she did that was really good‑‑ her first six or seven games,
everything she did was good. She was the greatest player to ever come to
Connecticut. Then everything she did that was bad, well, she's not as good as
everyone said she was.  
So when you're that highly skilled and highly talented and you come to
Connecticut, you're going to get to experience a little bit of everything. And
how you handle that in the end is going to determine how good a player you
are.  
And certainly in five months Breanna Stewart has gone through everything you
can imagine. Being called better than Maya Moore and being looked at as you'll
never be a great player until junior year. So takes a pretty strong type of
person to play basketball at Connecticut.  
  
Q. (Off microphone) and for what it produces this year it seems like there's
a collective entity here, it kind of shifts and moves. How is that different
for the program to have that than in the past where there's not an
identifiable personality around for which everything might move?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, we weren't fortunate enough to have any of the three to
see that ESPN talks about all the time. So we had to do it as a group rather
than rely on one person.  
But that's always been the case at Connecticut. We don't build our program
around one person, no matter who that is. We don't aspire to be that, when we
have players like Tina and Maya and Renee and Diana and Sue and Sveta and
Shea, and I could go on and on. It was always in the context of we'll let them
decide, each player, how big their role is going to be.  
And because of their personalities and how big their personalities were, they
just became superstars. And we don't have anybody with that personality this
year. We just don't. Kaleena Lewis has the kind of basketball game, the kind
of skill level that if she had a different type of personality she would be
like Maya or like Diana in terms of how she would act, but she doesn't have
that yet. Maybe she'll get it next year.  
But, you know, you just have to kind of take advantage of what you have. And
this year's been frustrating and rewarding, because it's been collectively.
And collectively when we're good, we're really, really good.  
And the four losses that we had this year can be in some ways directly
attributed to that one person in the past who in the last two minutes decides
the game. And it's taken us a long time to figure out who that is.  
  
Q. Kelly sort of alluded to this, but in terms of late ‑game execution, are
there things that you can do in practice to get your team better for late‑game
execution against an opponent like Notre Dame where ultimately that's really
been the difference?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, I was talking to somebody else the other day and
when we were up 5 in overtime and still unfortunately missed those free
throws, we went back to practice and I put the time on the clock and made a
triple overtime and still we made 15 in a row. So next year I'm going to
practice really hard on our guys making free throws in late‑game situations
because that's all about coaching, you know.  
And I said this 100 times. If Stewy makes those free throws, I'm a great
coach; if Stewy misses them, then I'm an ass. So many of those things
basically come down to something as simple as every one of our games, one
possession or one play ends up being a difference, like you said.  
And it may be the exact same outcome Sunday night. I have no idea. I have no
idea. I love the play they ran, though, at the end of regulation at their
place, when we're up 3, and they would double team Skylar and she throws it to
Kayla McBride who dribbles to the 3‑point line and ties the game. I don't know
why I can't think of that. One of these days I'll have that play. Just give it
to the guy, let 'em dribble to the 3‑point line and shoot it.  
  
Q. Geno, Kaleena and Stefanie were named to the WBCA team today. Your
thoughts on that honor and being rewarded for the work they put in?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I think every kid goes to college, whether it's
Notre Dame or Connecticut or Louisville or Cal, with goals: I want to win
national championships, I want to be an All‑American, I want all these things.
But unfortunately it doesn't happen for everybody. And when it does happen,
you're thrilled because you know how hard they have to work to make that
happen, that it was a goal of theirs from the time they were in high school
and that they're fortunate enough to play on the kind of team that allows for
them to play like All‑Americans.  
And both Stefanie and Kaleena deserve to be on that All‑American team this
year. Just like Bria deserved to be on it last year. And the other eight
players that were named on that team, the same with them. I don't think
there's anybody on that ten‑member team that you would say, you know, somebody
else should have made it than them. I thought it was the absolute perfect ten.
They did a great job.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the job Muffet did this season and just
what attributes have enabled her to be successful in the profession?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, everyone assumed that because you graduate three
starters like they did that your team is going to really suffer the following
year. And in the normal situation, they might have. But when you've got a
guard like Skylar Diggins who can miss eight shots in a row and then when it's
time to make the next four she makes the next four. And I think people maybe
underestimated just how much of an impact someone like that can have on your
team.  
I know it's the same thing when we lost our four starters and Diana was the
only starter coming back and everybody said now we'll get them. You don't
underestimate just how good a great guard can do.  
The other thing that I've seen happen is I think Muffet's really good at
taking advantage of what her players are really good at. She puts them in
situations where they can be successful. They're not running an offense that
doesn't fit their players. They're not playing a defense that doesn't suit
their style of play. She's really smart. She keeps her composure on the
sidelines.  
They're as prepared if not better prepared than any team we play all long
year. And it's been like that for a long, long time. And that's what allows
you to be in a position where you are now. Muffet's doing the same thing this
year that she's been doing the last 20 years, but when you have the kind of
guard that she has right now, all that stuff that you've been doing for 20
years now you go to three straight Final Fours because you now have the
absolute perfect person to run the stuff that you run and lead the team that
you put together. So it's not like she just all of a sudden stumbled on being
a great coach.  
  
Q. Two questions. First of all, have you done anything special this week to
either challenge or, your players being so familiar with the other team,
change up your game plan? And, secondly, how much thought have you given to
scheduling on down the line when so much of your conference goes away, and
might even ‑‑ two years from now might even want to play‑‑ consider playing an
independent schedule like Louisiana Tech did 20, 25 years ago?  
COACH AURIEMMA: This week we didn't do anything other than try to get ready
for hopefully two games. Our practices were mostly about what we need to be
really good at Sunday night and what changes we want to make for Sunday night,
based on the other four games that we play or three games that we played
against Notre Dame this year.  
In terms of the future, I don't know what the future holds. I don't think
anybody else does either. The conference that we're going into is for us a
great opportunity. And the thought of us being out there and independent,
women's basketball program, that's never entered my mind. That's not something
I would want to do. I don't think in today's day and age you can function like
that. I think being in a conference is ultimately the best thing for our
program, and I don't see that changing.  
  
Q. Geno, is there a difference between the way your team will approach
experience ‑‑ prepare for this experience than Cal? You guys six times in a
row and they've never been here. What is the spectrum of that experience when
you come in with a difference like that?   
COACH AURIEMMA: I was just saying this to Chris Dailey today, that I looked
around and I said: I can't believe this is 14 Final Fours for us. Because I
remember in 1991, our first. And it was here in New Orleans at Lakefront Arena
and 8,000 people at the game. And I remember how we acted relative to how we
act now. And we showed up and it was different than any other game
preparation, different from anything else we had done.  
And then at halftime we're down 10 and we're in the locker room and we're
like, damn, the pain started already. And it's halftime.  
I'm sure there's so much going on with Cal's kids right now that by the time
the game comes around, because of the hoopla that exists here now, it's way
more than it was in 1991, it will be‑‑ that will be the only thing that's
normal is when the actual game begins. Because everything else leading up to
that is something that they've never imagined or ever experienced.  
But when the ball goes up Sunday, that will be the only thing that's familiar
to them. And that's probably the way it should be. You should have as much fun
as you can and when the game starts go back to what you've always done, play
basketball.  
But I hope the experience that we're trying to provide for our players is not
that much different. We're not locked up in a hotel room watching film 24
hours a day. And we're not practicing three hours a day in different spots.
And we're enjoying where we are. And we're enjoying what we're doing. And
we'll be ready to play Sunday night, just like the other three teams will be.  
  
Q. Coach, to sort of follow up on that, do these things ever become routine
because you've done so many of them, or do you still get the buzz out of it? I
know it can't quite be like Cal doing it for the first time. But can you still
get that enjoyment out of it, emotionally that this is still a big deal to
make a Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Leading up to this is getting harder and harder for me
every year, not‑‑ being at the Final Four is still fun. It's still great. It's
easy. When you're here, you know your team deserves to be here. You know
you're going to play well. You know you're playing a great team.  
For me, it's gotten harder and harder to enjoy the process leading up to this.
And Lindsay doesn't know it yet, but 10 years from now she's going to look
back on this year and go, man, that's when it all turned for me. I used to
love this game (laughter).  
  
Q. Geno, where would you put your interest in playing Notre Dame, obviously
not next year, but the year after that and in the future? Is that something
that you and Muffet and both schools would work to have just because of its
importance as an overall rivalry for the game?  
A.Yeah, if you look at our schedule now, this year, I think as the preseason
top 10 teams, I think we played‑‑ I want to say all of them at one point or
another. And that's kind of been our philosophy during the regular season for
a long time now.  
So once we get this conference thing squared away and once we get our
scheduling in order, I would venture to say that there's going to be a lot of
interest in playing that game. I'm sure on our part and their part. I would
think.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining
us for our fourth and final call this afternoon with our women's final four
head coaches. Joining us for this particular segment is Jeff Walz, the head
coach of the University of Louisville. Jeff and the Cardinals will be playing
California this coming Sunday in the national semifinal game of the 2013
Women's Final Four in New Orleans.  
At this time, before we take your questions, I'd like to invite Carolayne
Henry who is chair of the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Committee and
Senior Associate Commissioner of the Mountain West Conference to say some
welcome remarks. Carolayne?  
CAROLAYNE HENRY: Thanks, Rick. Jeff, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to the
University of Louisville, pronunciation notwithstanding, and congratulate you
and your team on an outstanding season and for making it to the 2013 Women's
Final Four. I look forward to seeing you in New Orleans, and good luck.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Jeff, if you would, just a quick opening statement and then
we'll go to questions.  
COACH WALZ: First like to thank everyone there. We're just honored to be one
of the four teams remaining. It's been a crazy two weeks for us. Just really
excited with the way we're playing right now with the effort that our young
ladies have given us, not just during the games, but in practice, both
mentally and physically.  
We're a group right now that I think has done things that no one thought could
be done, and we're going to continue to grow with what has gotten us where we
are right now, and hopefully, be able to find a way to win a game or two more.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what is your style of coaching? What is the line that you
find of how far you can push players and how you push them? What was your
learning curve with that and figuring out the point which you started to get
diminishing returns?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I was fortunate enough to work six years for Paul
Sanderford, two years at Western Kentucky and four at Nebraska, and Paul took
three Western Kentucky teams to the final four back when he was there. I just
really learned and watched from him. He was very demanding on his players in
practice, but most importantly, I saw how much he cared about them not only on
the floor but off the floor. The relationships that he was able to build with
them that they put their trust in him and they believed in him. They knew that
even though there were some really tough days at practice that he was just
trying to get the best out of them to hopefully show them that they can
achieve more than they even think they can. That's really where I learned it
from.  
I became a big believer that you can really get these college students, these
18 to 22‑year‑olds, to do more than they ever dreamed they could if they know
you care about them, if they know you genuinely are there for them.  
So when we step on the court, our players know it's basketball. It's all about
basketball, and we have a job to do. But they also know when we step off the
court, I'm there whatever they need. We're going to laugh. We're going to
joke. They're going to make fun of my stuttering. I'm going to make fun of
their hair if I have to, whatever it might be. We're very sarcastic, and we
like to laugh and have fun.  
When you can do that off the floor and be able to switch it and understand,
hey, when basketball stuff starts, it's time for practice. We've been able to
have some success here, and we're going to continue to do that, and hopefully
the success will continue to follow.  
  
Q. How concerned are you with their ability to rebound, particularly the
offensive rebounds? Your team being one that likes to get the ball and go.
Also, would you talk about the intriguing match ‑ups that will take place?   
COACH WALZ: Yes, their ability to rebound the basketball is something else. I
was really impressed with them as we watched the Georgia‑Cal game. I think
they came up with an unbelievable 27 offensive rebounds. They're relentless.
They're ball hawkers, as we like to say. They just hawk the ball. They're
going after it. Their number one goal is to get it, and they won't settle
unless they do. So we were very concerned about that.  
We know we're going to have to make that a focus of ours, a concentrated focus
and putting a body on somebody every time a shot's taken.  
Guard‑play‑wise, it's going to be fun. I think they've got one of the best
guards that I've seen in a long time in Clarendon, and I've been really
impressed with her ability to shoot the three, her pull‑up jumpshot, and just
her demeanor on the court. She really is a comforting influence for their
entire team.  
Then you've got Brittany Boyd that is a very, very solid player, does a nice
job of taking care of the basketball. Both of them have 100 assists and more.
So when you've got two players on your team that Clarendon has 100 assists and
Boyd has 150, I think it says a lot about their abilities to not only handle
the ball, but they can distribute it and get it to people in the right spots
to be able to score.  
  
Q. So far you've been called an answer man because you have an answer for
everything. Just talk about having a week to prepare, but 48 hours before
you're back out on the floor to have an answer for the next team?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I wouldn't say it's so much that we have an answer. What
we've been able to do is score the basketball the past three games.
Everybody's‑‑ I've had great emails and great text messages and phone calls
telling us what a great job defensively we did against Baylor, and I kindly
remind everybody that I talk to that we held them to 81 points. They average
81 points, so we did average. They score 81, and that's exactly what they were
scoring on average for the entire season.  
The difference is they normally only give up 51, and we found a way to score
82. So our ability to score the basketball right now, to me, is a bigger
influence on the way we're playing than us being able to defend people. We
score 86 points last night against a very good defensive Tennessee team.  
So we're going to have a game plan. That's the part of the game that I love
the most. I love the strategy part of it. I love trying to figure out what can
we do to possibly get someone off balance? Then you try to think what are they
going to do to try to get us off balance? And that's where I enjoy sitting
down and watching film and just trying to dissect their games and figure out
when they watch us, what do they think our weaknesses are?  
So it's a lot of fun to do that, but at the same time, as I've said over and
over, I haven't made a shot in my entire career as a coach and I haven't
gotten a rebound or come up with a steal. You've got to have players that are
willing to go out there and follow the game plan and do some unorthodox things
at times.  
When you put four on defense and send one back, which we were going to do for
the first possession against Baylor, just to try to get some excitement and
try to get our team believing, hey, we can do some things and it's going to
work. Right now, I think our players do believe in our coaching staff, believe
in our game plans, and we're going to continuing to with that and hopefully it
will work when we have to go up and play California.  
  
Q. If you can quickly talk about the Schimmel sisters?  
COACH WALZ: The Schimmel sisters are a good group of two great kids. It's been
fun to coach them. They're playing great basketball right now. Shoni's really
been shooting the ball well and been passing it. And Jude is just, I mean,
she's so steady with the ball. She played 30 minutes last night, had three
assists and one turnover against a lot of pressure. Tennessee was trying to
pressure and come at her, and she with stood that very, very well.  
They're fun. I like how they play and that's why I recruited them. I want kids
that want to come in here and know they're going to get the chance to play.
You're going to get a chance to run up‑and‑down the floor. From Shoni's
freshman year to her junior year she now knows, okay, when can I try that
no‑look, off the ear pass? If we've turned it over two straight times, it's
not the right time to try it. But we're still giving her the freedom to play,
and I think that's what makes her so special.  
I tell her all the time, you're talented enough to play anywhere, but you
couldn't go play for just anybody. Because I know sometimes she might throw
one up into the crowd but I also know she's got the ability to come down off
the break and shoot one from 24 feet that some people might think is a bad
shot, but that's her game and you've got to be willing to let players play
their game if you're going to be successful.  
  
Q. When you went to the Final Four for the first time in 2009, can you talk
about how immediate the impact was in terms of recruiting, visibility, how
different it felt when you went out after having been there? And how you think
now Cal is doing for the first time, how that can impact their program?  
COACH WALZ: It was great for our program, because it puts you on a national
stage. It puts your name out there. It lets everybody know that you are a
program. It's hard anymore to just have one team. Like in '09 you had a great
team, and that's it, and then you weren't heard of again.  
I think Cal, Lindsay has done a great job of building and continuing to grow
that program. And this is only going to help their recruiting, and I'm hoping
it continues to help ours. Because, as we all know, that is the name of the
game. You've got to find players that believe in what you're doing and want to
be at your University. I'm a big believer in that.  
If you've got to try to convince a kid this is why, this is what you do, this
is why you should come here and you're begging them to come. Well, once they
get there, those aren't the ones that give their heart and soul. So when we
try to go out and kind of players that want to be a Louisville Cardinal, and
those are the ones that are going to give you everything they have.  
So there is no doubt in my mind that it's going to help both our programs to
continue to grow and hopefully we'll both be able to go out and find some top
10, top 15 players.  
  
Q. You talked about offensive creativity and players being able to play.
Doesn't mean undisciplined, but they're able to make some choices out on the
court. It strikes me that Connecticut and Notre Dame have similar type styles
and I think they're harder to defend because of that. Do you think that's a
big thing going forward in women's basketball for coaches to be able to help
players play that way?  
COACH WALZ: Yes, I do. I think it's very important, and at the same time, I
think as a coach you have to be able to give your players freedom to play. But
you have to make sure your players understand what's going on in the game,
what the time and score is.  
I love watching Geno's teams play because of how they play. But at the same
time I don't think you're going to see Kelly Faris or somebody coming down the
floor and shoot a 25‑footer 1 on 4. You know, that's freedom, but we hopefully
aren't going to do that either.  
So you teach them how to play. You teach them time and score and then you give
them freedom within that. That's something that we really have been working on
here and our players are really starting to understand the more educated they
get about the game of basketball, understanding what's going on at this
certain time, you're going to be able to do a lot more. Then I don't have to
call as many plays. I don't have to direct us in what we're doing.  
And that's what we really did our two games at Oklahoma City. That's why when
I said we're going to play street ball, that's what that meant. We're not
going to worry about hopefully having to run a bunch of offense. We're going
to drive and kick, make the extra pass, find a shooter and score, and that's
what we were able to do for two straight games.  
  
Q. I hope you'll indulge me asking a question about a player who is not on
your team but you've seen play a couple of times. What impresses you most
about what Jewell Lloyd has been able to do for Notre Dame as a freshman
coming in and starting 34 out of 35, and filling some big holes?  
COACH WALZ: Well, Jewell's done a great job for them. Her strength, her
stamina is really what's impressed me, because a lot of freshmen, when you're
playing as many minutes as she is, the toll and the wear of the season just
kind of breaks you down because you're not used to it.  
As I tell all my freshmen, I sit them down before they go home for Christmas
and we go to the board and talk about, how many high school games did you
play? How many hours did you practice each day? Did you get two days off? And
we go through that. For 90% of them they've played more basketball before
Christmas break their freshman year in college than they did their entire
senior season.  
So what impressed me about Jewell is just her ability to sustain her endurance
and to be able to continue night‑in and night‑out to go out there and perform
at the level she's performed without looking tired.  
  
Q. You've knocked off No. 4, No. 2, and No. 1 Baylor in your bracket. Now
you're getting into the Final Four and you're kind of seen as the underdog.
But what have those wins against the higher seeds done for your team's
confidence?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think we're at a point right now where we do believe if we
show up and compete and follow game plan and believe in each other, we can
beat anybody. But, at the same time, we also know if we don't show up and
we're not all on the same page, we're able to be beaten by anybody. We're just
not talented enough to just go out there, roll the ball out and say, hey,
let's play.  
We have to go out with a plan. Our players have done a fantastic job of
following the game plan. We're going to know player tendencies. We do our
scouting based on player tendencies. What this player likes to do. We have to
try to take that away.  
Our game last night I thought we did a really nice job in the first half. Now
in the second half, Taber Spani drove left every time she got the ball and
scored, and that was on our scouting report. Don't let her go left. Don't let
her go left. But we didn't do a good job of that, and that's something that
we'll talk to our players about. Hopefully we'll be able to do a better job of
that for 40 minutes against Cal.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you were able to come to the Sugar Bowl earlier this
year and watch Louisville, and if you were able to take anything away from
that victory? They were a big underdog against Florida and had a great game
and Louisville just kind of took over New Orleans. Were you able to watch that
and is that something you can translate to your team?  
COACH WALZ: Unfortunately, I was not able to go down to the game since it's
right in the middle of our season. But we did watch the game. We watched from
start to finish, and were just so impressed with how Charlie had those guys so
prepared and so mentally focused to play and came out and threw the first
punch.  
That's kind of what we talked about with our kids. When you're playing teams
like we're playing, you have to be the aggressor. You have to come out and try
to get it going from the beginning, instead of trying to fight your way back
upstream.  
We learned a lot from watching them. We watch our men play a lot. We love how
they play, how they compete and how they attack the entire time. And we try to
take things away from both of those teams and implement them in our program.  
  
Q. How much of you saying Louisville as the ugly ducklings crashing the
party, nobody believed we'd be here, is a true feeling of being an outsider
versus you playing an us ‑against‑the‑world card to motivate your team?   
COACH WALZ: I think it's a little bit of both. You're always trying to find a
way to motivate your team. But I'm not sure if you filled out a bracket, but
did you have us beating Baylor?  
  
Q. I did not have you beating Baylor.  
COACH WALZ: Okay. And I'd love to know of the bracket that's were filled out
on ESPN how many had us beating Baylor.  
  
Q. I'm going to say less than 1%.  
COACH WALZ: Okay. So I think it's fair to say we're the party crashers is a
legitimate saying. I think we are. If somebody had us beating Baylor, did they
really have us beating whoever that next team might be? And last night, it was
Tennessee.  
Even as we beat Baylor, I'm not sure anybody thought we could come back on
24‑hour rest and beat a very talented Tennessee team that had been beating
everybody in the NCAA Tournament by about 18 points.  
  
Q. I think that's fair.  
COACH WALZ: That's why we go with it. We're going to try to go with it and run
with it and see where it can take us.  
  
Q. We were talking to Lindsay a little earlier, and I think she said you
guys maybe first got to know each other when she was an assistant at Richmond
and you were at Maryland. She talked about your ability to get players to
believe in whatever you tell them. She said if you told them they'll come down
from the moon and run around in circles, they'd do that. That you just have
that ability. Can you talk a little bit about getting to know her a little bit
and maybe what you think her biggest strengths are as a head coach?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, she was an assistant at Richmond and I was an assistant at
Maryland when our paths first crossed. It's kind of funny, because we were
both out at the Final Four last year, and actually were at a little get
together and we sat next to each other at dinner and just had a really nice
conversation just about basketball and life and family for that entire time.
Now all of a sudden we're going to end up playing each other in the first
semifinal game.  
I'm just really impressed with how she's been able to go into a program and
continue to build it. I think it's very similar to what we've done here. We
did not walk into a situation where the cabinet was bare. We talked into Angel
McCoughtry, Candace Bingham and just took them to the next step, the next rung
on the ladder. And Lindsay has done that exact same thing.  
She went in and had some very nice players and brought in some more of her
own, and now they've got them taking her personality, and that's one of we're
going to continue to attack. We're not going to give up. We're relentless. We
get on the floor after 50‑50 balls.  
I've just been really impressed with the little bit of film I've been able to
watch right now of how they don't quit.  
  
Q. Where is Monique Reid physically compared to the player who scored 18
points a game in 2009 and 2010, and kind of along with that, showing players
how she feels off the court about them. How has your relationship with her
kind of changed over the years as she's dealt with a lot of physical
adversity?  
COACH WALZ: Mo's probably, I can honestly say, she's probably 50%. She played
33 minutes last night, which is the most she's played this entire season, I
believe. I just admire her because she just is willing to continue to fight.  
When she came back from her micro fracture surgery from last season, we knew
it was going to be a situation where we're going to just have to monitor her
playing time, monitor her practicing, and just see how the knee responded.  
I felt we did a really good job of that in the non‑conference. She was playing
14, 15 minutes a game. Some games she might play 20. Then we get into
conference, she was doing well, and then, boom, she goes down in practice and
has that same knee, reinjured it, has to go get a scope done and had it
cleaned up. They basically said at that point in time, you need more surgery.
We can do it now. You're finished for the year. Or we can wait until the end
of the year and see if you can't manage your pain and the swelling until it's
finished.  
There was no doubt in my mind what she was going to choose, and that is she
wanted to play, and that's what she's done for our program.  
She's the only player in our program history that played in two Final Fours.
When she steps on the court for our next game, she will have surpassed Angel
McCoughtry for games played here at Louisville.  
So it's been fun to watch her, especially her freshman year because she was an
important part of our Final Four run. Sophomore year, she's first team All Big
East. Her junior year, I believe, she was first team All Big East. Then gets
hurt her senior year. Comes back for her fifth year, and she's able to fight
through it.  
Our relationship has grown each year. You know, when she came in as a
freshman, I had to get the most out of her. I had to try to get more out of
her than she ever thought she had in her as a freshman, because I knew what
she needed to bring us with the group that we had. We had Angel McCoughtry,
Candice Bingham, and I needed two more players and it ended up being Monique
Reid, and Becky who did a great job of filling those roles.  
So she's continued to mature. She's continued to grow. I think she's learned
as most of my players do after their freshman and sophomore years, hey, coach
is one way at practice. But he'll do anything for us when we step off that
court.  
Then, for a fifth‑year senior, she's also learned if she goes hard, I really
don't say too much to you. So she's decided to go hard now.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say your conference schedule prepared you well for this
national tournament, and what do you think of the idea that you can't win it
all without beating one of those teams again?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think our conference schedule, just the Big East itself is
just a great league. To be the last year of it as the existence we have now to
have three of us playing in the Final Four, I think it speaks volumes for what
the women's programs are all about.  
When you go back and look at the men and women, you have five of the eight
teams are Big East schools. So I'd say the Big East had a pretty good year in
both men's and women's basketball.  
For us, we know if we're fortunate enough to get past Cal, we'll have to play
either Notre Dame or UCONN, and it's going to have to be a situation where we
come out with the same type of focus that we had when we played Baylor in
Tennessee. Because we haven't had much success against UCONN or Notre Dame.  
So we're going to have to get our mindsets changed, if we are fortunate enough
to get to that game, to be able to go out there and try to make that as
competitive game as we can.  
  
Q. Do you think you have an advantage to play a team that you don't see that
often in the tournament?  
COACH WALZ: I enjoy that myself. I enjoy playing teams that you don't get to
see that much because I think that makes the chess game even more exciting.
Because now you watch them on film. You're like, she's pretty quick. Then you
get a chance to actually get there in person, and it's like, oh, she's quicker
than I thought she was, or she might be slower than you thought she was.  
But we'll have the opportunity to play Cal, who, we obviously have not played.
Then, if we're fortunate enough, we'll have to face Notre Dame or UCONN team
that's very familiar with us and we'll be familiar with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Walz, thank you for joining us. Look forward to seeing
you in New Orleans.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you very much. Sure appreciate it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Muffet McGraw. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH McGRAW: This has been a dream season for us. I think when you looked at
us in the beginning of the year, nobody predicted us to be in the Final Four,
and certainly the improvement we've made throughout the year.  
But how well we've played throughout the year has been just so fun to watch.
Skylar Diggins leading the team in just about every way possible, but great
performances by Kayla McBride and Natalie Achonwa and Jewell Lloyd. We've had
some fun along the way and we're so blessed to be back for the third time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Looking statistically, and statistics can be used however you want, but
in some ways it looks, Jewell Lloyd actually played more games as a freshman
than Skylar did. I know point guard adjustment is much bigger. But can you
just talk about how fast Jewell adjusted to the enormous role you've given her
and maybe even compare it to how Skylar adjusted? That's the first part. The
second part, you could have three good looks at Morgan Tuck, particularly in
the triple overtime game. I just wonder what impresses you most about her.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, Jewell's progress throughout the year was really
tremendous. She really came in as an immediate starter. I think the first day
of practice it was pretty obvious that she was that good and that ready.  
She started out the year well with a career high against Baylor December5th. I
think she went through a little bit of what most freshman go through where
there are a little bit of ups and downs along the way as you're just getting
used to the rigors of the college basketball season.  
But she has really come through late in the year, which surprises me because a
lot of freshmen hit the wall in February and don't really recover past that.
But she has been tremendous.  
And I think a lot of it is because of Skylar. I think when you have veteran
players around you, they make it easier for her to do her job. And we try not
to give her too much early on.  
I think obviously not playing the point you don't have as much responsibility.
So I think it was easy for her to make that adjustment.  
And I think Morgan Tuck has really improved throughout the season. And she is
coming into a starting position. I think that she's a very good post player.
She can score around the basket, and she can face up as well but her
rebounding and her inside game I think are really good.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just the fact that teams like you and UConn and some
others, even a Stanford that has really become very adept at what I would say
is read and react offenses and I know you guys have said but have players who
can freelance and can react and how that makes it difficult for defenses to
stop you. And then the second question is if we have a Final Four first ‑timer
in Cal, if you can sort of talk about what it meant to your program back in'97
to make that Final Four breakthrough and how you build on that after you get
that spotlight?  
COACH McGRAW: The Princeton offense is a really fun offense to play in because
it's all reacting to the defense. I think there was so many options. There's
never a point where you have to go from A to B. There's always different
options and the ability for the guards especially to be creative and to play
to their strengths and to move without the ball, I think, is it's a great
offense for this particular team because they are such smart basketball
players they read the defense so well. And it's effective against man and
zone.  
So I think the transition game into the Princeton offense gives my players a
chance to use their own creativity. I don't like when the point guard looks
over and says what are you going to run. And fortunately I don't have to worry
about that because Sky pretty much can make up her own mind. So we've been
blessed there.  
I don't like a team that runs a lot of sets. I want it to be more of an open
game.  
Second question, I think going to the Final Four for the first time is an
unbelievable experience that you just treasure. The first one is always
special. You remember that team, those players, those kids and just the joy,
especially when you've overachieved to get there. When you're a team that was
not the No. 1 seed and yet you still managed to get there, I think it makes it
even more special. And I think they're going to enjoy them mentally.  
  
Q. Couple of years ago lost three times to UConn and turned the tables at
this point in the Final Four. Now that's kind of reversed. I'm wondering, was
there a mental obstacle that you and your team had to get over that year and
if that's the case how did we do it? And then this year do you feel like you
have a mental edge because of the three wins over UConn?  
COACH McGRAW: We beat them in 2001 and won the national championship, I think
that was a big moment for us to finally get to that point and to win a
national title upsetting UConn in the semifinal. And I think that game
certainly gave us and our program kind of a great momentum swing.  
And in the last couple of years, I guess the last two years, we faced them and
come out with the win. And I think we just‑‑ we go into the game with a lot of
confidence and we know it's going to be a battle. But I don't think there's an
edge really either way.  
I think coming into the last two games we won a couple. We lost one. And I
don't think we felt any differently than we feel right now.  
  
Q. You had talked a little bit about Morgan Tuck. The other two Connecticut
freshmen have really stepped up their game in the NCAA Tournament. You haven't
seen a lot in the three games this season of Moriah Jefferson. Can you just
talk a little bit about what the improved play of those two freshmen mean in
terms of giving you guys different looks and what you're most concerned about
when they have like Jefferson and Hartley on the court at the same time?  
COACH McGRAW: Jefferson gives them speed that they didn't have before. I think
she is somebody that can really get up and guard the ball, and she can make
the offense run a lot faster, because she just is so quick and she really
likes, seems to like the transition game.  
So she presents some problems because she puts their game at a little higher
pace. Breanna Stewart I think is just a great shot blocker. I think that's the
thing she does better than anything. She's really been that all year long.
Somebody that can really change your shots around the basket and she's playing
much better offensively now, which gives them just another person that can
really score.  
  
Q. This Sunday there will be two Hoosiers on the floor together for the last
time in Skylar and Kelly Faris, and they both really elevated themselves to a
pretty exalted position in storied programs. And I wonder if you have any
thoughts on those two and what they've done and how they've represented their
schools?  
COACH McGRAW: I certainly have a lot of thoughts on Skylar. Miss basketball,
state champion in Indiana. To stay home has meant a lot to everybody in the
state of Indiana. Certainly up here in the community it's been amazing the
support that we've gotten.  
And I think people like the home‑ talent. They appreciate that kids stay close
to home. When we went to Indianapolis for the Final Four we got a huge crowd.
The entire state was cheering for us. So I think it's a bonus to have a player
like that stay close to home and help us grow our fan base and create more
interest in the women's game. And to be Player of the Year candidate the past
couple of years, Player of the Year in the Big East, it's just brought even
more notoriety to women's basketball and certainly to the state of Indiana.  
Kelly Faris has had a fantastic career at UConn, and she's had tremendous
success there, and I'm sure that they will miss her next year.  
  
Q. Do you have a favorite Skylar story?  
COACH McGRAW: No, I don't think I have one. I just enjoy her so much, the way
she pops in the office every day and staff meetings, sits down and asks what
we're working on. I think she's just been so involved in what we're doing at
every level, that it's been really fun.  
She's a very different type of player in that she‑‑ I could see her being a
coach. I would really look at hiring her one day on my staff because she has
that kind of basketball IQ basketball. And I think we relate in a little
different way than with most players. And I've really enjoyed that.  
  
Q. It's just her sitting with you and the coaches?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah. Not for a long period of time. She pops in on the to the
training room, locker room, hey, what are we doing today? And five minutes.
It's not a long time, but it's just interesting.  
  
Q. Going back to the idea of playing them for the fourth time. Two years ago
when you were on the other end, you said, quote, it's difficult; I hope to
beat a team four times. I'm assuming that you're hoping you're wrong at this
point?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it's tough to beat a team three times. It's tough to beat
a team two times. And the battles we have had this year have gone back and
forth and down to the wire. Every one of them. So we've really done some
really great things at the end of the game to win the game. We've made some
huge plays. When you look back at every game, whether it was a defensive stop
or a huge basket or something good, we've been able to make something happen
at the end.  
So we would certainly hope that the karma continues.  
  
Q. You faced Geno's teams many times. Is there a common thread or trademark
that you think all the teams have in common and also can you talk a little bit
about the rivalry, is there a rivalry between you and he?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, all his teams are really talented. I mean, they get great
players. They've had No. 1 player, they've got Lewis and then Stewart, best
player in the country.  
So they've always had great talent. He's a very good coach offensively. I
think the way their team moves and the style of game they play I think really
fits what he has. He tinkers with it year to year based on what he has. I
think they're really strong defensively. They're a very good defensive team.
They rebound. They do everything really well. He's a really good coach.  
I don't know that there's any trademark, except that they're really talented
and very well coached.  
And do you see, do you have a competitiveness between the two of you?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we're both competitive. I think it's been quite a
rivalry. In the last few years, I think it's gotten even more competitive.  
  
Q. Going back to when the bracket came out, it couldn't have come out as too
much of a surprise where teams were seeded, did you think: Couldn't we at
least be in opposite brackets so we don't make it to the championship game, or
is it you play them when you get to them?  
COACH McGRAW: I do think that. I thought the way the bracket was set up, it
was interesting to see we have to play Duke who was the next No. 1 seed, I
thought, the highest No. 2 seed.  
So I was curious as to how we ended up playing Duke and yet in the top four
lines they said, oh, you're the 2 and they're the 3 so you have to play. So it
didn't work that way the rest of the way through.  
So I was hoping that it would be a championship meeting as opposed to the
semifinal, we've played them three years in a row now and it would be nice to
play somebody else.  
  
Q. Also being familiar with Louisville. What did it take for Louisville to
beat Daly?  
COACH McGRAW: Unbelievable. That was just a remarkable offensive performance
by their team the way they shot the 3. And that was the only way they had to
win. That was their chance. They were much smaller.  
They spread the floor and shoot 3s. And they made them and set the NCAA state
record, and that was about the only way they could have won that game. And it
was a masterful plan.  
Defensively they did a really great job. And a lot of pressure on the No. 1
seed when it gets down to late in the game, if you can stay in the game with
them, it was difficult for them to come back from all that, and they had all
that energy to come back in the game and then Louisville makes it by making
two free throws from one of their seniors who had a great career for them.  
So what a great finish. And I think a great thing for the game to see a team
that didn't think they could be beat to get beaten and have some new teams in
the Final Four.  
  
Q. Realize some conferences are changing but what are your thoughts on
seeing three Big East teams this year in the Final Four? Is it surprise?
Delight? Pride? Annoyance?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled for the Big East. I think it
proves we were the best conference. I don't think that there was any question
when you have two No. 1 seeds coming out of the same conference but to see
Louisville join us in the Final Four I think shows what depth and strength we
had in the Big East.  
And it's a little sad to think that next year we'll be gone, the year after
Louisville be gone. A shame it has to end but a way to go out. And we're very,
very happy and take a lot of pride in that.  
  
Q. Two questions about Skylar: Was there ever a moment when you realized how
much of a difference ‑maker she could be for the program? And have you noticed
a change in her intensity, her sense of urgency in this tournament compared
even relative to the last few tournaments she's been in?  
COACH McGRAW: I think I noticed her arrival on the national scene starting in
the Big East tournament her sophomore year and continued through the NCAA
tournament in the game where we beat Oklahoma and then Tennessee to advance to
the Final Four. I think that was the moment that she really stood out and
became the iconic symbol of our team and what she's done for the game of
basketball, I think she started to really understand her position and what she
could do, what she was capable of.  
And I think the last two games she has been unbelievable. I think she always
has a sense of urgency a drive to win but the way she's playing, she's managed
to somehow relax and play and have fun and at the same time have the
tremendous drive and sense of urgency. So she's in a really great place right
now.  
  
Q. I think when somebody becomes for lack of a better word the "it" girl in
a sport, it sort of chooses them. It's not like Skylar's just chosen to be the
center of attention; it shows her. She's a great player. But she has all this
charisma, all these other things. Can you tell us how she's handled that,
because seems like she has wonderful relationships with her teammates, it
hasn't caused any chemistry problems. But that's a lot to put on somebody
besides just playing basketball, to be really one of the faces of her sport at
a young age?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it's a tremendous burden to be placed on a player at
that age. And somehow she has embraced it. I think she talked to Ruth Riley
years ago, like after her freshman year, maybe, when just about what it's like
to be the one that everybody's talking about. And Skylar's in a completely
different generation now with social media and how that has blown up to her
Twitter account numbers.  
But I've been so impressed with the way she handled it. But I haven't really
been surprised because when she was going into ninth grade, I sat her in my
office and offered her a scholarship and she was so poised and mature at that
point, I thought this girl is just going to be special, and she really has
done unbelievable things, I think, for the women's game.  
  
Q. What are the ways you think she's most improved this season and how has
she most impressed you with the way she's developed her game?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think she has become a very confident scorer and
somebody who has welcomed the opportunity to be one of the leading scorers on
our team. I think last year she was in a little bit of a, not a back‑up role,
but certainly with Natalie Novosel and Skylar, they were going to be probably
the top two scorers.  
So I think she's worked hard to get this opportunity. I think her jumper, I'm
surprised when she misses. She has worked on her shot so much and the
mid‑range game I think is her specialty.  
So I think that's the thing she's improved the most.  
  
Q. The end of the first half when you guys were struggling and Skylar hit
those three 3s it seems as many times she carried the game it seems like that
was the best example ever, because you could have been in real trouble without
that happening.  
The second general question is, yes, Cal is new to the Final Four but
Louisville has been there fairly recently. Why does it seem like all the
players still wind up going to the same schools?  
COACH McGRAW: The first question, we were in serious trouble in the first half
against Duke. We were really struggling to find our rhythm offensively and
couldn't make shots, which we're normally pretty good at.  
I thought Skylar hitting those three 3s gave the whole team a sigh of relief
that the pressure was off them and Skylar was going to carry us for a couple
of minutes until they got their shot back.  
So that was huge. I think that was something that we absolutely needed. She
knew it. Similar to the game at UConn when she hit the back‑to‑back 3s, but
that was just so key in our comeback.  
And then the other question, I think that players look to‑‑ everybody wants to
win a championship. And I think they want to go to the school they think has
the most opportunity, and a lot of players now are looking at what other kids
are doing in their class, which for us in our recruiting, we want kids to have
the confidence to come in and know that they're going to be able to compete
for a national championship.  
And they don't have to bring in other players with them. But it seems as
though Duke and Connecticut, Tennessee, they still seem to attract the best
players.  
And I think when we get a little more parity in the high school game, I think
that maybe you'll see more parity in the college game, because the top players
won't always be looking to go to the top five schools.  
  
Q. When you have a rivalry that's gotten as intense as Notre Dame and UConn,
how much of a plus can that be for the game as a whole? Does any sport need to
have a rivalry just like this one?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think they do. You've got the Yankees and the Red Sox,
and I think there's always big games that attract the casual fan to the game.
And so I think that's what we're doing for women's basketball.  
I think it is the most heated rivalry in women basketball and it's a game that
everybody enjoys watching. And we enjoy playing. I think it's a fun game. And
you know it's going to be a battle. It's going to be a war. So I think that
makes it even more fun to watch.  
  
Q. What is the advantage of having been here the past two seasons, the team,
knowing what they're going to go through and that sort of thing, and also is
there any added weight just because they've been there twice and not achieved
their goal?  
COACH McGRAW: I think that going in knowing what to expect is good because
you're prepared for, you can prepare the freshmen for it.  
I think it gets to be a little more of‑‑ I'm not sure what the word is. It's
not quite as fresh and as fun to be stuck in for five hours of interviews and
so many other things that because you always want to get out and enjoy it. You
don't really have that chance to really spend the time with your team in New
Orleans, because you're always doing something else.  
So I think we're going to have some fun on our own, I'm sure. But I think we
do have at least a lot of experienced players that know what the grind of
going through all the media work is going to be and all the practices and the
open practice and I think they'll be able to focus better because they know
what to expect.  
  
Q. Is there any added weight to it just because they've been there before
and haven't achieved the goal?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, so I think I answered that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Lindsay Gottlieb and we'll start off with an
opening statement.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I'm thrilled to be on a call like this. I have a group of
young women in our locker room that I absolutely knew that they were capable
of playing at an elite level and had the ability to make a Final Four, and yet
this is still better than any of our wildest dreams.  
We're enjoying every moment. I'm excited about going to New Orleans and having
a larger audience and the national media experience. These Cal Bears, they're
special young women who have come together and become a pretty darned good
basketball team.  
So we're focused on winning two games and at the same time want to enjoy the
experience. Looking forward to the whole thing, and happy to answer any
questions you have.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Was there a moment this year that you thought this team had the ability
to get to the Final Four? I mean, even in the beginning of the year, you spoke
that you thought this would be a very good team. But I wonder if there were
points or a certain point during the year where you really thought this was
possible.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think if I had to point to one moment, it was beating
Stanford. Everything we did with our scheduling and our mentality and our team
meetings this year were to prepare us for what I called kind of being elite
and having a shot at being at a Final Four. When we lost at Duke earlier in
the year, I said this is the type of game we scheduled on purpose so we can
win against a top 5, 6 team when we need to.  
But there's a difference in feeling like you can do it and believing you can
do it and absolutely knowing you can, and I think winning at Maples the kids
can look at each other and say we know we can do this. I think that was the
biggest moment of saying we belong in this company and we have to keep getting
it done.  
  
Q. Two questions for you. Just about the fact that this matchup is between
two teams, I think a lot of people maybe didn't necessarily think we were
going to be there. You guys were a No. 2 seed but you hadn't been there
before. And Louisville having to get through both Baylor and Tennessee.
Talking to Jeff Walz last night, he said this is so good for women's
basketball to have these unexpected teams. I wonder if you could talk about
that and then specifically maybe talk about the fact that your team has been
so dominant on the boards, that that's been such a big factor for you guys,
and how do you explain why you have such a good rebounding bunch.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I'll take the first one first. Cal‑Louisville is sort of the
undercard in this Final Four. There's no question UConn and Notre Dame are the
heavy hitters in terms of name recognition and having been here before. But I
think it sets up pretty well that you have two exciting teams with coaches who
are obviously passionate and care about women's basketball and believe in
their teams, and I think it's a neat matchup for the country to see there's no
question that maybe people didn't have Louisville in their bracket ahead of
time, but that they're arguably the hottest team in the country having beaten
Baylor and Tennessee in two amazing performances.  
And I think we're also a team that people don't know a ton about, but we're
exciting to watch. So I agree it's good for women's basketball. It just puts
different players in programs on the national radar, and I think it speaks
that there is a growing depth of talent across the country.  
So really, really excited for the matchup and happy for Jeff and his team and
we're just excited to be there.  
In terms of our rebounding, we have a group of kids that are so aggressive and
relentless on the boards. People ask me do we do rebounding drills, and we
really don't.  
I can't take credit for their natural abilities. What I can say I've tried to
do is empower them to embrace that as a huge strength of ours, that it
matters. We talk about it before every game. I don't say, Let's go rebound; I
say, Rebound like only Cal can. Dominate the boards.  
It's more we believe in its importance and I encourage them to do what they
do. But it's a group that collectively really is aggressive and relentless and
works hard on the boards. And we have a number of kids who go to the boards.
We can't just focus on one‑‑ boxing on one player.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about ‑‑ take me through Tierra Rogers'
place with this team and how she relates to her teammates and how her
teammates relate to her, because I know she stayed on the roster, she stayed
on scholarship. I know she's still with you guys a fair amount from a
day‑to‑day basis. But what's been kind of Tierra's role?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: For those who don't know, Tierra Rogers was a tremendous high
school player in San Francisco. Her father was tragically murdered at halftime
of one of her games when she was a junior. She then struggled with maybe
giving up basketball, but stuck with it, came to Cal, and beginning of her
freshman year collapsed at a workout and was diagnosed with a genetic heart
disease that would keep her from ever playing basketball again. She has a
pacemaker.  
There were struggles that came with that in terms of do I continue to do this,
do I stay at Cal. And Joanne Boyle was right by her side from the beginning,
said, You're going to have a scholarship for as long as you need to graduate
and we're going to be your family still.  
And I just took over from that point with the same mentality as Joanne. One of
my first calls when I got the job was to say, Tierra, you're still with us.
She's a huge part of the team.  
What I've said before is there's not a player in California women's basketball
history who has had as much history on a program that's without putting on a
jersey or scoring a point.  
She's a friend to our players. She's a mentor. She is a source of inspiration.
She's just normal around them. Just her teammate. But I think they all see her
as a symbol of you take advantage of every day. You play hard and for each
other every day. You might have things happen to you in life that you can't
control, but you find a way to turn that around and make it positive.  
So it's a pretty special story. She's on track to graduate. She's with us all
the time. And I think we all appreciate the courage it takes to do that
because there were times at which the sight of a basketball court I think made
her really sad.  
She's been very open that it's not easy all the time. She goes through moments
of depression and things like that.  
But she's all for this team. And she said to me at a practice earlier in the
year, just sitting and she was on the side and she said: Coach, this team is
special. And I said I know, T. And we didn't really have to say much more.  
She's a huge part of everything and glad that more people will be able to hear
her story through this run.  
  
Q. Mini scouting report on Louisville and your strengths and weaknesses as
opposed to areas where you think they'll give you the most trouble?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think obviously they've been scoring and shooting the
basketball at a ridiculously high rate these last couple of games. I think
they like to get out in transition. Tremendous guard play led by Shoni, but
her sister Jude is playing really well, and Bria Smith's a terrific player. I
think that their offense starts from these kind of disruptive defenses that
they play. They mix it up a lot from zone to man to kind of what we would call
junk defenses, triangle and two, things like that. So they're very balanced.
They're very uptempo and they try to make you make mistakes.  
In terms of how we match up, I think it's going to be a fast‑paced game. I
think both teams want to get up and down. Like with everybody, we try to take
advantage of our depth and athleticism inside and push the pace with our guard
play, Brittany and Layshia.  
I think it's going to be a really fun matchup, and we'll have to make sure
we're ready to handle their pressure and multiple defenses.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you, do you think that with reaching this level you're
going to have to shoot a little better than you have earlier in the
tournament? I'm referring to how you started off against the last game
shooting 1 for 18. Is that worrisome to you?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I don't think it's in any coach's game plan to start 1
for 18. I think every coach feels better when the ball's going in the basket.  
So, yeah, I do think we want to get high‑percentage shots and we want to knock
them down. And at the same time I think how we are all year is we say if the
shot doesn't go in, we need to get the offensive board or we need to be moving
the ball to make sure we get the best available shot.  
I think what I tell our players is not, hey, we have to make more shots. I
talk about where we're attacking from, are we getting the right looks, are we
focusing when we finish, that kind of thing.  
But absolutely we understand. I thought it was key in the Georgia game that
when we were shooting so poorly, we continued to get stops. I mean, we easily
could have been down 15, but we were down 6 because we were getting stops. We
talk about defense being in attack mode on offense.  
And when we're knocking down shots, we're obviously better all the way around.  
  
Q. How key will Layshia's offense be in slowing down Louisville's offense,
basically giving you guys a chance to get back up on defense and presenting
them from being in that transition mode? And also have you ever played ‑‑ had
a game in New Orleans either as a player or as a coach?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: First off, I think if we're scoring collectively, that helps
to slow down their transition. So I think you make a great point that half of
slowing down a good transition team is making baskets.  
And especially not turning the ball over on live ball turnovers. So in terms
of us wanting to score efficiently. That offense starts with Layshia. She's a
terrific guard.  
I think she's an All‑American guard who has risen on the biggest stages. So we
pride ourselves on being a balanced team. We certainly spread the ball around.
But I think Layshia getting off to a good start, Layshia knocking down shots
will help us collectively and will show down the transition, as will all of
our baskets.  
New Orleans, I have not played there that I can recall as a player or coach.
We played at LSU when I was an assistant at the University of Richmond. But
that's the closest to New Orleans I've gotten. But I did attend the Final Four
as a coach when it was in New Orleans. What was that? Maybe eight years ago or
so?  
  
Q. Curious about your thoughts on being the sort of outsider and that the
other three teams from the Big East ‑‑ I think you're familiar with at least
that region of the country and probably familiar with the conference. Do you
like the idea that you're playing teams that you don't see all year unlike the
other ‑‑ at least two of the other ones?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think it's really cool to be the West Coast
representative. The number of text messages and tweets I've gotten from
coaching friends, not only in the Pac‑12 but across the West Coast, I think
there's an additional sense of pride in that. We have ‑‑ everyone on our
roster, except for one woman who's from Israel, everyone's from the state of
California. It's kind of cool to be like, hey‑‑ it's a great chance to
represent for our state, for the West Coast.  
I think it's added fun to it. I do think it's exciting to be playing teams
that don't see us on a regular basis, and everyone's going to watch film on
each other and coaches are going to do their homework.  
But I think it's different when you're live. I talked to our players in
motivating them about, hey, let's be better than they ever thought we could be
on film, live. Interesting dynamic. I grew up on the East Coast. I'm so
respectful of the Big East and the quality of basketball that goes on. But
particularly of these three teams.  
But I think it is a neat dynamic to be the outsiders, to be the West Coast
kids, and we're going to do the best to represent ourselves but also this side
of the country.  
  
Q. Geno said sarcastically he was congratulating the presidents of the Big
East for breaking up the greatest basketball conference that's ever existed.
What are your thoughts on that comment?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's obviously very timely that all of this conference
realignment stuff going on, particularly sort of the demise of the old Big
East is happening right at the time when there's so many positive things
happening. I believe two of the men's team are from the Big East. And three of
the women's teams.  
So I think it's Geno being Geno, making a timely funny quip, but I think it's
just the way it is right now with conference alignment, realignment. And it's
unfortunate, just because growing up on the East Coast I would watch those
games and the rivalries.  
My first coaching job was at Syracuse. But obviously for this weekend we're
focused on just trying to take care of our business and being the best version
of Cal that we can, and if that shed some light on the West Coast, that's just
an additional bonus.  
  
Q. Two additional questions. The first is I know Joanne Boyle is one of
them, but can you sort of talk about your coaching mentors and how you took
things from them to develop your own head coaching philosophy? And then,
second, Cal has had a lot of success recently with other women's athletics,
swimming and volleyball, softball. How much is there sort of a contagious
sense when you have that success in women's athletics, maybe the athletes
being friends with other teams that maybe helped your team?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Great questions. First, in terms of I would say my influences
on how I coach and how I approach life, there's no question it was my parents.  
My mom passed away when I was in college, but my dad is coming down to New
Orleans. And I think what they did is say: Do what you're passionate about. I
think there was a feeling in our household that whatever you take on you
should do it at a really high level, but no pressure to do anything in
particular.  
I think a lot has been written of the family of lawyers and was there pressure
to do that. They just really instilled in us this idea of be really good at
what you do, but if you choose something that you love, you're more likely to
be good at it.  
In coaching, absolutely Joanne Boyle hired me as a 24‑year‑old. I needed a
note to rent a car when I went out recruiting because I wasn't 25. And it was
her first head coaching job. She'd been a long‑time assistant at Duke. Took
the Richmond job. Brought me along‑‑ I had been at Syracuse and New Hampshire
‑‑ and said, Let's do this together.  
I think there's a lot of different ways to be successful in coaching, but for
me that was the best path because it was as close as you could be to running
your own program without it. She kind of let me in on all the decisions in how
you run a program.  
So I can't be more appreciative to her of everything that I learned and also
just the ability to form my own philosophies and be the coach that I am.  
I read a ton, from political things to philosophical things to coaching books.
And I watch‑‑ I watch press conferences. I watch how people respond to their
players.  
I can tell you moments when I've paused the TV and rewound it and said, Look
at how that coach kind of interacted with their player.  
And in doing that, I take it all in and learn from people. But I feel strongly
that you need to be true to yourself and take pieces of people and be your own
personality. I don't think I'd be very good if I was trying to be somebody
else. So it's like I read, watch, and listen and try and help that form what I
think is right for me.  
The second question about women's athletics at Cal, we have an unbelievable
athletic department. Our athletic director, Sandy Barbour, she supports all
the sports, but I think in particular empowers women to believe that it's
really important here and it's not just words, it's actions.  
She really wanted women's basketball to be good in addition to the other
sports. And I completely feel like there's a camaraderie. I'll give you one
quick example. Teri McKeever is our women's swimming coach. She was the
Olympic coach this past summer, the first ever female coach of the United
States Swimming Team. My office sits right over the pool, so I can listen to
her from outside. Well, she came to me right before they were going to
Nationals about two weeks ago and said: Would you speak to my team.  
I speak a lot in front of people. I don't get nervous. I was sweating bullets
to talk to these swimmers, these people with Olympic medals in that room. I
said: You want me to talk to your team? So I gave them a signed basketball,
they sent me pictures from Nationals of their girls with signs up of things
I've said to them. And they send me e‑mails saying: Good luck.  
I'm close with some of the softball players through Twitter and stuff,
interact with them.  
So it's a great environment here, and I think our athletes see other
successful female athletes. And I think people respect that we're different in
terms of our personality and style but that we all are representative of Cal
and do things at a high level.  
  
Q. I was wondering if there was anything wrong with Gennifer Brandon in your
game against Georgia. You took her out most of the second half in overtime.
You're leaving a lot of rebounds on the sidelines by doing that. What was your
thinking in that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't know how many rebounds we left because Reshanda Gray
got eight offensive rebounds in that game. Gen had a tough one, struggled to
get going early, was all over the boards, got good looks and missed some early
and never got in a rhythm.  
She's fine, but because of our depth in the post, you know, I'd certainly‑‑
you ride with your top players, but didn't see her getting into a rhythm. So
we gave some minutes to Reshanda who, by the way, would be starting on almost
every other team in the country. So we didn't feel it was a negative thing.  
I talked to Gen after and I said, Hey, shake it off. Your teammates had your
back in this one. We're going to the Final Four, and I have no doubt when you
step on the floor on Sunday you're going to be the best version of Gen we've
ever seen.  
I'm not worried about her. I'm thankful we had depth in the post. Talia had a
tremendous second half also. And we'll get Gen going in New Orleans.  
  
Q. Wonder if you had any scouting reports with Sandy on where to eat in New
Orleans and all the great haunts here.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I got a nice congratulatory text from Lisa Stockton, the
Tulane coach, and I said, Thank you. And she wrote back, and she said, Sandy
has to be your official tour guide. I said, We've already given her that job.  
Haven't talked to her directly about that. We've been talking about some other
important things.  
But there's no question that this team is excited. Our players have been
talking about beignets for weeks now. And I don't know if you saw the
television interview, but LaChina Robinson asked, Layshia, what are you most
excited for, and Layshia screamed: Beignets. I think we have to make a team
stop at Cafe du Monde for sure.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could talk about the intriguing matchups.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's going to be some really fun guard play. People
say almost cliche that the guard play is the most important thing in March and
April, and obviously Shoni is one of the most dynamic, fun‑to‑watch players in
our game.  
Jude has played great. Bria Smith. And I think we have some guards that people
are going to fall in love with when they see them. Like I mentioned about
Layshia, people asked me about the difference between us this year from last
year. Last year I thought we were really good, but this year we're kind of at
this next level. And there's no question that Layshia had an All‑American
season to get us there.  
The kid is dynamic. She's got the best mid range in the country. She can get
to the rim and shoot the 3 as well.  
When the country sees Brittany Boyd and the pace she plays, she's really fun,
she's good for basketball. She's flashy. She's tough. Quick with the ball.
She's a great passer. I think you have her on the court at the same time with
Shoni and there's going to be a lot of pictures taken. And Afure Jemerigbe has
been playing great for us. She made some huge plays in the win over Georgia.
And we bring a kid named Eliza Pierre off the bench who on‑ball defenses ‑‑
she makes it an art form.  
I think the matchups are going to be really fun. I think the team that gets
out in transition more and is able to exploit that is going to have an
advantage. So obviously we want to try and slow them down and take away open
looks, and I'm sure Jeff will be saying the same about us.  
  
Q. Being a part of the first other than Stanford to get to the Final Four,
what does it mean to the program right now?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's beyond words. I think that this is something that
I knew these players were capable of and we've kind of all dreamed about. But
the reality is better than that.  
There's a lot of good basketball on the West Coast, and Stanford has kind of
carried the banner for so long and consistency of excellence is amazing. But I
think it's good to have another team and different faces and different style
of play out there.  
When I took the job at Cal, I was very vocal about I loved this place, but I'm
not just happy to be here. I think the time is right in women's basketball for
there to be another team in the mix of the elite, especially one on the West
Coast that's not named Stanford. And I thought the things were in place at Cal
to do that.  
And the fact that it has happened and hopefully we can continue to make it
happen, it's huge.  
  
Q. Talk about the contribution of Layshia to get these wins this season.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't know if there's a player that does more for their
team. And we're very balanced and we pride ourselves on that balance and
versatility. But this young woman has taken on a lot and come through in every
moment. And sometimes that's hitting the big shot, but sometimes it's just
having the ball in her hands and making a good decision. Sometimes it's a
defensive stop.  
I can go back to the preseason when we were in that locker room at Notre Dame
last year and we lost a tough game to a No. 1 seed and we had everyone coming
back, and I said, I want to be good next year not simply because we don't lose
anybody but because everyone in this room is even better than they were.  
And Layshia's the hardest worker we've been around. But in addition to doing
her own thing, she brought Brittany Boyd under her wing and said, Hey, we're
going to work out today. We're going to get you to a whole other level. I
think that type of leadership, not just with Brittany but the whole team, has
carried through.  
We have a number of terrific personalities on the team and a fun‑loving group.
But Layshia has been the quiet, steady leader who has helped to take us to
another level.  
  
Q. You were talking earlier about watching other coaches and how they go
about things, how they interact with their players. I'm curious kind of
watching Jeff in that sense, what stands out to you about his style, fairly
unique kind of full ‑throated guy?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Totally. Jeff and I used to talk when I was an assistant at
Richmond and he was an assistant at Maryland. We would talk about scheduling,
phone calls, and things like that.  
So he's been someone I've been friendly with for years. It's really fun to see
him do his thing. When another kind of sort of same‑generation young coach
gets a coaching job, you watch to see how they handle everything. He
seamlessly transitioned from being sort of the right‑hand man at Maryland to
running his own program.  
You can tell he's comfortable doing it his way. People have joked that he's
the mad scientist with game plans. And I think the main thing you can say
about him is he gets his players to believe in him and believe in what they're
doing. You get the feeling if he said, Hey, our game plan is going to be we're
going to fly in from the moon and run around in circles, they would do it for
him. And that speaks a lot to his personality and what he gets out of his
players.  
So just excited for him and the way that he does things, and hopefully it will
be a great matchup on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2013

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Geno Auriemma. Opening remarks, please.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the committee did a terrific job this year each and
every year, especially recently, we're getting a lot more parity in the
tournament, a lot more excitement in the tournament.  
And I'm sure you appreciate a lot less coaches complaining about their region.
I want to say thank you on behalf of all of us coaches, and it's the most
important time of the year for these players. It's what they work for for 12
months out of the year and coaching staff's put a lot of time and effort into
this, and this is our reward. And I want to thank you and the committee for
making all this possible for us.  
As far as our team, we've played really, really well since the NCAA Tournament
started. The Idaho game carried it right on through. And we beat four really
good teams and the last two in the regionals, I couldn't imagine that we could
play any better. Getting great contributions from a lot of different people.
This is where we'd hoped we'd be when we started practice in October. It's a
familiar place for us, fortunately. Familiar opponent, unfortunately.  
I know starting today when we begin our preparation, this team is focused on
one thing and one thing only. And that's putting ourselves in a position to
win a national championship. And I know we're all anxious to get started.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, despite all that Kelly has done and all that she is in your
program, we still call her underrated. Is she the most underrated great player
you've ever had? And Sunday she's going to go against Skylar Diggins for the
15th time. It's two Hoosiers who have become elite players in storied
programs. I wonder if you have any thoughts on how they've represented
themselves and their programs.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think Kelly is for sure, or has been, I should say,
one of the more underrated players, both in our program and nationally.
Underrated in terms of what the expectation level is of what a Connecticut
player is supposed to look like and people view scoring or stats as a way of
measuring how good someone is.  
In the last four years for us, she's been invaluable, starting with her first
game of her freshman year. There's no one I would want to represent us in
everything that she does, more than Kelly. I think she is what Connecticut
basketball is all about. Just show up every day, practice hard, play hard,
compete for a national championship and not worry about whether you get any
credit or not.  
As far as the rivalry with Skylar Diggins, it's been great for them for four
years in high school and now four years in college. I don't know what the
record is against each other. It might be 7 and 7, it might be 8 and 7 or 7
and 8, I have no idea. But I do know that there's a tremendous amount of
respect there.  
I know Kelly has a lot of respect for Skylar and what she's done. And I think
the two of them have represented the state of Indiana like you think they
would.  
The state has a tremendous reputation for hard‑nosed basketball players. They
certainly have done the state proud. And I'm not surprised, and I don't think
the people in Indiana are surprised either.  
  
Q. It is 7 and 7.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's appropriate since this will be the last time they'll be
playing against each other. It's been a heck of a rivalry, I think
individually maybe less so than team‑wise. But Skylar's gotten a lot more
attention and certainly a lot more accolades for what she's done for Notre
Dame.  
But I don't think Kelly would trade her national championship for anything in
the world.  
  
Q. I don't know if anybody pointed out to you but New Orleans is the first
city to host three Final Fours and your team has been in three of them.
Wondered what you thought about the significance of that and what does it say
about the consistency of your program? And also you got a couple new bosses
with local connections in Warde Manuel and Debbie. How have they been to work
with this past year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're right about the three Final Fours in New Orleans. And
we're 1 and 1 the first time we came down here in 1991. We're like Louisville
is this year or Cal. No one expected us to be there, but we came down there
and we enjoyed every minute of it.  
And when we came down in 2004, I think everyone expected us to win a national
championship, and we did. As far as the city's concerned, I love it. I've been
down there a bunch of times. I enjoy the people. And certainly enjoy the
atmosphere and I'm looking forward to coming down there, and every time my
family's been down there, especially in 2004, I can assure you that my family,
after that championship game, really enjoyed the city.  
And Warde, everybody's heard about my new contract. That was contingent on us
getting to the Final Four. Warde being from New Orleans, there's a clause in
my contract that it was going to be ripped up if we didn't win and get him
back to his city.  
He's been absolutely fantastic for me personally, for our team, for our
athletic department, for our university. And Debbie, bringing Debbie up here
has been like a dream come true for me. I've never had an advocate for our
program in all the years I've been here that works as hard as Debbie does to
make sure that our basketball program is the best that it can be.  
So I'm really, really in great company and I'm really happy for them.  
  
Q. Moriah has been on the floor with Bria a fair number of times recently.
Can you talk about that dynamic and what her evolution might mean for you guys
in terms of getting a better result against Notre Dame?  
COACH AURIEMMA: One of the things we wanted to do a little differently after
the Big East Tournament was we wanted to get Bria off the ball a little more
and allow her to concentrate on scoring more so than she was earlier this
season. She's been in a bit of a slump. She struggled all year long with
injuries at first and then just not playing well enough and getting down on
herself a little bit.  
So the fact that Moriah is playing so well right now has allowed us to move
Bria and the two of them I think work great together. They really compliment
each other well. Defensively they were great last weekend. Offensively, they
were both super aggressive. It changes our team obviously when the two of them
are like that.  
It gives us a whole different look than when we have Caroline in there. So I
hope we accomplished our goal that when we saw, bring people off the bench the
game changes, and it certainly has this past weekend.  
  
Q. I know you've played Notre Dame quite a bit obviously, as you mentioned a
familiar opponent. And all the games have been close. I'm wondering, with all
your experience, to what degree do you worry about there being a mental edge
that Notre Dame has here or mental obstacle that your team has to overcome?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I do believe‑‑ I believe in that theory to a certain
extent. I know we have beaten them 12 times in a row. And I'm sure not all of
that was physical. I think some of that was that we had a decided mental
advantage when you know that you can beat someone, it certainly does give you
maybe more confidence and it certainly does give the other team more cause for
concern.  
And the fact that every game has been so close and every game's gone down to
the last, in some cases, last possession, it would be a really different
scenario if we had really, really played poorly and lost a lot and felt like
they're just too good and we don't have it right now.  
But the fact that every game has come down to the last minute means there's a
couple of things that we didn't do well. And there's a couple of things that I
need to impress upon my team over the next three or four days. And I think
come Sunday night, when that game starts, I hope‑‑ and I want to believe that
what's happened in the past is not going to be a factor.  
  
Q. Couple questions on Morgan Tuck. Obviously she had a bruised knee and
then she slipped on the ice. She did start in the triple overtime game against
Notre Dame and played 34 minutes ‑‑ didn't play, didn't start after that. Can
you just talk about the ups and downs for her season, typical ups and downs?
And also her sort of counterpart from this area, Jewell Lloyd has been a huge
contributor to Notre Dame. Can you talk about what you've seen of Jewell in
the three games you've played them.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, as far as Jewell is concerned, I think she's added
another dimension to Notre Dame's team. They lost two really quality starters
from last year, Natalie Novosel and Brittany Mallory.  
And being the center, I think Jewell Lloyd defensively has given them a lot.
Offensively has given them an awful lot. She's a great athlete. And she's
played really, really well in big moments for them.  
As far as Morgan's concerned, I thought the first month of our season, when we
were practicing, I thought Morgan Tuck was the best post player on our team.
She did everything right for an entire month. And her knee all of a sudden
became a real issue and she starting missing practice more and more and she
started to lose a little bit of her confidence and it's been an up‑and‑down
season.  
But I gotta tell you this NCAA Tournament, she's been terrific. And I trust
her. Her teammates trust her. I wouldn't hesitate to put Morgan out there
early and often on Sunday, and I think she's going to have a huge national
championship tournament.  
  
Q. Wondered if you could please address two things, first being the total
contrast in the size of the bracket with two teams that know each other as
well as any two Final Four teams in history. And, two, surprising to a lot of
people is that they are there and they don't know each other at all. And also
if you could address sort of the bittersweet nature of what a triumphant Final
Four this is for the Big East, with three teams, the Big East as we know it is
going away?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I was talking to Pat McKenna, our SID, maybe we ought to do
with the NFL and reseed the teams when they get to the Final Four so we
wouldn't have to play Notre Dame every year.  
But that would take away from the Cinderella nature. Cal's never been to the
Final Four. Louisville's, this is their second opportunity and both Jeff and
Lindsay have done a great job at their schools, and one of them is going to be
playing in the national championship. And that's something that I'm sure very,
very few people predicted that both of those schools would be in that position
that they're in right now.  
So that's just part of the NCAA tournament's beauty. And, yeah, on the other
side of the bracket you've got the complete opposite thing. And it's become a
great rivalry. It's become a game that people look forward to, and we
certainly have had some memorable games already this year and last year as
well.  
And we have three Big East teams in the Final Four and we have two on the
men's side. So we've got five of the eight Big East teams, five of the eight
national championship contenders are Big East schools.  
So I guess the shoutout should go out to all the presidents for having the
foresight to tear apart the greatest basketball conference that ever existed.  
But as basketball coaches, I'm sure Rick and Jim Boeheim and Muffet and Jeff.
And I feel we wouldn't want to be anywhere else. And we wish it didn't happen
but we have no control over it.  
But I guess it's a great swan song. If it's going to end, this is a great way
for it to end.  
  
Q. To follow up on the question about the mental aspect. Do you feel your
team is at a different place mentally than it was going into the Big East
championship game, and also could you update us on Stefanie Dolson?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Stefanie's‑‑ we haven't done anything obviously since Monday
night. And she's in great hands. Rosemary Ragle and our medical staff are
spending every waking moment that we can with her, and we're going to get
together this afternoon so I'll know a little bit more this afternoon. But
obviously she's not going to be 100percent come Sunday night.  
But I thought she was magnificent over the weekend. 21 rebounds on one leg
against those two teams is pretty amazing.  
So I'm hoping, keeping my fingers crossed, that we're going to be able to get
her best effort. But I'm not sure about that.  
As far as where we are: Yeah, that's one of the things we try to do here. We
try to separate the regular season, the end of the Big East tournament from
the NCAA's. And I've always thought that we've entered the NCAA tournament
certainly in the last 20 years with a different mindset than what we had at
the end of the season. This is a completely different animal. It's a
completely different atmosphere, and we approach it completely different than
we do our regular season.  
So physically we're not exactly where we want to be. But we haven't been all
year. Mentally, we're probably in a better place right now than we have been
at any time this season.  
  
Q. First off, I think a lot of people thought Notre Dame would be a good
team this year. I'm not sure anyone would have expected them to have the
season they did. Why do you think for that team things came together as they
did?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I remember‑‑ I remember when we went to the Final Four in
2002. And we won a national championship and we lost four starters. And Diana
Taurasi was the lone starter returning.  
And I don't know that anyone thought that we could win another national
championship but we did. And we did it on the strength of the best guard in
the country.  
And you can't underestimate what having the best guard in the country means.
And when you've got somebody like Skylar Diggins who can control every single
game and make her teammates better than anyone thought they could be, you have
what happened this year. And I think Muffet's done an incredible job of
guiding that team to where they are today.  
And Muffet by herself would not have been able to do it. And Skylar by herself
would not have been able to do it. And I think those two working together have
taken a team that most people thought would be really good to being a great
team. And they both should be commended for that.  
  
Q. Mark Cuban today, I'm not sure you saw this, today said he would consider
drafting Brittney Griner in the 2013 draft. He said she would obviously make
the team but he was thinking seriously about giving her a shot to do that. And
I wanted to get your reaction to Cuban's comments today.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, obviously Mark Cuban's a genius, because he's been able
to parlay some great ideas into billion‑dollar industries, and he's done a
great job as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and he's won an NBA
championship. And he's done a lot for basketball.  
His genius would take a huge hit if he drafted Brittney Griner. And if
Brittney Griner tries to make an NBA team, I think it would be a public
relations thing. I think it would be a sham.  
The fact that a woman could actually play right now in the NBA and compete
successfully against the level of play that they have is absolutely ludicrous.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could just talk about, what do you think is the trademark
of a team coached by Muffet McGraw, what do you see in that, and can you talk
a little bit about your relationship, is it a rivalry between you two?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, the trademark of Muffet's teams is they play well
together. They pass the ball exceptionally well. They play a real intelligent
brand of basketball. They're tough. They're tough kids. They get more than
their share of loose balls, 50/50 balls. They get more than their share of
free throws, because they attack the basket as well if not better than any
other team.  
So you watch them play, and all you can think of is they're really, really
good. They're sound in every area of the game.  
As far as our competition, Muffet and I, we play golf together a couple times.
And she gets all fired up about driving the ball further to me, which is a big
deal when your teeing off 50 yards in front of me.  
That goes to show you how competitive Muffet is. She's incredibly competitive.
But I think the competition between us is about Notre Dame versus Connecticut,
not necessarily about Muffet versus Geno. She doesn't have to prove anything
to me and I don't have to prove anything to her.  
  
Q. You mentioned a few minutes ago about the mental edge or possibly a
mental edge. But on the flip side there's also the law of averages. I think
two years ago when it was the opposite way, you had won three straight and
talk about you had never beaten a team four times in one year and didn't. How
much do you think is that a factor in this game, is that there's three games
where it's down to the last possession, how tough is it to beat a team like
that four times?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's difficult. I don't think it's undoable. I mean,
obviously it's difficult when you're talking about two teams that have played
games that were decided at the last seconds. But if you can do it three times,
you can do it four times.  
As I said, I don't know that what happens on Sunday is going to have‑‑ that's
going to be the result of the previous three. I think if we play exceptionally
well, we're going to beat them. If they play exceptionally well they're going
to beat us.  
And I don't know that the law of averages‑‑ obviously if we play each other
enough, it's going to turn. That's why it turned from where we were with them
before to where they are with us now.  
  
Q. Wondering about the big picture in terms of the Cinderella teams and
Griner and a stalwart like Stanford being out, is it good for women's college
basketball to have new faces out, or is it not a detriment to not have Griner,
the biggest star the game's had for a while?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, one of the things I talk about, when the NCAA tournament
starts with my team is, is the beauty of the NCAA tournament is that it's not
about which team is supposed to be there, which players are supposed to be
there.  
The NCAA tournament, the beauty of it is you have one night six times or
actually four times. You have one night four times to prove that you deserve
to be in the Final Four. And the team that proves it the best, they deserve to
be there. So just like in the years we've gotten beat, Baylor doesn't deserve
to be there. They didn't play well enough. Neither does Stanford. Neither does
any other team that lost. If we had lost or Louisville had lost we don't
deserve to be there.  
So that's the beauty of the NCAA tournament. The fact that you've got new
faces, I think it's great. I think we don't have a face that everyone knows
like Skylar Diggins or Brittney Griner or Elena Delle Donne or all the First
Team All‑Americans, Chiney Ogwumike, we, don't have anybody like that this
year. But I've been there with Diana or Maya Moore and all those people so I
know what it's like to have everyone focused on one individual or two
individuals, and this year I'm sure the focus on the Final Four is going to be
on Skylar Diggins.  
But I think because it's only one person a lot of people are going to get to
see some other really, really good players that people haven't talked about
this year.  
I mean it's just now that Shoni Schimmel and Jude Schimmel are coming into the
limelight. They've been great all year. And if you were in our league you
would know how hard they are to play against.  
The kids that Cal has because they haven't been on national television a lot,
people don't necessarily know who they are. Well, now, for a few days people
are going to be talking about those kids. And that might not be the case if
all the big names that everyone expected to be there were there taking up all
the attention.  
  
Q. You already talked about the Big East being the greatest conference in
college basketball, I guess both men and women, could you give us with your
familiarity with the league, what is Cal in for exactly? They would have to
beat two teams from your conference, you know all three obviously, to win. I
don't know if you would highlight differing styles between the way they play
and the way the Big East plays and kind of along those lines what are your
thoughts on that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I'm not sure‑‑ you mean what are the styles of our three
Big East teams and how they differ from‑‑  
  
Q. How hard is Cal ‑‑ given how good the Big East has proven to be now,
they're going to have to obviously beat Louisville and either you or Notre
Dame.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Okay. Well, that kind of cuts both ways. You know, if
Louisville wins, then it's going to be two Big East teams playing for the
national championship. Two teams that know each other, two coaches that know
each other. That presents its own challenges. If Cal wins and beats Louisville
and Cal is playing for the national championship against a Big East team,
sometimes what you don't know doesn't hurt you. If Cal wins, they're going
into a game against a Big East team saying, okay, so what. If they had played
a bunch of Big East teams before and knew, oh, boy, this is what we're up
against, sometimes that's worse.  
So I think the inner struggles in our conference, the way we beat each other
up all season long, thank God we don't play each other all of us twice, home
and home. We might not have any teams left to play in the NCAA tournament.  
But I do think we look forward to playing other teams from other conferences,
that's why traditionally we've done well in the NCAA tournament as a
conference.  
But I think for Cal it could go either way. They could be intimidated, which I
doubt, or they could show whoever wins our game with Notre Dame a side of a
team we've never seen before.  
So that's the beauty of it.  
  
Q. There's another story about what's acceptable in coaching today in
practice and that, where is the line in coaching behavior. I wonder if you
could briefly comment on how maybe difficult it is for people who don't coach
to understand where the line is between acceptable and not acceptable
practices.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know each coach has their own line that they think is the
acceptable line. And that maybe varies by how a coach perceives they need to
coach to get their team to be successful. And maybe some coaches are on that
line. Some coaches try to stay below that line. I can't speak for other
coaches for sure.  
And, believe me, I acted like an idiot at practice more times than I can ever,
ever recount. But some of the stuff that I saw, and I've got a friend of mine
whose son is on that staff, so obviously it's difficult for me thinking about
it, but if what I saw is accurate, and I would assume it is, there is no line
that could be drawn that would make that behavior acceptable.  
I don't know where you would draw the line that you could say, well, we were
on the line or below the line. From what I've seen, that behavior is the kind
of behavior my son played college basketball. I would not want any of my kids
or anybody be put in that situation ever.  
  
Q. We were talking a little bit about Louisville. You played Baylor this
year. Can you just tell me what it took for Louisville to beat them and what
you feel like they bring to the table against Cal.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know Jeff Walz is going to get a lot of requests at every
clinic this year to explain his defense against Brittney Griner. And I know
he's probably going to get some job offers. Thank God I signed my contract or
they might be looking to hire him. I know all that, if you had said before the
Baylor game, Jeff, you know something, you're going to make 16 3s tonight and
some of them they ought to give you five points because of where you're
shooting from, he would have told you you're crazy.  
So what happened in the Baylor game? It was a perfect storm. Louisville played
hard. They played aggressive. They were tough. They played the way Baylor
always plays. Baylor plays hard. They're aggressive. They're tough. And
Louisville played exactly the same way. And then they added to that just a
ridiculous shooting night that you just can't ever anticipate, and there's no
way that Baylor was, I guarantee you, there was no way that Baylor was
expecting anything remotely close to that.  
So that helped them in the Tennessee game because they came out with the same
level of confidence that they played against Baylor. And right now, let me
tell you something, those Schimmel twins‑‑ not twins‑‑ but those Schimmel
sisters, they might be the most exciting players in the country right now.  
And if I was Cal, I would say I don't know how we're going to stop them. And
that's just two of them. Right now that whole team is playing with an amazing
amount of confidence.  
  
Q. Geno, just to follow up on that last point you made about the Schimmel
sisters. I wonder if you could explain what you've seen from them that makes
them maybe the most exciting players in the country.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I watched the game. I saw pictures of them when they were
young. I couldn't quite listen because my grandson was running around. Where
do they live, Canada, Vancouver, someplace, I'm not exactly sure where they're
from, but they had their outfits on and they had some traditional Indian or
Native American clothes on. And I thought, man, to go from there, where if
there's a traditional recruiting area for coaches, and then to go to
Louisville, which is a great program, but not necessarily a traditional
national championship contender, or won a bunch of national championships,
that the road that those kids have traveled and where they are ‑‑ and no one
knows their story probably, but what they've done in the last week has had
everyone stand up and take notice of these two kids and the joy they play
with, the fearlessness that they play with. They love the game, and you can
tell they love the game. They're tough kids. They're fearless, obviously.  
Man, I gotta find my way to that spot, wherever it is. I don't know if you
have to take a helicopter in there or you need guides or something to get in
there, but I told Jeff Walz this morning I gotta get a couple of those players
for myself.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## April 2, 2013

  

### [Taber Spani](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24887)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Kamiko Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25287)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  86  
Tennessee - 78

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're now joined by the Tennessee coach and
student‑athletes. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game.  
COACH WARLICK: Obviously disappointed for us, congratulations to Louisville.
But I want to talk about these two young ladies. These are our two seniors.
They're tremendous leaders for us this year.  
And they put their heart and soul in the whole year. And I just want to say on
behalf of staff and the Lady Vol program, we're extremely proud of both of you
and appreciate all you've done.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kamiko and Taber, would you both talk about obviously you guys got
yourself in a big deficit and trying to fight back, you almost made it. Did
you think you had a shot there?  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: Most definitely. Throughout the whole game we believed in
ourselves. The coaching staff tells you to go out there and fight. And we've
been in situations like that before.  
And we practice it in practice, with practice guys. Having drills where we get
stops. And that's what we tried to focus on was getting stops and convert on
the offensive end.  
TABER SPANI: This team never gives up. And we believed in each other. We just
put ourselves in too big of a deficit at the beginning and our defense wasn't
the way it's been the last few games. It let us down.  
  
Q. Both of you, could you just talk about this season. I know it's just
ended, but did it live up to your expectations? I know a lot of people
wouldn't have picked you to get this far when the season started.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I'm tremendously proud of my team and the coaching staff.
Everybody, like you said, counted us out. We were picked fifth to finish. We
finished first; unfortunately we didn't win the tournament.  
But we made it this far. Believed in each other. Our coaching staff believed
in us. And we just stuck together. It was a family. And we just bonded, and I
love that about my teammates and our coaching staff. And like I told them in
the locker room, I'll take this team over the past three teams I've been on,
because I've never seen so much fight in a group of girls.  
And I actually love that and appreciate that, because no matter what they
always had our back. We knew we could count on them.  
Unfortunately we fell short today. But we fought. I mean, that's all I could
ask for.  
TABER SPANI: Yeah, I just echo Kamiko. I can't say how proud I am of this team
and what we've accomplished. I think any Tennessee team, when you don't make a
Final Four‑‑ that's the great thing and the amazing thing about this program
is no matter what the transition was, no matter what it looked like, no matter
what excuse you might put out, if you're a young team or not, the bar is the
Final Four.  
And I think that's what makes this program special. So to come short of that
is disappointing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Where do you think this got away from you tonight? Obviously you dug such
a big hole there in the second half.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, you gotta get stops and rebounding. We didn't those
especially the first half. And can't give up ten offensive rebounds the first
half and we just dug ourselves in a hole. So we started battling a little too
late.  
  
Q. You were down 3 with four minutes left. What did you talk about the last
four minutes?  
COACH WARLICK: We just talked about just keep battling and keep fighting. And
we're down and then Taber gets a shot at a 3. And it's a good shot. It's a
good look. And it didn't go. And then we fouled and then they were up by five,
and so we just‑‑ we needed to make that 3 to get the momentum, and it just
didn't go down.  
But we talked a lot about not giving up. And that's been the mode of this team
this year. It's like Taber said, we thought we had a good year. But we didn't
have a great year.  
And that's just the nature of our program and our expectations, whether you're
Pat Summitt or myself, it's just what we're all about. It's in our blood. It's
in our makeup.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Louisville and what you see for them going forward?
Obviously they put together a good run.  
COACH WARLICK: They had just a heck of a tournament. You've gotta do something
right if you knock off Baylor, because Baylor's an unbelievable team. And so
to knock them off and then to come in here and play the way they did, they had
a great tournament. And we just‑‑ I think they'll be competitive. And I'm sure
they'll be ready to play in the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## April 2, 2013

  

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  88  
Tennessee - 76

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the victorious Louisville Cardinals. Coach,
opening comment.  
COACH WALZ: Wow. I'd first like to just congratulate Tennessee on a great
season. Holly's done a fantastic job with that group. They're very talented
players.  
We knew it was going to be a battle from start to finish. But we also knew we
had to come out and try to throw the first punch, which is what we've done.  
And I'm just so proud of the entire team. I think we played fearless the past
two games here, taking shots that probably most coaches wouldn't think are
good shots.  
They cut it to 3 and we're pushing the ball, throwing it over the top,
shooting layups and coming down the floor and shooting 3s. And it's a
remarkable group.  
It's an unbelievable story. I mean, it's really what it is. And we aren't
planning on it to end right now. To start the season, this was our goal. Our
goal was to get to the Final Four. And when we lose Asia Taylor, Tia Gibbs,
Shawnta' Dyer, and Monique Reid is playing on one leg, I never would have
dreamed that we would be able to do what we've done. But it's all a credit to
these players.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni and Jude, could you comment on what the coach was saying during the
season, losing the kids you did? At what point did you guys just say, look,
we'll have to make up for that, and was there a turning point in the season
where you felt like you were over those losses?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I don't think we dwelled on it very much because we knew had
to be healthy in order to come back in. Just like Mo came back and made her
comeback, and we just didn't necessarily‑‑ like, we knew they're hurt and we
wait for them, so we did what we could with the people that are available and
healthy. Now we just gotta get those other three healthy and be back next
year.  
For us to make it where we are right now, it's remarkable because nobody
thought we could do it.  
  
Q. Shoni, and actually all three of you, could you talk about what made you
believe when you couldn't get odds in Vegas.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think that starts with our coach. He believed in us so we
believed in him. So that's the mutual feelings you have towards each other,
you believe in us and we'll believe in you. And after watching the NC State
documentary, just put the fire in our eyes. And we were going out there to
win, and that's exactly what we did is beat Baylor and we beat Tennessee, and
now we're going to a Final Four.  
BRIA SMITH: To add on to what Shoni said, to have the coaches believe in us
and we have 100percent belief in them and the game plans that they write for
us. So it's just a great feeling to be where we are right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Jude, do you want to comment?  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: I think we've known all along we had everything we needed to
get to this point. But we owe a lot to each other and we owe a lot to our
coaches. Our coaches have been showing us a lot of inspirational things like
that documentary, the NC State one, and a couple of videos of Muhammad Ali. We
went and visited the Muhammad Ali Center. I think it just has a lot to do with
seeing all the underdog things like that, and it motivated us even more to
believe in each other and believe in ourselves.  
  
Q. Shoni, they cut it to 3 and at that point it seemed like they were
closing in on you and then you went in for that layup. Can you just talk about
how there's sort of a fearlessness that you approach the game with that you
right then almost ‑‑ that told them you're not going to catch up with us?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was definitely playing basketball. So to be honest with you
I didn't know we were up by 3. But for me to just go in there, I saw the lane
wide open, so I took it. And I knew the girl was going to come down on it. So
I had to just time it right, so I just went up. No doubt in my mind that I
wasn't going to make it.  
  
Q. The Final Four looks a little bit like it's going to get the Big East
Tournament. Were you pleased ‑‑ with an interloper from the West Coast thrown
in there. I know you haven't played Cal but you've played the other three
teams that made it through. Do you believe that having lost to them during the
regular season and in the tournament that you've got the ability now with the
momentum that you've got to go all the way?   
COACH WALZ: I'll make the comment on that. In'06 I believe Maryland, it was
the ACC Tournament in the Final Four, and we actually had to go through North
Carolina in the semis and then beat Duke in the finals. The five years I've
been there, that was the first time we'd beaten Duke. We hadn't beaten Duke in
five years. The first time we played them I think they beat us by 60. The
first year there. It kept going down, 60, to 50, to 38. And it was the first
time we'd beaten them.  
And I told our kids that today, as we sat there and watched UConn win last
night. Notre Dame comes through today with a big win. And I said why can't it
be us? I mean, why not?  
All it takes is one game. And that was our motto in the Baylor game. All it
takes is one. Just come out here and you gotta play the best.  
If we go 8 for 23 from the 3‑point line the other night, we aren't sitting
here right now. We figured out a way to go 16 and 24, 16 and 25. But we made
some big ones tonight.  
So we're just excited about the opportunity. I know we're going to have to
take on a very good Cal team. But, again, we're not worried about that right
now. We're going to enjoy this tonight. We're going to enjoy it tomorrow. And
we're going to enjoy it for the next few days, too. And we'll enjoy our Baylor
win, too.  
Life's too short. And I'm not going to sit here and tell these kids, okay,
tonight at 12:01 we've got to start preparing for the next game. We don't need
much time. We figured that out. We're out there defending, we're out there
playing, and we don't know what we're doing half the time. I've got some in
man and some in zone, and my whole coaching staff is saying: What are we
playing? And I go: I don't know. Who cares.  
But that's what our kids know. Our kids know we're just going to try to go out
there and be as unconventional as we can and have fun. And that's what we're
doing.  
  
Q. Coach, second Final Four. Does this in some way validate that one, not to
say that that was a fluke, but does that kind of announce to the rest of the
women's basketball that University of Louisville is a power?  
COACH WALZ: We're trying to put ourselves there. We're trying to put ourselves
there. I mean, our goal every year is to try to compete to get to the Final
Four.  
We've kind of figured out a way in our six years at Louisville that we are
normally playing our best basketball at the end of the year, because nobody
cares if you play great at the beginning of the year. It's how you play at the
end, because that's all that matters. It's March Madness. And it's crazy right
now.  
So we're thrilled. I believe we have a program, not just a team. And I think
we've proven that. But as I got, after our Baylor win, some e‑mails from
people telling how bad our kids were and how mean they were and dirty they
played‑‑ I had one guy send me a text this morning and it said: Go Tennessee,
so I texted him back and said: Go Vols. And what the heck? I'm sure some would
say we did something, like we shot it, we made too many, it wasn't right, the
ball had our name on it. They'll make up something.  
But I'm proud of every single one of them and I know we're getting a chance to
go play in the Final Four. And it's a memory these players will never forget.
You beat Baylor with arguably one of the best players to play in the game.
Everybody thought that was a fluke. And I promise you no one thought we'd win
tonight either except for this team. And we figured a way to pull it out.  
I'm not sure if we trailed the entire night. They may have scored the first
point. I don't know. But we just continue to fight and continue to fight.  
  
Q. Jude and Shoni, at what age do you guys remember, maybe as little kids,
that you might have first talked about playing in a Final Four together or had
that dream? If you guys could both talk about that. And what do you think this
means to your family and people back home?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: To be honest with you, I think we were talking about going to
different schools, because we watched the little Disney show where the sisters
play against each other, and so Jude was always like, I'm not going to the
same school as you. So for her to go to the same school as me and for her to
be here with me along with my other teammates, it's a great opportunity
because‑‑ I'm stuttering‑‑ acting like Jeff‑‑ no, but it's awesome to have her
right here by my side. But also my other teammates are right there, too.  
So, I mean, I remember her sitting there saying she didn't want to go to the
same school. But it was a blessing when she did.  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: She's lying. I tricked her. I was going to go to the school
they went to. It was a crazy feeling. The first time we talked about it was
when we were in middle school, we were young, watching the Disney channel.  
We owe a lot to where we came from, our family and our coaches and teammates,
but really it's just a blessing. And we're just‑‑ it just so happened we made
it to the same school, and I'm just thankful.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, in both of these games in this regional, your team came out right
away playing well, playing with a lot of poise and a lot of heart. It doesn't
look like this team gets very nervous before the game. Could you kind of
characterize how your team was before these games?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, I mean, with both games today, with both games this week,
nobody thought we could win. I mean, there's not anybody here that I think
still actually believes that we beat Baylor.  
So I told our players, we've got nothing to lose at all. So who cares? I made
the comment: We're going to play street ball. And I know it got misconstrued
by Kim. But what we were calling street ball is just we weren't running much
offense. We were just coming down the floor. We were going to drive and kick
and shoot 3s and have fun. That's what you do when you're playing on the
street.  
That's kind of what we did today, too. Tennessee is very good. They're long,
they're athletic, they're big. We couldn't get into a lot of offensive sets.  
So I just kept telling our kids go out there and play, have fun. If you get an
open 3, shoot it. I mean, Antonita Slaughter shot the one 3 from about half
court. And she thought it was a good shot.  
I just kept telling them, hey, you gotta shoot it. So I think because no one
believed that we could win, I just kept telling them we're playing with house
money, people. I mean, if we win, hey, it's one more to chalk up. If we lose,
everybody's going to say: I told you so. So who cares?  
And that's how they approached it. As the game kept going, both games, as the
game kept going our kids started getting more confidence and more confidence
and it didn't matter what the name across the front of the shirt was. They
just started believing in each other and they were just playing basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, I went back after I saw the 16 ‑25 3s to see what your 3‑point
shooting was like the rest of the season. And let's say it wasn't quite that.
Have you been like hiding this as a secret weapon for the postseason, or have
you got some special 3‑point training program that you've been kicking in over
the last week or so? Just where is this coming from?  
COACH WALZ: I mean, it's a great question. Antonita Slaughter, even though she
goes 1 for 6 at the 3‑point line tonight, she's been our best 3‑point shooter
the entire season. It was just back in February, the end of February she went
on about a five‑game stretch where, I think I said it the other night, she was
4 of 34 from the field.  
And finally started to make some shots against Middle Tennessee and Purdue.
She started getting a little confidence. Then she comes out against Baylor.  
But we hit some big, big shots. Shoni hits a big 3 in transition. Jude hits
that huge 3 in transition at the end.  
I mean, it's quite‑‑ Sara Hammond in the first half hits that 3. She started
to think she was Dirk Nowitzki. She wanted to stand on the 3‑point line. And I
said, Sara, please go post up once in a while. I told her at the timeout, I
said, Dirk, can you go try to post up for me.  
We keep it fun. It's enjoyable. Even games when we're getting our butt kicked
sometimes, I'm a big believer. And I always have been especially in games. I
love going to watch‑‑ we recruit, watch high school games, and you see a kid
go to the free‑throw line, they're down one, they miss the first. Coach says
come on, you gotta make it, you gotta make it. I tell our kids all the time
how many players go to the free‑throw line down 1, miss the first, and then
look at the Coach and say, hey, I think I'll miss again.  
Why put the extra pressure on them. So I kind of use the other philosophy. I
like to try to make them laugh. If they go up there, miss the first, I say, Do
you think you can miss two in a row? I want them to laugh. You gotta enjoy it.  
And that's kind of how we've done it. We're going into the Final Four the same
way. We're going out there, if we've got a 3, we're taking it.  
Everybody wants to talk about how we defend, like you guys did a great job
against Baylor, you stopped Griner. Yeah, we held her to 14, but we gave
Odyssey Sims 29. They average 81 points a game. They scored 81 points that
night. We just have to figure out a way to score 82.  
Offense is what's going to win us games in March. We scored 86 against a very
talented Tennessee basketball team that I don't know if anybody else has
scored 86 on them all year.  
And we did it in a regional final game when there's pressure on them. So I try
to take all the pressure off of them. And we're just going out and we're
having fun, and it's paying off for us.  
  
Q. That carefree approach to coaching in these high ‑pressure situations, is
that how you've always coached, or is that something that you developed over
time?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, I try to have fun. We do some odd things. We always
have. We'll start the game with some jump ball plays. We'll come out and trap
when no one's expecting you to trap. It's not how we are in practice.  
I mean, in practice I'm pretty tough on them. Because, like I told them with
about 2:20 to go and it got down to about 6, I said, I make practice miserable
for you all. So situations like this are nothing.  
And they're all going, You're right, you do, you do. And we handled it. And
that's my job. I mean, I'm not here‑‑ as I tell them, I'm not here to be their
best friend. If I have to be their best friend, it's really sad because they
have no friends. I go I'm going to push you, I'm going to be your coach, and
if you need something‑‑ they know to come ask me anytime. There's a situation
going on, I'll do anything I can to help them.  
But I want them to enjoy college, too. It's a job in a way, but when they
finish playing here, when Monique Reid finishes after our next loss, whenever
that might be‑‑ we only have two more opportunities to play‑‑ when somebody
asks about her career at Louisville, I'm pretty confident she'll say I loved
basketball, but I loved my college experience.  
And that's what it's about. You want to get them as well rounded as you can so
when they make that next step and they go out in the real world that they're
prepared for it.  
  
Q. We heard Jude and Shoni's description of how they ended up together.
Would you talk about how you might have envisioned them playing together on
this level?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, my assistant, Steph Norman behind you, we went out
and saw Jude play. Obviously Shoni was a year older. Shoni was the one that
got all the press, all the pub. But we both really liked how Jude competed.  
I mean, she was kind of a little bit everywhere. She's a pest. Get out there
and guard and knock down some shots. I think really you go back to our Baylor
game, and in the second half there's that loose ball with about four or five
minutes left. And it's going in the back court, and Odyssey Sims kind of went
after it and Jude came out of nowhere and cut right in front of her and gets
it.  
Those are the plays she always makes. Our Texas A&M game, first game of the
year, I think we were down 1, and with about 14seconds, sideline out of
bounds, they take it out and she steals the inbounds pass and goes down and
shoots a layup and we win the game.  
She's got very good basketball IQ. And she's really improved her understanding
of time and score. So I'm just really excited for both of them because they
both, I think, made a big jump to come to Louisville, to come so far away from
home. Because it's not the norm. And I think they both are excited about it,
because they've grown as people and grown as individuals, and hopefully when
they're finished up here, they'll be able to either go back home if they want,
go someplace else, but they will know that they can do it because they went
through a great experience here at Louisville.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH WALZ: Just like to first say how honored we are to be playing here
still. It was an unbelievable night for us last night, extremely proud of our
entire team, and we're excited about the new challenge in front of us.  
I'd like to just say thank you to the NCAA. I mean, it's been great because
we're sitting here in the same hotel with Tennessee, so we've just watched
film together. We've already played a pickup game in the backyard and on the
court. I mean, it's been a great setup. We shared breakfast, we broke bread.
It's been wonderful.  
So I just would like to say a thank you for the accommodations.  
  
Q. Monique and Shoni, if you guys could answer, Coach was talking about the
amazing night you had last night on the court, but I'm curious what these 12
or so hours have been like after last night. Can you talk about who you've
heard from, did you get any sleep, stuff like that?  
MONIQUE REID: Well, we still had curfew. So I mean, we got to enjoy it. I
mean, all my family called me. I was lucky enough to have my mother here to
enjoy it with, but I mean, at 10:30 phones were in and went to sleep.  
  
Q. Mo, you were downstairs at 11:15.  
MONIQUE REID: I was hungry. (Laughter.)  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I actually got the opportunity to hang out with my family.
They drove all the way from Oregon to be here, so I was with them for most of
the night. We also had our fans there and our band there and our cheerleaders
and whatnot in our hotel, so it was a busy night for the most part. But I
think everybody hung out with their families and just kind of enjoyed it all
together. It was a great opportunity for us to do what we did last night, and
we embraced it.  
  
Q. Antonita and Shoni, your coach said last night he needed 16 of 25 three
‑point shooting, didn't know if you could even do that with more defenders on
you. I was curious if either one of you ever counted how many threes you've
made in a row in practice or just hanging out practicing on your own.   
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Well, no, I've never really counted how many I've made,
but I know my teammates have confidence in me and that gave me a boost during
the game.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Most of the time we're just messing around after practice, so
not really worrying about how many go in, it's just kind of like just getting
a feel for your shot and kind of shooting around.  
I mean, last night the ball was going in the hoop, and so everybody took their
shots. 'Nita took hers, Jude, Sara, everybody. It was going in. Sheronne even
shot three, Mo even shot three. We were all just shooting the ball, and it
went in for us.  
  
Q. Sara and Bria, if you guys could address what was it like to wake up this
morning and turn on SportsCenter and see yourselves on the ticker? What's it
been like just to wake up and sort of be at the center of the buzz you guys
have created?  
SARA HAMMOND: I actually never turned on SportsCenter the whole night. I just
put the TV and fell asleep, and this morning I woke up and it was on again. I
was kind of reliving it all over again. No, I mean, like Mo said, we just
celebrated after the game, and meeting Kevin Durant was like a big special
moment for us. This morning we woke up, had breakfast together, went on a
little walk and kind of just embraced the win last night. But we're refocused
now, looking for the game plan against Tennessee, and focusing our attention
on them now.  
BRIA SMITH: Yeah, it's definitely an indescribable feeling. This is just
amazing. We embraced the win last night and even this morning, but we're
refocused right now and we're just trying to look forward to what we have to
do for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Monique, last night you said it felt like you were going to a Final Four
but there's still a game to be played. For you and Sara, how do you
emotionally regroup to play another game?  
MONIQUE REID: Well, I mean, of course we're extremely excited about the win,
but I mean, like today we're just going to go out and practice and get this
game plan ready and focus on Tennessee. But I mean, it's still an amazing
feeling, I feel like I'm going to the Final Four. I've been there before, and
it's just an amazing feeling.  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, just like Mo said, it's an amazing feeling. She's been
there before; they went to a national championship. But for some of us younger
ones, the sophomores and freshmen, we've never experienced this, so to come in
here and experience this and knock off the best team in women's basketball
right now is a tremendous feeling, and I'll remember this the rest of my life.  
But we're focusing our attention again on Tennessee because we haven't made it
to New Orleans yet and that's our whole goal, so we're going to stay focused
all throughout today and tomorrow.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you guys felt there were people that came out of
the woodwork or anything like that last night that were contacting you? Did it
seem like college basketball, women's college basketball finally clicked with
them?  
MONIQUE REID: Well, I know I'm really good friends with Peyton Siva and he
texted me last night, and he's like, Coach P is going to text you. I mean,
that was pretty cool getting a great game from them, and they played an
awesome game, too. It was just really exciting, and everybody from high school
was texting me. I'm the hometown kid, and I know everybody is really excited,
and my dad was crying on the phone. It was very good. Everybody was contacting
me, though.  
  
Q. Shoni, to beat a team like Baylor or any upset, you have to have a
certain amount of, for lack of a better way to put it, swagger. When you go
out on the court you have to believe you can do it. You really showed that
yesterday. Can you talk about how important that was and then how you carry
that over against Tennessee?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think the main thing was that we just believed that we could
win. I mean, we talked about it all day yesterday, we're going to go out there
and win. We believed it as a group, but also from hearing it from our coaches,
we just believed it even more.  
For us to go out there and execute a game plan is just‑‑ made it all come
true. That's what we need to do against Tennessee, too, just go out there and
execute the game plan that our coaches are giving us and continue to believe
not only in ourselves but what our coaches are telling us.  
  
Q. Monique, I wanted to ask you as a person who has been to the Final Four,
what do you say to your teammates who haven't been there about how close you
are and what it takes to take that next step to get to the Final Four?  
MONIQUE REID: I mean, to be honest, you have to believe, because I mean, even
my freshman year nobody thought we could do it. We beat Baylor in the Sweet
16, beat Maryland, nobody thought we could beat them. We beat Oklahoma, nobody
thought we could beat them. I mean, it's just you have to believe, and our
coach put a great message in our head. We watched the Jimmy V story about NC
State, and it just touched everybody's heart because we felt like them
yesterday, and I mean, like‑‑ like a lot of them said, it was poetic justice.
It was just an amazing feeling. That really touched our hearts. If we learned
anything from Jimmy V, it's never give up, and Coach Walz, being the great
leader he is, he taught us to believe in each other and we've did that
throughout the season, and we will not give up, I guarantee that.  
  
Q. Sara, I'm all for believing, but I've watched 74 of 75 teams lose and all
of them thought they could do it. If you could talk about specifically, Jeff
is really known as one of the best Xs and Os people in all of college
basketball, men's and women's. How important was it having his game plan, and
how specifically did you follow that game plan to win yesterday?  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, in order to pull this off, first of all, you have to have
a great leader. We all look to coach Walz as our leader, and he's been there,
he's been in that position, and we have 100 percent trust and 100 percent
confidence in what he's doing. And some people might think he's crazy when
they see him on the sidelines, but that's Coach, and we go with it, and he
gets us hyped and he has the perfect game plan.  
I know a lot of teams, they just stick to what they're used to and what their
comfort zone is. He gets us out of our comfort zone and challenges us to go
beyond what we think we can do, and it's worked tremendous for us this year.
You've just got to give him, I mean, 100 percent‑‑ I mean, I don't even have
words for the game plan that he put together.  
We didn't‑‑ honestly I don't think we believed in ourselves that we could do
it, but just the confidence and the belief that he had in us, I mean, you saw
it last night how hyped we got. He's a great leader, and we just follow with
what he gives us.  
  
Q. This is for any player who would like to address it and also for Jeff.
Coach Mulkey was very critical of the officiating after that game. I wonder if
any of you thought maybe that took away something from your victory because
that became almost like a story unto itself.  
COACH WALZ: It saved me the time. I appreciated it, it saved me the time, too.
I mean, it was a physical game. You know, it's fun to be on my side because we
don't have a secretary in our women's basketball office, so I answer my own
phone and I get my own emails. And there's nothing better than when you get an
email from a 63‑year‑old ex‑coach who's telling me that I'm an embarrassment
to the game because I told our kids to go out there and foul every time
Brittney Griner touched the ball. That was never told. That's not what we did.
Our entire goal was to go out there and be vertical and get in her space and
make sure she just couldn't turn, catch and shoot, because if you allow that
you're not going to win.  
There's a reason they pay pretty good money to three officials to be out there
on the floor, so our kids went out and played the game, and nobody seems to be
concerned about the fact when our guards were getting body checked the entire
time bringing the ball down the floor. Nobody cares about that. And that's
okay.  
But, you know, it was a game that‑‑ it was a pretty intense game, and it's a
situation where you hope you have the best out there to be able to control it
and contain it. But at times it may have gotten away. But I didn't see my kids
do anything that was out of line. I was proud of their effort. I thought we
competed. I've always been told, and this is back to my 18 years of doing this
and going to I've listened to clinics, listened to Rick Pitino, all the great
coaches, Mike Krzyzewski, they always say, when you're going into battle and
you're the underdog, you've got to throw the first punch. You've got to go out
and throw the first punch, and we threw the first punch.  
And if you're afraid to get out there and be aggressive when you're‑‑ I only
know it because I heard it on ESPN, but when you're a 24‑and‑a‑half‑point
underdog, I mean, you can't sit back on your heels and say, okay, you do what
you want to do. So these young ladies here and the ones back in our locker
room came out and threw the first punch. And then when you go seven of your
first ten from three it doesn't hurt, either.  
  
Q. Shoni, you guys talked about refocusing. How do you do that when you have
scored such a monumental upset? Sort of get me inside this team and how you do
that, and then I want some numbers, text messages, friend requests, give me
some numbers for the last 12, 16 hours.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Refocus for us, that game is over and done with now and we've
got to move on to the next, and that is Tennessee. We've just got to focus as
a team. I think we're going to do a great job of that because we believe in
our coaches and what they're telling us. For us to just refocus is going to be
the main thing we're going to do, and it's going to help us win on Tuesday.  
Text messages, I think around 60 from last night and this morning, so I mean,
I don't know, just‑‑ yeah. I don't have Twitter and I don't really have
Instagram.  
  
Q. Mo, can you talk about the turning point in this season? You play in the
Big East and all the focus was on Connecticut and Notre Dame but not as much
on Louisville. Was there a turning point for you guys?  
MONIQUE REID: I definitely think after the Big East Tournament when we lost,
we just wanted to come together and have a great tournament, and we knew that
we'd have home‑court advantage first and second round. I think that was our
turning point, and we just got together as a team and practiced hard. I mean,
that's what we just started to believe in each other.  
  
Q. I know you want to focus on this next game, but what you guys have been
through, I think it probably unique. What has this last half day been like for
you? You mentioned getting all your own emails. That has to be pretty crazy.  
COACH WALZ: No, it's been fun. I mean, it's a situation where I told our
players to embrace it. It can arguably be called the greatest upset in women's
college basketball, and I know some people have argued this game or that game,
but we're sitting here playing with three starters that are not playing, that
are out for the year. I mean, we have a great of young ladies that when the
year started I felt really good about our team. I was like, hey, we have a
chance to make a deep run. And then all of a sudden it's one after another
that go down.  
But we had players that stepped up.  
For us I really believe this season all hinged on the three weeks when Monique
Reid went down after our Marquette game, and she missed six Big East games,
and we won‑‑ I think we went 5‑1 in that stretch. There were a few one‑point
games, two‑point games, and it could have gone either way in about four of
them, and we might not have even been in the tournament.  
But our kids found a way to keep fighting, and that to me is what got things
going.  
Right now the most enjoyable thing that's come about from this, and I just
want to give Angel McCaughtry a little shout‑out because she's got a little
Twitter war going on right now with RG3, going back and forth about his
comments about our kids throwing upper cuts and all that stuff and she's going
back at him, and it's been kind of humorous. But it just shows what our
program is about. You've got a young lady who is without question the best
player that's ever played for us, and she's four years removed, and she's
sitting there standing up for her program because she helped build this
program and put it where it is.  
And that means a lot to me because she still believes in what we're doing. Her
dad sent me a great text last night after the game, watched the entire game.
It means a lot when you've got your ex‑players that are sending you text
messages. But when you've got someone like her going into a little Twitter war
with someone like that, it just speaks volumes for her.  
  
Q. Could you maybe address the development and the progression of Shoni on
both ends of the court in the time she's played for you?  
COACH WALZ: She's come a long way. Offensively she can‑‑ like that lay‑up she
made was probably one of the best shots I've seen a kid make. But at the same
time I've seen her do it in practice. It's not like it's the first time she's
done it.  
I tell her all the time, she's talented enough to play for anybody, but not
anybody can coach her, because she's going to do some things that are going to
make you scratch your head like the one behind the back pass she threw off
somebody's head in the first half that I was like, Shoni, the girl was
standing right in front of you. But I'm not going to take her out because I
know that's part of her game. And she's learned to tone some of it down
herself. And because of that, she's becoming a much more rounded basketball
player.  
For us last night, I thought she took good shots. I really didn't think she
forced a bunch. In her freshman year she would have been pressing a lot,
especially when they started to make their run. But she let the game come to
her. The pass in the first half that she throws to Monique under the basket at
the end of the half, about a 25‑foot bounce pass that gets right to her for a
lay‑up, it's not one that you see on SportsCenter, but boy, it was an
impressive pass.  
Defensively, you know, it's not her strong suit. It's not something we're
going to sit down and put her on the best offensive player on the other team.
But what she does do, she understands the game. She floats around and
freelances better than anybody on our team, which is good at times and bad at
times. But she's really learning when to pick the opportunities to try and go
for a steal, when to try and go for a trap.  
You know, I tell her all the time, you've just got to make sure you know the
scouting report. You've got to know who you're guarding. If you get switched
off onto a shooter, you can't go and double; if it's a non‑shooter, go ahead
and try to get a steal.  
But most importantly, I think she's grown. I think she's grown as a leader, as
an individual. Her teammates have seen it. I think she's seen it. Even on the
pass last night that she threw on the sideline, the left sideline across from
our bench in the second half, there was a nice pass to Antonita Slaughter that
went straight through her hands. Right when it goes out of bounds, Shoni goes
up to her and is like, that's all right, that was my fault. And that to me‑‑
it wasn't her fault. It was a great pass. But take the pressure off of someone
else. That's what teammates are supposed to do.  
And I was just really, really pleased with that. And then when she fouled out,
you know, every time‑out, every dead ball, she's getting the kids, she's in
the huddle‑‑ instead of pouting she's encouraging, you guys can do it, you
guys can do it.  
And then you get Bria Smith to foul out, then Sara Hammond fouls out. When Mo
went to the line to shoot the two shots there I was hoping both would go in
because we did not want to play a five‑minute more stretch without those three
kids.  
  
Q. It's been a couple years since Tennessee has been to the Final Four and
Pat is obviously not there. I wonder your viewpoint on their program, still
very good but maybe not the air of invincibility of the team you just beat.  
COACH WALZ: They're a great program. When you've got someone like Holly that's
been on the sideline as an assistant for 27 years, now she's a head coach,
it's just going to keep going. It's not like you've got someone who's coming
in new going to throw in new ideas, bring in their own just complete change to
a system. So we know we're going to have our hands full tomorrow night. We're
going to have to come out and play another great game.  
But why not? I mean, no one expected us to be here today anyway. So what do we
have to lose? I mean, again, I don't think the pressure is on us, so we're
going to come out here, and I know our kids are going to compete and play hard
and we'll put a game plan together and we'll see if we can't go 16 for 23
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. The other day you said you have friends that don't watch the game because
it was always the same. Did you get some people to say, hey, you converted
me?  
COACH WALZ: No, but I did get a few to actually say they watched it from start
to finish, which was great, because I've got some friends that I played
college ball with where they were like I just actually watched the entire game
and enjoyed it, and I text them back, there's a lot more that are like this
than you think. So hopefully going to be able to get three or four of them
because I know the three that actually texted me all have daughters that I'm
like, guys, you're going to have to go watch them play one day, so you might
want to start joining now.  
That's our goal, and I hope a lot of people had the opportunity to watch that
game last night.  
At the end there, it could have gone either way, but I think win or lose, and
believe me, we're fortunate enough to be up here on the winning side of it,
win or lose it was still going to be a great day for women's basketball just
because of the excitement that we threw into it. Normally you don't get even a
game that's coming down to the wire with your one seed versus your five seed.
I mean, there's a reason the line was what it was.  
So I'm just tickled pink that our players did not worry about what everybody
else was saying because nobody gave us a shot. Nobody at all. And I understood
why.  
  
Q. While you were coaching, Twitter was exploding about the women's college
basketball game, and that typically doesn't happen. Do you feel or did you
hear about just kind of that mass emotion from everybody? Do you feel like a
lot of people came to women's college basketball last night?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I hope so. I mean, it's not that that was our goal starting
off, but I know as an athletic department we strive hard to continue to grow
our game, grow our fan base. We're very fortunate to put close to 10,000 in
the stands every night, and it's been a six‑year journey for us, but I know my
first year we averaged about 3,300 to 3,500 fans a night, and now we're at
close to 10,000. So it can be done, it's just a matter of getting out and
selling your product.  
We sign autographs after every home game, win or lose, and some games are
tough. I mean, when you lose at home, it's a tough one. But our players go to
all four corners of the end zones and we sit there for 10 minutes on the
clock, and we sign them. And I think giving the fans the opportunity to
actually reach out and touch your players is what it's all about. You have to
give them the opportunity to feel like they're a part of it, that they're
going through it with you. And if we can continue to do that, hopefully we'll
continue to grow our game.  
  
Q. You sat up here the other day and talked about your game plan against
Baylor, and it was score, score, score, and joking about putting up 16 threes,
but Tennessee has proven to defend the three so well, they did it against
Creighton. I was just wondering about your game plan going against the Lady
Vols.  
COACH WALZ: Lay‑up, lay‑up, lay‑up. If they're going to guard the three, we're
going to shoot lay‑up, lay‑up, lay‑up.  
No, we're going to have to go inside out. I mean, did I think we'd make 16
threes? No. But I knew we'd‑‑ did I plan on taking between 40 and 50? Yeah, I
did plan on taking between 40 and 50. But when you go seven for your first
ten, all of a sudden everybody start to pressure out on you, and we actually
got some really nice drives mixed up into that.  
So we're just going to continue to play like we play. If we can go in the post
and have an opportunity to score, we will. But if we've got to get inside and
kick the ball out, we'll shoot the three, too.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, where is the line in enjoying what you guys did
yesterday and now moving on? Do you at some point say we're not talking about
it anymore and we're moving forward?  
COACH WALZ: No, life's too short. I mean, you can go back and just watch our
men's game again yesterday when Kevin Ware breaks his leg. I mean, why tell
the kids not to enjoy it? Now, we're going to be focused to come out here and
play tomorrow night, but again, we just had the biggest upset in women's
college basketball, ever. Now, it's my opinion, but I've had a few that say
the same thing. Why wouldn't I want my kids to enjoy that?  
Are we going to go out on the floor tomorrow night and go shake hands and say,
hey, we beat Baylor? No, we aren't going to do that. But we're going to enjoy
this, and we're going to come out here and practice here shortly and we're
going to get prepared for it, and we're going to have a game plan, then we'll
go back and eat and watch some more film and talk about what we're going to do
and come back out here tomorrow night and play.  
You know, the one thing I do know is‑‑ the one thing I've learned about all
this is when you get a chance to go to a Final Four as a coach, you normally
have a lot of friends that like to buy you meals or whatever, a beverage,
whatever it might be. I've already had text messages, about 300 of them, when
you get to New Orleans, if you're playing or not, the first beverage or food
is on me. I'm like, boy, I'll be eating for a month.  
But you've got to enjoy this opportunity, and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. You mentioned the men and what they did yesterday. How aware were your
gals of that? How aware of what they were doing for you? And how much sleep
did you get last night?  
COACH WALZ: The first part, we watched the entire first half of the men's
game, and then Candice Bingham here was giving me updates of the men's game
during our game, so I told her I wanted to know how the men were doing, and if
she hadn't done that at the under‑eight media time‑out when they interviewed
me I was going to ask Rebecca how they had done, but since she told me they
had won I didn't have to do that.  
And sleep, I mean, a few hours. You know, trying to get everything taken care
of. Like I said, I get my own emails, my own texts, so I reply to all of them.  
  
Q. Coach Warlick mentioned she tried to recruit a couple of kids she
couldn't get in on and you signed them and you guys just kind of went head to
head with Mercedes Russell. Do you feel like now your program is at a level
where you can compete with the established powers of the game for just about
any recruit in the country?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, we're going to try and recruit the best. That's what
our goal is. Hopefully our game will continue to grow where you get players
that are willing to go outside the norm, and again, that's why the men's game
is so special. And I say in a good way, men are confident and arrogant enough
to think you can go to any school and I'm going to take them to a Final Four.
Women like the security. They like to say, hey, I'm going to go with my friend
here, I'm going to go with my friend there. So it's our job to try to find the
players that are willing to say, hey, I think I can do this. I can sit here
and come in and I see the players they have and we can get to a Final Four. It
takes Angel McCaughtry, Candice Bingham, players that nobody thought that that
team in '09 ever had a chance at doing what we did. And then you've got to
find players that have a bunch of heart. In that year we had Dez Byrd who
played the point for us, and nobody ever thought she'd ever be a point guard.
And then we had two freshmen that came off the bench in Becky Burke and
Monique Reid that just did their roles. For us right now we're trying to find
those players that want to come to Louisville and help us get back to a Final
Four, compete for a national championship.  
But it takes a special player. It takes a special person, because you've got
to have that belief in yourself that it's okay to go against what everybody is
telling you to do, because it's a simple answer, go to this school, go to
school there, go to school B. But if our game is going to continue to grow,
we've got to continue hopefully to recruit these kids and get them convinced
that it's okay to do something different.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH WARLICK: Obviously we are extremely excited to be here, and these young
ladies have worked hard all year, and it's a great opportunity for them. And I
think they look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. Meighan, just like we were all predicting, you guys are going to be
playing Louisville tomorrow. We asked you a bunch of questions yesterday about
Baylor and that's not who you're going to play. Can you talk about your
feelings while you guys were watching that game and what it felt like to know
you weren't going to have to go against Baylor?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: Honestly, I feel like we just had just got done playing
because our adrenaline was flying from watching the game. Like I said to my
teammates yesterday, it doesn't matter who we play, I mean, either way we
would have had to play either team to get to the Final Four. But no matter who
we are, it's just another team that's standing in front of us of getting to
the Final Four and even possibly winning the national championship.  
We just have to take one game at a time no matter what opponent we play and
just go out there and play hard and play Tennessee basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously everyone was expecting a lot from Baylor and now that
they're out of the tournament, now it looks like the field is wide open. I was
just wondering what you thought about that.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think the opportunity is there for both teams, and as
Meighan said, this team has been really good about taking one game at a time,
and that's been our focus. We really have not looked ahead for anyone. So our
preparation today will be for Louisville. They have extraordinary game, and
they're in the same spot we are. We'll prepare for Louisville as we would have
prepared for Baylor, just understanding personnel, understanding concepts, and
it's just a great opportunity for us.  
This team has not been overly hyped and they have not been extremely low, even
after our losses. I think they've understood when we've had a loss they've got
to go back to the drawing board and get better. They're going to be focused,
and I think they'll understand what needs to be done.  
  
Q. Taber, about that, about not being too high or low, you had that real
tough loss at Missouri and then a tough loss in the SEC tournament. Can you
talk about how you were able to sort of regroup after tough losses this season
and come back?  
TABER SPANI: Well, I think it's a testament to the fight and the
competitiveness that we have on this team. I've said this ever since this team
has been kind of brought together: I haven't been on a team so far here that
has that fighting spirit, and we're so hungry, and I think that's helping fuel
our passion to go out and be energetic and play every possession literally
like it's our last because at this point you don't know, nothing is
guaranteed, so I think the fact that Missouri, it was a tough loss, we didn't
play very well but we learned from it, and Texas A&M was a heartbreaking loss
for us, and we all were devastated but we learned from it.  
I think every loss that we've had, I think the focus has been to get better
from it and not to dwell on it, and I think we've done that and we're really
finally meshing and coming together and starting to play the kind of defense
that we pride ourselves on playing, and I think the fact that we're doing that
at the right time is exciting for us.  
  
Q. Ariel, I wanted to get your thoughts on when you look at Louisville's
backcourt, what really strikes you about the Schimmels and Bria Smith and what
really strikes you about how they play?  
ARIEL MASSENGALE: I mean, they play hard. They can put the ball in the basket,
they can get to the rim, they can shoot the three, so it's definitely going to
be a challenge for us. I think in the past couple games we've done a good job
of taking away other teams' strengths so we're going to be aware of personnel
and try to contain Shoni Schimmel, she's been great, she's a great player,
knows how to put the ball in the basket. But I think our coaching staff has a
great plan for us to go out there and hopefully contain that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Holly, when you look at the way Louisville shot from beyond the arc
yesterday, how do you guys plan to attack that and try to defend that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, it was fabulous. I mean, they shot the lights out. We're
going to defend personnel, try to limit touches. We're going to defend by
committee. We've done that all year. We're going to take a lot of pride in
one‑on‑one defense, and as Taber said, we've worked a lot on that and we're
going to mix up our defenses.  
So our game plan is to try to limit their three‑point shooting. We played
Creighton who was second in the nation on three‑point shots and we allowed
them five, so we're well aware of their strengths, and obviously we're going
to try to take them away.  
  
Q. Holly, Kim talked about before playing that it was tough to figure out
what defense Louisville was playing. Do you have any idea what you might face
against them or are they difficult to scout?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think they run just a whole plethora of a lot of
things, and we're not going to try to spend a lot of time figuring out if it's
a man, it's a zone. We're going to try to run offenses that we can run both.
We've been doing that all year, and Ariel has been great at seeing things, and
I'm allowing her to call an offense that she sees fit during the game.  
We're aware of that. We have offenses that can go against both, and we don't
want to slow our game up trying to figure out what Louisville‑‑ what their
defense is doing. We want to continue to attack, attacking the full court,
attacking the half court.  
  
Q. Kamiko, can you address, you guys have played some good three ‑point
shooting teams, Creighton is one, Missouri is another. When teams are like
Louisville was yesterday, they weren't just‑‑ Baylor was defending them and
they were taking some shots that were just crazy, but they were making them.
How do you deal with that both strategically and emotionally as a defender?   
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I think we just make it a pride game. I know Coach Elzy just
pulled some of us aside and challenged us to get in the guarding, and Holly,
as well, and if we all just take it upon ourselves to lock up one‑on‑one and
make sure our girl doesn't score and make it tough for the guards and much
easier for the post players to do their job. I think it's just a pride thing
that plays into it.  
  
Q. Holly, what do you think it does for a sport when a team that seems
unbeatable finally falls?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, that's why you play the game. You just‑‑ it's a game, and
all bets are off. Nothing is guaranteed. So you always go into the game, or
you should, thinking you're going to win. We've been on the Baylor side when
Chamique Holdsclaw was a senior and beat us to go to a Final Four. Nothing is
guaranteed, and if these young ladies understand that and you put in the time,
things will happen. And as Michelle said, Baylor was doing a great job of
defending the three. It was going in, and they were in a rhythm. It's just why
you play the game. It's what's great about this game.  
  
Q. Bashaara, Louisville was very physical yesterday. I know this is a
physical game, but they were doing a lot to grind or they were disrupting her
when she didn't have the ball. As a post player you've gotten used to that in
college but can you talk about how you keep your cool when you're going
against a team that does that?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: You've got to keep your emotion intact. You can't get
emotional when people are battling and the refs are not calling it. You just
keep your emotions and keep playing your game.  
  
Q. Holly, I guess you can spin this either way. We're going to ask
Louisville how they come back after such a big game and we'll ask you guys how
you avoid not saying wow, Baylor is out of the picture. Do you think the fact
that you guys have the experience you have is a big factor? It sounds like you
guys are probably happy Baylor is gone but immediately said, hey, that doesn't
mean we're in the Final Four yet.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I would not be truthful if I didn't say I was glad Baylor
is out of the tournament. But these young ladies have kept things in
perspective, and I think they understand what's ahead of them and what they
need to get the job needs to get done. As I said, we've had lows and we've had
highs, but this is a special group. There's a bond between them and our
coaching staff that I haven't felt in a long, long time. And when you have
that bond, they're not going to overlook anybody. They're not. They're going
to go out and play as hard as they can. I don't care who it is, and that's
what I love about them. They spend a lot of time together off the basketball
court, and when you do that, you form a trust, and I think these young ladies
have a great trust that they're going to go and be up for the game.  
It's a great opportunity for them, and they understand that. But it doesn't
matter who we play, and we're not going in with the attitude of we're just
going to roll over Louisville. No, we have to play and we have to play
together.  
So I think they understand that.  
  
Q. Holly, I know it's kind of difficult to evaluate when you're still in the
middle of the season, but kind of looking back, what's been the biggest
challenge in your first year as the head coach or maybe the biggest thing
you've learned just being in this position versus where you had been for so
many years before?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, my biggest challenge is just my time away from
basketball. Just doing the things outside of being on the court. When you're
coaching‑‑ when you love doing Xs and Os and being around these young women
because that's what you love, and that's what I love, and the time away from
them has probably been my biggest challenge.  
Even if I do something‑‑ these guys bring me back down to earth if something
goes on. They give me quite a bit of a hard time, but then I turn around and
give it back to them.  
But yeah, I just think the time commitment and‑‑ but I'll tell you, I have an
unbelievable staff, and I don't feel like I have to go into a game or to a
practice and I have to make all the decisions. There's no way as a coach, for
me, that if I had to make all the decisions, if I had to sub‑‑ I've got great
assistants that do a lot of things, and sometimes I stand up there and I get
the opportunity to call an offense and a defense. I have a lot of help.  
  
Q. Holly, this doesn't have anything to do with tomorrow's game, but just
historically you guys were every bit the giant, you'd won three in a row, you
had the best player in the country, had taken everybody's best shot for four
seasons and you lost that game, so emotionally devastating to watch. How as a
coach do you sort of comfort those kids even though they've had all that
success that they're going to feel this incredible disappointment in their
last college game?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, it is, I know how disappointed they are. We've been
there. That should not take away the great year they've had, the great career
that Brittney Griner has had, the standard she has set, the standard the whole
team has set. It's tough, and I know it's tough for Kim, as well, but you've
got to look at the big picture and understand where you've taken women's
basketball. You've gotten the interest up. You've got to keep thinking about
the positives and not the last game. It's hard to do. It's hard to do, and
it'll be really difficult for Kim and the team to watch that last game, but
you've got to watch it and understand what you did and learn from it.  
But what a great run they had. We will not see a Brittney Griner time player
probably for a long time, and obviously Sims. That's one of the best
competitors in the game. So disappointing obviously for them to not go to the
Final Four, but it is part of the game, and as you said, I've been there and
we have felt that, and it's tough to go out that way as a senior. But they're
going to continue to play a game, we're going to play the game tomorrow and
there's going to be four people in the Final Four. It's just the nature of
this‑‑ of any sport.  
Not always the best player plays for championships, and we've been on both
ends. We've been on both ends. We've lost 10 games and won a national
championship when the coaches are trying to figure out how we were going to
just get our players to show up. Along with winning comes‑‑ you've got to have
a little luck, and it's about match‑ups, too.  
  
Q. Holly, going back to that season opener against Chattanooga, did you come
away from that game thinking, oh, this team will probably end up in the Elite
8 just needing one more win to go to the Final Four?  
COACH WARLICK: I sure did. I thought we were on our way. No, I was‑‑ quite
frankly I was wondering what did I get myself into, and the first person I saw
was Coach Summitt, and she just assured me things would get better, and she
told me that she lost her first game, and I thought, well, you know, Coach
Summitt lost her first game, I'm going to be okay.  
The worst thing I did was went back to my hotel room and looked at the
schedule, our remaining schedule, and I'm like, I just had to turn it over,
and I had to just start focusing on Georgia Tech because that was our next
opponent. Yeah, it was a little scary. It was a little scary. But we turned it
around. But yeah, to lose your first game to an in‑state school, it didn't
fare too well with a lot of‑‑ myself and I'm sure a lot of fans. They were
ready to get rid of me after the first game.  
  
Q. Holly, just to follow up on that, what kind of changes did you make with
the team going in after that loss?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we've been a‑‑ we've tried to make defense and rebounding
a priority, and I think we had a team meeting the next day, and probably
reidentified roles and what our expectations of each young lady player.  
I think that helped. And then we challenged them. We reminded them who they
were representing, the University of Tennessee, and themselves, as well. We
defined roles, and then we went to work. We took practice a little bit more
serious. We were a little bit more focused. And we went and opened our next
game, we opened up Georgia Tech's facility, their brand‑new facility. So I
think that our practices probably leading up to that game were the best we've
had thus far. We just tried to make sure they understand our expectations of
them.  
  
Q. Holly, what games this year do you think you have played the best
defense?  
COACH WARLICK: I thought North Carolina we played well. I thought Texas A&M we
played well. Gosh. I mean, we played in spurts, but I thought yesterday I
thought probably was our best defensive effort. We got aggressive, we got
after the ball, and I think if you had to set an example of Tennessee
basketball on the defensive end, I thought yesterday was a great example.  
We have been working and working and working out since day one in the fall, so
our defensive rebounding has been such a priority to where we've sometimes
ignored our offense because we needed to get so much better defensively. I'd
say Oklahoma was our best overall game.  
  
Q. Did you look at Baylor yourself any?  
COACH WARLICK: I looked at‑‑ I actually looked at all three, but I mainly
looked at Oklahoma because if we don't take care of them, we're obviously not
going to advance. But all the coaches, yeah, we put in a lot of time with
Baylor and a lot of time with Louisville. That's just the nature of our job,
and that's what you do. I'm sure Dean is not‑‑ I think he'll be okay that he
did all that work and we're not using it.  
But that's what you do. That's what you do. You just put in a lot of time and
watch a lot of film, especially at tournament time. That's just part of our
job and what we do.  
  
Q. I'm sure that you've probably heard from a lot of people after your win,
but did you hear from a lot of people after what happened in that game after?
I'm curious to gauge the buzz that has been created by what Louisville did
here yesterday.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I heard both, honestly. Excited about our win. A lot of
text messages. A lot of people don't call me when I'm here. But a lot of text
messaging during the game of the Louisville game saying can you believe what
happened and those type of things. Absolutely. I think in general it's‑‑ I'm
sure that's what everybody is saying. Louisville had a great game plan, they
stuck with it, and they finished the job.  
I will say this: 16 threes and then Baylor had a chance‑‑ the strength of
Baylor, you've got to understand that they're still in the game‑‑ they give up
16 threes and then they go ahead towards the end of the game. Baylor is an
incredible team. They're just a phenomenal team, and it was Louisville's day
and they did a great job and followed Jeff's game plan and made shots and won
the game. So it was a tribute to both teams. Hard‑fought game with Baylor, but
the perseverance of Louisville in finishing the job.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on Shoni Schimmel particularly? She's sort of a
dynamic scorer when she really gets going and just seemed like she had almost
the game of her life yesterday.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, she is‑‑ there's people who shoot the basketball, and
there's people who score, and she's a scorer. You just hope she doesn't get in
the‑‑ she was in a zone yesterday, and I'm sure the shot that she shot over
Griner was probably the number one play of ESPN top 10. She plays the game.
She plays the game hard, and she wants the basketball, and so that's going to
be a challenge for us. We can't let her get in the zone and‑‑ she was in a
big‑time zone yesterday.  
  
Q. Maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't, but this group of girls having been
to the Final Four and even at a program like Tennessee that's been there so
many times, do you have a sense of what it would mean to get there?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, this group it would be huge. I mean, we've‑‑ three out of
the last four years of Taber and Kamiko's career, they probably had the
possibility of going against Baylor. I think it would be huge, huge for them.
It's unique at Tennessee in we've created a monster because we‑‑ it's great to
win SEC championships, but our fans and everybody, if you don't go to the
Final Four and win a national championship, you've had an okay year.  
Now, that's crazy, and I know I was a part of helping build that, but that's
crazy. And I think these young ladies understand the achievements they've done
winning the regular season SEC and then what's ahead of them. Yeah, it would
be a huge‑‑ it would be huge for these young ladies to go to the Final Four.
I'm not‑‑ I mean, it would be a fantastic opportunity for them.  
  
Q. You were just in a battle with Louisville of sorts in recruiting. I
assume they were kind of primary team you were competing with to get Mercedes
Russell, and what does that say about Louisville's program right there, that
they're competing for the top players in the country?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I mean, I think they're one of the top teams in the
country. I think they're in on a lot of kids, and we did go down to us and
Louisville, and they recruited a kid they got. Recruiting is recruiting, and
it's a battle, and I think it's who you need at the time and what the kid
loves about their program and what they don't. I think Mercedes just saw an
opportunity at Tennessee maybe better than she did at Louisville. I don't
know, but I think we did both recruit her, and it went down.  
But like I said, there's kids on their team, we looked at Bria Smith, and so
there's kids that they've gotten that we didn't get a chance to get. So it's
just part of recruiting and what you need and I guess how you fill your
program.  
  
Q. You talked about that '99 game, and there's obviously been big upsets in
the women's tournament before, but considering the era we're in with ESPN,
everybody knows where the games are, and then you have Brittney, such a
transcendent player, almost like NASCAR people tune in to see the wrecks, last
night people tuned in to see the giant fall. Did something like that almost
need to happen to continue to push women's basketball forward?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I'm not going to say‑‑ it's not going to hurt, but I
think that people wanted to see Griner play, as well. I'm sure they tuned in
last night because a lot of Baylor's games have not been very competitive. We
went down to Baylor, and we were down 20 points before I could even put my
hand up to call a time‑out. I'm sure that people didn't watch it closely and
then they followed it on the ticker last night, they probably went, oh, they
tuned it in and started watching. But it works both ways. I think that people
enjoy to watch great basketball, and then I think Baylor is a great basketball
team, and then they want to see the underdog win. So I think it's helped us
both ways.  
  
Q. You were talking about how much it would mean to go to the Final Four.
People on the outside look at this team, it really has overachieved based on
preseason, unlike a lot of other Tennessee teams. Do you still think the
players, though, if they didn't make the Final Four, would they feel like they
underachieved?  
COACH WARLICK: Oh, I think so, most definitely. I mean, they‑‑ kids think
they're‑‑ we were preseason ranked in the 20, 22, 24 in the polls, and they've
got a chip on their shoulder, and I think they carried that chip throughout
the whole year. And I think they don't see themselves as overachieved. I think
they've seen themselves as a talented group coming together as one and playing
together. Yeah, they'd most definitely be disappointed, but I don't think
they've ever thought they're overachieving. I think they think that they're
becoming‑‑ they're getting better and they're becoming into their own and
playing pretty good as a team.  
They just had a chip on their shoulder all year, and we've played the underdog
role. In the past, not a lot of times Tennessee has been playing the underdog
role, and this team needed that. They needed that. They needed somebody to
tell them, look, you're not really good right now and you have to work, and so
they did. They went to work, and probably after the first loss they thought,
you know what, we do, we need to get back to work and understand the
importance of practice.  
I've said this as a coach; you don't want to coach effort, and I have not had
to coach effort with this team. I've actually been able to coach and teach.
And so when you get a team like that, you've got something special. They play
hard, and that's all I ask for them to do is play hard and play with a
passion, and I think great things will happen because they are talented.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  82  
Baylor  81

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Louisville Cardinals. Coach, your
opening thoughts?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not sure exactly where to start.  
THE MODERATOR: You've got two minutes.  
COACH WALZ: That's it? I stutter, I should get four (laughter).  
It's just a remarkable night by a remarkable group of young women. We put a
game plan together as a coaching staff, which we always do every night we go
out and play. I've been telling them the entire year, if we can just get 40
minutes out of everybody, not playing great, just playing good, we could be
special.  
We have not had that the entire season. I thought our Purdue game, I thought
we played pretty close, but not where it needed to be. We came out here
tonight and we executed a plan defensively, offensively, and did everything we
needed to do.  
I'm just so proud of 'em. Antonita Slaughter defensively is where she stepped
up tonight. She played 40 minutes for us and just did a great job on Brittney
Griner. I told our kids in the locker room before the game, We got to turn
this thing into a street ballgame. You got to drive, kick for threes, try to
make it fun. There was no pressure on us.  
We came out and did that. I'm honored to coach this group of young ladies. As
I told 'em from day one, I'm going to demand them to be great, I'm going to
demand that I get the most out of 'em.  
With the injuries we've had, I'll say it over and over, I'm as proud of this
basketball team as I was of our team that played for a national championship
in '09, and we're still playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. We'll now take questions for our
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, there were two key plays late in the game that led to your fouling
out. One was the double technical foul, then it looked like you'd been tripped
and the foul was called on you. Can you talk about, from your perspective,
what happened on those two plays and what did you say to your teammates to
keep the spirit up?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, what I told them was just continue to play and go out
there and believe because that's what we've been talking about this whole
trip, is just go out there and believe.  
I believe in them. I knew they could do it. I kept saying it all day, We're
going to win. For them to actually believe in me made me believe in them. We
actually went out there and just did what we needed to do, and that was win.  
  
Q. Antonita, Brittney only had 10 shots in the game. How in the world did
you limit her to 10 shots?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Well, I think I could smell what toothpaste she used. I
was in her face all the time with my hands up. That was the game plan the
whole time. I think that was a big impact for it.  
  
Q. Antonita, Baylor coach didn't know what kind of defense you had. Was it
box ‑and‑one?   
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Right, that's what we were going for. Most of the time we
just scrambled. It worked out for us, so...  
  
Q. Jude, can you talk about the defense that Baylor put on you guys.  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: Yeah, we can give credit to our coaches for that. They set up a
great scout for us, got us prepared. We knew coming into this game they were
going to pressure the point guard a lot.  
I think me and Bria Smith knew that coming into the game. We knew we needed to
protect the ball and I think we did that pretty well.  
  
Q. Were you surprised until really the last 10 minutes of the game they
didn't really come out at you on those three ‑point plays?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We knew coming into the game we were going to have to shoot a
lot of threes. Our guards, our posts can all shoot threes.  
For Nita to knock down her first couple threes, then Jude had a couple, even
Sara had one. Anything at that point was possible. The goal was as big as it
could be. We just kept shooting threes. That was our game plan, to go out and
shoot threes, and it worked for us.  
  
Q. Shoni, that layup you made over Griner, first of all, how did you do
that? Second of all, there were some words expressed between the two of you.
Were you surprised you didn't get called for a technical at that point?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was just showing emotion. I was just excited. I just hopped
up and was screaming, Yeah! Nothing personal or anything.  
I mean, I just put the ball in the hoop is how I made it. Nothing too special.
I saw her going one way, caught her off guard, went the other way. She was off
balance for a second, so I just went up on the left side.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on the win. We'll continue with
questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey said the officials allowed more stuff to go on, more
physical play, than any game since she's had Brittney Griner. Did you feel it
was an unusually physical game? If so, did you think it benefited your team as
opposed to Baylor?  
COACH WALZ: I mean, understand, our goal was to stand in front of her, have
one behind her. It's just really hard to comment on that. I really didn't
think it was really all that exciting to watch as an official. I'm not sure
what sometimes they were watching.  
The fifth foul on Shoni, I'm still trying to figure out what took place there.  
You know, we turned and boxed her out. We stood in front of her. We did a
really nice job. I told Antonita, Go under her elbows, go under her elbows. We
tried to stay as vertical as we could without putting bodies on her.  
I mean, you know, it's a game where if you let Brittney catch you wherever she
wants to, she's going to score. She's the best player I've coached against and
tried to game plan against.  
When shots went up, we turned and boxed her out. When she got the ball, I told
them straight up, do not ever bat down on the ball because I didn't want her
to get to the free‑throw line.  
At one point in time, I mean, we're up 20, and it's 8‑0 on fouls. We were
driving at times and kicking, we still couldn't get one called. I promise you,
we were trying to box out every time.  
There's no question, there were a lot of fouls called against us. I was just
thankful on that last drive when Monique Reid went in for the layup, it was a
late whistle, but I was glad he caught it because she got clobbered.  
  
Q. There was a team technical called.  
COACH WALZ: That was on me. I was outside the coaching box. I've learned, I'm
better off if I wear a sport coat because I can step out and rip that off and
go halfway on the floor and you won't get a technical. If you sit on the
scorer's table three feet outside the box, you're going to get one.  
Even though my kid fouled out. My whole thing was, Damn, she fouled out. I sat
on the score table thinking, Who are they going to put in? They run across the
floor and give me a T. I haven't worn a sport coat all season, so I think I
might wear three of them on Tuesday night. It's like that commercial, when you
travel, I can run out, take one off, run back out, take a second one off, it's
okay (laughter).  
I don't know. I mean, our kids still found a way to persevere. Despite me
getting a T, they found a way to grind it out at the end.  
  
Q. Without giving away too many secrets, what exactly was it? Was it a box
‑and‑one?  
COACH WALZ: We came out in what we call (indiscernible) one. It's like a 1‑3
zone. I didn't want to get too set up in the box where we gave the wings
anything they wanted. We had Antonita stay in the front if the ball was on the
one side of the floor. The whole goal was to jab out, come back, jab out, come
back.  
I just didn't believe, deep down I kept telling my players every timeout, if
they make 10 to 15 threes, they're going to beat us. I don't think they can
make enough threes to beat us, but I know Brittney can make three‑ and
four‑footers all night long.  
Odyssey does a good job she went 3‑9 and hit some big ones. Jordan Madden goes
2‑3\. At the end of the night they're 6‑17\. And then we only allowed Brittney
10 shots, she goes 4‑10.  
Defensively we did everything we wanted to do. It got to a point when Sara is
hitting a step‑back three in the corner, I don't know what to do. I mean, from
my side, it's not like I drew that up, all right? We start to make some shots.
I told our kids, The pressure is on them. I didn't want to try to slow the
ball up. You can drive and kick. If you're open, shoot it. If there's any
question, bring the ball back out.  
So defensively that's what we did. We switched a few possessions of going man
to zone for a few passes, then jumped into man, trying to get them a little
bit confused.  
Overall I have to give all the credit to our players. I tell everybody all
year long, I've not made a shot or gotten a rebound all year. So we can put
the game plan together, but it's all about the kids.  
  
Q. So much about the defense on Brittney Griner. What about the offense? You
took her out of the lane. Even on the last play she was out so far, was not
able to get back. Talk about your offense.  
COACH WALZ: Well, that's kind of what we talked about, to be honest with you.
This is what we have to do to guard 'em. I told our kids, If we don't score 70
points, we don't have a chance to win. Our whole goal was to try to get to 70.  
I don't think anybody had scored over 70 on 'em this entire year. I'm 90% sure
nobody has scored 80 on 'em. I told our kids, We got to keep scoring. If they
score, fine, we're going to come down and score.  
I mean, I was all excited because we started the game. I'm sure y'all saw. I
put Bria Smith on the offensive end. With the first possession of the game, it
was five on four them. If we don't foul, they're going to score. We're taking
the ball and throwing it the length of the floor for a layup.  
Bria was wide open, standing back on the three‑point line. It took me two days
of practice to get her to stand. She wanted to come down and guard.
Unfortunately, we got called for a foul so we weren't able to execute it.  
Our goal was to score, score and score. I told our kids, If we have to take 40
to 50 threes, we will. I don't know if we could go out there right now 5‑0 and
go 16 of 25. But we did it in the biggest game of the year for us. Now we're
going to hopefully keep our momentum going and see what we can do on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Did you keep your composure in this game?  
COACH WALZ: I was mild compared to what I usually am. Oh, yeah, my kids know
how I am. I'm fighting for them. So if I think some calls aren't going our
way, I'm not just going to sit there and take it.  
I stood up for our players. I mean, I'll have to watch Bria Smith's charge
there for her fifth foul. With all the contact going on on both hands, how do
you make that call? Shoni Schimmel's fifth foul on the drive, I'm dumbfounded.
Kids are getting knocked down and bringing it across with body contact, it's
not called. That's fine, but I'm not just going to sit there and take it.  
They warned me a few times. Because I was three feet out of my box, sitting on
the scorer's table, they gave me a technical foul.  
That's how I coach, my kids know it.  
  
Q. Outside of this arena, what your men's team did today was the biggest
story in sports. Did you guys know about everything that happened there?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we were all sitting in our locker room cheering on
our men, and we saw it. It's probably the most devastating injury in sports
that I've seen. I was watching I'm not sure what it is when Joe Theismann got
his leg broken. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that.  
I told our kids before the game, I said, You know what, it's a basketball
game. Even for us tonight, I mean, I'm not sure where this stands on victories
in women's college basketball, but I'll have to say it's kind of high up
there.  
At the end of the day, it's a basketball game. Both teams come out here and
compete and give it everything you have. We're watching our men play, and
Kevin has an injury that obviously he's out for the year. Who knows how bad it
is. I just told them, I said, Go out there and give it everything you've got.
But at the end of the day it's a basketball game.  
We all said a prayer for him before we went out. I just have to give a lot of
credit to Coach Pitino, the players, because to be there and see something
like that happen, 'cause I saw the expression of the players on the floor and
the players on the bench, where it was right in front of them, to be able to
bounce back from that and get your mind refocused and win an elite game to go
to the Final Four against Duke, not like they're playing a bad team, I think
it says a lot about what Coach Pitino has done with his team, the type of
players they have.  
I know we were really, really excited to hear that they had won and moved on.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Tennessee  74  
Oklahoma  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Holly Warlick from Tennessee. Coach,
your opening thoughts.  
COACH WARLICK: It was a really hard‑fought game for us. I'm extremely proud of
these young ladies. We talk a lot about where we start and then where we are
now. I keep saying this, but this team, they play in the moment. They play
each possession like it's their last. As a coach, you don't want to coach
effort. I have not from day one had to coach effort. We've actually coached
and taught.  
The credit is to them and how hard they've worked, the hours they've put in,
just their listening and wanting to go to practice. I know it starts with
practice.  
The only time they didn't want to go to practice was the day before yesterday.
They keep thinking we go too long, but I'll let them slide on that one.  
I thought Oklahoma, a great crowd, a tremendous crowd. I think Sherri and her
team have done a fabulous job with the amount of injuries.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kamiko, you kind of set the tone for the game when you got that first
steal. Can you go over that play.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I mean, she smiled at me, so I knew I had to get low. She
swings the ball in front of her, I happened to stick my hand in there. I just
kind of reacted to the ball.  
  
Q. Kamiko, generally being able to slow her down for the game, take her out
of their offense, can you talk about the impact that had.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I think it had a great impact. I think it started in the
locker room. Coach Elzy challenged me to guard her, bring my best defense. My
teammates helped me out. So it wasn't just me.  
Most of the time I was on her and I just tried to live up to that challenge
from Elzy, because if not, I was going to hear about it later. Didn't want
that to happen (laughter).  
  
Q. Taber, talk about how the tone is set with your team on the defensive
end?  
TABER SPANI: Well, I think obviously everyone knows Tennessee is defense and
rebounding. We've stressed that from day one. I think Holly's style is she
really wanted full court pressure or get into the ball and pressure them.  
I think that just plays right into the personnel that we have, with the
athleticism we have, especially at the top with Kamiko or with Jasmine or
Meighan up there on the ball.  
We wanted to come in, set the tempo early, dictate to them that we were going
to be the ones pressuring. We were trying to get them out of their offense
because they're a great offensive team when they're able to run their sets.  
I think that helped us on the offensive end because we got steals, kind of got
into a little bit of a rhythm. I thought we did one of our best jobs all year
of really passing the ball, being unselfish, making the extra pass. We got
into a really nice rhythm in the first half.  
  
Q. Isabelle, talk about the rotation of the guard, the post situation.
Certainly McFarland, she's going to get her rebounds. Talk about the rotation
that you have in the post position.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think for this game it definitely brought a challenge for
our posts to actually have to step out of the paint and guard on the
perimeter. That's something we're not used to.  
Coach Elzy and Holly talked about that today and yesterday, that we have to go
out and get out of our comfort zone and guard the perimeter. I think we did a
pretty good job on that.  
  
Q. Taber, can you talk about how your young posts have developed.  
TABER SPANI: It's been tremendous for us. I think as a player, you see them in
the off‑season, you see the talent, the potential. We've seen that ever since
they stepped foot on our campus.  
The maturity, Izzy has done a great job of taking the post under her wing, she
really kind of owns that group. She wants them to get better collectively and
it will help us as a whole.  
Cierra came in and made really big shots. Both of them have done a tremendous
job of rehabbing in order for them to get back to this point.  
I think Bashaara is just mature beyond her years, the big baskets, the big
boards she provides for us.  
  
Q. Can all three of you players talk about, again, the next game is going to
be played, but certainly you played Baylor, there's no guarantee they're going
to win, but talk about going into that game, just preparing and how you have
to get ready for that team.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I personally think, I mean, Brittney Griner, she looks like
she's going to get hers, but we have to shut down their guards, shut down
Odyssey, shut down Hayden, she killed us when we were at Baylor. Get after
Madden and Destiny Williams, the other post player.  
We can't focus so much on Brittney. She's going to get her rebounds, her
points. I think if we can shut down the perimeter, we should be in business.  
TABER SPANI: I think it's a mindset, us included, so many times we've played
them, you go in and you feel like you have to change your entire game plan
because of Brittney. Granted, she's one of the greatest players ever to play
our game. I think it's our mindset going in, we're not going to be scared. The
power of belief is really big for us. We believe in each other, what we can
do, who we can be. I think that confidence level is going to help us.  
Especially having the experience of going down and playing at their place with
this team this year, we didn't have Izzy because she hurt her ankle that game.
So our mindset is going to be go in and attack, and whatever happens, happens.
But we're not going to go in and let down by any stretch of the imagination.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think, especially being y'all's last season, we're going
to play with a chip on our shoulder. I'm having a lot of flashbacks from last
year that may be the case. If anything, I want to prevent that feeling,
because I don't want it to come back.  
I'm going to give it my all, play hard for these guys, Holly, the rest of the
team, Pat, of course. I'm just going to go at it.  
  
Q. Isabelle, it looked as though you were moving better today and seemed
more comfortable on the floor since you had your injury. Was that the case?
How good did you feel out there today?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I felt really good. I was doing a lot of rehab on this
trip. Me and (indiscernible) have been basically roommates. I'm glad I can get
out there and do the best I can. I need to talk to her when I'm hurting. I'm
feeling really good.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, congratulations on your win. We'll continue with
questions for coach now.  
  
Q. Holly, when your backcourt struggles shooting the way they did, yet you
still controlled this whole game, talk about how many other things you did
right.  
COACH WARLICK: Meighan Simmons, 1 for 15, that's obviously unusual for her.
What I loved about Meighan and what she did, she didn't let her offense affect
her defense. I don't think any of the players did. We've stressed so much on
the defensive side and the rebounding side, I just don't think they had time
to think about what they were doing offensively.  
That's a different mindset than we've had. It's a different mindset that
Meighan has had. I know she wanted to play, and play so hard. But I love that
she was still in the game and still defending.  
We had some players step up. Meighan didn't play well, then we had Jasmine
Jones, who I thought had a great game. So we had people step up, Cierra
Burdick. That's the sign of a solid team. Massengale didn't shoot the ball
well. We moved the ball. 14 assists was good for us. We found a way to win.  
  
Q. Against the predictions of many people, you've earned your way back to
the same position where the season ended last year, going into the Elite 8,
probably to face Baylor. Assuming that's the matchup that you get, you have a
younger squad this year than last. What do you have to do to have a different
outcome?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we should be familiar with them because we've seen them
three out of the last four years in the NCAA tournament. I think we have some
familiarity with them.  
You know, you have to make shots at the outside. You've got to make shots.
You've got to take care of the basketball. As Kamiko said, Griner, she's in a
league of her own, so you can't get caught up in what she does. I think you've
got to take care of everybody else. You got to make shots.  
I think when we played them down there, we played a better second half because
we settled down. Hopefully playing them, especially on their home court, has
given us the opportunity to see her and play against them. It's not our first
time, which hopefully will help us.  
  
Q. The deeper you go into the season, it seems Kamiko keeps raising her
game. Couldn't you almost make a case that she's the most valuable player on
the team at this point?  
COACH WARLICK: Absolutely. I totally agree with you. We're asking her to lock
down the opponents' best offensive player, then we want her to make plays on
the offensive end as well.  
She has stepped up. She has a maturity about her. She's just taken this team.
She's wrapped her arms around this team and said, Let's go.  
I will tell you, at the beginning of the year, if I had to say Kamiko was
going to be our leader, I would say no. But our players love her. She's done a
heck of a job on and off the floor being a leader for them.  
So my hat is off to her. She has exceeded my expectations. I knew what Kamiko
could do. It was just a matter if she was going to commit to do it, and I
think she has. She and Izzy both have stepped up and played big for us. She's
done a heck of a job.  
  
Q. In this game in particular, it seemed like she not only limited
Ellenberg, but she was responsible for entry passes.  
COACH WARLICK: I think Kamiko Williams is an extremely talented young lady.
When she puts it all together, she gets a great mindset, she can do just about
anything.  
I think Kyra spent a lot of time with her preparing her for this game and she
had a mindset of what she needed to do and she did it.  
When she gets zoned in, she understands that our success relies on how she
plays, how hard she plays, what she does on the defensive end. I think she has
now stepped up and taken a lot of responsibility.  
Four years ago, she would not have been mature enough to step up and do the
things she has now. She's a senior. It's her team. It's her and Taber's team.
She's leading by example. I can't tell you, I'm really, really proud of her. I
knew she had it in her. We're just right now getting it out of her. Very proud
of her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your bench and your rotations, substitutions.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think to bring Izzy off the bench is huge for us.
Cierra Burdick, too. Both those young ladies started, then they both went out
with injury. I think they give us a punch, especially Izzy on the defensive
end, Cierra is very consistent offensively.  
So the thing about this team is they have not complained or had a hard time
about starting, who is playing. We've got a good thing going, a good rotation,
and they know they're all going to play.  
So actually I've wanted to get Izzy back in the lineup, but I didn't know
where I could put her because everybody else is playing so well. And Jasmine
Jones, I thought she had a great game for us. She's a freshman athlete that
doesn't know how good she can be.  
I just think we stepped up and did some really good things when we needed to.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the baton that you gave to the girls, the significance
of it, where it came from.  
COACH WARLICK: We have a new coach, a new staff, so we talked about passing
the baton on from Pat's regime and what she has built, the legacy she built,
the tradition she built. There are differences, we understand that. But we
have the same heart and the same drive, the same commitment.  
We just wanted Pat to pass the baton on to our players and understand that we
represent the University of Tennessee, and what Pat built. We want to make
sure we carry on that tradition. There is a new group, a new staff, but we
still have the same belief that we're Tennessee, and we're going to represent
Tennessee and Pat Summitt to the best of our ability.  
  
Q. How big a deal is it that Isabelle will be back for Baylor? She couldn't
play the last time.  
COACH WARLICK: I think it's huge for us in any game. Any big game we have
played, we really didn't have Isabelle. She played maybe about five minutes in
the Notre Dame game and was not very effective coming off one of her knee
injuries.  
She brings this team a lot of confidence. I think she's huge to our success.
I've said it all year. I think when we get her healthy, we have her
availability, everybody else, we're a different team. We're a different team
with her, we just are.  
When you have somebody back there, she makes up for defensive miss‑assignments
or getting beat on the drive, she makes up for her presence inside with being
able to block shots. She's a huge difference for us, huge game changer for us.  
  
Q. So did Pat actually give the baton to them?  
COACH WARLICK: No, we came up with the baton. Actually our staff came up with
it. We just wanted something to represent what was and what's going to be.
Everybody that touched our program, academic advisors, our president, our
athletic director, our associate athletic director, everybody that is part of
our program got a baton, our administrative assistants, because they're just
as much a part of our program as our team and staff.  
We just thought it was important that everybody get aboard. We're not going to
be able to survive unless we have this big huge family. So we gave everybody a
baton. We've just been passing it around. It's been huge for us.  
So it's something that we identify with. Like I said, it brings back our
tradition. But we know we got to move forward and pass the baton and get our
own identity. But we're never going to lose the identity that the Lady Vols
have.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Louisville  82  
Baylor  81

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. We'll go straight to questions for our
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, the last play, the foul they called, did you feel like you got
it clean?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, I feel like I got all ball, but, you know, I mean,
wasn't my call. That's all.  
  
Q. Brittney, this was an incredibly physical game. How much might that have
bothered you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We see physical games every night. Most of the time, get more
calls.  
But, hey, you know, you just play through it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, y'all were down 19 with 10 minutes to go. Can you talk about the
way y'all fought back. What got you back in the game?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: We just kept fighting and never gave up. We pushed each other.
Came down to the wire and made big plays.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about when you hit those two free throws at the
end, did you think that might have been enough?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I did all I can for my team. I never stopped fighting. I wasn't
hitting all of my shots, but I never stopped shooting. I made some big shots
down the stretch. I made all my free throws.  
We were right there. Just couldn't finish it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about how difficult it is with a team like that.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: They jumped on us from the start and we didn't respond. Had a
late start late in the second half, picked it up.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes and continue with questions
for coach.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've seen every conceivable defense to stop Brittney, but it
seemed like they always had three players in her vicinity at all times.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm sure Jeff could answer better than I could. I think they
were in a box in one. Whoever was on one side, they had another play behind
her. He can tell you better what they did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their zone, that they were double ‑ and triple‑teaming
Brittney.   
COACH MULKEY: You want to attack dribble‑penetration, but you also have to hit
some 10‑ and 12‑foot jumpers early in the game. I thought other than them
shooting lights out on the offensive end, I thought we were patient with what
they were doing defensively.  
Guys, you just had an opportunity to beat a team that made 16 threes and
Griner got 10 touches, and you go up 1 with nine seconds to go, that's pretty
remarkable. You're supposed to get blown out if you get 16 threes, and we
didn't get blown out.  
  
Q. How critical was it not to have a timeout there at the end? What
specifically should have happened?  
COACH MULKEY: They've been taught what to do there. I think they were in such
shock that it was a foul called, and I'll be glad to answer any referee
question you want to ask me, because I don't mind getting fined, so ask me.
Now is the time to ask me, okay?  
But we didn't do what they've been taught to do. We're supposed to throw it.
You've seen us do it many times, throw it to halfcourt for Griner, then let
the two guards cross and look for a good shot.  
I don't know really other than maybe they were in a state of shock that a foul
was called there. I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the officiating in this game.  
COACH MULKEY: I thought the game started out way too physical, way too
physical. I thought that all three of them, if they go past this round of
officiating, it will be sad for the game.  
I thought the two critical calls at the end of the game were really bad.
Jordan Madden drives in the paint. We already have the missed shot. She calls
an offensive foul on Madden right there. Well, why so late? Odyssey Sims had
the rebound in her hand.  
Then I don't know about that at the end. It was on the opposite end. I'd have
to go see it. You saw it. What did y'all think? Was it a foul? Did anybody
here think it was a foul? Honestly, tell me.  
  
Q. I thought it was a foul.  
COACH MULKEY: Okay. All I can tell you is the one in front of me, the charge
was critical, it was critical. I thought it got personal with both teams. When
you allow it to be that physical, you have taunting. I thought Schimmel went
and got in Griner's face and all they did was warn her. When Odyssey and
Schimmel got into it right there, it became a technical and a technical.
What's the difference?  
It got out of hand and it got personal with players, and you don't like to see
that.  
  
Q. It seemed to get out of hand, like you said. Both coaches were jumping
around. Were you concerned that your players were going to keep their
composure when coaches and everyone were sort of going crazy on the
sidelines?  
COACH MULKEY: When you're down 19, then up 1 with nine seconds to go, do you
think they kept their composure? We were down 19 and we went up with nine
seconds to go? Did they keep their composure?  
  
Q. I was talking about the last possession when the foul was called, were
you concerned people were going to make the right decision?  
COACH MULKEY: The girl drove by Griner, your All‑American post player. I'm not
ever concerned about Brittney making a bad decision. You said it was a foul.
I'll have to go back and see it. I don't think the referee raised his hand
that it was a foul. I thought he was raising his hand that it was going the
other direction. I thought he was just going to say it was our ball. I don't
know.  
I am proud of the fact that the kids fought hard because they could have quit
on you really, and they didn't.  
Compliment and credit Louisville. If Louisville can hit 16 threes a game, good
Lord, they'll win a national championship.  
  
Q. Did you feel those threes they hit, were they open shots? Did they maybe
surprise you with how deep they were shooting them?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the post player that Griner is guarding, she hits a
couple. That's when you know it's going to be a long day. I'm not sure she's
taken a whole lot of threes all year.  
That was their game plan, to shoot a lot of threes, and they made a lot of
them. We would cut the lead, they would hit another three late in the shot
clock.  
Of the 16, I'm not quite sure how many of them were open because of our poor
defense, where they penetrated, kicked out, we helped off. But you got to make
shots. They weren't coming in the paint, were they? And they made 'em.  
  
Q. There early in the second half, you cut it to 5. Then they hit seven
threes. They made the big lead. Did that make it the toughest to come back
on?  
COACH MULKEY: Every three that they hit when we would cut the lead made it
that much tougher. You keep thinking through the course of the game that
they're going to start missing some. But they never did. Then I just thought
that our full court pressure allowed us to make plays and got us back in it.  
Tough way to lose. It's hard to lose when it's your last game, but it's even
harder the way that game ended. Makes it a little tougher.  
  
Q. Did you express your opinion to the officials as the game was going
along? Were you very vocal about that?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, yes.  
  
Q. You've had other physical games since you've had Brittney. Did you think
more was allowed in this game?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, yes.  
  
Q. You hate to see players, not just Brittney, go out after all they've
accomplished fighting back tears. How do you as a coach help your team put
this in perspective so they're not remembering this one loss but all they have
accomplished?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you don't do it tonight. There's nothing I can say to them
tonight that's going to make them feel good. You just try to help them get
their composure and you protect them like a mother hen.  
As I told them in the locker room, I'll take every hit you want to write,
about we choked, Baylor or bust, epic disappointment. Put it right here on
these shoulders. Don't you point one finger on those kids, you put it right on
me.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Tennessee  74  
Oklahoma  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Sherri Coale from Oklahoma. Coach,
your thoughts about this afternoon's game.  
COACH COALE: First of all, I just want to congratulate a very, very good
Tennessee team. I thought they played extraordinarily well today. First half
they really made a bunch of baskets early, kind of punched us right at the
beginning.  
But I am incredibly proud of our basketball team. Thought the final five
minutes of the game they just fought with a passion and spirit that defines
our program.  
Even though we didn't win the game, the season is over, I could not be more
proud of a group of kids.  
These guys have done amazing things this season against really unbelievable
odds. To lose Mo in the first nine minutes of the game, a kid that plays 40
minutes for us, to survive, hang around, keep fighting, just depicts the
character of this team.  
I have loved coaching them and I am so sad that I don't get to coach them
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Joanna, you seem pretty emotional. Can you talk about what the last few
weeks have been like for you and the emotions you were feeling as the final
seconds ticked off.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Well, it's always sad at the end of something. This is just
the end of a part of my life. This team means so much to me that it was really
sad.  
But I'm looking forward to the future and I know this team's going to be great
next year.  
  
Q. Sharane and Joanna, if you could talk about the offensive struggles
today.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: I mean, you can't stop shooting because the ball's not going
in. You got to keep trying. I mean, you just got to keep trying. That's what
we did.  
I mean, eventually we started making shots. But by that time, it was too late.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: We did everything right execution‑wise. We got open shots.
They just weren't falling. I don't know if you could call it nerves or a
different backdrop, I don't know. But sometimes the ball just doesn't go in
the basket.  
We did everything we possibly could. It just wasn't our night shooting.  
  
Q. Joanna, you were so excited to get to come home. Can you talk about the
atmosphere.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: It was amazing. Just running out on the court and hearing
people scream and yell for us, that was really, really awesome. I think just
coming home and playing my last game, our last game of the season at home, was
really special and it's something we'll cherish.  
  
Q. When Morgan had to go out of the game, how did that affect you guys in
the immediate aftermath of that, emotionally and on the court?  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: You got to find a way. I mean, that's the only answer. You
can't panic. We still had basically the whole first and second half to go. I
mean, if anything, play hard for her. She doesn't want you to feel sad, dig a
hole just because we're emotional.  
You just got to play through it.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Yeah, Morgan is our point guard, she plays, like coach said,
almost 40 minutes a game. She's kind of the floor leader, gets us in the
offense and everything. We kind of missed that.  
At the same time we had Jasmine. She's a fifth‑year senior and can run the
offense just as well.  
It was kind of both ways, just a different feel in the game with Jasmine in,
but at the same time, we trusted her completely. It wasn't that much of a...  
  
Q. With all the ups and downs of the season, the emotion after the game, did
you hear the ovation your crowd gave you at the end of the game?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: It was really, really special. I really appreciate them all
staying and cheering and everything. It means a lot to be appreciated for what
we've done this year.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: Yeah, I agree. It was just great. My first Sweet 16 and I
got to come home and, you know, just see this crowd. It was just an amazing
feeling. I want to do it again. I am going to do it again. We're going to do
it again, so...  
  
Q. Joanna, last time we talked about Tennessee you said they were really
quick. Was tonight different from last time? Has anything changed? Did they
just seem like the same team?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Well, I think at first they had a couple quick transition
baskets, and I think it kind of shocked us a little bit.  
We stopped their transition. I don't think it was the quickness so much. We
got a little uptight, wound up, and I think that's what really affected our
offense.  
  
Q. Joanna, if Baylor wins this second game, you know Baylor's post as well
as anybody, you went against the Tennessee post today, can you give us a
comparison between those two post players?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Obviously Baylor has the size advantage. I don't know. I
think it's going to be a physical game between the two of them. They're
similar in some ways, but very different in a lot of ways.  
I think Tennessee is probably quicker. Baylor, it's hard to get around
Brittney.  
  
Q. Joanna, obviously disappointing to have it end this way, but is this a
thing where it may take you a little time to appreciate what you've been able
to accomplish?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Uhm, probably a little bit. We've kind of across the year
taken a step back and, Okay, we're doing something special right now. But at
the end I guess now, it might take us a little while just to really bask in
what we've accomplished.  
  
Q. Joanna, if one of your younger teammates comes to you in the next few
days and says, I want to make the kind of jump you made in your career, what
would you tell them?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: First of all, I'd tell them to get in the gym and work,
because that was a big part of it. But also just to play free and to play to
have no regrets because that's the way I played this season.  
  
Q. What do you see from this team next year? Do you think a game like you
had today, Sharane, can catapult you toward doing this kind of thing box score
‑wise next year?   
JOANNA McFARLAND: We're going to be great next year. The league is going to be
somewhere where they could win the league, I think. They're only losing one
starter and they're going to get a lot of people back. They're going to be a
force to be reckoned with next year. They're going to be really good.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: Well, I feel like I can make an impact. This game alone has
taught me a lot, just this one game. I mean, after the game, I realized these
seniors taught me something. Whitney Hand taught me how to be a leader on the
court. Lyndsey taught me how to play with emotion. Jo taught me how to be
tough, crash, rebound, want the ball. Jazz taught me how to love defense.  
I just learnt all these things from these seniors. I'm going to be a junior,
but I'm going to show all my teammates that we can do this. I'm going to take
this role as being one of the leaders and try to bring us back here, bring us
further.  
I think next year is going to be great. I can't wait.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. We'll now take
questions for Coach Coale.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the impact Kamiko Williams of Tennessee had on the
game.  
COACH COALE: Big, strong guard. Gives us a matchup problem. Try to keep
Sharane on Simmons because she's a prolific scorer, that puts Vegas on Kamiko,
which is a bad thing size‑wise.  
Great athlete, good rebounder, really strong defender, hard to get around,
plays really hard. Yeah, she impacted it in a variety of ways.  
  
Q. Right now, is it hard to embrace don't cry now but be happy because it
happened?  
COACH COALE: Not really. When you're proud of your kids and they did
everything you asked them to do, not really. I would love to be going to New
Orleans to play in the Final Four. The thing that makes me most sad is we
don't have practice tomorrow. I don't get to be around them in the same
environment together that we've been in up to this point.  
That's sad, but at the same time, wow, what a ride they took us all on. They
were unbelievable. I got to be a part of that, so...  
No, not that hard.  
  
Q. Sharane's game was inspiring, how she played. I know she's given you so
many tough minutes throughout the year. When you think about what she could
provide for you, you have to be pretty optimistic about her coming back and
leading this team next year.  
COACH COALE: You know as inspiring as her play was for 40 minutes tonight, I
think that little speech she just gave might have been more so. Now you see
how we were able to do this. They get it. She'll be back for two more years.  
  
Q. This game and this tournament, the emotions run so high. Close games,
emotions peak at the end. This got away from you early. Can you describe how
you manage your emotions during a game when it's clear early on that it's not
your night.  
COACH COALE: Well, that's the difference. You thought it got away from us and
it was over early and I had to manage my emotions. I didn't. I didn't think it
was over. With four minutes left, I thought, Stranger things have happened,
let's go make some baskets. You're in the moment.  
This team has done incredible things this year in the face of situations where
most people would just succumb and say, All right, let's get 'em next time.
Not these guys.  
As their leader, I don't get to do that either. We just played a
possession‑by‑possession game. You think in a minute, those shots Vegas was
getting, they would go. They did go eventually, just too little too late.  
  
Q. Could you talk about when you lost Morgan, what that did in terms of
putting all the pressure on Jazz.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, that was one of those where you're like, Really? Seriously?
After everything, now we're going to drop another one right here in the Sweet
16?  
I had a feeling when Morgan hit the floor it might be a concussion because she
hit really hard.  
Fortunately Jazz has experience leading the basketball team, though most of
the season when she has subbed in, she's not subbed in as point guard, she's
played anything from 2 that 4. Morgan plays 38 to 40 minutes a game. There was
a lot of pressure on Jazz. I thought she handled herself really well. What
hurt us worse was Tennessee changing defense.  
I was really proud of her. I thought she fought like crazy and defended and
rebounded and did all the things we asked her to do.  
  
Q. Talk about the senior class, the legacy they're going to leave here.  
COACH COALE: Well, we have on our locker room door in every entrance, Leave
your story better than you found it. It's what we challenge our kids to do,
every single class that comes through. That's your charge.  
We've had some pretty special people and some pretty special classes at the
University of Oklahoma. That gets to be a rather daunting task after a while.
You leave your story better than you found it. Most of them find a pretty good
story these days.  
These four kids did. The fiber of who we are, the character that they
displayed, their belief, their trust, their faith, admiration in one another
is off the charts.  
All things that are good they left us.  
  
Q. It's a really young post crew for Tennessee, but they're developing
quickly. How would you gauge them, specifically Burdick and Harrison?  
COACH COALE: Really, really good tonight. Really good from the high post.
Really athletic. Have perimeter skills as well as great length. They gave us
trouble. Against the zone, they make good decisions. Against the man, they
were very physical.  
I thought they were really good.  
  
Q. Even though Morgan left the game, she seemed to stay in it emotionally.
Can you talk about her on the bench after her injury.  
COACH COALE: I'm sorry, I was into the game and I didn't really pay attention.  
I expect her to be in the game. She's a leader, she's a captain. It's what she
does. I know she was incredibly dizzy. I know she was capable of doing what
she was supposed to do.  
  
Q. It seemed like you had a lot of momentum when you came out of the locker
room. Can you talk about the adjustments you made at the half?  
COACH COALE: I think we were a little bit like a boxer who got stunned in the
first half, disoriented, shaky, we lost Mo. They popped us pretty good. For a
little bit there they were shooting 85%. Like seriously?  
But then we steadied them at halftime, talked about having been there before,
having come back from behind before, made a little adjust on ball screen
coverage, talked about establishing Nic in the post. I thought she came out
and performed as a different kid in the second half.  
You know, we had ourselves right there. Would love to know how the story might
be different had we made a couple of those open shots early in the second
half. We got stops. Crowd was behind us. We got exactly the looks that we
wanted and they just didn't go in, two or three of them, all the way into the
bottom of the basket and back out.  
It takes life from you when you have those, especially when you're behind, and
they don't go down. Yet we battled, continued, we just couldn't dig ourselves
out of the hole we put ourselves in early.  
  
Q. Considering the narrative of this season as a whole, it didn't end up the
way you wanted it to, did this team climb every step to the ladder?  
COACH COALE: You know what, they did and then some. The way I feel about these
kids will fill me for years. The young guys who got to see the examples set by
the senior class, what a gift they've been given. Whitney and Lyndsey were
absolutely unbelievable this year.  
They're two guys that they don't get to play any more, they show up every day,
they stay invested. That is so hard. The easiest thing to do is just seal up,
maybe be there, but not really be there. Those two guys were all in every day.  
I know that left a gaping, open wound inside their heart, and they did it
anyway. Those kids they did it for, they know. They'll be forever indebted.  
Now they'll treat their future teammates in the same manner. They know what it
means to be right. Preach it all you want, but until kids feel it, it's hard
to get it done. That's the gift the senior class gave these guys.  
Did we climb up the ladder? Yeah, I think we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it was like going against Holly, how she does or
doesn't resemble Pat Summitt?  
COACH COALE: I don't think they look a thing alike (laughter). Thank goodness
I wasn't going one‑on‑one against Holly. I'm a little irritated I didn't get
any asks on where would I be on the one‑on‑one tournament.  
Here is what Holly has done. Honestly, what a tough job. Seriously, do you
want to follow Pat Summitt?  
Holly has put her personality on that team. She jumps around the sidelines,
has a lot of energy, passion, yet she's fun, has some humor wound up in all
that. I think her team is feeding off that. I told her that at halfcourt, what
a difficult position, yet what a fantastic job she had done with this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments.  
COACH COALE: Thank you.

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Kamiko Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25287)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with head coach Holly Warlick, then we'll take
questions from the floor.  
COACH WARLICK: Excited to be here obviously. Our team has worked extremely
hard to get to this point. We, as everybody else, have dealt with injuries,
and we're young. But that has not played a part in our struggles.  
We have I think the majority of our team, everybody back, except one young
lady, excited about that. Really love this team. They work hard. For coaches,
that's half the battle. As a coach, you want to be able to coach and not coach
effort. For the most part, I've not had to coach effort this year.  
Excited to be here in Oklahoma City. Everyone has treated us very nicely.
We've been here before. It's just a great place to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. You talked about being here before back in 2008. Pretty eventful
regional. What do you remember from that weekend?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we won, so...  
Had Candace Parker. She dislocated her shoulder. We won. You can't forget that
opportunity we had here.  
Yeah, great crowd. We played Texas A&M in the finals, so...  
Very eventful for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the journey this team has been on just to get here,
the ups and downs, what has made it such a special ride so far.  
COACH WARLICK: Sure. Starting our season off with a loss on the road to UT
Chattanooga. When you look at our schedule, I know as coaches it made us very
nervous. First three out of the four games were on the road.  
I think this team, they've worked extremely hard in practice. We've had to
deal with injuries, but we just seem to keep going and different people step
up, just play different positions.  
Kamiko Williams has played anywhere from the 1 to 4 position because we had to
move around. We start off ranked 24. We've just played with a chip on our
shoulder. As I said earlier, when you play hard and you have a lot of effort,
great things happen.  
I think our practices have been very competitive. They listened. Haven't had
to coach effort. I think they understand the importance of hopefully now
defense and rebounding.  
We're an offensive‑minded team trying to teach them to play on the other end.
So I think they bought into it when we got into our season. And I tell you, I
have an unbelievable staff. When I got hired here, the first thing I thought
was important was to go out and get the best staff I think for the University
of Tennessee. I went out and got Kyra Elzy, Jolette Law, Dean Lockwood stayed.
It's amazing how my staff has formed relationships with the players, has a
great knowledge of the game, obviously great recruiters. But we put a lot of
time being around our kids.  
I think it has paid benefits for us. It's a fun team to be around. We get
upset with them every once in a while, but they are a fun group to be around.  
I think we've put in time and a lot of effort in giving them confidence. I
think it's paid off.  
  
Q. Holly, defensively this team has not always gotten it. You've talked
about that. The last game against Creighton you said may have been the best
defensive performance of the year. After that result, can you sense this week
in practice maybe the team is a little more excited about practicing and
learning defense than they have been prior?  
COACH WARLICK: I hope so (laughter). Every time I get up here, I'm preaching
defense and rebounding.  
I do. The worst thing we did in defense is we couldn't guard the three ball.
Creighton was second in the nation shooting the three ball. Something had to
give.  
I think they understood that like Texas A&M, we had a great offensive night,
but we couldn't stop them. So I think after that loss, then what we had to do
the first and second rounds, I think they get it and understand that we have
to play on the defensive end.  
You got to make stops. I mean, Meighan Simmons can score 20 points, but if her
player scores 30 points, it's not helping us. I'm just using her as an
example. Any of them.  
Just try to make sure they understand the importance of defense and really
team defense. You got to lock your player up, but it is a team defense. I
think they're getting it. It's only taken the whole year, but I hope we got
it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're not inside Oklahoma's locker room, but as you watch
film and digested them, talk about what you see that make them go. They
weren't really expected to still be playing at this point.  
COACH WARLICK: I think they were motivated to get back here to play, number
one. I think they're extremely resilient. They're dealing with a ton of
injuries. But I think Sherri is a great coach and they play hard. I don't care
if they're dealing with five people, six, seven, eight, they play extremely
hard.  
She's got them representing Oklahoma. At this point you got to be doing
something right to get to the Sweet 16. I think Ellenberg has stepped up her
game. I think McFarland stepped up her game. I think they play extremely well
together and feed off each other.  
I don't care what their record is. It's survive and advance, and that's what
they've done.  
  
Q. What are your advantages in the matchup tomorrow, what advantages do you
have?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we've got a little bit more players to play, number one.
I think with Isabelle Harrison back, it really helps us inside. Really takes a
lot of pressure off of Shaar Graves. I think we've got quick guards.  
Our thing is we tend to quick shoot the basketball. I just think we've been
seasoned and have all different styles, so I hope that we're ready for their
style and how hard they play. I want to make sure we match their intensity.  
It has been really good to get our big kid back just because we needed a
different presence inside.  
I think Izzy has brought us a lot of confidence since she's been back. I would
hope that we'll use our inside game 'cause of our height and our physicalness.  
I hope I answered your question (smiling).  
  
Q. Holly, whether it's you, Sherri, any women's basketball coach, there's a
very good chance you're going to have at least one ACL or some tough injury.
On the women's side, it's almost like you have to go in with the mindset of I
know we're not going to have everybody we start off with. How much of that has
to be a mindset that you never let be a mental block for you?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, it is. You have to have 15 people on scholarship because
you got to count on, unfortunately, injuries. We got into the NCAA, I've got
to where we didn't go against each other a lot. Any kid that hit themselves
and fell down, you get nervous. I think at times your philosophy changes when
your numbers are down. You don't want to make contact but you still have to
keep them in shape.  
You have to understand, like this year, Isabelle had two knee injuries and
hurt her ankle. Cierra Burdick broke her hand. Kamiko Williams sprained both
her ankles in one game. I don't know how you do that, but she did that.  
It's just part of our game across the board. It's part of the game. I think as
coaches, I know for our team, we're going to recruit more players so we have
enough to play and play the way we want to play.  
  
Q. Holly, I don't know exactly where to go with this question, but I'd like
for you to reflect on succeeding a legend. It's not easy. Are there easy parts
of it that you like very much or difficult parts that are difficult?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think if you think about it, it's difficult to follow a
legend. I just don't let myself go there.  
Pat was my coach. She was a mentor for me. Now she's a great friend of mine.
So I see Pat in a different light than probably everybody else, which is a
great thing for me.  
She's still around. I still love her around. I want her at every practice. I
talk to her daily. But I can't let myself go there. When I think you're
coaching at the University of Tennessee, following Pat Summitt, it blows my
mind a little bit. So I don't let myself go there.  
I think there's one thing that stands out for me that Pat taught me, is you
surround yourself with great people. I think when I got my staff,
administration, on down to assistant coaches, I allowed them to do a lot.
That's what Pat afforded me. She let me do a lot of things.  
So I don't feel like it's me, it's all me, and I have to make every decision,
because Pat didn't make every decision. She taught me that. So it's a group
effort. It's a team effort. That's how I look at it.  
I just try to focus on every game, each game at a time. I still use her as a
resource. I'm thankful that she was a part of my life as far as teaching me
her philosophy and what's important in basketball, what you need to focus on.
I think that has helped me in that transition.  
But I think probably what's difficult has been not having her in the light
that I'm used to seeing her, her sitting there and watching our team. But it
brings to light for me knowing that she is there and I still have her to
bounce things off, and our kids still have her around.  
It's been a great ride for me and a great opportunity. It has been tough, as
well. So it's a little bit bittersweet. I just relish every day she's with me
and the opportunity to still have her on staff.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments and best of luck
tomorrow night.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student‑athletes, Taber Spani and
Kamiko Williams. We'll take questions from the floor for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. I know that you guys were chosen by SEC coaches to finish fifth in the
SEC. I know your coach was just in here and said she feels like you're just
now getting completely invested in defense. With that in mind, how did you go
14 ‑2 in the SEC? What allowed you to sort of take off as a team?   
TABER SPANI: Well, I think I do agree that we're just starting to kind of
finally buy in completely. I think during the SEC, we would have some really
great spurts of defense, but we just wouldn't be consistent. I think with a
young team, consistency, being able to sustain that for 40 minutes was
something we had to struggle with.  
I think offensively our ability to push the ball. We were scoring pretty much
between 75 to 80 points a game. I think that helps you. But I think the fact
that now we're buying into defense is just going to hopefully make us all the
more dangerous.  
But I guess it's the fact when we could turn it on, we could turn it on. With
a Sweet 16 appearance like this, you can't do that. I think we're finally
buying into that.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I mean, I completely agree on that. I think also, too, we
watch film, watch our bad clips where we can learn, and we watch our good
clips on what helped us defensively win that game. We go back with our
practice guys and do it on the court.  
We're winning games. Like she said, offense has helped us. Especially Coach
Elzy stressed that defense was the key to the game. We won the first two
rounds, we're about to play a good team, four players scoring in
double‑digits. We're buying into it. I'm pretty sure in practice we're going
to prepare for it.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about how tough it will be to slow down Aaryn
Ellenberg.  
TABER SPANI: Well, we have a lot of respect for her. I've watched her
throughout her career. She's a great flat‑out scorer. She's not limited on
anything on the offensive end. She's going to get a lot of attention from us,
we'll key in on her and limit touches. When she does catch the ball, make sure
we're in her space and pressure her because she shot the ball very well up in
Dayton. We're going to have to understand that.  
We'll adjust throughout the game depending on how it goes. But she definitely
has our attention and we respect her a lot.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: I agree with Taber. At the same time coming from a defensive
mindset, I'm probably going to be the one guarding her, I'm going to have to
not get discouraged.  
Just constantly staying after her, don't give her space, try to limit her
touches, keep my confidence in guarding her. I think that's going to be key.  
  
Q. You mentioned you were playing a great team. I don't know how many people
would have said that about Oklahoma two weeks ago, a month ago, six weeks ago.
Do you really see a great team, and how do you make yourself continue to look
at them that way so you bring your best game?  
TABER SPANI: There's 16 teams left. At this point, especially if you won two
in a row, you can get hot. When you start winning and gaining confidence,
every team is dangerous.  
I think, you know, collectively we haven't watched a ton of film on them from
the entire season. But what they're doing right now, that's what's making them
great.  
As for us playing them tomorrow, that's all you can focus on is the here and
now, how they've been playing lately. They have great players. They have great
elements.  
In the last few weeks, they're starting to really gel and come together. Like
I said, we haven't seen their earlier season, what was going on, but right
now, they're kind of starting to find their way.  
So whenever you have great talent, great players like that, a great coach who
has been to a Final Four, has experience like that, then you have a team
that's dangerous.  
KAMIKO WILLIAMS: Like what Taber said, they have more than one option they go
to. A lot of teams we play, there's one or two people we have to focus on.
They have a lot of people that can score. That means more than one of us will
have to play defense.  
Like she said, they just have more options, a lot of elements, a lot of people
they can go to. There's 16 teams left, they're one of them, and they're in our
way.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow night and thank you very much, ladies.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Louisville head coach Jeff Walz. Any
opening comments.  
COACH WALZ: I'd like to say thank you. Very excited about the opportunity to
be playing in the Sweet 16 and looking forward to taking on a very talented,
well‑coached Baylor team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Jeff, Kim said she doesn't know what defense you run mixing it up against
Purdue. I guess that's the perception you wanted.  
COACH WALZ: Half the time I'm not sure our players know either. That's what
makes it so good. We're just not in a situation where we can come out and play
man‑to‑man for 40 minutes, I've got you, you've got me. So we have to sit here
and try to disguise things as much as we can, try to catch teams off balance
if possible.  
Being able to do that has given us the opportunity to create a lot of
turnovers, and we've been able to score off of those.  
So we'll come out here tomorrow night. If we can get away with putting six on
the floor, we will, if not, we won't. We'll try at least once.  
  
Q. What have you been doing in practice this week or what do you plan on
doing in the next hour or so to prepare for Brittney Griner?  
COACH WALZ: There's not much to do. I mean, she's just a special basketball
player that we're going to do what the past 34 teams have done when they
played them: try and keep her away from the basket, if possible, try to make
her earn all of her points, try to make sure we don't allow her too many
opportunities, when she does miss her shot that she can get her own rebound.
That's what she does well: if she misses, she usually gets her own miss back.  
We're going to try to be as physical as we can like everybody else and see if
we can't make her shoot turnaround jump shots instead of layups.  
  
Q. From a mental aspect, how do you approach playing the No.1? Do you
approach it any differently?  
COACH WALZ: No, I mean, we're fortunate enough to play in the Big East, so
we're playing Notre Dame twice, UConn. We're playing against No.1's the entire
season.  
At this point in time, you're just going out and competing for 40 minutes of
basketball clock in two hours. We just have to try and do the best we can at
trying to confuse them, if possible, trying to make sure we limit them to one
shot. Then we have to make sure we get good looks each time down the floor.  
But mentally, our kids are excited to play.  
  
Q. You hear sometimes about teams using goofy tactics in practice to
simulate Griner's wingspan. Have you taken to any of those, brooms, paddles,
or more a traditional route?  
COACH WALZ: No, we haven't done anything like that. We've just gone with our
players, our practice guys. But before we left, we haven't done anything like
that at all.  
We're going to come out here. I've told our kids, if you come out and play
scared, it's not going to matter. So we're going to try to come out and
attack. At the same time I might not be smart, but I don't think I'm dumb.
We're not going to throw the ball in the low block and say shoot over her. At
the same time, we're going to try to make her move some and see if we can't
get some other kids involved that she's not guarding to possibly score in the
block.  
At the same time, if we have a shot, our goal is to shoot it and don't worry
if she does block a few of them.  
  
Q. This is a pretty balanced group among your starters. Is that sort of by
design?  
COACH WALZ: We are very fortunate. With the injuries that we've sustained,
we've still been able to compete at a high level because of the balance that
we have.  
I knew going into the NCAA tournament that we were going to need Antonita
Slaughter to make some shots for us, especially when we got past middle and
the first round. I knew she was going to have to score in order for us to get
past Purdue.  
She got back to shooting the ball like she had the entire season. She took
about a month off, but we were just happy that she found her shot again.  
We have about six or seven that can score between 15 and 18 on any given
night. With having that ability, it at least makes it a little harder for
teams to try to focus on just one player.  
If we're going to have the opportunity to have success and have a chance to
win tomorrow night, we're going to have to have everyone show up and make
shots.  
  
Q. You talked about the way you try to create turnovers. Facing Odyssey Sims
on the other side, how key is it for you to not start turning it over?  
COACH WALZ: It's important for us any night we play. We've actually done a
much better job the past month and a half on taking care of the ball. We've
talked about that. That's part of our focus. Hopefully we'll have the same,
you know, outcome tomorrow night, that we'll get shots and not turn the
basketball over.  
  
Q. I know there are some things you can't do in the shot clock era, but I
remember UTEP beating Kansas with a score in the 30s. Do you think about
trying to do something crazy, strange, getting completely out of your own game
in an effort to try to do something against Baylor and Griner?  
COACH WALZ: I'm trying to put six. I'm hoping our officials are bad at math
tomorrow night and we just get 'em real confused (laughter).  
No, with the shot clock, you have a choice. You can't just pull the basketball
out and try to hold it and just try to milk the clock.  
What I want to make sure is, we're going to try to make sure when we have a
good shot, we get a shot. The whole key to anybody who has any kind of success
against them, they've been able to score.  
They're as well‑balanced as any team I've tried to prepare for. If you don't
score, you don't have a chance. So instead of sitting here and being so
concerned about how are we going to stop them, my biggest concern is to make
sure we score.  
We're going to come out here once we're finished for an hour and a half and
shoot. I'm not worried about how to stop them. I mean, who has stopped them?  
Instead of getting all concerned about how are you going to stop Brittney
Griner from scoring 30, forget it, she's going to. Figure out a way how we can
score 70. If we can figure that out, then you might have a chance to get the
last five minutes of the ballgame where shots start to matter.  
With the success they have had, it's been a while since a shot's mattered in
the last four or five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Jeff, you went against the national championship game, that UConn program
that won two championships in a row. You spoke about Baylor being as balanced
as any team. The personnel is different between these two teams. Can you make
some comparisons about programs reaching that level where they're so hard to
beat?  
COACH WALZ: It's really hard to compare because I look at the UConn teams, you
have Renee Montgomery, Tina Charles, Maya Moore. You have six or seven of them
that were scoring between 15 and 10. There was absolutely nobody that you
could back off of and say, Make 'em shoot the ball.  
On Baylor's side of it, you've got a post player you can't play one‑on‑one.
You just can't. It's about impossible. She's going to score on you. Then you
got Sims at the point, you've got Hayden, guards that shoot well enough from
the three‑point line that you have to guard 'em. They're shooting 40%. You
can't just say, Shoot all you want, because they are good enough to make 'em.  
It's a situation where that one player really makes them a difficult matchup,
but they've got five or six others that are solid basketball players.  
It's hard to compare the two teams. I know I'll be fortunate enough to have
played both. We'll see what we can do tomorrow night because we didn't have
much success with UConn.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you were as proud of this team as your national runner
‑up team. What are the elements that have led you to say that?   
COACH WALZ: Well, I go back and you prepare for a year, you're sitting here
going through your roster trying to put pieces together of who's going to play
where, who's going to be able to do this and do that. Then all of a sudden
Asia Taylor, who we expected to have back in November, is gone for the year.
Tia Gibbs, who we expected to have back for the start of practice does not
play at all during the year. Shawnta' Dyer, who started for us, tears an ACL
in mid December. Then Monique Reid comes back from missing a season from a
microfracture surgery on her knee, and she's playing with one leg for most of
the year, fighting a way, figuring out a way to do it.  
We take four players right there that started for us at one point in time. To
have them not available or limited minutes, but to still have everybody else
step up, for us to be able to continue to have success we've had, now come to
our fourth Sweet 16 in the six years we've been here, it speaks volumes about
the type of players we have.  
Instead of making an excuse, they have just taken more responsibility and
said, Hey, I have to now step my game up. You have players like Antonita
Slaughter, Jude Schimmel, Sara Hammond that have improved from last year to
this year, and you have Bria Smith, Shoni, that have continued to take on the
responsibility as they did the year before.  
So we're very fortunate to have a program and not just a team. If this was
just a one‑year thing, when you lose the amount of players that we've lost, we
wouldn't have had the success that we've had.  
We take great pride that we're building a program here, and our goal is to
continue to raise the bar.  
  
Q. Tennessee is the traditional power. Let's say 15 years ago, Louisville,
Baylor, Oklahoma, not only had they ever been to a Final Four, none of them
had ever been close. Now all of you have gone to Final Fours. Baylor has won
two championships. What does that say about building programs, how that's
helped the game?  
COACH WALZ: It sure has. That's one thing I think all of us coaches are trying
to do, is we know in order for our game to grow, our programs have to grow. I
know that Geno, everybody would like to go to the Final Four every year. In
order for our game to grow, we've got to have some programs that can continue
to put some pressure on, so it's not the same four No.1 seeds in the NCAA
tournament.  
For all of us that follow women's basketball, that's fine. But I've got
friends that won't watch it because it's the same teams every year that are
your top four seeds. If we're trying to grow our game, we have to do our job
as coaches and programs to put some pressure on them so we can get some new
faces out there, and then hopefully our tournament can get at the level the
men's is, where you watch an open practice, and there's 6,000 or 7,000 fans
there watching it.  
That's where we have to continue to make sure we take advantage of growing our
game. If you can take opportunities to get fans to come watch us practice in
these venues, you have to take advantage of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Wish you the best of luck tomorrow.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville student‑athletes Sara Hammond,
Antonita Slaughter and Shoni Schimmel. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Shoni, if you could, Coach Walz talked about some of the injury problems
you had, some uncertainty there. Talk a little bit about that, what was that
like, and how you have been able to fight through that.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Well, with losing four of the girls that could actually start
on our team, it was a big issue for us. We didn't really think about it that
much. We kind of moved forward with it. We ended up getting Mo back, so that
helped us a lot.  
For us to kind of not to worry about what happened, them getting healthy,
we're focused on the people that are actually able to play and help us win
games.  
It's not like we don't need 'em or anything. We still want them to get healthy
and whatnot, but we're just kind of moving forward and living with their being
hurt.  
  
Q. Sara, did you feel like there was a moment this year where things kind of
righted for the team as far as getting to this point? Was there a game or a
coming ‑together moment?  
SARA HAMMOND: I don't think there's like one game in particular. I think just
over the period of the season, we just continued to get better and certain
players matured and started step up. Look at Jude Schimmel over the past
couple games, her confidence level has risen. Her defensive presence on the
floor, her ability to get to the basket have been tremendous.  
We have Antonita Slaughter who has shot the ball like crazy. She's a person we
feel really confident in shooting the ball. Also her length and her defense
and rebounding ability.  
I think it's just a process of everybody maturing and growing throughout the
season that's kind of brought us to where we are now.  
  
Q. Antonita, coach was saying the fact that you guys have gone against two
of the No.1 seeds, you're familiar with Notre Dame and UConn, you're not
intimidated by a No.1 seed. Baylor is different in that they have Griner.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Yeah, I definitely think playing in the Big East has
definitely prepared us for this.  
But Brittney Griner, like you said, is a different animal. Coach has a game
plan for us. We have confidence in him. I think our game plan's going to work.  
  
Q. Sara, your game plan defensively has kind of changed a lot. Coach Walz
joked maybe even you guys don't know what you're doing. Talk about how the
defense has evolved.  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, we have all the confidence in the world in our coaches in
setting a great game plan defensively and offensively.  
I think coach just has like so many different things, he's so experienced,
knows so many different strategies of beating teams.  
We joke all the time, half the time we don't know what we're doing out there.
Other teams don't; it's working for us.  
With Baylor, they've had everything thrown at them. The coaches have worked
non‑stop this week to come up with a good game plan defensively.  
We like to get teams rattled and we just scramble on defense and try to make
them make bad mistakes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Best of luck.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Mulkey from Baylor. We'll go straight
to questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotions of the last game, how it is coming into
this? Can that carry over?  
COACH MULKEY: At the time the emotions of those seniors playing in the Ferrell
Center for the last time was, as you would expect, a lot of tears, but not too
much. They were tears I guess of nostalgia and also tears of joy.  
But we've moved on and forgotten about it. We're here on a business trip. The
next game against Louisville is really all we're focused on at this time.  
  
Q. Kim, one thing I've noticed with a few players, a care ‑free attitude,
fun‑loving group. Does that help defray some of the expectation?  
COACH MULKEY: That's their personality. I just stay away from 'em because the
way I get prepared for a game when I was a player and now as a coach is a lot
different than young people do. For a lot of basketball games, that's how they
prepare.  
Jordan is just the fun‑loving, happy‑go‑lucky player. Brooklyn is the
sarcastic, quick‑witted. BG is the free spirit. But they know when to focus.
It's not that they're not focused, it's just away from the court they're
college kids. Sometimes we forget that.  
So I learned about their sophomore year to not walk in that locker room before
a game because the way I think you should prepare for a game may not be the
way they prepare for a game.  
Whatever they've been doing, it's been successful, and you don't want to
change 'em.  
  
Q. Can you expand on that a little bit? When you were playing, were you an
ultraserious type?  
COACH MULKEY: Back in the day, I hate to say it, it sounds like years ago, but
I guess it is years ago, you don't have all the social media, the cell phones.
You don't have even the TVs in the locker room, the computer stuff in the
locker rooms.  
I'm not even sure we had a stereo system in our locker room. You went in, got
dressed, got taped, sat around, then you played. It's not that I was serious,
it's just that we didn't have distractions I guess I would have called it at
the time.  
I think a lot of the things these kids have access to could be distractions.
But we didn't have all that. I think back in the day all we had, the invention
of the bag phone. I know y'all don't know what that is. But I did take a bag
phone one time, or had a bag phone one time.  
  
Q. Does it challenge you as a coach to deal with personalities, free
spirits, stuff like that?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think when they're young and freshmen and sophomores,
you have to deal with it. If it is a personality that is not good for team
chemistry, it's a personality that is not focused, a personality that affects
what we do on that floor, yes, we deal with it. I did.  
I dealt with Jordan. I sat her for being silly on the floor. When you leave
that floor, if they've given me everything they have, I have to let them be
college kids after I let them out of that locker room. It's the floor that you
are mainly concerned about, how they represent you on that floor.  
Now with the thing that happened with Whitney the other day, I now had to
address that. But you address it, you teach 'em, you move on.  
  
Q. Can you speak to what you've seen out of Louisville from game tape, maybe
some areas where you plan to attack.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm not sure I know what defense they run today after watching
them because they disguise it. You think they may be into a zone, then 10
seconds into the shot clock, they're in a man. You start off running a man
offense, you see something...  
They just do a lot of things in a possession defensively.  
That's why they're very good. If you look at stats, they create a lot of
steals. When you look at them, they have great length everywhere, but you
wouldn't think they would have that many steals. I attribute that to what Jeff
has them doing defensively. When Jeff got in the game, he was with Paul
Sanderford at Western Kentucky, and his sister played there, Jaime. He learned
from some good coaches. Jeff is just an outstanding coach.  
We understand we're going to have to take care of the basketball. We
understand we're going to have to get back in transition defense. We
understand they score a lot of points.  
  
Q. Have you noticed your team being different as opposed to when you were
trying to win your first one, how they approach games?  
COACH MULKEY: I would use the word 'mature.' When you have that many seniors,
they're a lot more mature. I think they're a lot more relaxed because of the
experience that they now have having won and having lost. They lost an
opportunity their sophomore year to go to a Final Four again, then they did
what they did last year.  
They've pretty much experienced it all. Certainly more success than failure.
But they've experienced it all.  
  
Q. I know your focus is on Louisville. You have another Big 12 here. Kansas
made it. I think a lot of people kind of focused on you alone in the Big 12.
Having four teams make it say a lot about the conference, specifically
Oklahoma as a No.6?  
COACH MULKEY: Every time a Big 12 team plays, I'm rooting for them. I do agree
with you, people tend to judge our league, and it's not fair, because I know
what I have. Everybody thinks we ran through the conference these last couple
years, there's such a big gap between Baylor and everybody else.  
There may be that gap, but that doesn't mean everybody else is not very good.
This is a competitive league. It's a tough league. It's a well‑coached league.
Just look at Bonnie at Kansas. Our seventh‑place team, who everybody was
holding their breath could we get seven in the tournament, she's in the Sweet
16 for the second consecutive year, beating a team that was seeded higher and
finished higher in the SEC. I can't remember who she beat in the first round.  
  
Q. Colorado.  
COACH MULKEY: Colorado. That's two different conferences right there.  
But the Big 12 night in and night out is tough. It's just tough.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked the other day about how difficult it is to win back
‑to‑back titles, but harder to win all those other games. How has this team
for two years been able to win 74 of 75 games?  
COACH MULKEY: Talent. I'm a coach that believes in acknowledging what you
have. Recruiting is so difficult now to assemble that much talent on one team.
You have too many egos, too many parents' egos. You have too much selfishness.  
How many times as a coach can you go recruit that much talent on a team and
they all agree to come play for you? It's a rarity. They wanted to do it. They
wanted to do it because they wanted a degree from Baylor, I hope, and number
two, they wanted to win a championship.  
For the most part looks like they're all going to do that, some later than
others on graduating. But it's just talent.  
And I do know this: the most talented teams don't always win. Y'all know that.
You've seen it too many times. Once you assemble that talent, you've got to
fix egos, fix roles, let people know what is expected of them. That doesn't
happen overnight. Just to watch each of them evolve into what their role is,
accept it, be content and happy for each other, for our program as a whole,
makes you proud as a coach to have 'em.  
  
Q. You obviously lost to Louisville four years ago at this stage. Is that a
topic?  
COACH MULKEY: Look, they had Angel on that team. They were supposed to win.
That team that beat us went on to the Final Four that year, I think.  
You have to evaluate your team and place expectations that you as their coach
think is fair. I thought that we gave them a very good game. I thought we
played extremely hard. They were the better team. They went on, as I said, to
make it to a Final Four that year.  
  
Q. The one thing coaches can't control is injuries. I know you lost Shenay,
but for the most part you've been able to stay relatively healthy. How
important has that been?  
COACH MULKEY: This time of the year it's very important. I'm going to go back
to our second year when Melissa Jones, senior class come off a Final Four
their freshman year, her injury, when it happened in the Oklahoma game, was
devastating to our team.  
Injuries can completely take you out of sync and change the complexion of your
season at whatever point it happens. Sometimes you can't recover from it.  
We have been fortunate that our trainer, Alex Olson, he's been with me the
entire time he's been at Baylor. He understands when to tell me what I need to
do. I will never compromise a player's health to win a basketball game.  
We've had the little nagging injuries throughout the year, but we've been
smart in that we just rest 'em. There was a period of time when Griner's shins
were bothering her, and I wouldn't give her 20 minutes of a game. If she falls
short of the scoring record, blame me. I should have given her more minutes.  
You gauge it and do the best you can. You can't control injuries. That's a
part of the game.  
  
Q. It was a long time ago, but nine years ago this city, 0.2 seconds, how
much did that game impact you in terms of what you've even done since then?  
COACH MULKEY: First of all, it wasn't this city, it was Norman, Oklahoma. I
won't ever forget it as long as I live. I do feel like it cost us our first
opportunity to have a chance to go to the Final Four. It motivated that next
year's team that won the national championship.  
But this bunch, they don't have a clue. They would go, Huh? They don't know
that. They don't remember it. For me, I'll never forget it. Coaches have
memories like elephants, they remember things. But it doesn't affect anybody
in our locker room today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by our student‑athletes from Baylor
University. We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, if you could, talk a little bit about the personality of this
team. Coach Mulkey was talking a little bit about how now she leaves you alone
in the locker room, do your own thing. Was that a struggle at first, getting
everybody with the personalities on the same page?  
BROOKLYN POPE: Maybe last year, but this year, I think everyone knows the goal
ahead and everyone's on the same page to let our egos go to the side. The
personality of this team is mainly pride and focus. If we focus and play with
pride, we'll be fine.  
That's how I think this team has decided to approach the game of basketball
this year.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, along that same line, did it take you a while or maybe Kim a
while to let you be you?  
BROOKLYN POPE: Like me personally or the team?  
Yeah, I think me and Coach Mulkey didn't really know how to bring out the best
in me. I just think this year, it kind of came together that I'm not the type
of kid to howl or text after a game, after a practice. It's just, let me go
with it and it will be better if I find my way versus you trying to guide me.
Let me do my thing, everything will go smooth. She don't bother me at all.  
  
Q. Brittney, what has been different about going through this tournament and
trying for a championship knowing that it's going to be your last?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, just knowing that it's your last run, a little bit
different. You appreciate everything, take in everything. A little bit more
emotional, I guess you could say, after every game, knowing it's your last
time at that spot, your last time on the home court.  
That's about the only different thing compared to last year. I knew I had one
more year to do it. This time it's my last one.  
  
Q. Brittney, Kim called you a free spirit when she was up here. Does that
help you deal with some of the national attention and the expectations that
you've dealt with?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely. Like a little butterfly in a cocoon coming out.  
I don't know, it definitely helps. My personality helps me out a lot just
dealing with everything. The hateful comments and everything I get, it doesn't
bother me at all. When you're out there, Hey, that's what you think, okay,
cool. I just kind of go with the flow really.  
  
Q. Brittney, you win 74 of 75. What drives you as a team?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It's really not hard to motivate us. Coach does a great job
at it. Everybody on this team hates to lose. We love to win. That's motivation
enough right there.  
Even if the score is lopsided, we're still playing hard. Coach challenges us
every media timeout, win each media timeout, don't look at the score. If we
don't win it, she definitely lets us know. I think that's what makes us go
harder every time.  
We don't pay attention to the score, we just try to go as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Odyssey, what would you say are maybe the way or a couple ways that you
have most improved as a point guard in your time at Baylor?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I'd just say just learning the game of basketball. I think
coming from high school to college was a big step. I didn't completely
understand the game like I thought I did. Coach Mulkey, she did a good job of
helping me my freshman year, considering I had to learn everything on my own
and I had to learn quick.  
Sophomore year I kind of grew up. I just had to grow up, I guess, fast.
Winning the national championship made everything better.  
Now that I know my role, know what I got to do for my team, I understand that
it's not all about points, it's not all about stats. As long as my team wins
and I do my job as far as taking care of the ball, managing the game, then I'm
fine, and my teammates, too.  
  
Q. Odyssey, Kim talked about that she just stays away from the
personalities, the way you guys prepare for a game. With all the personalities
on this team, you as a point guard, how do you deal with that? Is it different
on the court?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: This team, we do have a lot of different personalities. I think
before the game, everyone has their own kind of way of getting ready for the
game. We understand each other. When someone has their headphones on, we don't
talk to each other.  
We just kind of go with the flow. We talk to each other sometimes. Everyone
gets into their zone a different way.  
We understand that I think on the court it's more together. We play good
together. Our personalities are set aside and we know we're on the court for
one thing, and that's to win. We take it one game at a time.  
We have a couple of differences, but on the court at the end of the day, we
bring it together and we know what we got to do.  
  
Q. Brooklyn, the Florida State game was emotional I'm sure for all the
seniors. Obviously the way the game went with Brittney dunking three times, do
you use that emotion?  
BROOKLYN POPE: With BG dunking, just how everyone feels, it was great for the
crowd. It was great for everyone who support us, Baylor, Waco. I felt like all
that adrenaline pumping inside the gym, all the positive energy on behalf of
Baylor, just really helped out team know that this is the last time we're
going to play at this gym in front of this crowd.  
I'm happy we went out the way that we did. The crowd got to see BG dunk. She
rarely ever dunked in Waco, she always dunked away, which is weird. But she
gave 'em three. It was three of her best dunks ever ‑ so far...  
  
Q. Odyssey, how much have you studied Louisville? One of the things they
like is to create a lot of stuff forcing turnovers, their steals. How much
does that put on you?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: We actually watched film two days in a row. The first day, we
just went over player profiles, who was going to guard who. Second day, we
watched their defenses. I think they're a great defensive team. They change
their defenses a lot in the middle of the shot clock, off rebounds. So that's
our main focus, trying to figure out what we're going to run as far as when
they change their defenses.  
We're probably going to watch some more film tonight. You can never watch too
much film. This is a new team. We don't know too much about 'em, so we have to
continue to watch a lot of film.  
Coach does a great job of that. So I think after we watch film tonight, we'll
be ready. We understand we're going up against a great team.  
  
Q. Brittney is a unique talent. Nobody dunks like her. Just her ability to
catch almost any pass thrown. Can you even take more chances with a player
that's as talented and as big as she is in terms of passes you wouldn't throw
to somebody else?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: First off, you're not going to come across too many 6'8" girls
that can dominate the paint, can be as athletic as her. I do take risks that I
never took since I've been playing basketball as far as some passes. Me and BG
have an understanding of how I pass the ball to her. We kind of bumped heads
last year about how I was passing to her.  
But I think I throw my passes really, really high. I probably won't ever have
to throw high passes ever when she leaves. So it does change it a little bit.  
I just think she changes the game completely: passes, dunks, shots. Everything
she does is just phenomenal. It's something like I've never seen before.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on your wins and your thoughts about
this upcoming event.  
COACH COALE: We're thrilled to be back in Oklahoma City, have the opportunity
to compete in the Sweet 16. Four tremendous basketball teams at this location.
It should be a great weekend of the highest caliber of women's basketball.  
I'm proud of my team. I'm proud of our fan base for how they're supporting and
buying tickets. Can't wait for Sunday afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. This is an interesting matchup because even though the Lady Vols like to
run, so does Oklahoma. Could you talk about this matchup.  
COACH COALE: I think we do both like to play up‑tempo, although our up‑tempos
are a little bit different. Tennessee is really, really fast, explosively
fast. Meighan Simmons might be the fastest guard I've ever seen on the floor.
You remember I coached Danielle Robinson for four years.  
We like to play fast as well. I think it's really important to play at our
speed and not theirs. Part of that is taking care of the basketball. You can
limit their ability to run a little bit if you don't turn it over obviously in
the open floor.  
I think another part of that is shot selection. We have to take the right
shots so there aren't long rebounds that lead to that transition that they
love, as well.  
  
Q. Can you describe how you held it together this year with the loss of
Whitney and injuries, your mindset after that game.  
COACH COALE: You know what, it's been a crazy ride this year. I still remember
vividly exactly how I felt the moment Whitney went down. I don't remember with
much clarity what happened after the game. But the moment she planted her feet
and went up for the jump shot I remember clearly.  
I remember holding her hand on the court and I remember walking out of an
arena that had the absolute breath sucked out of it. It was the quietest and
yet an arousing standing ovation for her. Just one of those moments in sports
you don't see very often, thank goodness.  
But we made a decision that we were going to find a way to do special things
and to be extraordinary. I think that's been the most rewarding part of this
journey, has been the continuous correct decisions by a bunch of courageous
young student‑athletes who simply wake up every day and decide they want to be
special. I don't use that word 'special' very often, but this group is
special.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your overall satisfaction of making the Sweet 16. What
does it say about this team?  
COACH COALE: That's a really fine line because we are incredibly proud of what
we've done. It is very satisfying. Here is my thing. I always have these
really smart kids. I can talk around stuff. They're going to know what's
happening anyway.  
So we just call spades spades. We talk about what an accomplishment this is to
be here. We let it sort of sink in. We looked at each other, we talked about
it, we digested it, then we said, Okay, that was fun. Now we have work ahead
of us. Don't let this be the end all. Just getting here is not enough. Who is
to say what is enough? What is enough is what you're capable of.  
We believe we have a lot of basketball left in us and that's what we're
looking for on Sunday.  
  
Q. You talk about smart kids, tough kids. Joanna McFarland embodies both of
those, especially when you've needed her in big situations. If you could
expound a little bit how she's done that.  
COACH COALE: She's one of my favorite stories because Jo is a perfectionist,
probably has been since the moment she came into the world. As a high school
player, when I watched her play in the summer, if she missed one shot, she
acted like she could not believe she missed a shot. I loved that competitive
bend she had. I loved how physical she was.  
She got to Oklahoma and expected to be perfect every day. It plagued her for a
while because one mistake would sit on her back and ride with her to the other
end. After a four‑minute interval, she couldn't move. Basketball moves too
fast, no such thing as a perfect player or a perfect game.  
In the classroom she's the same way. 98 on a biochem test isn't enough. She
thinks it should be 100. That's why she has 3.92 in biochemistry and has been
accepted into pharmacy school. It drives her it makes her great, and yet she
had to figure out how to get on the right side of that line.  
It's a precariously difficult balance to find and she found it just when we
needed her to find it most.  
That's a great story.  
  
Q. I think you've had other teams that sort of bounced around and tended to
find themselves here at the end playing their best basketball. This team did
that. It sounds like what you're saying is behind the scenes they weren't
bouncing around. Take us inside. How were they special? Even while out on the
court there were these things happening. Tell us about that.  
COACH COALE: Well, depends on what your definition of 'together' is. The
transcending trademark of this group of kids has been how much respect and
admiration they have for each other. That's been the trademark of this group.  
Never once in all of the difficult days that we went through, injury, gather
ourselves, another injury, gather ourselves. Those are lots of dynamics going
on there. Never once did that care, admiration and respect that they have for
one another vacillate in any way.  
Then we get into Big 12 Conference play. Here we go. We go great for a while.
Then all of a sudden a really tall mountain, we can't get over it, we find
ourselves in a swamp, in the middle of quicksand. In the midst of all that,
these guys continued to respect one another and care for one another. There's
just an absence of pretense that grows from that. When people are real with
one another, that allows you to continue even in the face of difficult
circumstances.  
As long as they were trying to do that, this isn't working, we have to figure
it out, if you have that core, that core is tight, and people trust one
another, they believe in one another, they have respect for one another, then
anything is always possible. So that's been the thing that's made them special
throughout the entire season.  
  
Q. One of the best moments of this program was a few years ago when Whit was
a freshman and Tennessee came, Oklahoma put on a show that day and upset
Tennessee. Coach Summitt was very close to a milestone. That was a great
moment in Oklahoma history. What did that do for your program going forward?  
COACH COALE: I love what you just said when you said Oklahoma put on a show.
What I remember most about that is Oklahoma did put on a show. I'm not talking
about my basketball team, I'm talking about the state, that environment, and
it was nationally televised for everybody that had a camera, potentially Coach
Summitt's milestone. Whether you were a women's basketball fan or not,
everybody was watching. I think Bob Knight was calling the game for heaven's
sakes.  
The state of Oklahoma, we really looked good that night. Danielle Robinson and
Whitney Hand made us look really good. That game played back yesterday on a
couple networks. I had people texting me, Does Whitney ever miss a shot? I
think she missed one. That was sort of the opening window of this is who
Whitney Hand is for the rest the world.  
Physically her career didn't play out the way the rest of us wanted to. The
light she brings, the way she makes a part of all these better, that continued
throughout and is still happening today.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the situation Holly is in. She's there as an
assistant forever, now taking over, trying to establish herself. And does this
look like the same old Tennessee or do you see some differences in them under
her?  
COACH COALE: First of all, I would just be guessing like the rest of you what
that might be like, because I never sat in that other chair, which is really
weird. Folks that have sat in it have told me that's a long, long way, those
15 inches.  
I think that Holly is in a tremendous situation, though, in that if you're
going to sit next to somebody for a long, long time as an assistant coach,
don't you want it to be Pat Summitt, really? What she's learned, been able to
acquire over the years, now it's her turn.  
I think it takes somebody who really gets that program to be able to follow
Coach Summitt, to be able to bridge that, share all those lessons and that
tradition with them. I think it was a natural choice, a great choice.  
I think she's done an amazing job. In many ways, it is vintage Tennessee. They
have better athletes at every spot than we do. They're athletic. Their guards
are big. They can all shoot it. They get after the basketball. They deny
passing lanes. All that is Tennessee and has been Tennessee for decades.  
Yet there's a little something about 'em that's different, and it's hard to
put a title on. I don't really know how to even describe it. But there's a
little something different. That's Holly Warlick. That's the stamp she's
putting on this program.  
  
Q. You mentioned the game where Whitney was so good here against Tennessee.
I know it has nothing to do with tomorrow, all things pretty much meaningless,
but then I think back to Bob Stoops after winning the 2000 Orange Bowl, like
there's some connection. Are you able to draw some connection for your team to
maybe put them in as good of a place as they can be going into it?  
COACH COALE: That's the beautiful thing about sports. If you look hard enough,
you can draw a correlation to make it feel like it's all in your favor, no
matter what.  
I think our guys do have a great, great feeling about Oklahoma playing in this
building. I think we obviously have a great feeling about playing in front of
Oklahoma fans.  
So I think as things line up, I was thinking earlier this morning, I don't
even know if Maddie Manning and Nicole Kornet, youngest on our squad, if
they're aware of that game. I have no idea. We've not referenced it much,
though I'm sure everybody around them is talking about it.  
Having been in this arena and played here and played well here on a stage with
a lot of pressure, it wasn't to go to the Elite 8, but there were a lot of
eyes on this game, to play as well as we did can only be good.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck tomorrow.  
COACH COALE: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma student‑athletes. We'll begin
with questions.  
  
Q. Joanna, when Whitney went down, a lot of people felt that's it for
Oklahoma. You rallied and played some really good basketball from that point
on, especially you. What happened that day? Why did this team actually play
even better basketball the rest of the way without your best player?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Because it was a lot of playing for the people who couldn't
play. When Whitney went down, it was four total. I remember right from our
next game, they applied a motivational clip for people who couldn't play or an
injured player. That's what hit me. I'm going to play for the people who
can't, especially my fellow seniors. I know it killed Whitney as a senior who
couldn't play.  
I think it was all of us stepping up our game so we could give the people who
couldn't play an opportunity to go and be a part of something special.  
  
Q. You played likely your best game of the season against UCLA. How do you
replicate that game, bring it back?  
MORGAN HOOK: We just went out there and said there's nothing to lose. We were
the bottom seed. We were going to go out there and play for each other. Just
like Joanna said, when Whitney went down, we were all playing to play another
game to with Jazz and Jo.  
  
Q. Joanna, I covered both of your older sisters. Both of them had different
games. How much learning from them helped you? Coach was talking about your
perfectionist streak. How have you learned to manage that?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: It's been hard. I think that's been the place that I've
grown the most over my four years, is coming to grips with the fact that you
don't have to be perfect, as long as you give everything that you have. You
can rest easy at night, have no regrets.  
As for my sisters, I owe a lot to them because they took me to our little
recreation center and beat me in the paint, taught me moves. I was probably
ahead of the game a little bit just 'cause they knew so much and told me so
much.  
  
Q. Aaryn, after all you have been through, what does it mean to make the
Sweet 16?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It's definitely a big accomplishment for us because, I mean,
we expected to be here, but not in sort of the way it went. We expected to
have Whitney and everybody by us. They're still there on the bench, but it's a
little bit different.  
It still means a lot.  
  
Q. Morgan and Joanna, do you sort of take pride in the national stage that
Oklahoma is going to be on? This is a program that is very well ‑supported.
Just the fact you're going to have your home fans, national TV audience, what
that means to you, the appreciation of women's basketball in this area.   
MORGAN HOOK: I think it shows a lot about our fans. I know they've told us so
many tickets have been sold. We can pretty much guarantee a lot of those will
be fans for us.  
It just shows that people still are interested in women's basketball and do
enjoy watching us play. I think as a team, we play with a lot of class, a lot
of championship behavior. I think it's a positive for women's basketball.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: I would agree. I think a lot of it also is the people who
came before us, the players before us who built the program, built the legacy
that we play in now. Class and grace, pass it on, a big thing in our locker
room.  
It is fun to play in front of a home crowd in Oklahoma City because it is a
really good base for women's basketball.  
  
Q. Aaryn, what is your job tomorrow and specifically is it your job to get
going quickly, to be a factor early in the game?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: My job's really just to do what I've been doing. I mean,
there's no added pressure or anything for me to try to go score the most
points or score all the points early.  
Just pretty much do what I've been doing and really just play along with the
rest of everybody else and we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Joanna, you've gone against as good of posts as there are in the country,
one in particular. Your thoughts specifically on Tennessee? It's a young,
athletic group. What are the biggest challenges that Tennessee will provide
inside?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: Like you said, they're very athletic. Just from the little
bit of film we've watched, they're animals going on the boards. I think a big
thing is going to be rebounding, like always. Post defense is all about
position early. It's going to be a lot of that position game, staying low,
being ready.  
  
Q. Morgan, being the point guard of this team, you know the weapons that you
have. Griffin has grown up as a post player for you, playing well. How good
has she become and how much has she helped this team this year?  
MORGAN HOOK: She's grown with her confidence completely. I think that's what
it stems down to. I mean, last year she wouldn't call for the ball. Now she
demands the ball when she's in there. It gives us as guards confidence to pass
it in there because she is ready for it, has great position.  
I just think it comes from her confidence. That's why she has been such a
factor for us this year.  
  
Q. Aaryn, Morgan, Joanna, what is it in Coach Coale, was it somebody on the
team that brought you to where you are after everything fell apart? Did she
say something special?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It's probably just a combination of a lot of things. Her just
never letting us be satisfied with just being okay after we've lost so many
people. Just with everybody in general in our mindset as to, This isn't good
enough. Yeah, we've lost four people, but nonetheless, we're still going to
play hard and expect from ourselves just as much as we expected before.  
MORGAN HOOK: Yeah, I would say that she just never let us feel sorry for
ourselves. She said she recruits character, I think that showed when the four
injuries happened. We kind of got together and said, This is it, this is what
we have now, this is what we're going to have to do. We never had that moment
where we felt sorry for ourselves. That came from Coach Coale not letting that
happen.  
JOANNA McFARLAND: I remember being in the film room after Whitney went down, I
can't remember now, I lost it, but something like how great of a story is it
going to be. We've been through all this adversity, how great is it going to
be when we do something special. That really motivated me ‑ I think all of us.  
  
Q. Joanna, what have Whitney and Lyndsey, two senior captains who cannot
play, what has it meant their sticking around the program? What have they
given you, albeit not their presence on the court?  
JOANNA McFARLAND: They have a lot of knowledge. They've been in the system
four years. Especially Whitney, five. They know a lot and they try to help us
in whatever way they can.  
I know for me personally, because they're my senior class, I try and do
everything I can when I'm on the court for them because they can't be out
there.  
  
Q. Aaryn, how critical is hitting three ‑pointers early? That's such a big
part of the two victories you've had already. Is that something you're
consciously thinking about, getting hot early from outside?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Definitely. I mean, that's a big part of our identity. We're
all really good shooters. For us to just be able to knock down shots, it gives
us a breath of fresh air for just other things, just to be free to go after
rebounds, get lower in the stance. It's definitely important for us to make
shots.  
I think regardless of any of that, we're going to have to do a lot of other
things really well in order to win a game.  
  
Q. Morgan, Coach Coale said you guys are a special group. Do you feel
special? If so, why? What is it about you that is special?  
MORGAN HOOK: Just our togetherness. I mean, we have this bond where we want to
continue to play so we have another week together.  
I mean, I think all of these girls can vouch for it. We're like sisters. We
have that sisterly love. We go out there and play the way we play for each
other. I think that's why she says we're a special group. A lot of teams don't
really have that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Have a great game tomorrow. Thank
you.

### [Chiney Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21930)

### [Amber Orrange](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23449)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  51  
UCLA  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Stanford head coach, Tara VanDerveer, Chiney
Ogwumike, and Amber Orrange. Coach?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I want to compliment UCLA. They have a talented team, and
probably the best compliment I could give them is how much they've improved
throughout the season. They played a great game.  
Having said that, I think our team found a way to win, and that's what I'm
most proud of. It was a struggle all day. With the foul trouble we were in, it
was so extreme between yesterday and today. But we have to adjust. But we had
great leadership at the point guard.  
Tournaments are won by guards, and Amber was the best guard on the floor. She
took care of the ball. She ran our offense. She had huge shots for us down the
stretch. You know, she basically played almost three games in three days. I
wasn't really sure that our team was built for three games in three days with
this caliber.  
But people really stepped up for us. Bonnie came in, hit some big shots.
Mikaela Ruef hit some big shots, timely shots. Our team had to grit it out.
And quite honestly, we haven't had to do that a lot this year. And we learned
a lot about ourselves. So I think we'll be better because of this experience.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half, your stars had two fouls. Was there ever an
idea to put them back in as UCLA was coming back in?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I guess that's just how I feel about it because of the
nature of the way the game was being called I wanted Chiney in the second
half. And I thought it was a good opportunity for her to rest, same thing with
Mikaela. I really have confidence in Chiney. If it had not been three games in
three days, I would have played her. She's gotten that out of her system, and
that it's not going to happen. You know, in three games in three days, I just
said let's let her rest a little bit. We need other people to come in and help
us, and I thought we did struggle running things offensively.  
I thought we were in more trouble without Amber. We just couldn't run any
offense. They're athletic. They're aggressive, and we struggled and turned the
ball over too much when she was out.  
But we have played a lot without Mikaela Ruef, and the person in the first
half that kept it together for us was Bonnie. She did a great job.  
  
Q. Amber had a game somewhat similar to this in the NCAA Tournament last
year. I'm wondering if you think this is the best game she's played at
Stanford?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I wasn't sure that yesterday wasn't the best game. I mean,
I'm just saying up until yesterday. But she's had a great tournament. She did
play a great game against West Virginia. Also we had more around her last
year, so I do think this was the best game. She had Nnemkadi to throw to or
Chiney or even Lindy helping her out. But Amber put our team on her back
today. She got to the basket, made some nice passes. What I was most proud of
was when she had a turnover or made a mistake, she had resolve, and got back
and got a big steal. A lot of players if they make a mistake, they hang their
head or get discouraged. That just made her madder and made her play harder.  
  
Q. Amber, what were you thinking in the last couple of seconds of the game?
Was it kind of team on your back? Were you thinking, I'm going to do this?
Were you kind of willing it?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I was just thinking I want to win. I want to win. I'll do
whatever it takes. I just looked for opportunities to take chances on plays on
offense and defense and luckily it worked out.  
  
Q. Amber, with that last play, yeah, you want to win and everything, but
what did you see? How likely ‑‑ I mean, the shot clocks are coming down, how
likely did you really see and feel that?   
AMBER ORRANGE: Well, first I was looking over at Tara to see what time she
wanted me to go at. Then at like ten or 11 seconds, I used the screen, and she
kind of overplayed me left, so I spun back right and luckily the shot went in.  
  
Q. Was there any time in the game, especially late in the game, that it
passed through your mind that you might be the first team to be in the
tournament?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I don't think that we would have been the first team that would
have lost it.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Actually we lost to Arizona State in the first tournament,
and we lost to UCLA, and I believe that was 2007. So we would have been the
third.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
AMBER ORRANGE: That didn't really cross my mind. I just wanted to win for my
team now, and I think we all felt that way.  
  
Q. Chiney, how did having, I guess, a career low and all of that kind of
struggling the last two nights to get shots in, but you've talked all year
about the rest of your team, and it's one team. (No microphone)?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Today was a great day as a team. I think throughout the year,
what I've been telling you is exactly how I felt. Every game we look for
someone to step up. I knew the day was coming when things would be really hard
for me, and I really hoped it wouldn't be the Pac‑12 championship, but it was.  
I think it just shows that we have a lot of players on our team that may not
match‑up on paper as you see an advantage. But, mentally, mental and
physically. It's 4‑1\. Mentally, Amber was strong in this game, and even
Bonnie. Just keeping things together. Joslyn playing a full game. All of those
little contributions that you make, getting a stop here, affecting the play,
taking a charge, everything.  
So I think tonight was a true testament to team basketball, and what we mean.
We're sisters at Stanford. No matter what situation, we stick together. Yeah,
I'm just really proud of this team and their effort.  
  
Q. Chiney, I know players have a hard time talking about themselves, and I
realize that it's a team game. But as far as yourself on the national scale,
looking at it, can you talk a little bit about where you should stand,
especially with a tournament like this, minus this game, as far as how you've
carried yourself?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Coach, what is the thing you say about team accolades?  
I mean, yeah, we definitely want the big trophy, but any individual award is
in response to a team effort. So even though I'm redirecting it again, I think
it just shows that it's a team sport. I just hope my presence today was enough
to give Amber confidence. That is the only thing I hope. I think she did a
pretty good job on her own.  
  
Q. Chiney, what exactly was Brewer doing and along with the double teams?
Can you talk a little bit about how they were able to keep you down to three
points?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I don't think I got into the flow of the game that
much. Val sort of plagued me and mentally too. But they were just bodying.
It's been a very physical tournament. I'm just trying to adapt to how each
player plays defense. I think that every time I caught the ball, when I was
thinking about getting the ball, the team, UCLA was anticipating it. So kudos
to them and their defense.  
But Coach told me with like about 7 or 8 minutes left, "Chiney, you can't do
this by yourself." After that, I knew this is Amber's night. She had the best
feel of the game out of anyone on the floor, and I trusted her.  
It's hard to just run out to the perimeter and hope or try to get an offensive
position. But it's not hard when Amber's on your team. Yeah, she's a hard
worker, and it proves that hard work always beats talent when you work hard.  
  
Q. Chiney, you were in Amber's ear quite a lot as soon as the game ended. Do
you want to share any of it?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I was just saying thank you, thank you. She was more talking
to me. I try not to be an emotional person, but I was putting a lot of
pressure on myself. I have to play well in order for us to win.  
I think today proved it's not true. As long as you're a team that you play
hard, and you fight, and you play for 40 minutes, you can win no matter what
the situation if you believe in yourself and stick together. Yeah, Amber was
telling me, I got you. Don't worry. I got you.  
  
Q. Amber, you have been one of the most improved players in the whole
conference period. Can you talk about what you've been doing in practice and
just progress to get to this point?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I lot of it is on the mental side of the game. Thinking of
things when they don't go your way. If this would have happened last year, I
probably would have shut down and had a really, really bad game. But a lot of
times we focus on being mentally tough and sticking with things.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think Amber has grown a lot. She is one of the hardest
workers on our team. Two of the hardest workers are sitting up here. They are
in the gym. Amber loves basketball and is very passionate about it.  
So, first of all, she works really hard. That shot wasn't a lucky shot. She
works on it. The second thing is I think she's getting tremendous mentoring
from our assistant coach, Kate Paye. Amber watches video with Kate, and Kate
has really helped Amber and has been a really special coach for Amber to work
with.

### [Atonye Nyingifa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24921)

### [Markel Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24920)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  51  
UCLA  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Coach Cori Close, Markel Walker, and Atonye Nyingifa.
Coach, opening statement, please?  
COACH CLOSE: First of all, I just want to say that credit to Stanford, their
maturity. Amber Orrange shot some humongous shots, and just calm and maturity.
Credit to them, and congratulations to them for a really well fought game.  
We're hurting right now. My heart just hurts for our seniors, because I felt
like they gave so much of themselves out on that basketball game today. It's
hard for them not to be rewarded with the win at the end.  
Hopefully, eventually, they're going to see that they were incredibly uncommon
women that made uncommon choices, and we didn't yield the result we wanted.
But I could not be more proud of the effort from my team. Our team and staff
were, were excellent, and it hurts right now to not get the reward in the win.
But I couldn't be more proud of our process and our journey.  
  
Q. Kind of an interesting day. You guys go down and scramble back to come
back before halftime. You built a bit of a lead. It was kind of a strange day
with Chiney struggling the way she was. It was a very atypical day, don't you
think?  
COACH CLOSE: It was atypical. But if you look at really intense March games
between really good teams, I think you see that a lot. We take each other out
of our first‑second options, and other people have to step up and make plays.  
I had a lot of players. I thought Markel Walker stepped up and made huge
plays. Obviously, Amber Orrange stepped up and made huge plays, and Ruef made
an amazing acrobatic shot in the second to last possession.  
Yes, it was an a typical day if you look at our whole body of work. But this
time of year, that's what really good battles end up being.  
  
Q. I know it's a small consolation that you held Chiney to a career low
three points. But can you talk about the defense that Brewer and the double
teams put on her?  
COACH CLOSE: I just think it was a great team effort. I think one of the
reasons that Alyssia Brewer and Jasmine Dixon and Markel Walker were able to
guard her is because of the pressure our guards put. Atonye Nyingifa, Nirra
Fields, Mariah Williams, the pressure they put that their perimeter players
couldn't find Chiney in her normal positions of comfort.  
So I think it was a selfless effort. And I put emphasis on the effort because
it is hard to cover that much ground the way they spread the other floor and
put that much pressure on for 40 minutes. I think it is a tremendous feat. It
isn't a consolation. It still really hurts, but it doesn't change the fact
that we changed a heck of a game on the defensive end of the floor.  
  
Q. Did you try anything different today against Stanford that you had in
previous games? Did you throw a new wrinkle at them today?  
COACH CLOSE: I think both teams tried to a few wrinkles to get the balls in
our playmakers' hands in positions of strength. I don't think it was anything
major. We need to do a better job of getting more ball movement and inside
touches. We needed to maintain our defensive pressure and intensity. The
biggest difference is our rebounding. We felt like we defended them well at
our place, but we didn't finish the play with rebounds. That was the biggest
difference further today is I thought we came up with many more rebounds.  
Obviously, we outrebounded them significantly today. I thought if we got more
possessions and more shots on goal that we would win, and I guess we were one
possession short.  
  
Q. Obviously, your coaches talked about how you're hurting right now, but do
you think that this game is the game in which you guys realized how good you
are and there is a lot to play for in March?  
MARKEL WALKER: I felt like this whole weekend was something that we can go
back on and see that we accomplished something. We played together. Our
seniors stepped up a lot. Yes, it hurts, but we found something in us that we
didn't know we had, and we played so well together as a team. The only thing
we've got to do is go back to the drawing board to see what's next.  
  
Q. Cori, Amber went left a lot. Defensively what will you take from that?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, we got caught on it, and it will be something that we'll
grow from. One of the things I absolutely loved about this team this year is
they're never afraid to go back and look in the mirror and say, how can I use
this to get better and be a spring board forward?  
I feel like that was definitely not our game plan. We wanted to keep her from
going to her left. They put a shooter on that side, and her hesitation move
got us. She went right that one time down the middle of the lane and one. Gets
you on your heels a little bit. But it was not the game plan. That's easier to
say in writing a scouting report than it is to live out. She's made a couple
of really hard jumpers going to the left too.  
She's been the difference in two of the three games. Up at Stanford, I thought
we did a really good job on Chiney a lot of the times, but she made plays, and
I thought she was the difference obviously tonight.  
  
Q. You kind of said is there that she was the difference. Maybe if you could
elaborate more on that because you guys did play really good defense.  
COACH CLOSE: Well, it's hard to have her make those plays down the stretch.
There are a lot of things as a coach that I would have‑‑ everything's ‑‑
hindsight is "20/20". I might have done a few things differently down the
stretch knowing what she was doing. Just like I expect our players to look in
the mirror and grow from that, I will too.  
But I want to give the credit to Amber. I thought our pressure bothered her a
lot of the game. For her to say that persistent and confident after we made
her pick up the ball, turn the ball over a couple of bad passes. And her
steadiness, that's why they're a great team. Credit to Amber that she was able
to make those great plays, even though it was a really difficult game.  
  
Q. Did you consider the last possession calling a timeout? After Markel's
shot rimmed out, did you think Alyssia got hacked on there?  
COACH CLOSE: I did consider it. I did consider calling the timeout. But I
thought that they were in a spread court situation, and I knew we were going
to be putting the ball in Markel's hands anyway to drive and I didn't want to
give them a chance to set their defense. When I thought Markel was going to be
able‑‑ I was watching sort of the level of play. Was Markel going to be able
to get even with them and create a driving lane? And I knew that she would. So
worst thing I could do is get in her way at that point. So I don't regret
that.  
It is what it is. It's very rare at the end of a game that you're going to get
that kind of call. It is what it is.  
  
Q. Atonye, what was the fatigue level out there after three games in three
days for both teams? Did you feel like everybody was feeling it in the second
half?  
ATONYE NYINGIFA: I know we tried our best to get our bodies right. It was no
walk in the park to play three games in three days. Our team held it together,
kept our composure, and we just went off with energy, and we felt great and
just played our hearts out.  
  
Q. When the refs put the .2 seconds back on the clock, and you have the
timeout leading the last play. Were you aware of the Trent Tucker rule? There
had to be a discussion of that?  
COACH CLOSE: That there had to be a tip? Yes, we were aware of it. It didn't
quite go the way we drew it up. It's a tough read, and it was a tough play. We
didn't quite do what we'd hoped we would do. But it's a tough situation,
obviously. We were trying to go to get a screen over the top for Alyssia
Brewer, and there was a miscommunication on it. Ultimately, I have to take
responsibility for that. We didn't get what we wanted on that last tip.

## March 9, 2013

  

### [Chiney Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21930)

### [Mikaela Ruef](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24895)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  61  
Colorado  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Tara VanDerveer, Chiney Ogwumike, and Mikaela
Ruef on the way.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I'd like to compliment Colorado. They have a very
deep and aggressive team. This was a really important win for us. You know,
also this probably doesn't happen very often, but I thought the referees were
really, they worked really hard as we shot a lot more free throws than them.
Colorado was extremely aggressive, and I thought, you know they did a good job
of making sure things didn't go over the line. Chiney was a human today. She
missed shots that she's been making all season long.  
But we got some great play, some great minutes from Mikaela Ruef. We got a
great match from Amber and some different people stepped in. I thought Sara
James was steady. Hit a basket for us, made some nice defensive plays. For us
to have ten turnovers was a great thing for us. We outrebounded them which was
a great thing for us, and we're very, very excited to be playing tomorrow
against UCLA.  
  
Q. Can you look ahead to UCLA now, watching what you watched? The way they
played Cal? Is that a cautionary tale for you guys in any way?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, Cal has an excellent team and I think that it was,
you know, it was really kind of the perfect storm. UCLA did a great job of not
allowing second shots, and Cal has a way of feasting on old boards, and that's
something that we've been emphasizing with our team that we have to rebound. I
honestly, all my focus was on Colorado and thinking about playing against
UCLA. We have a big and physical team. And we have a big, physical team too.
We match up well with them, and we know we have to play very well.  
It was a little bit, you know, this game for us was we have to get our team
off their feet, and it doesn't help maybe to have this, you know, to spring
forward tonight. But these are young players that are going to have to come
out and really battle tomorrow.  
  
Q. Chiney, yesterday you said that you were all smiles as far as, you know,
your team getting involved, and it seemed like there was a lot more work
involved tonight. Can you talk about that?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think I was all smiles again today, but it was forced
smiles, like, come on. The next one is going to go in. But, again, I'm really
proud of this team. A lot of people don't realize that we are pretty young.
Despite Mikaela's class as a red shirt junior, Sara James and Mikaela and even
Joslyn in a way are looked to as leaders.  
This year, especially with the game, like Sara James was that one person that
we were all like, hey, let's do this. Let's get through this together. So it
was another good moment for our team. Clearly the ball didn't go in the basket
as much as we'd like.  
But this is how March is. The game is physical. You have to stay with things,
and I think that was a big test today. Colorado is a fantastic team.
Definitely deserving of their ranking. And I'm just really happy that our team
responded well to the adversity.  
  
Q. Talk about the collective defense, you, Sara, almost everybody, Taylor.
Just talk about that part of the game?  
MIKAELA RUEF: Well, we didn't necessarily like the way we played defense
yesterday in our game. We thought that it was lacking a little bit especially
in the post end. That was one of our main focuses for me and Chiney to not let
our people score. We couldn't help this team run as much because they had good
perimeter shooters. Amber had good stuff on Chucky. Chucky is a good player,
and I thought Amber did a good job of not shutting her down accident but
containing her.  
Everybody was super focused on guarding her player, and we switched well, I
think, and did a really good job on screens and stuff, and trying to get
through those and stop their people.  
  
Q. Tara, did you envision winning a game like this with one 3?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We have played games like this. I think Sara James did it.
We have played games like this. Teams, I think, respect the three‑point
shooting. If you saw us yesterday, I told our team at practice forget shooting
threes, just put the ball on the floor. I just really felt this was their
style. We've played them a couple times. I don't know how many threes we've
gotten against them in other games. They extend defense. They put it on the
floor. We didn't have a lot of assists either.  
They made it very tough to get the ball inside, and when Chiney got it, it
made it very tough for her to have bodies on her, arms on her, and they subbed
in waves, so that if somebody got‑‑ like they weren't worried about anybody
fouling out. They had like 22 fouls.  
So I guess we have played teams like this before. This is an Arizona State,
which we're used to playing against. This is like the semifinal game last year
against Arizona State. We didn't have any threes in that game either. We were
able to go inside, get some drives to the basket. I thought Amber was really
the key. Just how she wept through their defense. They're going to get
extended and she made them pay for doing that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the adjustments you made at halftime to get the
separation until the second period?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Quite honestly, the best ideas at halftime were not mine. I
asked our team what they like doing out there. What felt good to them. I got
great input from assistant coaches. Trina had scouted them, and she was
talking a lot about what we needed to do. Amy made a game adjustment. Kate had
a list of different things. I think in some way the better play was not from
me.  
But I was a little upset about how physical the game was. I think the
assistants were doing a better job coaching, to be honest with you the
adjustments that we tried to make were going high and in, spreading out a
little bit more, taking people off the dribble, trying to recognize some
mismatches. Just keep going at Chiney and trying, more than anything, stay
support. I liked how Mikaela attacked the basket.  
Sara James tried to, she had a charge. Amber attacked the basket. Chiney
attacked the basket. And quite honestly, we can only play people that go to
the basket. That's what we talked about at halftime.  
  
Q. Chiney, Tara was mentioning the bodies and arms all over you. Did this
have the intensity and feel of an NCAA Tournament game?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yes, that is the first thing I said. That felt like a
tournament game. Just the set‑up of Kia Arena, this reminds me of a tournament
with the blue and black and everything. Yeah, the tournament, you can't
foresee anything. And today, we struggled at moments.  
But at the same time, I think we responded well. We just stayed together. And
that's how teams win in the tournament. They try to be more aggressive, and I
think we were more aggressive in the second half defensively. That's what
helped us get easier baskets, and we found a way to push through.  
So I think this game has really taught us a lot just to stay with things,
despite any situation, despite how you're playing, to stay together united.
And I think we play for each other at Stanford. That is one thing that no
matter what happens, we're happy if we play hard and play for each other; and
it was fun. It was fun. It was a very fun‑‑ winning is fun.  
Not missing shots isn't fun, but sticking together when you have teammates pat
you on the back saying the next one's going to go in. Just being there with
each other. So we have a lot of fun at Stanford, despite any words.  
  
Q. Mikaela, do you feel like it's coming together for you guys? That making
adjustments successfully? Do you feel there's a bit of coming together in the
last few weeks?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I think so. I think we're figuring out how to put pieces
together on our team and where people fit in and how they can help our team.
We are getting a lot of contributions from the bench, which is awesome.
Especially in a tournament like this where it's three games in three days, and
it's not ideal to play three games in three days, but we're a team that since
we can get help from our bench players or substitutions, subs, that we can get
through these three games successfully.  
  
Q. How long have you been in the starting lineup?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I don't know. People work hard and stuff.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Good job.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: We love each other. We're happy to win.  
MIKAELA RUEF: I'm bad at interviews.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: It's okay.  
COACH VANDERVEER: It's getting late.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: It's getting late, obviously.  
  
Q. Coach, there have been years they've called this the Stanford
Invitational, and there is a reason for that, and some years have been a cake
walk. This year is more competitive, I think. Do you agree? What is your
response to that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, if it was a cake walk, I missed the cake. It has
never, ever been easy. I can remember at the Pac‑12 tournament, we're down 18
against Arizona. We ended up winning it. Every, I mean, every game to me has
been‑‑ every tournament has been extremely challenging.  
You know, this year we do have four teams ranked in the top 20, and I think
the Pac‑12 with the Pac‑12 Network is getting fabulous exposure. We have a
terrific players and so many young players. Like just Ariel out there today or
just looking at the number of great young players that we've seen playing in
the Pac‑12\.  
You know, I'm really proud of our team and how hard we worked. They're part of
a great tradition. But we work for, I think really hard. Just an example with
Cal, they've had a great, great year, and you have one bad night and you're
not in the finals or having a chance to compete. So two‑thirds of our work is
done and the most important third is ahead.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the difficulty of playing a third game in three days
and also UCLA's depth? Could you talk about what happened last game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: These are young people that play basketball for hours every
day, and I also would just say I compliment our strength and conditioning
coach who works really hard to not only get people really strong and get them
in shape, but to help them recover.  
They'll be fine, and there is going to be a little extra adrenaline tomorrow.
So I would take who we have maybe over playing ten people. In different
situations, we can play different people, and we are down one player and
they're down one starter also.  
But I think we'll be in great shape tomorrow, and I think that people will see
a very exciting game, and I just know that, we'll, as Chiney said, we've
learned from this game and gotten better. And that is the idea of this
tournament, the Pac‑12 tournament, is about showcasing great women's
basketball, and helping us get ready. This is a dress rehearsal for the real
thing.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2013

  

### [Alyssia Brewer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19306)

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

UCLA  70  
Cal  58

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations UCLA. We have Coach Cori Close, Markel Walker,
and Alyssia Brewer. Coach, I'll let you open.  
COACH CLOSE: Credit to Cal. This win means a lot to us because they are such a
formidable opponent, and we've respected them all year. They really handed it
to us down at our place, and they just are a really good basketball team that
have represented our conference extremely well all year long. And we expect
and will support, and root them on through a big NCAA Tournament run.  
But I'm proud of our basketball team, and I'm also proud of my assistant
coaches who I just saw put together a tremendous game plan, and you know, just
have been spending countless hours not only in their preparation, watching
film, but individually with our players, having a pulse of what they need,
what they want.  
So it's such a great team effort. I think the two groups of people I'm so
thankful for is our seniors, their perseverance, playing through coaching
changes and injuries and all kinds of different things that our seniors have
had to battle through. Their faithfulness and loyalty has been so
inspirational. And obviously I think I have such an amazing staff. It was fun
to watch that play out, because of their hard work.  
  
Q. Cori, third time you get to play Cal. Was this a matter of a better game
plan or a matter of you guys executing in a way you hadn't in the previous
games?  
COACH CLOSE: I think we executed better. We wanted to play more zone in the
second game at our place, but we got behind. And so then it was playing catch
up and trying to turn them over and create more possessions. So it took us out
of our game plan. We played almost all zone up there. They shot the ball
better up at their place.  
But I thought our guards handled the pressure, and we got the ball in places
that we wanted this time, whereas we thought our weapon ‑‑ at Cal, we let
their pressure get to us. Even at our place as well. I'm not sure the game
plan changed so much. It's more so that we executed well at the beginning. We
were able to stick with our game plan and control the rebound, control the
paint. It obviously led to easier opportunities on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Alyssia, can you describe how and why your zone was so effective tonight?
It really established the tone of this game?  
ALYSSIA BREWER: Well, like Coach said, whenever we played them up there, our
first game we played them and we lost by five that game. And then they came to
our place and played mostly man. We look back at this first game, and realize
what we were doing wrong and we adjusted to that.  
I think also communication is a very big deal for us, and we communicated the
entire game, and post the guards, and guard the posts. So I think you have to
give credit around the team to talk to each other and listen to each other on
the court.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the composure that you showed in the second half when
they really turned up the pressure on you?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think that our senior leadership was really calm. Every
time out they banked in the three or a couple of last second, Alyssia hit a
three‑pointer, sort of a desperation three. Instead of, oh, should I go out on
that? Should I abort our game plan? No, we're going to stick with this. I
thought every time out, our seniors were like, hey, let's make some minor
adjustments, but we're all right. I think it goes back to them. They provide
the tone.  
But what Alyssia said is really important. Our whole team has such great
togetherness and emotion, and I think that's why you saw a sense of calm.
There was just a unit in what we were trying to accomplish together. When the
other team made a run, that's okay. We knew that they're a great team. We knew
that run was going to come. We broke the game up into ten four‑minute
segments, and every four‑minute segments we said, did we win that one? Did we
accomplish our goals with that one? And then we left it. That was a big part
of handling the runs in the second half, we were only dealing with four
minutes at a time, so all we could do is deal with that.  
  
Q. Are you surprised at all it never got into single digits?  
ALYSSIA BREWER: I say I wasn't‑‑ like our togetherness is so good. Like our
coach said, our seniors, and everyone stepped up. So even when they started
making a run, we came together so much that we had so many offensive weapons
to stop it. Like, it wasn't just one player looking for their own. It was so
well, that we didn't break apart. I'm not surprised. If we would have saw that
some person didn't talk or next person didn't talk. I was surprised that it
wasn't, but we were so together the whole game that it wasn't.  
  
Q. Cori, we asked Cal this question. How do you put this game away? You guys
play again tomorrow, so maybe it's a little easier. But this is probably
arguably your biggest win of the season in terms of Cal's ranking. How do you
put it away and turn around and play tomorrow?  
COACH CLOSE: How deep do your goals go? This was someone ‑‑ Cal was our
opponent today that was in the way of what our goal was to come win the Pac‑12
tournament. So, if your goal goes deep enough, you put it away and start
focusing on what you have to do to prepare for the next formidable opponent.
That's easier said than done. It takes mental discipline and habits of
preparation. That's why we don't just turn the switch on excellence. We've
been practicing excellence all year long. Our thing is, hey, we just stick
with our routine. We pay the price to prepare the way we need to prepare
physically, mentally, emotionally, and we give ourselves a chance to go and
accomplish our goals.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it would be fair to say that the Pac ‑12 in the past has
been an underappreciated conference by the selection committee. This year it's
hard to argue with four teams in the top 25. Can you make the case now for
where you think you should be seeded?   
COACH CLOSE: Well, you know, I can tell you that I believe we've got a 1 and a
2 for sure in Stanford and Cal, and I believe we've proven not just with this
win, but with other wins we've had in the top 10. We beat Oklahoma early at
their place when they were number 10 in the country and they were healthy at
that point. We went down when Texas was undefeated.  
So I think we made an argument. I think the reality of the situation is that
just because you're asleep some of the time when we're playing out here on the
west coast, doesn't mean there is not great basketball going on. And I've been
singing the praises for the depth and the growth of this conference, and I
think we're just scratching the surface.  
The committee does a great job. I'm not going to second guess that. They're
going to do their homework, and they're going to look at our body of work and
seed us where we've earned.  
But I am really excited about the direction of the Pac‑12 conference. And
we've made a big jump this year, but we're going to make a bigger jump next
year. And this is a very spectacular time to be a part of Pac‑12 women's
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about preparing for another game on back ‑to‑back
days going into tomorrow which is so important?   
COACH CLOSE: This is what we knew going in. When you're running on the track
in September and October, you're preparing for this. They're hydrating, and
they're calling me hydration police, and this is what you've been preparing
for.  
So this is a matter of your heart and your mind overpowering anything that's
happened physically. And both Stanford and us and Colorado and us all three
teams play a lot of players. So whoever we're going to face, we're going to
face a team of great depth.  
But it's not going to come down to that. It's going to come down to mental
focus, togetherness, toughness. It's all those intangible things that. Great
players go make plays, and it just has to do with how deep it goes.  
  
Q. I wanted to follow up on my previous question. You felt the selection
committee would give you the seeding you earn. Can you put a number on that?  
COACH CLOSE: I'm not smart enough for that. I did the mock selection with the
coaches in Indianapolis, and I have a great amount of respect for the amount
of work that goes into that.  
I believe we're probably a 3 or a 4, would be my guess. But I really do have a
lot of respect. I'm actually a representative for the Pac‑12 conference on
that committee. I get a chance to talk to that committee about once a month
through the year, so I've had my chance to have a chance to make them aware of
the great body of work of not only my team but the other teams in this
conference.  
For us, it's a matter of we're just proud to represent UCLA, and we think
that's such an honor. So whoever we get a chance to do that with in March
Madness, we consider it a privilege, and we're excited to make a deep run in
the tournament.

## March 9, 2013

  

### [Brittany Boyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23421)

### [Layshia Clarendon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23447)

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

UCLA  70  
Cal  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Cal Golden Bears. Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, Brittany
Boyd, and Layshia Clarendon. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thanks, you guys, for being here. Obviously, we wanted to be
playing in tomorrow's championship, but I credit UCLA. They're a terrific
team. They're in the top 15 for a reason, and I thought they brought all their
strengths to forefront tonight. They came out ready, and they were really
good.  
I'm proud of how our team fought back in the second half. I thought there was
no quit in us. I thought we did a lot of things better in the second half. But
hole was just a little bit too deep, especially against a team as good as
UCLA. But I credit their players and their coaching staff who did a great job,
and we have to use this to help us, and we will. I'm confident in the
leadership our team and players and staff that we have. The only option is to
look forward to the next tournament that we're thrilled to be able to say that
we're going to be in, and we'll use this to help us.  
  
Q. You guys have stayed in the moment all year. Was there anything about
today that you think had to do with looking ahead?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Obviously, that's going to come to my mind first to think
about that, but I don't think so. I thought that our players were focused and
walked through last night in shootarounds. So didn't seem that way to me. But
I do think one thing we'll talk about is, hey, we can never feel comfortable.
We played really well against USC, and there should be a confidence level from
playing well.  
But I think this will help us to say at any moment, whatever team's in front
of us, we have to be really sharp. We could face a team like UCLA and second
round of the NCAA Tournament if we make it past the first round or we could
face someone in a round after that.  
So I think it will help us to kind of make sure and keep us on edge that we're
never comfortable. But I don't think there was an issue of looking ahead.  
  
Q. Kind of along that line, how do you think a loss like this could affect
your tournament seeding?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think what the Pac‑12 has wanted all along are really good
teams. So when we beat one another, it looks like a great win. This should be
a great win for UCLA and help their resume. For us, it doesn't hurt you. I
look across conference today, Maryland lost to UNC and Tennessee lost to Texas
A&M, and it's same kind of differential.  
I think our body of work is pretty good that I think we could have help
ourselves in this tournament had we won it maybe we could have gotten a 1
seed. But I hope this kind of keeps us where we would be otherwise.  
  
Q. Layshia, given season that your team has had, and have you foreseen
anything like this happening with your team? The way you played?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: No, I don't think we ever think we're going to miss that
many shots. My coaches say every shot I take they think is going in, which
gives me a lot of confidence. But like she said, we were well prepared. They
just gave us those first punches in first half, and you can't give a top 15
team a 21‑point lead on you. It's hard to come back. They're too good.  
  
Q. Coach, you were able to win against UCLA both home and away. What were
they doing differently tonight that seemed to upset your shooting ability?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, they came out in a straight zone. You know, and I knew,
obviously, that we had play really well down there and they didn't play any
zone. So I thought one adjustment they could make was to go zone. So I think
we face more zone than any team in the country.  
But I think they went zone, and we missed our first couple shots. And I think
that was an issue for us. Then the way that we miss shots, the long rebounds
let them get out in transition, and that was just disastrous. So I think the
difference was missing early shots and them converting those to lay‑ups. We
couldn't get into a rhythm where we get stops.  
  
Q. What was your sense of what was going on the glass? In terms of
rebounding, do you feel like you guys got beat there?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I thought early on we had a tough time getting interior
touches, which meant long shots were long rebounds and our posts weren't as
much of a factor on the offensive glass. We do. Sometimes we shoot really
well, and sometimes we clean up misses on the glass, and it was a little bit
of both evils were there, because we were missing shots and not getting
rebounds. More so than what they were doing, it was a factor for us not
scoring.  
They're a great rebounding team as well. So the 13 offensive rebounds for them
is a problem. I think we end up with more second chance points, but we don't
want to be five ahead of somebody. We want to be 25 ahead of somebody.  
So sure, it was a factor in the game. But if we're a top two or three
rebounding in the country, then UCLA's four or five. So I don't think it's a
shock. We just didn't get the job done as well as we wanted to. But I loved
our players' resolve in the second half. We came out a lot more aggressive.
Gen had probably combined for ten, and most of those came in the second half.  
  
Q. Brittany, from your perspective on the point, how difficult or what
problems did UCLA's zone present you as you were kind of looking for your
teammates inside?  
BRITTANY BOYD: In the posts they were getting post touches and getting the
feel of the game. Yeah, in zone, the zone kind of cures our energy and skills
our transition because we were a transition team. So by them making shots, it
was hard for us to push the ball. So we got the ball down court, set up, and
it was really hard. That's where we get most of our points is in transition.  
  
Q. Layshia, what was the what was the mindset at halftime? What were you
thinking in the locker room at halftime?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: We can win this. We're going to win this. This team never
stops believing for one second, and that we're fighters. That we didn't come
this far. We didn't come back 17 against Oregon stated, beat USC in overtime,
go play Duke, all of these games without fighting now. I think there were 3
minutes left, out of bounds, we're not passing. It's character. We've got to
keep fighting, and we never let people change who we are. We're always going
to fight and bring energy. We're always going to stay true to our colors.  
  
Q. Lindsay, clearly missing shots in first half didn't help, but it seemed
like offensively UCLA just did what they wanted in the first half. Were you
surprise by what they were trying to do or anything like that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean I think we couldn't get ‑‑ they were scoring in
transition so much. I looked at the sheet at halftime, and it said 2 or 4 fast
breakpoints. It didn't feel that way, because we never could get set‑up. We
knew that they've been wanting to play through the paint recently, especially
with Thea being out, even more so. We know they like to cut behind it.  
So our themes were protect the paint and pressure the ball. And we just never
got done in the first half. Again, I thought they push the ball well. It poses
problems when they can have three or four different people pushing ball up the
floor. They will have Markel or Nyingifa push it up, and it bothered our
transition defense. And I thought we let them kind of cut behind us a little
bit, and get more interior play than what we want them to.  
So we weren't surprised that that's what they're looking to do. But I thought
we had a hard time getting stops we wanted because we were letting them go in
transition a little bit. And they just played well.  
  
Q. Layshia, what do you think the team is going to do in responding to what
happened?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: When we're sitting in the locker room and we're all kind
of, you know sad and on ourselves and we look back, and we have three losses
on the entire year. So we're like if this doesn't ruin our season in any way
at all. We talked about it being more of a wake‑up call. If anything, it will
make us more hungry for tournament. And we wanted it, of course, but we didn't
get it. So now it will be how we respond. With this team we'll take a few days
off. Prepare well for tournament, and then it's kind of all or nothing. So I
think it will affect us for the positive, for sure.  
  
Q. Lindsay, was there anything wrong with Gennifer in this game? She seemed
to be lacking some of the zip that she has orderly was that a funk of how UCLA
played?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Like Brittany said, I think their focus was on shutting down
our inside game with their zone, and it's a long zone. Usually Brittany can
passes and make slices to those posts. I think it was way they were playing.
And we don't necessarily have major athletic advantages like we do over UCLA.
She never got going offensively. But the team struggled to get going
offensively, and that was everybody.  
  
Q. This is for players: In the zone they attacked the paint pretty well. In
the first half, perimeter shots weren't falling for you. Both of you got
turned up a notch in the second half from arc. Could you talk about the cold
shooting, a bad night? Or was doing something that frustrated you?  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think it's hard for us to get in our rhythm. Lot of shots
we take in our zone offense. Skip it, get wide open threes. I think for me,
everything was contested, creating something on the pull‑up. Then the law of
averages. Something's going to go in. They started to go under ball screens
and switched off a little bit. So started a couple shots down.  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, for me giving shots, I don't feel like they were bad
shots, but for myself, going into paint, finding open lane and making lay‑up,
it was so packed in, and there was nowhere I could drive or ditch to nobody.
So I just credit their defense. Their defense was the key to this game.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Chiney Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21930)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  79  
Washington State  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with Coach Tara VanDerveer, Sara James, and
Chiney Ogwumike. Coach, if you'd like to open?  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, I just want to say probably the most important
thing is to see June Daugherty behind the bench, knowing she was okay. It was
really scary. We're really glad that she's doing well. Congratulate Washington
State on a great game. I thought they played really hard. It was a much
tougher team than we saw last week, and we had to‑‑ I thought we had to really
play well in order to move on to the semifinals tomorrow, and we did play
well.  
The two people next to me I thought had great games. Sara James has been
practicing so hard. She really showed out today, knocking down five threes,
which is I think a career high for her. She just had a great game. She worked
very hard defensively on Galdeira who is an excellent, excellent player. The
usual double‑double from Chiney, which we have come to depend on. Chiney
rebounding, scoring, and I feel like I've got really good contributions from
Mikaela Ruef, I thought she had great passes, six assists. I thought Joss who
actually had the flu all week made some really big plays for us. Amber was
steady. Bonnie came in and helped us, and E. Payne came in and helped us. We
got a lot of contributions from a lot of people. Having said that, we'll have
to play a lot better tomorrow.  
  
Q. We're used to double ‑doubles from Chiney, but we're not used to behind
the back passes. What did you think of that one?   
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought it was something that we actually practiced. We
actually practiced behind the back passes as part of a bigger series of drills
that we do. I thought it was kind of the right thing at the right time. Just
in that our team needed something to kind of loosen them up, maybe, get them
excited. That kind of did it. Along with others, right then were some steals.
Both Sara James and Mikaela had five steals. But I think Chiney is lobbying
for some point guard time.  
  
Q. Were you comfortable shooting tonight in a new gym? Sometimes it can be a
tough night on shooters, but you looked comfortable. Did you feel comfortable
here?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, we came here and shot this morning. The ball was just
feeling really good in my hands. I just knew that it was going to be a good
shooting day. So I came out firing.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk a little bit about the play at the end of the first
half when you got the ball, went the length of the court, looked at the clock
or looked at the scoreboard? I don't know if you were counting the crowd too,
but can you run us through what happened on that?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: It's funny. Sometimes I get burned on defense, and I feel
really bad because I'm a risk‑reward type of defender and I sometimes get out
of position. But knowing the last ten seconds going up I knew that our defense
was pretty‑‑ ending the game with the defensive stop was big. But I didn't
expect to get a steal. I saw their coach tell their player, don't foul, don't
foul.  
So I just try to bring momentum. Today I haven't smiled that much in a long
time playing. Today was a lot of fun. So many people got into the game. Like
Sara James was diving on the floor. Mikaela Ruef diving on the floor. Amber
her defensive presence. Taylor making great passes. Bonnie penetrating. How
many times have you seen Bonnie willing to take contacts like that?  
I think it's March, and it's lose or go home. So I think that was just a
really fun thing for us.  
  
Q. Are you aware this is the first 20 ‑20 game that's ever been in the
conference tournament?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I've recently become aware. It's funny. It's awesome. It's
cool. But they don't really matter to me in the scheme of things. Because to
me I'm smiling about how Sara James got that huge offensive board when the
pressure was inside and how she hit five threes and spotted up really well,
and Joslyn, how she responded in the second half. Those things got me going.
Even those stats are nice.  
I look at the four or three turnovers I had, and I'm just hitting myself in
the head. So that's what I focus on. It's just whatever our team needs, I'm
down for.  
  
Q. How is Bonnie's head?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it was sore, but she seems fine. I'm mad at Chiney
on that play.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Oh, I know. That was my fault. I should have known the
scouting report. Because Galdeira, she likes to drive right. She's an
aggressive driver right, and I should have known that switching on to her.
Bonnie really made me look good until she fell and hit her head because she
tried to take a charge on that play.  
So if I knew what I was doing, Bonnie wouldn't have been put in that
situation. That's part of how we keep each other accountable. So, sorry,
Bonnie.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Anthony Levrets](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21838)

### [Michelle Plouffe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21840)

### [Taryn Wicijowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20576)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

UCLA  54  
Utah  43

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH LEVRETS: First of all, we're really proud of our team, how well we
battled in that second half after not playing great basketball in the first
half. We turned it over, I think seven times, and 12, we gave them 12‑‑ the
other way around. Seven offensive rebounds in the first half t 12 turnovers.
In the second half we eliminated that and competed. Other than that last
segment, we were right there.  
So really proud of our team, and we got some basketball left to play, and
hopefully we can keep improving this year and into the future.  
  
Q. Taryn, will you talk about that last segment? You guys had tied the game,
gonna head, and was it just a matter of not being able to sustain that?  
TARYN WICIJOWSKI: I feel like we missed shots that we could normally make.
Whether we made it or not, obviously, missing shots after we got so much
momentum kind of took that away from us a little bit, and they made some tough
shots too. They made a shot clock buzzer beater bank and you know. So they
made tough shots and we missed shots that we can make, you know, so I think
that's more what it was.  
  
Q. Coach, you went on a 15 ‑2 run, and it seemed like when Taryn picked up
her fourth foul is when things kind of shifted?  
COACH LEVRETS: Are you trying to bait me?  
  
Q. No, no, no. I'm just saying that it seems like you guys had UCLA on the
ropes and everything. The offense was working, and when Taryn picked up her
fourth foul, things kind of went stagnant again?  
COACH LEVRETS: I agree. Yeah, I think that was a huge call. But that's the way
basketball works, not having one of your key players on the floor. But that's
the way it goes. If I comment any further, I'll get myself in trouble.  
  
Q. Talk about Cheyenne off the bench tonight. The Seattle kid to come in and
get you guys back in the game?  
COACH LEVRETS: Yeah, Cheyenne started for us a lot down the stretch last year.
You know, with Awa playing more minutes this year, it's been tougher for her
to get her minutes. But she's continued to improve, continues to work, and she
can score.  
Obviously, we're going to have to replace some seniors next year, and Chey is
one of those kids that's talented enough to do it, and hopefully we'll have a
great off‑season and see more of her playing like she did in the future.  
  
Q. Michelle, what are you going to remember most about this senior group?
You and Taryn have one more year left here, but I'm sure you learned a lot of
things from some of those older players?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yeah, they were such a great group of girls. They're great
people off the court and on the court they're just competitors. They can shoot
the crap out of the ball. It's hard to replace players like that, but we're
going to, hopefully.  
  
Q. Anthony, are you disheartened by the way you guys played the last few
weeks?  
COACH LEVRETS: I was not disheartened ever. I know from the outside looking in
everybody thought we would try to find a bridge to jump off of, but there
aren't any in Salt Lake City, so they were safe. We played a very, very
difficult schedule. It was notup‑and‑down basketball. It's a long, long year.
It is not a sprint. It's a marathon. And I was disheartened after some games
with the outcome, but this is such an incredible group of kids. They've been
through a ton of stuff in the last few years together, and nothing really
seems to faze them as far as changing how we play or go about our business.  
So I think we started the year, and I thought we had a chance to do something
special. It probably ended short of where we all thought and hoped we'd end
the season, and, you know, I love coaching them. I love being around them.
It's hard to be disheartened when you walk into the room and there are 13 kids
that you just love being around. I've said it over and over again, this is the
most fun we've ever had as a staff with a group of kids, and it's hard to be
disheartened for very long when that is the kind of kids you have.  
  
Q. Walk me through what was working in the second half on that big run
approach when Taryn said the shots weren't falling?  
COACH LEVRETS: There is a great pressure on the basketball and switching, and
it takes a little while to adjust that to. Especially when you don't get a
practice, it takes a while. Your eyes and how we played, it takes a little
while to see what you're seeing, and to be able to get catches right away.  
As the game went on, it gets harder and harder to do that, and we have good
players. Eventually you adjust to what they're doing. We get the ball into
good spots, they play well together, they play well off of each other, and I
think not having "T" on the floor down the stretch is a huge part of what
we're doing. We were playing great because we have good kids and they know how
to play together.  
  
Q. I asked Michelle the same thing, but what was message to the seniors in
the locker room? Or what will it be?  
COACH LEVRETS: The season is not over. We're going to be playing. It's
probably not going to be in the NCAA Tournament. It's probably going to be in
the NIT. But one of our kids said if we're going to be in the NIT, let's go
win the whole thing. That is the message.  
The season is not over. It's not over until they make you stop playing, and
we're going to take a few days off here, and hopefully get a little rest, get
healthy, be students for a little while and then come back and practice and
use this segment of practice time however long we get, to try to get better,
and we'll try to go beat whoever it is the next person on the schedule is.  
  
Q. Was it a little tougher knowing that you struggled in the first half and
battled back from a double digit lead in the second half against a top ‑15
team?   
COACH LEVRETS: All losses are the same. You feel like a bad person afterwards
for a while, and then you get over it because of the kids. There are no good
losses or bad losses. Losing sucks. You've got to get over it, and we'll move
on to the next thing.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Chucky Jeffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24875)

### [Linda Lappe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21392)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  70  
Washington  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH LAPPE: I'm really proud of our players. I thought we stepped up big at
certain times. We had a lot of players come in and do their job perfectly
tonight. But particularly Kyleesha Weston and Jamee Swan coming in off the
bench were huge for us. When Brittany Wilson got into a little bit of foul
trouble, they came in. Didn't seem like who we brought in the game, we never
missed a beat. Allowed us to get some good rest so we were able to make a push
at the end.  
That's kind of what we've been good at all year long is being able to go on
runs in the second half because we have so much depth. So I'm excited for the
win. We'll enjoy it for a couple minutes here, definitely, and we'll get ready
to move on to the next one.  
  
Q. How will you guys feel about going against Chiney after the big game she
had earlier today?  
CHUCKY JEFFERY: Chiney a great player. It's hard to stop Chiney, but this is
what we wanted. We want to face Stanford. We think we match up with them
really well, and we think it's going to be a good game.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel about the match ‑up with Stanford?   
COACH LAPPE: Chiney is a great player, and they have a lot of great players.
They're executing their offense really well right now. Understand what they're
trying to get, working together really well. They're also tough defensively
because they're so big. They're deceptively quick, and it's hard to get easy
shots on them.  
So we're excited for the match‑up. There is only one way you can look at a
match‑up with Stanford, and that is it's an opportunity. We're going to look
at it that way, and we'll have to make sure that we're ready. We're playing
really well together. Yeah, they're the giants of the Pac‑12, and we get a
shot at them.  
  
Q. Coach Lappe, how do you feel about the development of Lexy Kresl this
year?  
COACH LAPPE: She's been able to really catch fire. She got hurt a couple weeks
ago. That hurt her a little bit. But before that, she was starting to really
hit her shots and understand the offense. Defensively I thought tonight she
was really good. I thought she did a nice job on Kingma. That's an area she's
improved a lot over the last year, and offensively she's starting to get back
into the flow. This was her first real game where she's been able to play
quality minutes.  
So you can see some rust out there at times on some of her shots being short
and things like that. But we're happy to have her back. I think she adds a
different dimension to our team.  
  
Q. What is it you guys or your team shot really poorly in the first half is
a case of just getting accustomed to things? And you picked it up in the
second half?  
COACH LAPPE: We were really excited to play. I think any time that's the case,
you tend to miss some easy shots. You saw that a lot yesterday in some of the
first round games, and we kind of went through that to start the game.  
But I liked how we stayed with it. I like how we kept crashing the offensive
glass. We needed to get a lot of extra shots this game, and we did. We showed
a lot of toughness, and a lot of resolve chasing down loose basketballs to get
us extra shots.  
Finally in the second half we started to knock down some shots that we always
shoot. I thought we were taking great shots throughout. Lot of times when
you're missing shots, you're not taking shots that you practiced or you're
rushing. Not all of our shots were good. They were within the flow of the
offense. We were just rushing a little bit, and we were a little bit too
excited, I think.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about Jamee's game, and Jamee, talk about your
game?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, Jamee played outstanding. She's strong. She's physical. I
could tell in warm‑ups that she was ready to go. Her goal is to just bring
that consistency every single game, and when she's ready to play, that's when
you saw a lot of the good things that she could do. She was a force on the
inside defensively, blocking a lot of shots or changed a lot of shots down in
there. Rebounding the basketball really well, both offensively and
defensively, and then was aggressive down low in the black.  
I liked how our team found her. Late in the game there we ran a set for her
and she executed and knocked it down. The thing with her is she could have
even had more. She missed a lot of easy shots in the first half and she just
had to slow down a little bit. Once she did that, they started to come.  
JAMEE SWAN: I don't know really how to say. I feel like I've played the best
I've ever played. It was really nice to actually be out there and not be
afraid and know what I was doing and have my teammates behind me. Helping me
do what I have to do to be able to be on the court.

### [Lia Galdeira](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24831)

### [Carly Noyes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24870)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  79  
Washington State - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Daugherty, Lia Galdeira, Carly Noyes, and
Coach Mike Daugherty. Coach June, an opening statement?  
COACH JUNE DAUGHERTY: Mike's not undefeated as a head coach as of today. My
staff and Mike did a great job all year, all six years we've been together. A
lot of people ask about what turned the team over and letting someone else
coach them. I believe in all our coaches, and I think they did a great job
given the adversity that was going on here the last couple of days, at least
with me physically with appendicitis.  
But really proud of our program. We're competitive now, and that's something
that when we walked into Pullman six years ago, we couldn't say that. We have
some great kids in this program. You have a chance to see sometimes three and
four freshmen on the floor at one time.  
We've had great leadership from Carly Noyes and with Katie Grad and Ireti
Amojo. They've been fabulous seniors for us. And done an amazing job with the
team. We may be the youngest team in the country. We don't know. We've never
told our team that until now. But with six freshmen and two sophomores, the
leadership they've provided has been very much appreciated.  
Today we had some good looks. We didn't always knock them down, and Stanford
was pretty good from the three tonight. I think that that put us back on our
heels a little bit. But what I loved about this group is they continued to
fight. They've done this all year, no matter what the score is, where we're
playing, who we're playing, what ranking they are. They continue to fight and
learn, and that's a credit to the seniors in the program. We're really looking
forward to another three or four years with this group, because they're very
talented and very exciting.  
  
Q. Carly, you guys made a run at last year's tournament. How much did that
change expectations or just the mindset in terms of what you've come to expect
now?  
CARLY NOYES: I think it gave us a whole bunch of confidence coming into this
year. We won last year, so we knew how to win, and we wanted to go on a run
like we did and have as much fun as we could.  
  
Q. June, you started off in the first half behind the bench, and it seemed
like in the second half, it was kind of irresistible?  
COACH JUNE DAUGHERTY: Well, I was under doctor's orders with all of the taping
that I have on me right now. I'm more taped than Lia, and that's pretty
impossible sometimes, that I had to be behind a safety barrier not to get hit.
But on timeouts, we knew that nobody should be running in there, normally on a
timeout or anything like that. But it was definitely different. Sitting up a
couple of rows higher, and able to watch it from a different perspective and
then on timeouts, I just tried to help with some of the adjustments that we
were trying to do and some of the substitutions.  
So it was really different. I don't want to do it anymore. It wasn't that
good. But, again, I can't say enough about my team. To handle the adversity
yesterday, it was a major distraction, because it happened about two hours
before we took off for the game and again today. And Mike and the entire staff
are phenomenal leaders.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
COACH JUNE DAUGHERTY: I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm all right.  
  
Q. Lia, you had such a great freshman year. What will you do over the summer
to keep up the momentum?  
LIA GALDEIRA: Hit the weight room, workout, and then, again, like Coach June
said, we had great leaders this year, Carly and Katie. I give all the credit
to them and God.  
  
Q. Carly, you guys had just played them. To turn around and play them again
quickly, do you feel like you played them more competitively tonight?  
CARLY NOYES: Yeah, definitely. We switched up our defensive game plan, and for
the most part, it worked. Credit to Chiney Ogwumike; she's tough to guard. I
think we did a good job for the most part. The offense, we weren't hitting as
many shots as we should have, but we got open looks?  
  
Q. Lia, what happened to you on that lay ‑up? I couldn't quite tell.   
LIA GALDEIRA: I don't know what happened either. I think I just got numb. And
I looked at June and she can come out from surgery the next day, and I'm going
to go back out there.  
  
Q. June, Chiney had 21 points, 20 rebounds. What was the plan to contend
with her? And how do you think you played against her?  
COACH JUNE DAUGHERTY: Obviously we've seen her twice now in a week's time. And
we threw a lot of different defenses at her in particular. She's so good, it's
tough what you throw at her. But we tried to front her and make her catch the
ball higher out than where she typically catches it, and we have to have
backside support. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes when
you're doubling her, it's easy. Because Stanford reverses the ball so quickly,
to lose her a little bit on the backside rebounding. I think that was probably
the one thing that was really disappointing for me. I thought we could at
least box her out a little bit more, and get her the easy on the boards.
Tremendous player. Played 38 minutes. I believe she's the best post in the
country. I know some people down in Texas might dispute that a little bit or
Baylor, and she's improved so much. So I just wish she was a senior.  
  
Q. Carly, being one of the seniors on this team, what do you see as the
future for this program?  
CARLY NOYES: I'm so excited to watch them. They're so great. They've improved
so much this season. And with that improvement in just one year, I think
they're going to be so much better a few years from now. So keep watching
them, because I'm excited.  
  
Q. Was it challenging to hear June's voice coming from far away like not
where you usually expected it during the game?  
CARLY NOYES: No, because she cheers us on all the time. That's the great thing
about June. She's just so positive. I don't know. We loved that she was here
today. Thank you so much for being here. We know it's not easy. Yeah, she just
kept cheering us on, and we heard her.  
LIA GALDEIRA: Her presence here did it all. She didn't have to say anything.  
COACH JUNE DAUGHERTY: I'd just like to thank all of the people that put this
together. The Pac‑12, obviously, Seattle Storm. This, for a coach that's been
in this league 30‑something years as an assistant head coach, this is part of
a great start of a dream come true for the best postseason experience for all
of our student‑athletes, not just at Washington State, but a lot of the other
great programs.  
So I just want to thank them. It's great to open up the Seattle Times and see
all the headlines for women's basketball. This is a long time coming, and what
a great start for the Pac‑12 and the Storm and everybody the commissioner has
put together for this. We're looking forward to coming back and staying a
little bit longer next year. Thank you.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Michael Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24819)

### [Cassie Harberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24821)

### [Christina Marinacci](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24853)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Cal  78  
USC  59

  
COACH COOPER: Opening statements, whew. It feels like all year long, but to
really play against a number two ranked team. They really came out and
established their game very early. I felt like they put us on our heels early,
and we were never able to recover.  
But before I go on, I just want to give a lot of why to these two young
ladies, especially Christina Marinacci. When I first went to USC, she was my
lone freshman there in a sense. And to have her play four years with her is
such a disheartening feeling that she's going to be gone. But we've had great
times together. And I think USC has definitely prepared her for life after
basketball. But for the time being, she has a life with basketball because
she's going to go on and do some great things. I know this hurts, 9, but I
want to thank you for your effort and your maturity and the things that you've
brought to our club and helped our young players get to this point.  
But, again, I tip our hats to that Cal team. They're a very good basketball
team. I'm proud of my team too.  
  
Q. After playing Cal two games reasonably close this season, this one got
away. What was the reason it got away from you?  
COACH COOPER: The biggest thing was toughness. I thought they were a lot
tougher on those boards. What did we give up? 22 offensive rebounds. When
we've done that to teams and we've done it this year, we've been successful.
And they were committed. They were committed to showing us that they were the
tougher team. But, still, we banged around, but you're not going to win too
many games when you're giving up those type of points and those type of points
in the paint.  
  
Q. Cassie, can you talk about today's game and the difference between the
close games that you've played with them and what happened today?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: I think like Coach Coop said was their physicality and being
tough. They came out and gave us a bunch, and we kind of fell flat on our butt
and we didn't respond. So that's really what we need to do. We need to come
out and focus and throw the first punch. We need to be aggressive. We just
didn't do that tonight.  
  
Q. Cassie, as a follow up, this season as a whole, were there a lot of
frustrations this season? Were there a lot of moments where it felt like it
was frustrating?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Right. I think there were. I mean, we were pretty young to
begin with, so that was kind of tough. Just getting the freshman experience,
but I think that's vital for them especially going into next year. But as we
had our downs, we also had our ups. We had a lot of good half of basketball
games. I think if we're 19‑4 or something, we just need to put 2‑2 together,
and we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Christina, what's it like mixing it up on the boards with Cal's post
players? What's that like?  
CHRISTINA MARINACCI: For me, I kind of look at Cal as more of our rivals than
UCLA. Every time we play them has been a battle. Those are the games I've
enjoyed. I played with Gennifer Brandon since eighth grade, going to Nike
skills camp, playing in the McDonald's game and all that stuff. We just go at
it with each other, and it's fun. Looking at the score sheet in the game, I
don't know if I'll play her again. But I look forward to playing Cal. It's fun
to have that competitive kind of game on the boards and stuff like that. I tip
my hat to her. She's a very difficult person to box out. She moves without the
ball very well. I also learned from her. But I've always enjoyed it, and
always looked forward to playing Cal. It's just tough to have my last game as
a loss against them, but it's all good. I wish them the best of luck.  
COACH COOPER: You'll see that one again. Whether it's overseas or in the WNBA.  
CHRISTINA MARINACCI: I want to see her somewhere. Even in a pick‑up game
outside (laughing).  
  
Q. How do you plan on renewing yourselves as far as USC goes?  
COACH COOPER: We have a lot of work we have to do. Obviously recruiting is
going to be very important. But we have a great foundation of young players
that are going to be a lot better, a year older next year. I think Ariya will
be a big piece. Cassie has been the foundation of everything we've tried to
implement and build on, and Kate Oliver will be back. So our players are going
to be a year older and a lot better.  
  
Q. If you can just look ahead to the NCAA Tournament, how far do you think
this Cal team can go?  
COACH COOPER: I think they can make it to the Elite 8. There is still some
roughness about them. I don't think they're a good perimeter shooting team.
But as you step up in the level of play, you're going to get against some
people that can rebound with you and bang with you and the other parts of your
game are going to have to be important.  
I think we did a good job today on Clarendon, holding her down. And she is the
perimeter factor for them. They've got a great inside attack, but she's able
to get the easy jump shots for them. Boyd, Jemerigbe, Pierre are questionable
shooters as you step up in talent, your weaknesses are going to be magnified.  
  
Q. Christina, can you talk a little about ending your career with USC?  
CHRISTINA MARINACCI: It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but
I don't regret it one bit. I know we didn't make it to the NCAA Tournament in
my four years of being here. But knowing that and looking back to when I was a
senior in high school, given the opportunity to go somewhere else once there
was a coaching change, I still would have come here. I've had such a great
experience playing under Coach Cooper with these kind of girls. I've played
with Cassie since high school on club teams. You know, yeah we weren't as
successful in basketball, but I've learned a lot. It's given me an opportunity
to play overseas, and it's also set me up for life when basketball's over. We
have a great communications school, and I want to go into sports broadcasting.
That is another thing I learned from Coach Coop as well, since he has a
background in sports broadcasting and like that.  
So times like these are rough, but I've had a great experience, and I don't
regret anything. I came to work every day at practice, and you know in the we
didn't make it, but I would still choose this jersey if I looked back on it in
high school. So fight on, I guess.  
COACH COOPER: She cleans up very nice. She was a sideline reporter at the
Espies. I didn't even recognize her. I was walking on the red carpet, and she
was going Coach, Coach. And I was like who is calling me? And it was
Christina.  
We want to thank everyone for coming out. It's been such a lovely time in
Seattle, and a great venue for women's college basketball, and we're hoping
all the teams the best. Thank you very much.

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Jasmine Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24857)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

UCLA  54  
Utah  43

  
COACH CLOSE: Well, first of all, thank you, media, for being here. It's really
big for our game, so I want to thank you for your coverage of our tournament.
Boy, survive and advance, you know. We've got to be excited to play the next
game. I thought we did a good job on the defensive side of the court, and we
held them. And they shot well yesterday, and I thought we limited their
three‑point opportunities until late in the game. They got a few open looks.  
But we always preach the defense and rebounding will hold you when you have a
poor offensive game. Our defense and our rebounding is with us, and we're
thankful to be able to play another day.  
  
Q. Cori, they made a run at you, went ahead, and you were able to close it
out. Just talk to me about that last segment there?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think it comes down to you have great senior leadership.
I thought we were very calm. Actually we called timeout and sort of
regathered.  
I think they don't have any panic in them. You have seniors that have been
through the worst, and I think everyone looks to them. Our team has
established who and when it gets toughest. When the pressure rises, who do you
look to? And everyone on our team said Jasmine Dixon. She brings a calm to our
team. Just to have people like that to look to, I think was an emotional
thing. It wasn't a tactical thing. It's really a credit to experienced players
making hard choices and being trustworthy for their team.  
  
Q. Is there anything you learned about California the first two times you
played them to help you tomorrow?  
COACH CLOSE: There is good news and there is bad news. The good news is it's
not a difficult scouting report. The bad news is it's very difficult to love
out. We said to our team, be physical and rebound and then be physical some
more and rebound some more. It was really going to come down to that. It's
going to come down to possessions. Who can establish the paint? Who can make a
few jumpers? Both teams would like to use their size to control the paint, get
the ball inside, get higher percentage shots.  
It's going to be guard plays. Who can make some outside jumpers and make
people extend? Then who can dominate the possession game, which is taking care
of the basketball and rebounding the basketball. I think both coaches would
say it's pretty simple; it's just really hard to do. It's going to take a
relentless spirit and it's a competitive nature. It's going to be a
phenomenally competitive game, and we're excited to have the opportunity to
play in it.  
  
Q. Jasmine, when you went out, what did it change for you guys what did you
feel like you had to do to compensate for that?  
JASMINE DIXON: I felt like all of our post players had to step up and have her
back, and we have to do whatever it took for us to win. She knew we had her
back whenever she went out. She just took her time and got right.

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Brittany Boyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23421)

### [Gennifer Brandon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23420)

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Cal  78  
USC  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement and then questions.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thanks, everyone, for being here. We love Seattle so far. I
think this event is first rate, so I'm really happy that you're all here to
cover it. This is a really good win for us. I know it sounds kind of vague,
but we wanted to come out here and play Cal basketball, and I think that was
on display. We were terrific on the boards. I think our defense kick started
everything. I think our players were aggressive on offense, despite the fact
that USC tried to slow us down and sag a little bit, I think we stayed
aggressive. That team has a lot of really talented players. We've had two very
close games with them.  
So I thought that our players were very focused. I thought they were sharp.
And this is a rally good win for us in a match‑up that we didn't think was
going to be easy, and I thought our players took it to another level and I'm
happy to get the win and move on.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you did have two close games with them. What do you think? Their
rebounding margin certainly sticks out. Do you think that's the difference in
a game that was not as close as the first two games that you played?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think that's always the big difference for us. I think
it's one of the things that makes us a good team, and USC in the second game
made it a point of saying we're going to neutralize the boards. Obviously,
Gennifer had the ridiculous rebounding game, and they said we're not going to
leave those post players. They helped with Brittany's kid and Layshia, and
Afure's kid. So we were a little more ready for that. Also credit the will of
in particular tonight of Talia and Gen, but our post group. They just said
we're not going to be denied. That was really good.  
And I thought Brittany and Eliza and Afure really sharp with the looks on
offense, and that took some pressure off Layshia. So the rebounding was a huge
difference for us in a game where it's not easy for us to out‑rebound them
because they're pretty good on the boards too.  
  
Q. Lindsay, what was this week like, I guess, handling the accolades of
sharing the conference title? How did you think your team handled kind of all
that attention being on them coming out here today?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I can say they impress me more every day. The win last weekend
in Seattle was really fun. This team has every day focused on only the game in
front of us and the next thing and the next task. Then all of a sudden,
winning that game was a genuine show of emotion since their first time doing
it. It was true and really neat.  
Then at the same time, I think we were able to appreciate that moment and move
on quickly, there wasn't ever a feeling from anyone in our Locker room that
that's enough. That we've arrived. They have stayed hungry.  
This week because Oregon State and USC sort of play us the same on the
defensive end, we worked a lot on our own offense and doing the things we want
to do. We tried to prep a little for both defensively, so we'd be ready in a
quick turnaround. But really it was making sure that we were focused, fresh
physically and also sharp physically.  
But we have great leadership and the rest of the team follows our seniors, and
everyone was locked in after the smiles and everything of last weekend.  
  
Q. Brittany, despite the relatively comfortable margin you won by, what do
you think you still need to work on as a team to advance here and beyond?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Well, we can always get better from here. That is defense,
offense, rebounding, everything is always you go out there and see how good we
played tonight, and we can only go up. So I just feel like everything just
keep going, doing what we have to do, and trying to perfect what we're trying
to do. We can only go up from here.  
  
Q. Gennifer, can you talk about yesterday, Ariya Crook from USC said the
focus on their team was going to be to block you off of the offensive glass.
If it took five players to do so, they were going to do that. Well, that
didn't work. Can you talk a little about matching up with USC and how this
game was different than in the past?  
GENNIFER BRANDON: Well, USC is always a physical game, so as a team we just
tried to, not only my assists in, but also tried to be above it. I knew they
were going to try to block me out, so I just tried to slither my way through
and be ready for after they shoot just be ready to go get the rebound anyway I
could.  
  
Q. Brittany, you took a couple of spills. How do you feel after that?  
BRITTANY BOYD: I'm perfectly fine. It hurt a little bit, but I'm fine.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: She's never taken out the ref before. She falls a lot, but she
took Anita out with her.  
  
Q. I asked Michael Cooper how far he thought you could go in the NCAA
Tournament, and he said the Elite 8. He said you still have some roughness to
your team, and not a great perimeter shooting team. Is that a fair evaluation,
or are you going to go after him right now?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: It doesn't really concern me what Michael Cooper thinks of our
team. I think we can always shoot the ball better. I want to look at a stat
line and see we're shooting 50%. I appreciate people that know basketball, and
I certainly don't think we're a flawless team and we want to get better. I
think every team would say the same thing.  
But we're going to be happy to hopefully play again tomorrow in this
tournament, and the goal is to be playing Sunday, and to look forward to the
NCAA Tournament and just happy to be in that position.  
  
Q. Lindsay, to be fair to Coop, he also said the difference today was
toughness. That you guys were a much tougher team. Can you talk about your
team's toughness today?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: These young women are incredible. They have the best smiles
off the court. They're fun. They'll dance. But you get between those lines on
the basketball court, and they are just‑‑ they rise to every occasion and
they're really tough.  
They're not dirty. We take a lot of contact, and we just know how to battle
with anyone, and that is from our point guard to our five player to our last
person on the bench. It's a collective resolve, and they just get it done.  
And I told them today to play through not getting calls. To play through some
physicality from the other team that we know is coming, and I am just
impressed by them and their ability to battle physically on the court and to
stay mentally really strong.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Mollee Schwegler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24818)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

OREGON STATE  57  
USC - 64

  
SCOTT RUECK: Just really proud of our team. Congratulations to USC for playing
a great game and getting the win. I'm proud of our team for battling, just
like they've been all year. We finished playing the best basketball of the
season, went toe to toe with everybody, had opportunities to beat two ranked
teams, but unfortunately didn't have enough to finish today, but couldn't be
prouder of our group.  
  
Q. Could you have done a better job of getting to the rack today?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's been somehow our Achilles heel all year. It's new
territory for me; my teams are always opposite. Only one out of my last ten
years being a head coach we were at a differential where we're in the lesser
half. So this year it was just strange, to be honest with you.  
But the game summed up our season, not being able to get there, and somehow we
haven't been able to keep our opponents from getting there.  
  
Q. You had one good spurt in the middle of the first half, but then in the
second half three different offensive spurts. Why were you able to have more
success in the second half?  
MOLLEE SCHWEGLER: I think we just came out more confident and just came out
trying to knock down shots and just willing the ball into the hoop, playing
better defense, getting stops and making it easier for our shots to fall.  
  
Q. Was there anything you figured out first half, though? Were you able to
get better looks or anything like that that helped your confidence the second
half?  
MOLLEE SCHWEGLER: Well, in the first half we were kind of sloppy and we
weren't very fluid on offense, and in the second half we just cleaned that up
and it made for better looks and easier to make shots.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any thoughts on that?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I thought she did a great job pushing the ball the second
half. We got out in the open court a little bit more and that created some
good looks for us early in the shot clock, got them on their heels a little
bit. I thought our post did a great job freeing up Jamie. Jamie was able to
get some more looks and be a creator a little bit more in the second half. I
thought the team really executed well, saw the floor and played with just a
different level of urgency on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that this is kind of typical for your season. How do
you take this and try to get over the hump and go forward for next year?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, we're young overall. We have a few seniors that have done a
great job for us, but this group in large part is freshmen, sophomores, and
those are the players getting a lot of experience. In the offseason it's
important that those players continue to develop their game and their
confidence so that they can be closers for us. And you need that player in a
tight game, and that's what we've been missing a little bit this year.  
I see it evolving, though, and I think this team early in the year, the
defense was really our issue, and we finished‑‑ they shot 29 percent today and
somehow beat us. We've been really turned into a lockdown defensive team down
the stretch, which I'm really proud of them for. Now, it's going to be
exciting to watch the improvement in our young kids as they come back next
year with a year under their belt of experience, with the confidence to close
and the game to close, and I see that happening.  
  
Q. You talked about the leadership of this team. The way Mollee stepped up
and nailed some of those threes today, what happened there?  
SCOTT RUECK: It was so fun to watch. You know, you don't see a lot of 5'6"
players in the Pac‑12, and this is a big‑time success story sitting next to
me, and I'm so proud of her. I can relate in a lot of ways to Mollee. Here she
is in the limelight, playing at the highest level that there is besides
professional.  
Finally, in my opinion, just believing that she truly belongs. Night in and
night out she had to get over the hurdle of believing she could defend at this
level, and so she's learned to survive that and that's allowed her to be on
the court, and she's certainly our best playmaker. And when she's going, she's
got the ability to knock down big shots from deep.  
This is an outstanding basketball player I'm sitting next to. So fun to watch
her over the past month. It's really just been hard work and just a
consistency that have allowed her to be this confident, and I know these
experiences over the past month she's going to carry with her for the rest of
her life, and I'm so proud of her for that.  
  
Q. For much of the game it seemed like Cassie Harberts was really kind of
controlling things.  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, she's great. She's got, how many free throws? 18 free throw
attempts. The first time we played them, 20. To be honest, I thought we did a
good job on her. She's tough to defend. We sent a couple people at her and she
still found a way to get there. Yeah, 3 for 9 from the field and finishes with
16. I don't know, I thought we did a good job, and that's what great players
do, they find a way.

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Anthony Levrets](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21838)

### [Michelle Plouffe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21840)

### [Taryn Wicijowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20576)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

ARIZONA  48  
UTAH - 66

  
COACH LEVRETS: Really, really happy with our performance today. I thought our
kids ‑‑ first half, we shot the ball really, really well‑‑ when you don't make
as many shots, which we didn't in the second half but we continued to defend
and rebound the next two well enough down the stretch and really, really
pleased with our overall performance today.  
  
Q. You hit 11 3s in the first half; any explanation in particular?  
COACH LEVRETS: All year long, we thought the strength of this team is that we
have really good post players, and we are not the most athletic team on the
perimeter but we have the ability to make 3s and we went through a stretch
there where we didn't shoot really well, but we think that's a big strength of
this team.  
I was surprised when we didn't make them early in the year during that
stretch, and you don't ever expect to make 11 out of 13 like that, just crazy.
But we think we are a good shooting basketball team, when they double‑team
down inside with our bigs, they are both great passers. In that first half, it
was Taryn that was doubled a bunch and she made the right read and we make an
extra pass and move the ball; we think we are a good shooting team.  
  
Q. Taryn, you're a post player and obviously you didn't take many 3s. What
was going through your mind when every three was going?  
TARYN WICIJOWSKI: I was getting pretty pumped because a lot of it was coming
through me. Like they had small (ph) guarding me and they would bring another
person to double‑team off that. People were just wide open and just knocking
down the wide open shots.  
  
Q. Michelle, you told me earlier this week that the shots would have to fall
in order to beat this team. How big was the basket for and you your teammates
the first half? How big did it look?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I don't know, I think just once Rachel or I just started
hitting one, everyone got confidence. And then we just feed off each other on
the court and feed off everybody's shots, so I think that really gave us
momentum in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, have you ever had 33 of 44 first half points coming from behind
the line?  
COACH LEVRETS: I don't think so, no. It was amazing. I knew we were making a
lot and then I saw the stats and I couldn't believe it. You know, and it was
everybody.  
But the key is, moving the basketball, and sharing the basketball and being
willing to make an extra pass to a teammate and trusting your teammate is
going to make the shot, and we were really‑‑ we have improved at that a ton as
the year has gone on.  
  
Q. Talk about your defense on Davellyn. Tough assignment for any player.  
COACH LEVRETS: Davellyn Whyte is as good of a guard as you're going to come
across; she can flat play, and Awa did a gerat job on her. I know she got 23
points, but she had to work for every single thing that she got. I think she
was 6 for 18 from the floor. But a credit to Davellyn, too, is she did
everything. I think she had eight rebounds and six assists to go along with;
she's just a great player.  
Just as importantly as the defense on Davellyn was, everybody else guarding
their person and not letting‑‑ because Davellyn is going to score. You can't
get the other people go big and that was the key. The kids did a great job
with it.  
  
Q. I don't know what the final free throw total was, but it wasn't much for
Utah. Is that something you need to address going forward is getting to the
foul line and slowing the tempo down when you're playing a team like UCLA who
is a very talented group?  
COACH LEVRETS: Yeah, maybe I need to yell at the officials more. (Chuckling).  
A lot of that was a product of them playing a lot of zone, so a lot of our
stuff came from the perimeter, and there was not a lot of drives because it
was against the zone, and so that's why we didn't have the free throw attempts
tonight.  
We'll see how we get played tomorrow, and obviously we played through our
bigs; and if it's man, we'll get it down there and we'll get to the free throw
line more. I think this was more a product of how Arizona played than it was
anything else.  
  
Q. Besides getting 113 ‑pointers in the first half, what do you guys need to
do to beat UCLA?   
COACH LEVRETS: I don't know yet. We are going to figure that out tonight. We
have been really focused on this game, talking about one possession at a time,
one play at a time, one minute at a time, one segment at a time, one game at a
time, and now we'll worry about UCLA.  
The first time we played them we were kind of a mess. It was our fourth game
on the road; we played Cal, Stanford, USC, UCLA back‑to‑back‑to‑back‑to‑back
on the road without Taryn. So we were kind of a mess, and this will be a big
challenge for us.  
But you know, we feel like we have a good team. We think we are playing pretty
well right now, and we'll go put something together, a game plan together here
tonight. And I don't know yet, I haven't even thought about it until 20
minutes ago.  
  
Q. Five turnovers, a record ‑‑ that has to be pretty cool.   
TARYN WICIJOWSKI: I know for us, we always talk about turnovers, if we don't
turn the ball over and we play good D, like we should have a really good
chance to win, especially against this team. Like the last time we played
them, we turned the ball over a lot and just given them points. I think today,
not turning the ball over and really making them work, have a lot of
possessions and stuff like that, really helped us.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yes, it's definitely something we addressed, to pass, and we
did change it. So we had a good game plan and that helped us out getting the
ball to the floor and then we were able to move the ball and play our offense
without having to have ‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ the backcourt.  
  
Q. How nice was it to see Rachel and Danielle chipping in? Obviously Rachel
is a senior but Danielle a freshmen, being able to handle that stage and
everyone played their roles.  
COACH LEVRETS: Yeah, it was great. We talk about it all the time: When it's
your turn, you've got to make shots. And everybody, the way they defended us,
everybody had an opportunity tonight.  
And the thing that all those kids can do, every one of them in our program, is
they can shoot the basketball. And when it's their turn, they have got to be
able to step up and knock it down. When we do that, it's kind of fun to watch
us play offensively. The ball moves really well and we played from inside out,
it's kind of fun to watch and hopefully this will be a confidence‑booster for
us.  
I think we're playing with a lot of confidence now, anyway, and winning is
fun. Win, and get to keep playing. Don't think about if you're lose, you done.
If you win, you keep playing and that's what we're going to try to do
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What kind of problems does UCLA present?  
COACH LEVRETS: Lots of problems, because they are really talented. But, so are
we. And I think their bigs are stronger, athletic, they shoot it really well
and they are good at inside and out. And defensively they can harass you in
several different ways. Other than that, they are pretty easy to beat.
(Laughter).  
I don't know yet what we are going to do. Early in the year when we played
them, we were not in any‑‑ not close to what we are right now defensively, so
I think we'll‑‑ it might be a really base game for us, might be a few things
that we do differently but it will be a really base game defensively. And then
we'll run what we run and see how they guard us and that's the great thing
about being a motion team; you can run your stuff any night against any kind
of defense and hopefully do different things based on how you're playing.  
  
Q. What did you learn the first time you played UCLA?  
COACH LEVRETS: That they are good.  
  
Q. About your group.  
COACH LEVRETS: Well, we battled. We were down 16‑2 I think to start the game,
and we beat USC the Friday night before; it was a noon game. It was just
weird. And not having Taryn obviously was a huge piece for us.  
. So that game was gone and over with, I don't even know if we'll use it as
far as what we'll watch. We'll match more of what they have done lately. But
we'll put something together.  
These kids, we have talented players. They are going to come out and compete
tomorrow and I don't know what the outcome is going to be, but I know we are
going to compete.

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

OREGON  62  
WASHINGTON - 69

  
COACH McGUFF: We obviously did not get off to a very good start, but give
Oregon credit, they were ready to go from the jump. And our defense was bad
and they really made us pay. They made shots, and they played really, really
well early on and we got down obviously 22 points.  
But, I'm really proud of our team for staying together. We showed a lot of
resiliency tonight, and for about ten minutes to go in the first half through
the second half, I thought we played really hard defensively. We were
aggressive on offense and got great shots.  
And then, you know, we finished off a lot of possessions with rebounds.  
  
Q. How important was making the deficit more manageable before halftime?  
COACH McGUFF: You know, one of the things that I think when you get down like
that, the most important thing is to make sure that we understand, there's no
20‑point play. We have to go possession by possession. That's what our players
finally started to see.  
When we got down a little bit, we were rushing shots on offense and trying to
get it all back at once. Once we got settled in and got them believing in
possession by possession, play great defense, finish it with rebounds and then
come aggressively in transition to the offensive end, then we started to kind
of get ourselves going.  
But I think the end of the first half was critically important because I think
we started to finally believe that if we just kept going the way we were going
that we win the game.  
  
Q. Jazmine, with the game opening up like that, the way they were shooting
the 3, is it reminiscent the last time you played ‑‑  
JAZMINE DAVIS: Yeah, you could say that. Oregon is a good team. When they come
out, they are on fire and they are on fire for a really long time.  
Like Coach said, it was just a matter of staying together during that time,
all Kristi was staying: It's okay, we are fine, down 22, we're fine, it's
okay. And you know what, that's what we did, we stayed together.  
  
Q. Did you actually believe Kristi or was there a little part of you that
said, no, I don't know.  
JAZMINE DAVIS: No, no, it was really early in the game, so I believed. I
believed Kristi. And when you get down like that, you don't ever want to
think, oh, no, we're done. You don't ever want to think that and I don't think
for a second any of us thought that.  
We just thought, okay, we need to pull it together, we need to make that extra
pass, get a little more ball movement and that's what we did and we came out
with the win.  
  
Q. Jazmine, what was the biggest difference for you between the first half
and the second half?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: First half, I would say we just started off a little slow.
Concentration wasn't really there to start the game. It just made everything
that we lacked or just had the first half ‑‑ but late in the first half, we
gave it back a little bit and then coming into the second half, we didn't turn
it off.  
Once we got that momentum ending the first half, we just came into the second
half, let's go, we are on fire, keep the intensity up and pass that energy and
that's what we did.  
  
Q. Aminah, what does a game like this mean for you and the team?  
AMINAH WILLIAMS: Well, for us, it means a lot. It shows that we were able to
play through adversity, we stayed together as a team, and we fought on both
ends of the floor and I think that is why we were able to come back because we
stayed together as a team.  
  
Q. The man ‑to‑man‑‑  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah, we started off the game mixing man and zone, and just we
were not playing with enough energy in zone and we were giving up too many 3s
and they were making us pay.  
We went to playing all man‑to‑man, and I certainly thought that was much more
effective for us, and kind of allowed us to start that run and climb back into
the game.  
I think what it did is it allowed us to string together a few stops and when
we did that, then we were able to get out in transition offense, because they
were making so many shots, we couldn't get in transition. It was all
half‑court for us. Once we started getting some stops and man‑to‑man and
allowed us to get going the other way aggressively.  
  
Q. With the tournament in Seattle, how beneficial is that when you're trying
to come back?  
COACH McGUFF: It was great. I think No.1, overall, I think it was a great day
for the tournament. Karen and everybody have done an outstanding job working
really hard. It's very organized. The hotel has been great. The fans were
great tonight.  
And to your point, I thought just having as many Washington fans as we had
here was a big part of us, kind of gave that momentum there late in the first
half.  
It obviously was a little bit different because of the venue, but especially
like in a game like that where we are down, everybody is sitting there like,
how is this going to go. Once we started to come back, I could really feel the
energy in the building. It was really neat and I thought that was a big deal
for our players.  
  
Q. The second half, you had a driving layup that seemed like you were just
determined to score.  
JAZMINE DAVIS: Yeah, the second half, we had one thing and it was, you can get
to the basket and to the basket if you can't pass it out. I thought us driving
instead of just stake being outside shots was a lot more effective because we
were getting to the basket. That's all I could think was get to the basket.  
  
Q. Talia hit a huge three with about a minute left on her time ‑out. Was
that a drawn‑out play?  
COACH McGUFF: Not exactly. We had something drawn up and then the kind of play
after the play was going to be drive it and pitch it. That's a great thing
about Talia, she has a very short memory. It's one of the things that makes
her a special player is she can miss a couple shots, and she knows that the
next one is going in. And I think that's a great example right there is she
hit an absolutely huge shot there, and I thought that was the shot that kind
of put the nail in the coffin for them.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Michael Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24819)

### [Ariya Crook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24820)

### [Cassie Harberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24821)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

OREGON STATE  57  
USC - 64

  
MICHAEL COOPER: Opening statement, we want to tip our hats to Oregon State.
That was a very well‑coached basketball team. We knew we were going to have to
come play one of our better games. I didn't know we were going to have to
shoot that many free throws, but they were a team that made us work for
everything. I thought our defense was very good because we took away Gibson
and Weisner for them. That was one of our focuses, limit the three‑point
attempts and we were able to do that, and we were successful to win.  
  
Q. Kind of a contrasting style, they were getting most of their points from
the perimeter. Did you feel as the game went on that that would win out,
wearing them down in the paint?  
MICHAEL COOPER: Well, we felt that we had the advantage down there, and we
didn't want to force it so much because we've got some pretty good perimeter
shooters, one sitting to my right here. We did want to get the ball inside and
create offense for ourselves, whether it was scoring in the paint or getting
it down there and then kicking it back out.  
  
Q. Ariya, you really came out, 11 points in the first half, averaging 15 per
game. How do you feel about your performance today?  
ARIYA CROOK: I think I did pretty well. I saw that Cassie was struggling the
first half, and I just thought that with my energy and my speed that I feel
like I could get the momentum for her to start going, but it didn't happen,
and she started getting her run in the second half, and that's my role is to
do.  
MICHAEL COOPER: These two young ladies have carried us all season long. We've
asked a lot of them and it's been grueling, but it's nice to see that our
teammates stepped up. But these two here are really the main thing we are
looking for. Cassie inside, Crook outside and we ask the other players just
for them two to make other players better.  
Although they're doing all the scoring, it's really their teammates that are
helping them get their shot.  
  
Q. Cassie, you've been a stand ‑out player all year. How have you enjoyed it
so far? Obviously this one helps. How has the experience been when you step
out on the floor? Is it, oh, shoot, I'm in the Pac‑12 tournament or just
another game?   
CASSIE HARBERTS: For me it's another game, but this game counts a lot more
than the others. You know, one‑and‑done, so I just decided to come out and do
the same thing I do every night, and like Ariya said, I didn't have the best
first half of the year, and I think my teammates were phenomenal in stepping
up and carrying the load for me.  
  
Q. Was it just a matter of them being physical with you?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Right, I think I've dealt with physicality all year, so that
wasn't really a surprise. But I've had a tendency to fadeaway jump shot all
year, and I think I really tried to take it into them, and I think we fouled
out three or four of their players. I tend to get to the line a lot, and I try
to step up and knock them down.  
  
Q. You obviously have a very hot opponent coming into tomorrow's game, Cal.
What are your thoughts on them? What are you guys going to do to take them
down?  
ARIYA CROOK: Well, first of all, we want to try to give Gennifer Brandon as
least offensive rebounds as we can because, she's their number one rebounder
and we need to box her out, and if we need all five of us to box her out,
that's what we're going to do.  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Personally I'm looking for redemption. Both the games we've
had this year were close, whether it was at home or at their place. We just
need to step up and finish off the game instead of giving it right back to
them.  
MICHAEL COOPER: From a coach's standpoint I think the team could be a
signature win for us, but the important thing is we've got to come out and
compete for 40 minutes. The first time we played them, we competed for half a
game and then the second time I thought they came into our place and really
imposed their will on us. So this will be on a neutral court. It's going to be
a very exciting game, and I'm looking forward to it.  
We want to thank all the throngs of people for coming out here this evening.
It's always a joy to see everyone.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Mariah Cooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24832)

### [June Daugherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23417)

### [Lia Galdeira](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24831)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

ARIZONA STATE  41  
WASHINGTON STATE - 48

  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Opening statement was it was a great game, second half
especially. We told the kids at halftime, just to keep playing great defense
and we'll start making shots. That's what happened.  
And the other opening statement is, June is out of surgery and doing well.  
  
Q. What did you say to these kids at halftime, and what do you say going up
against a team like Stanford?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: What we told them at halftime was we are playing great
defense. The toughest team is going to win this game, and you know, if you
guys just stay with it, the ball will start going in. Pretty much all that
came true.  
What we tell them when we go play Stanford is, it doesn't matter who the best
team is. What matter s is who is the best team on that day. If we are the best
team tomorrow, then we'll win it. And if we're not, we'll go home. I mean,
we're excited to play them. You know, we've got a game plan, hopefully it's a
better game plan than the one we had last week when we played them, and we'll
see if it works.  
The biggest thing with Stanford is you have to make shots. You've got to
out‑score them. You're not going to stop them. They are too talented. Every
time June and I have beaten them, it's because we out‑scored them. So we are
going to have make shots tomorrow.  
And we can get shots, but just we are going to have to make them.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the situation withJune? Was there any
question that you would go ahead and coach tonight or did you think about
going to the hospital with her?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, right after shootaround today, she asked the doctor,
she was in pain, and she asked the doctor to come look at her. Our team
doctor, Dr.Garcia, game up, examined her, and said that "I think it might be
appendicitis. And I think you need to go to the hospital to check and make
sure that's what it is."  
At that point, I went and got a taxi, and I was going with her until she told
me not to. And I just do whatever she says. She said: "No, you stay here with
the team in case I have to stay at the hospital." So I did that and she said,
win the game, and so we did that. (Laughter).  
You know, I'm good. I've been listening to her for 24 years. You know, it goes
on and on.  
  
Q. Is there any word on whether she's going to be able to return tomorrow?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, I hope so, because I want to retire 1‑0\. I'd like to
go out undefeated, you know, and then that assures that, no matter whether we
beat Stanford or not.  
But they say the procedure is one that you can go home the next day, and
knowing my wife, if she can comeback to the hotel, she'll be on the sideline
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Your team got hot; can you talk a little about maybe ‑‑ was the basket
open for you?   
LIA GALDEIRA: Actually, my team, during halftime, like Mike said, whatever
June says, he does. And whatever Mike, June and Brian tells me to do, I do it,
and then I give credit to my team. Works that way.  
  
Q. Your first experience in a setting like this, was it fun to be in this
kind of a tournament atmosphere?  
LIA GALDEIRA: It was fun. I remember watching this when I was a little kid,
and now I'm here. It's fun, cool.  
  
Q. What was going on today with June, was that a distraction at all? Did
that affect you guys coming out to start the game maybe?  
MARIAH COOKS: Motivation, yeah, like, of course, you know, we are here and we
are going to be kind of riled up, and our nerves kind of got the best of us
the first half I would say, just offensively. But we used June as motivation
just to push us like Lia said.  
  
Q. It was still a close game, can you take me through that little burst
there; what was working for you at that point?  
MARIAH COOKS: Just playing with patience, that's what works best for me is
just when I'm able to kind of just see where my defender is and make whatever
move I need to, so I had to do it for my team.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Niya Butts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21931)

### [Davellyn Whyte](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21932)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

ARIZONA  48  
UTAH - 66

  
COACH BUTTS: Obviously it's a tough loss. Third time playing that team this
year, and they really get the best of us. They came out and shot the ball
really well the first half. We were able to make some plays inside. They
cooled off in the second half, but so did we. We didn't have enough punch to
get it done.  
We are still well in the tournament, and for us, we have a couple of seniors
that are going to be moving on and wish them well. But outside of that, we
just have to go back to the drawing board.  
  
Q. What was the difference tonight?  
COACH BUTTS: Well, they just, again, you know, you're playing a team for the
third time, sometimes it's difficult. But they shot the ball really well,
especially in the first half. I think they shot 57 percent from the field, and
77 overall from the 3, and it proved to be too much for us to come back from
in the second half, especially; we didn't shoot the ball especially well in
the second half. But they played a great game and again we just didn't have
enough to get it done.  
  
Q. Can you assess the finish here? I know you had a rough ending to the
season. Can you just talk a little bit about this?  
COACH BUTTS: It is what you said it was. It was a roughening‑‑ and you know,
we didn't do some things well that we needed to do to win games down the
stretch, and we didn't get enough production.  
I think we had to have more players step up and make plays for us, offensively
and defensively. At the end of the day, we didn't do enough, and teams were
able to rebound with us and they were able to be more physical than us. We
didn't win enough 50/50 plays throughout the season.  
  
Q. Davellyn, you had such an unbelievable career here, how do you feel now
about your performance and where do you go from here?  
DAVELLYN WHYTE: I don't think it's really hit me that I'm done here, so I'm
kind of letting it settle in. But like Coach said, it's not over. So I'm going
to keep working out and doing what I have to do and see where it takes me.  
  
Q. You had Eva attached to your hip throughout the night. What kind of
problems did she present for you defensively, having an athletic point guard
like her guarding you for 40 minutes, seems like it would be a difficult task
for any player.  
DAVELLYN WHYTE: In the first half, it wasn't that difficult. I mean, I kind of
forced her to do what I wanted her to do but in the second half she adjusted
and knew what I wanted to do. She's quick but I'm a little stronger than her,
so I just had to use my strength and my smartness and work off her.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

ARIZONA STATE  41  
WASHINGTON STATE - 48

  
COACH THORNE: Well, we had our offensive struggles all year long, and we just
needed to play 40 minutes of defensive rebounding, and unfortunately we did
not do that. We played a good 20 minutes and then we faded and let Galdeira
get going and gave their post the lead to post up. Disappointing but just
lessons learned for a very young team on our end, and looking forward to
coming back next year with a roster at full strength.  
  
Q. What were you seeing open inside there tonight?  
JANAE FULCHER: Honestly, whatever the defense gave us, we had them wide open
and defensively just tried to take advantage of thatand sometimes we didn't,
but took pretty much whatever they gave us.  
  
Q. Having played them twice before, what did you think you might be able
tolook into ‑‑  
COACH THORNE: We really couldn't finish shots. We just struggled. That's been
our Achilles' heel pretty much all year, especially in Pac‑12 is just, are we
going to make shots.  
Obviously again, we are a bit limited offensively, but Janae has done a great
job for us all year, but we don't have anybody else consistently really
scoring for us.  
We needed to knock down some shots and finish a little bit better, play
through the physicality of the game better, which we had not done, and take a
little better care of the ball. We squandered too many possessions. You hold a
team to 48 points, you should win. Our goal is around 55 and we should be able
to get more than that if we are executing offense and taking care of the ball,
getting second shots. And we didn't execute well. Did not execute well.  
And a lot of our not scoring is not even so much that our players can't put
the ball in the basket. It's just the lack of‑‑ poor leadership and just
people doing what they are supposed to be doing. We are not reading things
correctly. We are not running things correctly a lot. It just makes it
difficult to score. So they know it. We know it. It's just a very, very young
and inexperienced team learning the hard way.  
  
Q. As a person who has been part of the tournament since 2002, can you talk
a little bit about the atmosphere today, in comparison to the past?  
COACH THORNE: Absolutely, yeah. I think obviously we aren't going to stay
around very long, but I'm excited that Karen and the Seattle Storm wanted this
tournament and I know you can just feel‑‑ you obviously feel the Washington
fans; we had to play a Washington team, but they came out. In general, I feel
like we have had probably better atmosphere than we've had in a while; and on
early games and on games in the first day, we've never really had that.  
So I'm very encouraged. This is a great city. I coached at UW for two years
and we out drew the men the two years I was there. It's got great tradition
for loving women's basketball, and for that I'm very excited that it's here
and I know that the Storm and everybody is going to continue to do a great job
and we look forward to being back next year. I want to thank everybody that's
working here, everybody was tremendous and everybody was wonderful to work
with, so thank you.  
  
Q. What do you think about a player like Promise, one of the smallest
players on the floor today, and she had career ‑high rebounds, as high as
anyone else today?  
COACH THORNE: Great question. We even think she might have had more than 14,
because it was 14 at one point and I think she got one or two more. I know she
would trade them all in for a W.  
Promise has had an amazing season in what has been an incredibly disappointing
season in terms of wins and losses, but Promise has been a bright spot for our
team in terms of her growth and development, offensively and defensively, in
every way learning what it takes at this level. And so I think people can see
that and very excited for the next two years.  
  
Q. Following up that, did you make a point going to the glass to try to find
another way to contribute since your shot wasn't going?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Yeah, I think the whole goal was to rebound and play
defense well, so I knew I had to get rebounds. My shot wasn't falling, I
wasn't making shots, so I knew I had to pick it up on the other end.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  75  
Kentucky  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky head coach Matthew Mitchell and
student‑athletes A'dia Mathies and Bria Goss. We'll take an opening comment
from Coach Mitchell.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we were excited that we were able to make the finals
today. Give thanks to God for giving us the strength and the talent to get to
this day. We're very disappointed that we lost, but we were beaten by a very
good basketball team, a very hungry basketball team. Texas A&M had strong
desire to be the champions, and that's why they are cutting the nets down as
we speak.  
All the credit in the world goes to those kids. They really played hard, a lot
harder than we did. They compete d with a championship effort. You have to
give them a tremendous amount of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. A'dia, things didn't turn out the way you hoped today. What do you think
you could have done different looking back?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think we had too many players out there with loose balls.
They at the free‑throw line, they don't rebound over and over and over again.
We can't let that happen too many times. That's unacceptable.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the difficulty in trying to keep Bone from getting
the ball or keeping her away from the basket.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Bone is a big player. I think our posts did an okay job of
trying to push off the block.  
It was up to us guards and other posts to swarm her today. She got a lot of
deep positions and easy buckets.  
  
Q. You ladies still have a ton to play for in the NCAA tournament. The
disappointment you're feeling right now, the emotion of not winning something.
Your gut reaction, please.  
BRIA GOSS: I mean, when you want something really bad, you come up short, the
pain is there. But I'm just going to use this pain as motivation to get better
for the tournament because we got a lot more basketball to play. We're just
going to use this game as a learning tool and try to move forward from it.  
A'DIA MATHIES: It's just disappointing because we know we had the capabilities
to win this game and should have won this game.  
We didn't come out there and play for 40 minutes like we should have. We are
going to use this game to move forward because we not gonna let this game
define our season. We going to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. You haven't had a whole lot of time to sit and think about the game as a
whole. What can you take away from this game that will make you learn and be
ready for the NCAA tournament?  
BRIA GOSS: Just to come out when you're on the floor, don't take any second
for granted, play like it's your last game, like it's the last opportunity you
have. We just gave away an opportunity.  
A'DIA MATHIES: We need to be sharper and focused throughout the whole game. We
can't have no lapses. We need to make every four‑minute segment like our last.
We didn't do that tonight, but we're definitely going to do that moving
forward.  
  
Q. A'dia, early to midway through the second half, you were settling for a
lot of jump shots. Was that something that their defense was giving you or you
settling for those shots?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I don't think anybody's going to take a forced shot. If we
open, we going to shoot the jump shot, look for our posts in on the inside. If
we open, we going to take jump shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue with questions for Coach Mitchell.  
  
Q. As much as you respect this league and as good of a job you have done,
forgetting about the game, just curious of your gut right now and your
emotions.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, it's just a tremendous tournament. It is one of the
toughest things I think to do in sports, is to win three games in three days,
or four games in four days, if you're fortunate enough to advance that far,
and play at a really high level.  
That's why I have so much respect for Texas A&M. They played some really tough
games to get here. They played much tougher than us.  
We're just disappointed. We've been here three out of the last four years,
haven't been able to get a victory. It's very, very disappointing.  
  
Q. What was your analysis of your halfcourt offense, the shot selection
today?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it was poor. That is coaching. There's no other way
around it. We could not get a bucket. Our post players are not at a point
where they can get on the post and score. That is a credit to Texas A&M's
defense. But I should have done a better job at this point in time in the
season of being better able to manufacture some offense. I feel really badly
about that. We thought we had some chances, and we just could not capitalize.  
So I thought the halfcourt offense was not where it needed to be on a day
where we got a lot of open shots and they didn't go down. You're going to have
days like that. You must be able to go inside and get something off the
backboard, and we just weren't able to do that.  
  
Q. Your depth had been such a strength the last two days. It looked like
that would be an advantage. Did you think your players looked tired in the
second half?  
COACH MITCHELL: I was just so optimistic coming into the game, I was so proud
of our team for putting themselves in the position that I thought we were in.
I thought that we were capable of really, really pushing the pace today and
playing really tough. That never materialized.  
As a coach, you just feel really bad that you're not able to get your team
prepared for a big moment like this. So I feel awful that we didn't get the
job done today.  
I don't know if we seemed tired. I just thought that we didn't seem very
tough. That's disappointing.  
  
Q. You have a week to regroup. What do you focus on for this week before
heading into the tournament?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we have lost four games now against SEC competition,
five games overall. Second game of the season we were just out‑matched for
that game. The other four that we lost, you saw, us I thought, not play with
the kind of desire and the kind of toughness that you've seen the rest of the
season.  
So a large majority of the season we've been really good and really tough. I
think what I'll try to do is figure out the best way to get our team in a
position to be ready to play in the NCAA tournament.  
If I can affect the toughness, bring that out of them, great. If it's what we
have, I have to figure out on a day like today, I need to do a better job of
being able to help them, get some baskets.  
We're going into the paint, we're at the rim. It's real, real physical. We
just can't get the ball in the basket. I think I'll be working on that the
next week or so.  
  
Q. When Bone is playing as well as she did in the second half, does that
give them a lot of advantage in the halfcourt offense?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, you really have to have a good team effort to guard her.
We did that very effectively in College Station. We didn't today. Again, it's
very disappointing to get this close and not be able to win.  
But if you let her get that close to the rim, she's going to have a big day on
you. She certainly did.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  75  
Kentucky  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M head coach Gary Blair and
student‑athletes Courtney Walker and Kelsey Bone. We'll start with an opening
comment from Coach Blair.  
COACH BLAIR: That was a great game for television, just like anytime you have
an SEC Championship. The SEC is back, okay? The SEC is back. I know we were in
the Big 12 and we thought we were the best back then. Probably Baylor is on
the court right now.  
But the SEC, with the tournament that we had here, with the quality and the
depth of this league, it's going to be special in years to come. The
outstanding freshmen that are in the league, we'll lose a few good seniors,
but look what's coming back. I'd like to thank the SEC conference staff, all
the people that have helped us here. We were treated with hospitality.
Everything was great.  
It's hard to beat us three times. I think our team will say Kentucky is just
great. Here is the difference. Kentucky played 40 minutes both games. We
played 37 both times we lost.  
I know Walker made that comment. She said, We knew if we played 40 minutes,
they couldn't stay with us. Our kids took that to heart. That's a good comment
for Walker to make, but it's not a good comment for us to read because we felt
like we could play 40 minutes with the best of 'em.  
Transition offense was the difference in the game. Even though we turned the
ball over some, we made some horrible mistakes sometimes in the second half,
but we got the easy baskets, we didn't allow them to play that great halfcourt
defense which they possibly can.  
Pratcher and Jones did a great job of dissecting. Gilbert hung on in the first
half for us while we had Bone in foul trouble. Bone did her thing in the
second half, along with my two freshmen, and my unsung hero Kristi Bellock.  
We're happy. We're still dancing. We're ready to go home, rest a little, get
ready for the tournament at our place.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did you take personal the fact that you were in foul trouble in
the first half?  
KELSEY BONE: Actually it was a twofold thing for me. Both times we played
Kentucky previously, I've had terrible, terrible cramps going into the second
half. I felt like that kind of caused or took a little edge off of us. When
I'm sitting on the bench, eight minutes in the first half, I still have 20
minutes left in my tank.  
It's probably was a blessing in disguise. It's a testament to my team and to
the depth that we have, that I can sit on the bench for eight minutes, and
we're only down by two points. It's not like they opened up this lead and we
had to come back and fight. We were only down two points.  
I felt like we had taken their best shot and we had not thrown our best punch
yet. I felt like we were ready.  
  
Q. Kristi, can you talk about your mindset? Your versatility, transition
baskets. To talk about your mindset today.  
KRISTI BELLOCK: I wanted to come out with a lot of energy. This was the last
game for the championship, so it's either give it all I got or go home. I did
kind of take what they said to heart. The last game I didn't have good post
defense, so I took that to heart and I wanted to make them look like the bad
post defense. I ran the court every time. When I got tired, I asked for a sub,
came back in and kept running.  
THE MODERATOR: Run, Forest, run (laughter).  
  
Q. For any of you guys, what was the effect of losing the Big 12
championships had to you being able to win the SEC this year?  
KELSEY BONE: It's funny, I looked at Kristi last night, sitting in the hotel
lobby, doesn't it feel good preparing for a tournament conference game and not
having to worry about Baylor. Every year we've gotten to championship games
and had to play Baylor.  
You know, irregardless of who our opponent was going to be today, we came in,
we lost four games, lost four of our last five games. I think sometimes you
need a little bit of failure to wake you back up sometimes.  
Those four games, they really refocused us and I think it changed our mindset.
If we just listen to our coaches, play hard, execute the game plan, we're a
dangerous, dangerous team.  
THE MODERATOR: Kristi.  
KRISTI BELLOCK: It's very special to me because this is my first time playing.
This is also my last time playing. I'm just excited that we got the trophy.
I'm excited because we did it on our own. We didn't have the Sydney Carters
and Tyras and Danielles. We did it with our seniors and with Kelsey.  
  
Q. Kelsey, does this mean anything extra to you after playing a year in the
SEC?  
KELSEY BONE: It's a storybook ending for me. I fell in love with the
Southeastern Conference as a little girl and I always wanted to play in the
Southeastern Conference. That was a lot of the reason why I made my initial
decision.  
Going back to the Big 12, then, boom, I'm back here in the SEC. That doesn't
happen to everybody who transfers. I'm probably the only person who can ever
say that.  
For me, this is about my team. We could still be in the Big 12. We could be in
the Big Ten. It didn't really matter. I'm happy, having fun with the group of
girls that I go to practice and line up with every day. We're just having fun.
When we're having fun, we're a hard team to beat.  
  
Q. Kristi and Kelsey, can you talk about your freshman Courtney Walker. Talk
about her play, especially being a freshman.  
KRISTI BELLOCK: Courtney Walker is amazing. She's our energy player when
everyone else doesn't make shots, Coach Blair calls her number, she steps up
every time. I'm happy we got her on our team. We love her like a sister. I
hope she keeps doing what she's doing for the rest of this season. That's
making me very happy.  
KELSEY BONE: Courtney is actually my roommate on road trips. We spend a lot of
time together. That's my kid. I mean, I'm like her mother. I do her hair. I
wake her up. That's my kid.  
So to see her out here, I mean, she's everywhere. We expect her to guard the
other team's best player. She's guarding an All‑American in A'dia Mathies, and
we're expecting her to score. That's not easy for a senior, let alone a
freshman.  
When she's coming in, giving us all this energy, we can't help but feed off of
what she does. It seems like every time Coach Blair calls her number, she
delivers. She does her homework, it's the weekend, I'm like, What are you
doing? Homework.  
But she's ready to play. She's playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes a game most of
the time. She makes us better.  
When she's out there doing all the things that she does, I'm like, I've got to
get this rebound for her because she's giving her it all.  
COACH BLAIR: Is she going to get you to switch over to engineering?  
KELSEY BONE: Not anytime soon.  
  
Q. Courtney, talk about your learning curve this year. Talk about how much
you've learned through the court of this season.  
COURTNEY WALKER: I learned a lot playing Kelsey and the seniors, really the
whole team. We had to come in early, he told us, with me and C. Will starting,
we had to come in and give it our all and produce really.  
When I came in, he told me most of the time I'd be guarding the best player, I
think it's a mindset. That's the biggest thing I've had to change from last
year to this year is being completely ready for the game and knowing what you
opponent wants to do and being able to take that away, because All‑Americans,
you can't really stop, you just have to focus on containing them, taking away
what they want to do.  
Really on offense, giving it my all, working on being able to defend, going to
the other end and trying to produce, or at least make a play and make a stat
in the books to give my team something to score or whatever we need to keep
winning.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk about how much Coach Blair means to you. You had a
conversation with him about playing for your grandmother. Elaborate on how
much he means to you.  
KELSEY BONE: My grandfather coached in Texas way back in the day. Coach Blair
started mentioning some names, and he and my grandfather ran in the same
circles.  
Coach Blair has meant a lot to me. I had an okay season. A lot of people gave
up on me. She's a flop. She was good in high school. She's not going to pan
out in college.  
Coach Blair just stuck with me. It would have been easy for Coach Blair to use
me in a different kind of way this year. But we had a conversation. He said, I
need you to lead my team. I took that to mean whatever he needed me to do.  
I felt like if I could be the one person that Coach Blair didn't have to worry
about with seven freshmen on the team, we'd be ahead of the curve.  
With that being said, I just had an epiphany. My grandmother died four days
after I turned four. She was my everything. When things get tough for me, I
think about her. And tonight, it would have been easy for us to kind of cave
in.  
But I'm playing for something bigger. There are bigger things pushing.  
We have this amongst our team. It's called, What's your why? When things are
getting bad, Coach Blair is chewing us out, Coach Starkey or Coach Bond or
Coach Wright will say, what's your why? They'll just walk by in passing, not
anything major, each person on our team has one.  
When we were going through that four‑game streak, we did that. Everyone kind
of, What's your why? My grandmother is my why. That's a why that I'll never
lose because I know she'll always be there for me.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Your previous time in the SEC obviously gives you a better ability to
place some perspective on Texas A &M doing this in your first year in the
league.   
COACH BLAIR: Well, the first thing, I'm coming in with more ammunition on the
playing court. I've got a very good team, even though we're young in spots,
but we have veterans in leadership roles.  
The SEC, when I was there for 10 years, was undoubtedly the best league. You
had Hall of Fame coaches, Olympic players, All‑Americans. Then in the last
nine years, there had been a lot of changes in the SEC. The only person that's
left is Andy Landers, and Melanie Balcomb was just there for one of my years.  
We're trying to build up, you're only as good as your coaches. We had
graduated so many great coaches in this league that it built programs up.  
Coming back, when I went into the Big 12, we tried to play SEC defense because
I couldn't play Big 12 offense. My players weren't good enough. So I had to
play SEC defense for survival. That's what I learned in my 10 years at
Arkansas to be able to play.  
That's how we built the team. Because the McDonald's All‑Americans and the
great players were not going to come to us. We had to build it with kids that
were good recruits, but not great recruits. They turned into great people that
could do great things. That's how we built our program.  
Now I've even got McDonald's All‑Americans. It's fun to coach them because
their offensive skills are generally a lot better. We shot 47% tonight. How
did we do that? We shot 16 out of 25 from the paint. We held their two post
players, basically 1‑5 and 4‑12\. That was the difference in the ballgame. We
knew we had to win it on the inside because their perimeter defense was so
good.  
I built this program with defense, but now we've got the offense to go with
it.  
  
Q. You've won national championships. You may the SEC is back.  
COACH BLAIR: Singular, sir.  
  
Q. National championship. You say the SEC is back. What does winning this
tournament do for you guys for the NCAA tournament moving forward?  
COACH BLAIR: It's going to give us a boost in attendance Monday morning. I'm
going to be out selling tickets, too. It's during our spring break, but I
expect people to buy tickets.  
Hey, we finished second in the league in attendance in conference play, third
overall. But we were second above Kentucky in conference play. So we got a
great fan base.  
But I'm never satisfied. I want to build it up. Last year we were second in
the sub‑regionals and all the 16 to Notre Dame. We had great attendance there.  
Texas A&M, it's an all‑purpose school. We're not just a football school, we're
not just Johnny Manziel, John David Crow. We win in everything. Every sport we
win.  
But what this means, it's our first SEC Championship. We've got individual
championships which we've already won. We've got west divisions. Well, there's
no divisions in basketball. We inherited the hardest schedule in the SEC in
conference play, okay? It's a random little deal. Guess what, welcome to the
SEC. I get Kentucky twice, Vanderbilt twice and LSU twice.  
It made us tougher. So we were on the aisle saying, All right, we'll take what
you are gonna give us. We're 5‑1 on road games until we lost our last two at
Vanderbilt and Tennessee, two pretty good teams.  
We're going to give to the SEC what the SEC always needs. It needs that
western team also to be a recruiting base for all the sports. Texas has got a
lot of folks. It doesn't matter if you're equestrian or gymnastics or what,
Texas is loaded with talent, just like Florida is. It's opening up the doors
for other schools to come in.  
We'd like to close the doors sometimes, there's more than enough.  
I'm happy to be a part of it. I'm in this thing not to win games, but to win
championships and compete for championships. I've lost a lot of championships,
but I've won a lot, too.  
You build your program with your staff. Folks, I hire good people and I work
'em like slaves and I give responsibility out, then I give 'em the love
afterwards. But my staff has been very, very special over the years. This is
one of the best staffs I've ever had.  
Coach Starkey's defense is tremendous, just like what Coach Schaefer used to
do for us a different way. So instead of me going in and trying to change a
Coach Starkey to coach like Coach Schaefer, no, I adapted to Coach Starkey. I
said, Your system has been good enough at LSU, bring your system in.  
The only one thing I asked, I believe in pressure, because we eat pressure for
breakfast at Texas A&M. He incorporated that. More of a gap defense. But it
works. It's very good. We held another team to 35% again.  
  
Q. You talked about having the hardest SEC schedule. Can you talk about how
that, coupled with playing Penn State, UConn, Louisville, Notre Dame, all out
of conference, prepped you for this run?  
COACH BLAIR: It really prepped us. A lot of people were calling me crazy when
I did that schedule. I wanted to build up our fan base. We're still educating
people towards women's basketball. It's a nationwide problem, particularly
with students coming to ballgames.  
Tennessee has 14,000 in, but they only had 300 students. If we have 7,000 in,
we might only have 300 to 400 students. That's an area we want to grow in, is
getting the students to come to ballgames.  
What was the rest of your question?  
  
Q. How is this going to make you guys ready for the tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: Hey, when you go against Geno, you get ready in a hurry or you
get embarrassed. We got embarrassed. Don't you worry. We'd love to have
another crack to show them how much we've improved because both of us have a
lot of respect for each other.  
At the same time I lost to Louisville, I lost to Penn State, two games we were
very much in. After that, we just grew as a basketball team. I trusted my
freshmen. I let 'em grow up with their mistakes.  
When you got a horse like Bone, you learn how to ride her. You got to get in
her head. She's a junky for basketball. She can tell you every WNBA player,
NBA player, everything about sports. Some are listening to music, she's
watching sports.  
She's going to be an outstanding coach someday if she isn't a broadcaster
first.  
It was just special. Here is one thing I challenged Kelsey with. On the board
I put seven keys for the game. Nothing about points. I said give me 15 boards,
give me 10 defensive ones, 5 offensive ones, give me 5 assists, play great
defense. Look what their post players did. Between her and Bellock, they shut
them down.  
She got me 10 defensive boards, she got me five offensive boards, she owes me
an assist, and I'll ask for it next time 'cause she only got four.  
It's just fun. People say, Why don't you retire, go play golf every day. Well,
my golf game is not as good as my coaching. It's not bad. But I'm going to
coach for a long time, all right? So I'm here for the duration. If you're
still good at what you're doing, if you got a great place to sell like Texas
A&M, why retire? I'm horrible at honey‑do's I don't want to do that. I want to
coach young people.  
  
Q. Can you talk about handling Walker's ball pressure today. Talk about the
job she did handling the pressure today.  
COACH BLAIR: Well, the one thing that I'm different than most coaches, if you
look all over the years, our assist/turnover ratio has been some of the best
in the country. The reason, I'm a set coach, not a motion coach. Why do I want
to put the ball in the hands of people that are average passers? I want the
ball in the hands of the kid that's going to make the decision.  
Walker has turned into a very good assist person. Courtney Williams is very
good. Bellock has done a good job. At the same time I run sets. When sets
don't work, sometimes we break down and we get into a flow motion and more
people touch the ball.  
But she wants the ball. She wants the ball. Jordan is coming in giving us a
little bit of energy. She'll be running the show next year. But Pratcher,
remember, Standish quit, my starting point guard, December the 5th or
something like that. Pratcher just said, Give me the ball. We gave her the
ball. She stood up. Our chemistry is better. Everything is better.  
Sometimes you have addition by subtraction. It worked this time.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH BLAIR: Thank you all.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  66  
Tennessee  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee head coach Holly Warlick and
student‑athletes Meighan Simmons and Taber Spani.  
COACH WARLICK: It boiled down to us getting stops, and we couldn't get any
stops. You know, Texas A&M were persistent and they hit big shots. We didn't
have an answer, so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You couldn't miss for most of the game. When Texas A &M made a
substitution on you, put Tori Scott in there, did you do anything differently
that prevented you from getting the ball easier, impeding your shot at all?   
TABER SPANI: I mean, not really. They're all athletic. First off, they just
all play a great game. It was a battle.  
I think she was a little smaller than Williams. They're kind of face guarding
after about 15 minutes into the second half. You know, similar, but I guess
she's just a different player, too.  
  
Q. As tough as this is to realize, all the things you have done well, one of
those has been bouncing back and realize you have the NCAA tournament.  
TABER SPANI: Absolutely. This team is resilient. This one hurts right now.
Probably going to hurt for a couple days.  
We have about a week and a half or so and we got to get ready. Honestly, we
wanted to go 4‑4, Kamiko and I as a class. NCAA championships is why you play.
Hopefully we'll have up to six games. But we got to take it one at a time.  
Honestly I think the biggest part of our season is still left to come, but
this one just hurts right now.  
  
Q. Coach Blair stopped to talk to you. What did he say to you after the
game?  
TABER SPANI: I mean, I know and my family knows him pretty well. He's just a
very classy guy.  
He just said, That was a senior effort. I was trying to do everything I could
to keep us in the game and hopefully with a W, but was just a little bit
short.  
  
Q. Meighan, one of the things that Texas A &M said they wanted to do was cut
down on transition points from you guys by not turning the ball over very
much. Did you feel the fact they only have nine turnovers was part of the
difficulty of you guys not being able to get your offense going as well as you
wanted to?   
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: Yeah. From early on we turned the ball over too many times.
We couldn't take care of the ball. We weren't getting into our offenses like
we should have.  
But I think after a while we got a couple transition points here and there. I
feel like we take care of the ball a little bit more, we'll be able to get in
our flow of the game and how we normally play from the get‑go.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. When you have a 50 to 40 lead, had the momentum, Spani hadn't missed
anything at that juncture, then after that she went a really long time. Was
Texas A &M doing something that caused you problems to get the ball to Spani?
  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think Scott came in for a reason. I think she was
denying Taber, not letting her have the basketball. That was a great move on
Gary's part.  
Yeah, you're up 10, then we got comfortable. We just got comfortable. We've
been preaching defense all year and rebounding. We couldn't get a stop. They
went 9. Last 11 possessions and they scored.  
You can put yourself in a position to score, but it boils down to coming down
and getting stops, and we didn't do it.  
  
Q. They have a lot of height inside and they have a lot of depth. Does the
combination of those two things make things tough?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, yeah, I think they were bringing people in and out.  
You know what, we need five people on the floor. We need five people on the
floor to get it done. We could not get a defensive stop. I don't care if we're
freshmen, what we are. It boils down to getting stops. You got to make a play.
We didn't make a play down at the end.  
I thought Bashaara battles. She scores the basket, it got called off for a
walk. I thought Kamiko got a good look at the end. But somewhere you got to
change their rhythm and you got to do it on the defensive end. We just didn't
get it done. A credit to them.  
They hit big shots. That's what teams do. In your run, you got to hit big
shots. They did. We tried zone. We tried man. We tried switching. We tried
everything we had. We just couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. When you mention the defense, even though you guys were up 50 to 40, did
you feel uncomfortable? Were you still a little uncertain about your defense
even with Spani having an unbelievable game?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I mean, you can't go 11 possessions and give them 9
possessions. I don't care what you're up. Thank goodness we were up 10. They
just went to work and we got comfortable with the 10‑point lead.  
We've done that in the past. We've gotten up and we've just decided, Oh, we
can exhale. You got to keep the hammer down, and we didn't.  
We'll go back and learn. We're a young team. We continue to learn. I thought
we missed Izzy today, we missed her height, her presence, her inside presence.
It's just what we've been dealing with all year.  
We've played without her, we've played with her. Just didn't get it done. We
didn't finish the deal. We just didn't finish it.  
  
Q. You know what went wrong, but you still got the NCAA tournament left.
This group has been resilient. What do you work on for the next two weeks
before the NCAAs?  
COACH WARLICK: We go back to doing what we've been doing. We got to get better
on the defensive end. That's the bottom line. We've got to get better and
become a better rebounding team.  
We only had six offensive rebounds. That's not a sign of a Tennessee team. We
gave up 18 rebounds, offensive rebounds, for Texas A&M. We just really got to
learn the importance of playing defense and rebounding.  
We got the offensive punch. We just got to play at the other end of the floor.  
We're going to bounce back. We're going to go back to work. We've got two
weeks to get better, to improve. I'm confident that our staff will go to work
and we'll get these young ladies prepared.  
I hate it for Taber today. I thought she played an outstanding game. I hate it
for all our players. I thought we put ourselves in a position to win. We just
couldn't finish it out. Hats off to Texas A&M. They could have given up. They
didn't. They kept battling. A credit to them, as well.  
  
Q. I know that Taber has had so many different injuries. Today looked to me
she was the player she can be.  
COACH WARLICK: I think so. I think she's battled injuries her whole career
here. She still has a little bit of a back problem.  
Taber is a competitor. Today she found a way to get her shot off. She just
played an all‑around game. We got down by 7. That was a huge turning point for
us when Taber hit some big baskets.  
Yeah, I don't know. I wanted to get the ball in Taber's hands, but they were
teeing in on her. I thought we had an opportunity to step up on some other
areas.  
But Taber, I mean, she played a great game. I don't know how much more she
could have done for us. She played 40 minutes for us.  
  
Q. Also in that second half at times she was guarding Kelsey Bone. I don't
remember her guarding a player of that size for a pretty long stretch. What
was your thinking on that? Did she do okay in that regard?  
COACH WARLICK: I think so. At times when Bashaara sits out in foul trouble,
we're small. We're just small and athletic. Taber is going to have to play
inside on the zone or guard somebody big. She was one of the biggest players
we had out there, so...  
You know, I tried everybody. I tried Nia Moore, who came in. She played two
minutes. Came up with a rebound. I don't know. We're just low in numbers. We
got to get healthy. I think the next two weeks will help us as far as getting
healthy.  
  
Q. Do you have any projection for Izzy?  
COACH WARLICK: I thought we had a chance to get her back this weekend. We had
a practice on Thursday and somebody ran into her and tweaked her knee again.  
I don't know. We can't catch a break. I thought she would be ready to go. That
kind of set her back. I think we'll have her for the NCAA tournament. I think
the next two weeks will be huge for her to rest and for her to rehab and get
her knee solid.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

KENTUCKY  60  
GEORGIA - 38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Matthew Mitchell and DeNesha
Stallworth and A'dia Mathies.  
COACH MITCHELL: We're very excited to be playing for the championship
tomorrow. We came down here with the intention of winning the tournament. We
played a very, very tough Georgia team today. I thought they showed tremendous
desire in the first half, out‑hustled us in the first half.  
We went out and played a very tough 20 minutes in the second half. So proud of
the players. Excited for our opportunity to compete for the championship. We
know we'll have to play well and prepare well to beat Texas A&M. We'll put
everything we can into it and see what happens tomorrow, try to get as ready
as we can.  
But glad to win today.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Just curious, the run in the second half was spectacular. What
happened?  
DENESHA STALLWORTH: Just I think we all took it personal and we felt like
there were some things we couldn't control, such as their O‑boards. I think we
all stuck together as a team and we fought hard. When we come together, it
definitely brings energy. That's something that was a positive.  
A'DIA MATHIES: We were pretty lackadaisical in the first half. We didn't come
out with much energy and hustle. They looked like they wanted it more than we
did.  
Halftime we got it turned around. We didn't come here to come to the second
round and lose. We got to get back on the right things and we came out with
the win.  
  
Q. Did you feel like they came out with max effort? Second half, you looked
like you had way more left in the tank.  
DENESHA STALLWORTH: We use our depth as an advantage every game. We wasn't
hustling in the first half. We were only down by like four or five points. In
the second half, it really changed. It shows what we do when we out there
hustling, focused, having fun. Definitely a different ballgame.  
  
Q. A'dia, what do you remember about the Texas A &M game in February? You
were able to turn them over more. What are your memories of it?   
A'DIA MATHIES: They a tough team. Every time they play, they going to give max
effort. We definitely stuck to it. We're playing Kentucky basketball and
utilizing everybody on our roster. With any team, we can wear them down.  
That game, I just remember it being a tough battle and we coming out with a
battle, a well‑deserved victory on our part.  
  
Q. DeNesha, it looked like Jennifer O'Neill was doing a good job.  
DENESHA STALLWORTH: Jen definitely pushed the pace in the second half. She's a
great passer. I just had to make myself available and finish. She did a great
job of finding me.  
  
Q. A'dia, what was said by coach and some of the team leaders at halftime to
kick start you guys?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I don't think I can say what coach said in the locker room
(laughter).  
He definitely just showed us how much they was beating up on us on the
offensive boards. It was 12‑3\. That just show how unfocused we was in the
locker room.  
We came out with a lot of energy. Like I said before, we didn't come here to
lose in the second round, we came here to cut down the nets.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive adjustments you made at Hassell in the
post.  
DENESHA STALLWORTH: Just playing more physical. Just not staying behind her
and letting her always go right, have it her way. Definitely played her more
tougher. More ball pressure helped. We did it as a team. Our guards helped
out, so we did a great job.  
  
Q. A'dia, Kentucky has won this once, long before either one of you two were
born. How big of a goal was this for you in your career at Kentucky to have a
chance to win an SEC tournament championship?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Definitely big. We feel we the deepest, most talented team in
the SEC.  
I think if you don't set goals like this, you shorten yourself. We very
capable of doing that. Just to have the opportunity to go out there and still
make that goal, it means a lot. I know we going to work hard for it. Nobody
wants to leave here with a loss.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Mitchell.  
  
Q. Could you give the non ‑X rated version of what you said at halftime.   
COACH MITCHELL: A'dia was joking. She was joking. No cursing or anything at
halftime. There was some intensity.  
I just wrote the number 12 on the board and the number 3 on the board. Georgia
had 12 offensive rebounds and we had 3. I thought Georgia played with so much
more intensity and desire in the first half. I was just livid about that.  
We came down here believing we had a chance to win this tournament, just
really unacceptable not to compete at a high level. We just talked really
about sort of had a rollcall at halftime and talked to some individual people
that were acting like it was no big deal. They were upset because they missed
some layups or whatever it may be.  
It was not a complicated message at halftime. We had to get our energy, come
out with more intensity, come out with desire. If we did that, we knew we'd
have a chance to win.  
  
Q. This one a little sweeter for you, avenging an earlier loss to Georgia?  
COACH MITCHELL: The thing that's sweet about it is having a chance and
opportunity tomorrow. You can't imagine how much respect I have for the
Georgia program and Coach Landers, who is one of the best absolute coaches of
all time, has been a great, great source of wisdom for me over the years. We
have tremendous respect for Georgia's team.  
It's only sweet not because of the opponent, but because our kids got it
together at halftime and are now giving themselves an opportunity to win a
championship we want very badly.  
  
Q. When you get the second half, Jennifer O'Neill, the eight points at the
start of the half, running the team, what did that mean as opposed to the
first half Jennifer?  
COACH MITCHELL: The first half Jennifer was the Jennifer in the three losses.
We absorbed three losses in this league. That was the first half Jennifer. We
were real fortunate we weren't down more.  
The second half Jennifer is the one I think is the best point guard in this
league. She was relentless, pushed the pace. Really I thought what separated
us when it was kind of going back and forth were some buckets. We were able to
score at the rim because she pushed the pace, did a good job.  
I think we are a very dangerous team when we can have her playing the way she
did in the second half. She's a terrific player right now, at least she was in
the second half today.  
  
Q. Seems like this is strength versus strength. You and Texas A &M are
probably the two deepest teams in the league, maybe in the country. How is
that going to play out tomorrow? What are your memories of that February
game?  
COACH MITCHELL: The February game was one of the best games of the year. Very
hostile environment. Very impressive place to go, Texas A&M. They had a great
crowd that night.  
Our team performed beautiful. They played together. They played with
tremendous focus and hustle. They were able to overcome some adversity in the
game. We had some deficits we had to overcome. We had to absorb a huge run by
Texas A&M.  
We just hung in there and sort of were able to out last them. Lexington, too.
Two good games, talented teams. Texas A&M is very well‑coached. It should be
the type of game that this tournament is deserving of. Two really good teams.
You should have to play very good basketball to win this tournament
championship. I think you'll have to play well tomorrow to win.  
  
Q. Georgia produced some really ugly offensive numbers, particularly in the
second half. What did y'all do defensively to force that?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought we played a good defensive half. In the first half,
they were 23% shooting. It was so bad on my offensive boards they were able to
get. I thought we were much better at getting them outside the NBA three‑point
lines, where we want them to start their offense, outside of that, then it
makes it more difficult to throw it into Hassell.  
She was killing us in the first half. We needed to do a better job of getting
them out of rhythm. I thought our bigs played better defense on Anne Marie
Armstrong. I thought Kastine and Bria did a good job of getting into Jasmine
James' legs. I though she played a tough game, had to go a lot of minutes. I
thought at the end we were able to force their offense to start out of their
comfort zone. I thought that was really the key to the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

### [Jasmine James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22148)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia head coach Andy Landers and
student‑athletes Jasmine Hassell and Jasmine James.  
COACH LANDERS: From an expectation standpoint, it was what we expected. We
expected full‑court defense. We got it. We expected good man‑to‑man defense.
We got that. Kentucky did a very good job with those things.  
Defensively I thought the first half we were where we wanted to be. They
probably got what they expected. But the second half obviously was
disappointing. It started on the offensive end with turnovers, which led to
some transitions, quick loss of possession. We were on defense, bam, we give
up a three, we're on defense again, four‑point lead is gone. All of a sudden
you look up and it seems like in three or four trips we're down. I don't know
that I'm right, but it felt like we were down six just like that.  
We strayed from where we wanted to be defensively. We strayed from where we
were in the first half defensively. We paid for it. From that point on, it
wasn't a lot of fun.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. In the second half, they did a good job of shutting you down in the
paint. What were they doing there?  
JASMINE HASSELL: They came with a double‑team. I mean, I don't know. They came
with a double‑team.  
COACH LANDERS: We didn't get her the ball. We did a good job of getting her
the basketball the first half. We didn't do a very good job of getting her the
basketball in the second half. You didn't ask me. But she's sitting here
making stuff up that's not real.  
  
Q. Obviously the season is not over for you right now. The tournament is.
How do you use this tournament as you build to go into the national
tournament?  
JASMINE HASSELL: Just refocus and do what we need to do. We need to fight
more. We need to execute. We need to execute our game plan. We did not do
that. We didn't do that in the second half.  
JASMINE JAMES: I agree with that. I believe we need to refocus more. 40
minutes in the game, we consistently play 20 or 30. We need to learn to stick
together and play a complete 40 to be as good as we can possibly be.  
  
Q. Ugly shooting numbers, particularly in the second half. What were they
doing defensively to you, especially on the perimeter?  
JASMINE JAMES: Kentucky has a defense that applies a lot of pressure. When we
did finally get open to knock down shots, we just didn't do a good job of
doing that. That's practice and focus. Clearly we didn't have that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Landers.  
  
Q. What was Kentucky able to do at the start of the second half?  
COACH LANDERS: Capitalize. I think the first thing they were able to do is
capitalize on our miscues. If I'm not mistaken, we turned it over three of the
first four, maybe the first three times in a row. It was nonchalant offensive
execution. They took it right down the court very quickly, as they do on
turnovers. First thing you know, they're dropping threes on us.  
The turnovers I think affected our team mentally when they should not have,
but they did. I think for sure the instant offense that those turnovers led to
affected us even more. We weren't very mature at that point. We weren't very
poised at that point.  
  
Q. Kentucky is a tough team to get in the semifinals, but obviously a good
team. Any positives to seeing them early?  
COACH LANDERS: Let's be real. I mean, we've done the things we wanted to do
the first half. We wanted to keep them out of the paint. We wanted to rebound
the basketball. We wanted them to be one‑and‑done and no threes. So we done a
pretty good job. Same game plan second half. Didn't do it.  
You ought to be able to learn something from that. Kentucky didn't change
anything. They didn't start the second half, in my view, with any more
intensity than they started the game with. We just quit doing what had put us
in a successful position at halftime, which is really sad.  
Now, you look at the big picture, we gave up 60 points. All the bad things
that happened defensively, we still should have won. Surely you can score 61.
But then you get to the numbers that's already been mentioned.  
You know, everybody on our team, because of Kentucky's defense, was forced to
shoot a couple of shots they would rather not have shot, to Kentucky's credit,
okay? The rest of them, nobody held a gun to our head and made us shoot those.
But we didn't hit shots.  
Basketball is no fun when you don't hit shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  66  
Tennessee  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M coach Gary Blair and student‑athletes
Courtney Walker and Kelsey Bone.  
COACH BLAIR: How about those Young Aggies? We keep finding a way. We might not
have had Johnny Manziel, but we had some freshman step up. I had leadership
out of Pratcher in the first half, knocking down shots. Bone second half was
just very, very good. I think she's the best post player in the nation and
she's hard to guard. When her mind is set, she's scoring easy, she's awfully
tough to defend.  
But Tennessee, they're just not a team, they're an institution on what they've
meant to this game all the way back to 1977 when I met Pat Summitt for the
first time at North Texas at a summer camp and I played three‑on‑three with
her. She kicked my rear from one end to the other. I remember that. I was just
a high school coach at the time. She found Mary Ostrowski for the first time
at that summer camp.  
Holly did a tremendous job. They were hurting us with their dribbles and
kicks. Then all of a sudden we were not putting them at the foul line the last
seven or eight minutes. They were going one‑and‑out and we were getting some
great boards.  
But Spani, give her a lot of credit. Williams, their Energizer Bunny, give her
a lot of credit. But I've got two seniors in Bellock and Pratcher. They're my
Energizer Bunnies and I'm proud of them.  
You have two new ones up here today, Courtney Walker, a great freshman. She
made life a lot better by hitting those two free throws and not letting us
have to go down and play hope‑they‑miss defense.  
Bone, appreciate the effort coming back from getting banged up yesterday on
that meniscus. You stepped up like a trooper. Just appreciate the effort of my
basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how much was the knee bothering you?  
KELSEY BONE: In the beginning I was thinking about it a little bit. We had a
walk‑through this morning. It was only a walk‑through, so today was my first
time. Game time and warmups was my first time going full speed on it. Once I
got comfortable and my adrenaline started going, it didn't bother me a whole
lot.  
My teammates stayed positive with me. Coach Blair told me, When you come out
of the game, don't sit by radar. I sat accidentally by our trainer, so I
didn't have a time to think about it.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how did you think the crowd played into this one? You went to
Tennessee and they have their crowd. It seemed like you had the Georgia fans
in attendance rooting for you guys.  
KELSEY BONE: It's funny because we came Thursday to watch South Carolina and
Alabama play. And we said, Gosh, all the orange everywhere. We knew coming in
once they won last night there would be more orange than blue.  
When you look around, the other SEC teams are rooting for us because we're the
underdog.  
We roll with our fans. We roll with who was cheering for us. We tried to
create our own energy. We knew nobody really expected us to come in and win
this game. All the odds were against us.  
This is our sixth straight conference tournament championship game. The last
time we won a conference tournament we were a 4 seed. We're hoping we have
some history and some magic on our side.  
  
Q. Courtney, can you talk about the importance of taking care of the ball.  
COURTNEY WALKER: One of our points in the game today was stopping their
transition because that's something Tennessee does very well, especially with
their great guard play they have.  
One thing we focused on was turnovers that lead to points for them. That was
something we did at Tennessee that I don't think we did too bad of a job on.
Here today we did it very well. Really taking care of the ball, running our
offense, knowing what we're looking for so we're not scrambling, turning it
over for them to get a score.  
  
Q. Courtney, you were down 50 to 40 fairly early in the second half. You
came down and hit a couple of baskets that kind of seemed to turn the
momentum. What was your mindset at that point?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I can't even tell you for sure. I mean, I just feel like
we've been fighting so hard and we've been staying together. KB and Pratcher
have been preaching at us for our seniors and the people that we need to fight
for, this is their last chance, so we need to get it for them.  
Our back was back against the wall down 10 in the second half. Somebody just
needed to turn it up until everybody got going. That's what I was trying to
do.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to put Tori Scott on Spani
in the second half, how that affected the game.  
COACH BLAIR: She came in for a few minutes just to slow down, because Williams
was not able to guard her. I don't think nobody was able to guard her. We just
had to change pace.  
Tori is the quickest kid we got on the team, along with Jordan Jones. We said,
Don't leave her, don't let her breathe. She gave us a chance to relax and get
Williams' head on there. Sometimes the best equalizer is the bench. You don't
have to say a word to them. I'm not sure that Spani scored the rest of the
game, even when Williams came back in there.  
Scott gave us next man up. That's what the 12th man is all about. 12th man is
all about somebody ready to come in if needed. Scott came in. At the same time
Gilbert came in in the first half, was not as effective as yesterday. A lot of
that was Tennessee. Gilbert has to learn to pin the ball. We were shooting the
ball instead of pinning the ball, forcing the defense to have to guard us.  
But we learned in the second half.  
  
Q. Kristi's game, having a double ‑double today. How important was that for
you?  
COACH BLAIR: Bellock, sometimes she gets the quietest double‑doubles you've
ever seen. Sometimes I'm hugging her, loving her or cussing her. That's all
about Kristi. She just gives me that smile every time.  
She's just a kid that's waited her time. You wait three years to play, play
behind a door, all of a sudden you're limping down, your parents aren't
calling to transfer, you become the best student on our basketball team. Good
things are happening to her.  
She'll get a chance to keep playing ball after that. But Bellock's a great
midrange shooter. She is just a low‑maintenance kid. Just a whole lot of fun.
I would love nothing better to take that kid back to New Orleans. To do that,
that's where she's from at John Curtis High School. I'd love to take her and
Scott back to New Orleans.  
Right now we got Kentucky or Georgia. I'd like to put in a special plea for
the Tennessee fans. If I'm not mistaken, Kentucky borders Tennessee. Georgia
borders Tennessee. You're not supposed to like somebody you're bordering. So
we're the new kid on the block. I want to see that Tennessee orange there pull
us through, and I hope they'll stay. Even if they don't cheer for us, I want
them to cheer for women's basketball because this is a special place. We've
been treated great here. The hospitality, the management of the facility. The
crowds have been very good.  
I do not want to see Tennessee pack up and go home. I want them to stay and
root on the next team. That's what we heard when we first came into this
league. If they couldn't get the recruit or they couldn't win the game, they
started pulling for SEC. So that's what I'd like for them to do, is hopefully
stay over and pull for us.  
But I was proud of my 250 Aggies that were there against those 6,000
Volunteers.  
  
Q. I noticed after postgame when you were shaking hands, you stopped and
spoke to Spani. Can you tell us what you said there.  
COACH BLAIR: Well, first she turned down my letters when I was trying to
recruit her years ago. At the same time I appreciate that kid. She could have
stayed in the Big 12 where her sisters played and her dad played and
everything like that, probably been the biggest show on whatever team she
decided to come to. She came to a place where she could be a value role player
and continue the tradition that Tennessee has. A lot of kids will not do that.
A lot of parents won't let their kids do it because they want their kid to be
the whole show.  
Now she's stepped up. She's going to lead them deep into the playoffs. The
kid's just a winner. I just appreciate what she's brought to the game.  
  
Q. Other than getting in her face, when Spani was having this hot of a game,
did you give any special instructions to stop her from going left or
whatever?  
COACH BLAIR: It wasn't her driving that was hurting, it was her spot‑up
shooting. How many girls catch, release and go up? All post players got to
bring it down. Most guards got to bring it down, check the description on the
ball or something.  
She catches it, she goes up. She knows the game, okay? That's where our game
has to catch up to the men's game, is on basketball IQ. But our role models
now should be women's players.  
We don't need Michael Jordan or Dennis Rodman anymore or whoever. We need to
have the role models of the WNBA players that are playing the game, the elite
women's players, and the coaches that are in the game. I beat one Hall of
Famer yesterday, beat another one today. I guess it would be Andy Matthews got
to wait awhile, but he'll be in it pretty soon.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH BLAIR: Thank y'all.

## March 8, 2013

  

### [A'dia Mathies](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20529)

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Vanderbilt  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Kentucky head coach Matthew Mitchell and
student‑athletes A'dia Mathies and DeNesha Stallworth. Coach, an opening
comment.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it's a terrific start to the tournament for us. We are
very excited to be here and playing in the tournament. We feel really honored
to have a chance to compete for the championship.  
I was so pleased with our players. They gave a terrific effort today and
really, really proud. Vanderbilt has a good team. They're tough. They made it
tough on us to get the victory.  
But I was real proud of our players and we're excited to have a chance to play
again tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: If you could each make a comment about today's game.  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think it was a great game tonight. A game we definitely
needed. We just wanted to come out here and make a statement. Just know that
we're looking forward to winning the championship.  
Vanderbilt was a great team. They came out and fought us very tough. We came
out with the win and I'm glad we did.  
DENESHA STALLWORTH: To add on to what A'dia said, everything was a team
effort. Everybody came in and gave great minutes. We're looking forward to
this next game.  
BY MR. TAKER:  
  
Q. A'dia, you talked yesterday at practice about how you wanted to go out on
top. How do you feel like your team competed?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think we did a great job tonight. We just played 40 minutes
with fresh legs. I think that played a huge factor tonight. When we can have
two people running down the court instead of one person...  
It's going to take a toll on 'em for the last minutes. I think we was getting
great post‑ups, making good plays, especially defensively we was getting big
stops. I'm proud of their effort.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought the start was very good for us. We wanted to have a
fast start. We wanted to use the energy of the second five coming in fresh,
almost like they were starting the game.  
We talked about that before the game. That was the plan before the game. I
thought we had a great start.  
It's exciting to be here and playing in this tournament. I think our players
are excited. We feel like we have quality depth. In this setting, I think it
can be very, very useful.  
I love the way we started and our intensity.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the defensive pressure, especially on their
guards.  
COACH MITCHELL: Jasmine Lister is a very good player. She is their primary
ball handler. We're just fortunate that we have some depth and we're fortunate
that these players have worked really hard to be in the position to play that
kind of defense. You just don't show up today and say, Hey, we're going to
play pressure defense. It started back last summer.  
When you have one primary ball handler, our plan is to try to make that very
difficult and try to make fatigue a factor.  
She's a very good player and I was very pleased that we were able to get as
many turnovers against her because she is such an excellent ball player.  
  
Q. How noticeable was that depth tonight, especially going up against a team
that already played one game?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought we had some stretches in the game where it was
pretty noticeable that we were able to get some baskets because we were maybe
a bit fresher.  
I thought our two point guards really did an outstanding job tonight, Jennifer
and Janee, one of the best games we've had them as a tandem. I thought they
were pretty relentless with pushing the basketball. That was something we
wrote on the board before the game, we wanted to be relentless in this game.
We wanted to push the basketball. We wanted to make pace a factor.  
Really, really pleased. Just excited for our team to have this opportunity. I
think we have an opportunity to advance tomorrow no matter who we play. I
think if we will just keep a great attitude and stay really hungry, we have an
outstanding chance. We want to advance.  
  
Q. Coach, nobody played more than 26 minutes. How big is that going forward
for saving legs?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we'll see. In theory it should be great. I have been to
a lot of these tournaments and I don't think you can make any guarantees. If
our players will recognize that we're stronger when all of us come together
and really give great effort, I think that it can be a great factor.  
But we just have to stay real focused. We have to continue to hustle. I
thought we did that. We have to really work hard on defense. I thought we did
that today, pushed the pace.  
It was really a fun day for our players. I thought they played together and
worked really hard. We just need to concentrate on what we know, will help us
be successful.  
But we certainly are planning on the depth being a factor in the tournament.
We want it to be.  
  
Q. You spoke specifically about the depth possibly playing a role in the
post. How pleased were you with the play of Azia and Samantha tonight?  
COACH MITCHELL: Gosh, I just thought they played beautifully. I thought it was
probably their best game, too, as a tandem. Many times they came in and
spelled Samarie and DeNesha. I thought we got tremendous production from them.
Azia Bishop continues to develop and play good basketball. That's huge for our
team. Samantha, had to be her best game of the season.  
We believe those two players are very talented. It's a great luxury for us to
have right now. We need to continue to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Do you see those kids coming off the bench maybe getting some confidence
that they didn't have midway through the season?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought since we made a commitment to it in Oxford, at the
Ole Miss game, I really noticed it in the practices leading up to that when we
said, Hey, here's the plan.  
Since then we've seen an energetic group. I would agree with that. I think
they do have some confidence. They should. They have performed well in three
straight games and it's really made a difference for our basketball team.  
I'm really happy with all of our players. We have a tremendous group of
players. I just want to see if we can advance tomorrow and do everything we
can to prepare to get that done.  
  
Q. How important is that cohesion with each five coming in? Is that why
you're doing that? Do you also feel confident you can mix and match a little
bit?  
COACH MITCHELL: We definitely can. We don't have to do five at a time.  
I think the second unit is confident right now because their roles have been
clearly defined. I think they are taking some pride of coming in as a unit and
being productive.  
We mixed it up some today. We didn't go five for five every time. We have some
really good combination on this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thanks, everybody.

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Georgia  71  
LSU  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia head coach Andy Landers and
student‑athletes Jasmine Hassell and Tiaria Griffin. We'll begin with an
opening comment from Coach Landers regarding the game tonight.  
COACH LANDERS: I think, first of all, we beat a very good basketball team
that's played very, very well lately. I'm really pleased with the way our team
focused in their preparation to play this game.  
They knew what they wanted to do. We went out and basically did that for the
better part of the 40 minutes. That doesn't mean that it all worked, but we
were doing what it was that we talked about and what we had practiced. I'm
really, really pleased with our basketball team, how hard they fought and how
well they executed.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tiaria, you're a freshman, but you took a three ‑pointer on the very
first shot of the first possession. Any hesitation at all?   
TIARIA GRIFFIN: No. I pretty much knew what we was going to do during the play
and I was just ready to shoot.  
  
Q. Jasmine, for the senior class, this is the last opportunity for you guys
to go out with a real statement. What does that mean to you and the rest of
the group?  
JASMINE HASSELL: It means a lot. Actually when we first got here, we had
meetings, our senior classmen did, as freshmen. Our theme was changed. Before
we leave here, we want to change it, we want to change it big by going out and
winning the SEC Championship.  
  
Q. Jasmine, you got an early foul in the first couple minutes of the game.
How did you turn that around and what did you do later in the first half and
the rest of the game to be so productive?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I didn't let it get to me. My teammates stepped up when I got
out. They carried it until I got back in there. I knew when I got back in
there it was time for me to go to work.  
  
Q. Jasmine, how important was it for y'all to jump on top of them as fast as
y'all did?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I mean, it's always good to get on top of a team because when
you there, you can keep your foot there.  
We just wanted to make sure we came out and made a statement.  
  
Q. What gives you the confidence that makes you think you can cut down the
nets on Sunday?  
JASMINE HASSELL: We work hard, we play hard. We play well as a team, we
execute, do what we need to do. I think we have a good chance.  
  
Q. Jasmine, can you talk about the passing that set up some of the
opportunities inside.  
JASMINE HASSELL: Yeah, our guys do an excellent job of executing the passes.
We practiced them. They did a great job of putting the ball where I needed to
score. If it wasn't for the guards, I never would have got the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Landers.  
  
Q. Seemed like y'all came out focused and intent. Can you comment about
that.  
COACH LANDERS: Yeah, I've just had a really good feeling about them all week.
They've listened. We prepared before we left Athens to some extent for both
Auburn and LSU. We really threw a lot of stuff at them, a lot of new stuff.  
You play in this league and you get scouted and everybody knows what you're
doing. I thought LSU did a really good job tonight in the second half of
adjusting to all of the new stuff. That's the league we play in.  
First I'll share this with you. We came over here. I told the kids before we
left Athens, You'll never sit out in that arena this week. Tell your mom and
dad you're on lockdown. We'll come in 35 minutes before the game to the
dressing room, put on tennis shoes, stretch, come out and play. We'll get in
the ice tub. 30 minutes from now we're going to get on the bus and go back
home.  
Tell your mom and dad you won't be back after the game. Tell them not to drop
by the hotel, your friends. That's the thing about playing close to home, you
have to get everything on lockdown because everybody knows everybody.  
So we came over, and doing that, they don't have their cell phones, they're
just locked in. We went to shoot around today. I told them, We're in a really
good place, man. We watched the game last night together at the hotel,
three‑tenths of a mile from here. I didn't want them to come over here. And
that was great because we weren't doing autographs.  
I could hear our kids talking, There it is, there it is. They were able to see
some of the things that we had worked on, how they were going to fit into the
game when we played against LSU.  
They really did a nice job of focusing.  
Sorry I rambled so long.  
  
Q. In the conversation we had before Georgia won at Kentucky back in early
February, the word you used to describe the Lady Bulldogs at that time was
'capable.' Where do you feel the team is right now?  
COACH LANDERS: I feel we're capable. I was right then and I'm right now. I
think we have a very capable basketball team.  
You're the one that's got the television show. You can figure out capable of
what. I'm just the coach. I just know we're capable (laughter).  
  
Q. What can you say about Griffin's shooting performance tonight, being her
first ever SEC tournament game?  
COACH LANDERS: I can say, Throw her the ball.  
Again, I watched her today at shoot around. She just wore it out. I watched
her yesterday. We didn't do shoot around here today. Yesterday we came in and
shot around for about 30 minutes. She was stroking it really, really good.  
But, you know, there's so much that goes into that. Did she hit the shots?
Yeah. But she moved to the right spots at the right time based on what her
teammates were doing. Her teammates identified no look, no look, and then
there she was, which is what we talked about. That's not open, that's not
open. She's going to be open. Came out first play, that's exactly what
happened. Looked here, looked there, Tiaria.  
You know, it took a lot of people to get Tiaria those shots, a lot of people
doing right things.  
  
Q. The lockdown that you talked about, how different is that for you in the
tournament?  
COACH LANDERS: I've done it before, on a couple of occasions actually. The
last couple years, it's not like we go to the tournament and party or
anything. We've actually come here and scouted games.  
What I've observed when we've tried to do that, and it's a great thing, but
there's so much going on in the building. They're looking around. They're
seeing people they know. They're eyeballing what somebody else on the other
team is wearing. It's easy to get distracted like that.  
Last night we had none of those distractions. We were just sitting in a room
with a television, and that's all. A bottle of water, focused. Nobody came in
and asked for an autograph. Nobody wished us good luck. It was pretty good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LANDERS: Thank you.

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

### [Theresa Plaisance](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24826)

### [Adrienne Webb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21770)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Georgia  71  
LSU  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU head coach Nikki Caldwell and
student‑athletes Theresa Plaisance and Adrienne Webb. We'll start with an
opening comment about the game from Coach Caldwell.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, first off I know we fell short of one of our goals,
which obviously was to advance and continue to play. But this team has
definitely been a team of many surprises.  
I'm still just proud of this group. They're a great bunch of young ladies. We
are a team that have enjoyed each other and we still got some more basketball
to be played.  
But a lot of credit to Georgia, the execution of their game plan.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Right from the start you were up against it. Was it hard to have some
faith that this time it was going to work out?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, giving all credit to Georgia, they set the tone coming
out. High intensity. We kind of dug ourselves a hole and really didn't bounce
back and pull our way out of the hole.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, I agree. They really set the tone out early, knocking
down three threes right off the bat. We dug ourselves a hole.  
That's something we've always done. We've never lost faith. We tried to fight
our way out of it. But they just kept executing their game plan. Things were
just going all their way.  
  
Q. Theresa, it seemed especially tough against Hassell tonight.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, that's one thing they did a really good job with this
game. They got her the ball down low a numerous amount of times. She
converted. They did a really great job tonight on the offensive and defensive
end. She was keeping plays alive for them. That's a momentum killer when you
have to play another 30 seconds of defense after an offensive rebound on their
part.  
That's a credit to her. She did a great job tonight, and they did a great job
of getting her the ball on the weak side, low post.  
  
Q. Now you go home, have a couple weeks to rest. NCAA tournament bid. Where
do you feel like you can go from here?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: You can only go up from here. Sure, can you take this loss as a
negative or you can take it as a positive as we can get better in these next
two weeks to prepare ourselves for the NCAA tournament.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: As a junior, you always want to leave out your senior year
with something that you look back on as a positive. This wasn't our strongest
game. This wasn't our strongest tournament, period.  
I want to make it my job personally to not let these seniors go out on this.
We're going to take these two weeks and put a lot of work in and get better on
the things we struggled with, make a good run in the tournament, because these
seniors deserve the best. They've given a lot to this program and this school
and we're not letting them go out like this.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Caldwell.  
  
Q. Can you give us any update on Shanece's condition?  
COACH CALDWELL: Right now obviously we're going to monitor her. She took a
pretty hard fall and a pretty tough bang, so we didn't want to run any risk
when you're dealing with anything to the head.  
We're just going to stay day‑to‑day and stay positive with her recovery.  
  
Q. Will she be able to return home with you tomorrow?  
COACH CALDWELL: At this point, I'm not for sure. I do not know. Hopefully she
will be able to.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on where you go from here. Not what you wanted, but you've
accomplished a lot. Take the big picture approach to the last month, NCAA
bid.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, I don't want this group to allow this game to basically
define who we are. We're a team that has the ability to play and beat some of
the best teams in the country.  
Georgia tonight had our number. They did a great job, like I said earlier, of
executing their game plan. But this was not our best performance by any
stretch.  
I feel like we got a lot of looks at the basket. We didn't do what we needed
to do as far as knocking down shots. But on the flipside of it defensively,
when you lose Shanece McKinney, one of our better low post defenders, I do
think that plays a role. I also think losing her off the boards.  
So we had to really play small against a very talented and bigger team.  
So we hope to get her back and get back to what got us to this point in the
first place, which is how we defended and rebounded the basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH CALDWELL: Thank you.

### [Meighan Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24840)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  82  
Florida  73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee head coach Holly Warlick,
student‑athletes Meighan Simmons and Cierra Burdick. We'll take an opening
comment from the coach.  
COACH WARLICK: Hard‑fought game. It's survive and advance. These young ladies
found a way to win. We played in spurts. We got to go back and defend the ball
a whole lot better.  
Proud of their effort and to finish the game with a win.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Meighan, going back to Sunday's game, you really looked rushed against
Kentucky. When you came out today, you pushed the tempo and really that gave
you that advantage. Could you contrast the difference in those two games.  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: It was a major difference I think.  
COACH WARLICK: We came out a lot more hungry this game. We had a lot of high
energy from the coaches on down.  
We started off, you know, a little slow, but after a while we picked it up and
played each four‑minute segments, made sure we did the little things out there
on the floor. That kind of gave us an advantage and pushing the tempo, like
you said, made sure we played Tennessee basketball. When we do that, the game
goes good for us and it's a great game for all of us.  
  
Q. Cierra, talk about the team's performance.  
CIERRA BURDICK: I think on the offensive end, we're just talented. We've got a
bunch of people that can score the basketball. That's one of our strong points
as a team.  
So if we just continue to share the basketball the way we are, I think we'll
be successful down the line. We've got to continue to pick it up on defense,
because offense is not our problem, it's the defensive end.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach Warlick.  
  
Q. Was that a point of emphasis, to come out and force the tempo?  
COACH WARLICK: It was. We wanted to push the ball in a make or miss. We wanted
a fast‑tempo game. I thought we set the tone early. I thought Florida did a
great job of adjusting. They went to a zone.  
We wanted to stack on the offensive end and I thought for the most part the
first part of the game, we did.  
But we've got to go back to the drawing board. We got to get down and defend
some people. We're not going to always out‑score people. We've got to make
defense our priority.  
I thought the first 10 minutes we set the tone and then we just get
comfortable. We get a lead and we get comfortable. We've got to have that
killer instinct in us and finish the game the way we start the game.  
  
Q. Holly, you want to force the fast tempo, your team seems to play well
offensively when it does that, yet you have to balance that with your lack of
depth playing three games in three days possibly. How do you do that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, Florida is a great basketball team. They're physical.
They're athletic. Amanda does a great job. I would have liked to have played
more people. But I just didn't see the opportunity to do that.  
Yeah, it comes to strategy now. Are we going to have legs to push the game we
want to play the next game and the next game? We just got to dig deep. We're
not going to go away from our game plan. Got to use probably more time‑outs
and more strategic plans.  
Pushing the ball in a fast tempo is what got us there. We can't go away from
that now. I thought towards the end, we almost backed off too early. But it
worked out.  
But, yeah, we're going to have to really be strategic in what we do in
time‑outs and get people some minutes.  
It was a hard‑fought game, and I knew it would be. Florida is competitive and
they're trying to get in the tournament. They're a tough opponent to play. We
knew that from the get‑go.  
  
Q. That's what was puzzling about the Kentucky game in that you do like to
play fast tempo and they wanted to play fast tempo as well. You guys just
looked rushed instead of fast. How do you explain that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we weren't very good (laughter). I don't know what else
to say. We were bad. We regrouped. It was not a good game for us. You can't
win a game if you turn the ball over 31, 32 times. I lost count after 25. 31,
there you go.  
We went back and I think we learned from that. I think for the most part
today, I don't know how many turnovers we ended up with, but first half we had
six I think. This team is young. We're going to continue to learn. But we
weren't ready. We came off a big game against Texas A&M. You go into a hostile
environment against Kentucky. We were not ready for that.  
I think as long as we learn from it and it's a teaching point and a teaching
moment, then I'll take that. So I think it got us refocused. I'm not real sure
if we would have beat Kentucky there, if we would have had the focus we had
today against a very good Florida team.  
We're always living in the moment and learning from how we can get better. As
a coach, we want to make sure, our staff make sure, that we continue to get
these kids better. We got to get better before tomorrow. We got to get a
better mental game and get some rest.  
Whichever team we play, it's going to be physical, up and down. It's part of
this tournament. It's part of most of how the teams in the SEC play. It's up
and down. It's physical. It's fast. Everybody has to do that.  
You got to play back‑to‑backs to get the job done. We just got to suck it up
and figure out what we need to do to get it done.  
  
Q. Because of that, might you stress rest more while you're down here? Are
you talking to the players about that? Are they listening?  
COACH WARLICK: The biggest thing that we do for these kids is we snatch their
cell phones. They got to rest. They can't get on the phone, stay up late.  
They know we're going to get them rest. We get them off their feet, make sure
they're in their rooms. After this, we're going to go and take ice baths,
everybody has to get in an ice bath. Not the coaches, thank goodness
(laughter).  
We're doing what I think we need to do to make sure that they get rest because
that's what it's all about. You get past this game, you survive and advance.
So now we're advancing. Now our focus is on one of these two teams. Rest is
going to be huge for us because of our lack of depth.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.

### [Ashley Bruner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23259)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Ieasia Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21773)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  61  
South Carolina  52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and
student‑athletes Ieasia Walker and Ashley Bruner. Coach Staley, if you could
make a few comments about today's game.  
COACH STALEY: I thought it was a hard‑fought game by both teams. Unfortunately
for us, we weren't able to make layups and free throws. I thought we turned
the ball over a little bit too much.  
But really proud of our players and their effort, how hard they played. I know
they wanted to win. Sometimes you got to make plays to win. But I surely am
really proud of the effort, especially these two up here, two seniors who gave
it their all for four years for this conference. So my hat goes off to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ashley, you were talking about yesterday how fired up you were to get in
the game. Were you a little too excited in the beginning of the game?  
ASHLEY BRUNER: No, I didn't go into the game hyped up because that's what I
did last game. I was trying to keep calm, be collected when the game was
starting.  
  
Q. It seemed like Kelsey goes down with a knee injury. You don't want to see
somebody get hurt, but the game was tied. You had an opportunity there, then
they ran off 14 points. What happened during that stretch?  
IEASIA WALKER: We didn't execute. We turned the ball over a good amount of the
time and they were able to capitalize off our turnovers. They got a lot of
their baskets off of points in the paint, just us overplaying or making
mistakes, overpassing or something like that. They were able to build their
lead back up.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Obviously this isn't the way you want it to end here, but you have the
NCAA announcement coming up. What do you do for the next week?  
COACH STALEY: We'll take a few days off. Our players, their bodies need to
recover a little bit. We need to stay active.  
We'll probably get back into it midweek just to work on some things, work on
executing in the halfcourt, continue to keep our defense sharp and our
rebounding.  
Then we wait. I think we're fortunate in that our body of work has done enough
to feel real good about our names being called on Selection Monday.  
  
Q. Following up on what Ieasia was saying there, when they went on the run
there in the second half, what did you see going on with your guys?  
COACH STALEY: You know, I thought we shot ourselves in the foot because they
were shooting in the bonus very early in the second half. We couldn't play the
defense that we're used to playing because they were shooting in the bonus.  
But I just thought they pounded the ball inside. I thought Gilbert really
challenged us. She was really a hard matchup for us tonight, got some easy
buckets.  
What I saw was them pounding the ball inside where we were oversized and
overmatched.  
  
Q. Elem only had two points today. It seemed like she let herself be backed
down by their taller post players or was she just not getting clean looks?  
COACH STALEY: I don't think we got Elem the ball as much as we got her the
ball yesterday. But they are big.  
What she did was she kept one of their post players honest. That way we'll
have one‑on‑one action in our places on the floor. It just came down to us
making layups. We can count how many layups we missed, then we missed 10 free
throws. If we can just make layups, I think the game would probably be a
little bit better. I don't know if we'll win the basketball game, but
certainly it would put them back on their heels and make it more interesting.  
  
Q. Your two seniors contributed quite a bit today. When you look back on
their year, their career, was it surprising or unsurprising to see what they
did today?  
COACH STALEY: No, I mean, it's not surprising at all. They did what they're
supposed to do, which is lead our basketball team by example. I thought
emotionally they led us. I think you look at the stats. They led us in their
experience. They've been here before. They are very familiar with this
environment.  
I just hope the younger players were kind of taking in the moment because
they'll have their day and hopefully they'll be put in the position where we
can take this a little bit further, winning an SEC Championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

## March 8, 2013

  

### [Jaterra Bonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24807)

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Sydney Moss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24842)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  82  
Florida  73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Florida head coach Amanda Butler and
student‑athletes Jaterra Bonds and Sydney Moss. We'll start with an opening
comment from Coach Butler.  
COACH BUTLER: We're obviously very disappointed. We didn't come here to play
close or make it respectable, with any other expectation except to win.  
Tennessee did a great job of getting themselves to the free‑throw line and
really capitalized on those opportunities.  
We did a below average job of defense in the first half. In our locker room,
we thought that was the story of the game. Played a tough and gutsy second
half. Against a good team, you can't pick and choose. You have to bring it
possession by possession. Have to give credit to Tennessee the way they played
throughout.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney, can you talk about your mindset going in against Tennessee.  
SYDNEY MOSS: My 22 points was because of my teammates. They found me really
well. I was being aggressive. So my mindset was just kind of being aggressive
and finishing, so...  
  
Q. You trailed by seven when Simmons went out with four fouls. Do you think
that was an opportunity for you?  
JATERRA BONDS: Restate the question. I didn't understand what you were asking.  
  
Q. When Simmons went out with four fouls, you trailed by only 7. Do you
think that was an opportunity that was lost?  
JATERRA BONDS: Whether she was on or off the court didn't dictate what we were
doing. We didn't execute offensively and defensively. Whether she was on the
court or not didn't factor into what we were trying to do. That answers your
question.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Butler.  
  
Q. Going forward, what do you want your players to take away from this?  
COACH BUTLER: The brief conversation we had in the locker room, and we'll have
much more in‑depth ones as we go into the next phase for us, we still got a
lot of learning to do, a lot of growing up to do in terms of how to bring your
best over and over and over again, possession to possession to possession,
half to half.  
We still have too many people that play a great second half or lead us in the
first half and then are nowhere to be found the second half. That process of
learning what my best is, and I think we're getting closer to realizing that,
doing a better job of being more self‑aware. What my best is and how I
continually put that at the forefront, that's where we're at.  
We're not as consistent with that as we should be.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  61  
South Carolina  52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M head coach Gary Blair and
student‑athletes Kristi Bellock and Karla Gilbert. We'll begin with an opening
comment from head coach Gary Blair.  
COACH BLAIR: First, if I'm Steve Spurrier, I'm Kevin Sumlin. That was almost
as physical as the football games are going to be in the SEC.  
I really think both teams played very good defense. They got a few extra
shots, but they usually do because they're the best offensive rebounding team
we faced all year ‑ until tomorrow.  
But our kids, we got into foul trouble. My bench saved us. They were not
scoring, but allowed us to play some big‑time minutes. Karla, that's the most
minutes she's probably played in conference play. She held her own, got to the
foul line, made five out of six, whatever. Bellock had her work cut out down
there on Welch or Bruner. But she keeps plugging away, plugging away. She hit
the crucial free throws.  
Finally the last play of the game, we knew Bone was finished, so we called a
play called Auburn. That's when normally Kelsey goes down on screen, Bellock
comes high and we throw it and dunk it in. But Bone was completely worn out.
We ran it for Bellock, and she hit that turnaround shot in the lane. I thought
that was the play that got us over the hump.  
I'm going to go back in history real quick. In 1996, I helped coach the Jones
Cup team. Dawn Staley, if I'm not mistaken, was the point guard on one of the
very best teams ever. We took the Jones Cup team over and we convinced a
little girl from South Carolina named Shannon Johnson to come in and be our
fifth guard and be the defensive player as well as the offense, because at
South Carolina she was an offensive player.  
Peewee came in, it reminded me so much how Dawn Staley played the game. All of
a sudden I was just thinking back to the history, because we had Katie Smith,
Rizzotti, Tina Thompson, great players, all that. I remember it was a little
girl from South Carolina that came in. She was our Energizer Bunny, sort of
what we have like with Jordan Jones coming off the bench.  
That has nothing to do with today's game, but that's how well South Carolina
is coached, and they play just like their coach played.  
I think it says a lot for basketball. When I was in the SEC 10 years ago, the
best day in basketball is this day, the quarterfinals, when you see eight
teams that are all top 25, that are all going to the dance, playing each
other. It doesn't get any better. If I'm a spectator, I want to see all four
of them, and I will see all four of them.  
But I've got to get this team, get some energy back into them. I'm proud of
our kids right here. Our post play I thought was a lot of the difference in
the ballgame. We only turned it over 11 times.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Karla, could you talk about how important depth was for this team as you
continue through the post ‑season.   
KARLA GILBERT: Basically the bench is important. We don't have a lot of
40‑minute players, so it's important for people to come off the bench and be
ready and become part of the chemistry that has already been made during the
game.  
If we keep doing what we're supposed to be doing, we should be okay for the
rest of the season.  
  
Q. Could you look ahead to tomorrow's game.  
KRISTI BELLOCK: I'm really excited about that game. The first time around, it
wasn't a good game for us. I hope tomorrow will be a better game. We just need
to come out with more energy, get them off the boards, run our offense, do
what we do, not let them dictate how we play.  
KARLA GILBERT: Going along with Kristi, everybody is excited about playing
tomorrow Tennessee. When we were there last time, our shots weren't falling.
We couldn't crash the boards like we wanted to. We want to make a new empty
slate and start all over from this game forward.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how important it is for your team to get off to a
fast start, get the lead early. You did that tonight. How important was that
in this game?  
COACH BLAIR: We've done it all year. Very few times have we started the game
behind. I think our kids execute the game plan, take what the defense is
giving to us. Then sometimes we lose it either due to foul trouble or good
play by our opponent or whatever.  
I thought the key in the ballgame was we were able to withstand what they were
able to do offensively. When we had the big lead, we had Bellock and Bone over
on the sideline, I thought that was key.  
We went into halftime 3, we were barely surviving on the offensive end, but
playing good defense. Coach Starkey had his team ready to play and did an
excellent job of preparing this team.  
The key to South Carolina is always Walker. They got very good post players,
but I thought we did as good of a job as we could on Walker, and sometimes you
wear out. But like a good senior, she wants that basketball, and she was
trying to make things happen. Sometimes turnovers happen or missed shots
happen.  
I know this isn't part of your question, but I believe we only gave up one
offensive rebound on a missed free throw. That's where they beat you 'cause
they know they're going to miss 'em. I was always hoping for Bruner to be
there instead of Welch. We really concentrated on that today, making sure we
blocked out, tried not to give them that second chance.  
  
Q. Coming into this last game, you lost four out of the last five. What does
this do to right the ship, get you back in the right direction?  
COACH BLAIR: Don't forget, South Carolina lost three out of six coming into
the tournament, too. In February and March, if you can string three in a row
together, like LSU got six in a row, we were part of that, it's hard 'cause
we're all dying right now.  
We needed this win bad. We played very well against Tennessee at their place.
Trouble was we couldn't stop them inside and they couldn't stop us inside. So
it was a great offensive game, similar to what he saw with Florida and
Tennessee.  
Now, we've got to start playing good. We do not want to back in to hosting the
NCAA tournament. We're going to work hard. We're going to have a great crowd.
Last year we were the second best draw for our sub‑regional next to Notre
Dame, and hopefully the same thing can happen.  
Until then, I read our stats, when we've been the fourth seed, we won the Big
12 twice. That's our goal right now, is to win this tournament. But our goal
is to play a Tennessee that shares the ball so well. Williams is an energy
player, with Simmons and Spani spotting up out there, Massengale driving hard
to the board, Burdick killed us last time. We have our work cut out.  
But South Carolina got us ready to play Tennessee. We're going to have a great
rivalry over the year between Dawn's team and our team because I love the way
she coaches the defensive end, and hopefully she likes the way we coach the
defensive end.  
You got two good ball clubs, and you definitely got two top‑20 teams right
there. I think both of us have a chance to get that Sweet 16.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  76|  
Vanderbilt  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb and
student‑athletes Jasmine Lister and Tiffany Clarke. We'll begin with an
opening comment from coach.  
COACH BALCOMB: Not a lot to say. I just really think the best thing to say is
Kentucky's defense to start the game was really good, really aggressive,
really physical, created a lot of offense off their defense. Just pretty much
want to give them credit for how they came out and attacked us right away and
put us on our heels. Then we just tried to fight back the rest of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. At times during the game, there were spurts when things went well for you
and other spurts where they didn't go so well. Could you talk about when
things went well what was happening that allowed you to do that.  
TIFFANY CLARKE: I think when things went well, we were just playing Vanderbilt
basketball. We were playing like we knew how to play. Then when they stepped
up their intensity, they went on their runs, I think we kind of lost sight of
what we do and started playing Kentucky basketball instead of sticking to how
we know how to play.  
JASMINE LISTER: Going along with Tiffany, definitely our runs came from
getting stops on defense, going fast to slow, kicking out, playing what we
know how to do.  
On the flipside, when we sped up, wanted to play like them, then we turned the
ball over and we weren't getting stops and letting them attack us those runs.  
  
Q. Kentucky has a five ‑for‑five substitution pattern. Can you talk about
what it's like to play against that. It's almost a new team every four
minutes.   
JASMINE LISTER: I mean, they keep them fresh. They all go hard the entire time
they're in, so you've got to give them credit for that.  
It's a mentality for us that we just have to keep playing harder and harder,
not let that get into our heads that there's new people coming in to guard us.
We just need to stay focused on our game plan and deal with what we have.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. The same question for you that I asked your players: what was the
difference between the good spurts and the times when Kentucky made some more
distance, separation?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think what Jas said is correct. A lot of it had to do with
tempo, what we were trying to do. At the same time I think we won games
recently. We've been on a 5‑2 run since we played Kentucky last time. It's
been because of our defense and our rebounding.  
I felt like every time we did make a run and we took care of the ball, got the
ball inside to Tiff, got a good shot for somebody, then we didn't get the stop
on defense that we needed. We fouled them, sent them to the free‑throw line.
They attacked.  
We made mistakes when we couldn't afford to make mistakes. They were mental
breakdowns we couldn't afford at that point in the second half with the runs.  
  
Q. Coach, you played five freshmen today. How important is it going forward
for the program to get those freshmen experience playing in the SEC
tournament?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it's really important. I was really pleased with their
progress over the last month. Since the last time we played Kentucky, we look
like a different team because we've been playing the freshmen more when Foggie
went down. It gave opportunities for the guards. You saw J.J. and Morgan step
up, just like Heather did early when Steph went down. When you had Katie and
Foggie, you had that, then the guards got more experience.  
I also like what Kendall was able to do in the tournament, tried to play her
more minutes. I think she's intimidating on defense. I think offensively
obviously she can score and give us good size.  
I'm pleased with their progress. I think at key times they made some mental
mistakes that hurt us. But I think they're going to keep getting better. Like
I said, hopefully they'll continue to play and get them even more experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thanks a lot.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

South Carolina  77  
Alabama  35

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley,
student‑athletes Ieasia Walker and Elem Ibiam. We'll let Coach Staley make an
opening comment about the game.  
COACH STALEY: I thought we played extremely well. I thought we played with a
lot of energy, especially our second half. Second half is something we've
really been concentrating on, getting off to better starts. I thought our
players really concentrated on taking care of the basketball, getting the ball
inside, taking care of mismatches that we had on the floor, taking advantage,
and we put a total 40 minutes together.  
THE MODERATOR: Ieasia.  
IEASIA WALKER: I think this was a good game for us. We got to play everybody.
Everybody got to feel what it's like to play in the SEC tournament. We took
good shots. Knocking down our open shots. I think teams won't necessarily play
us in zone, see they have to play man. Our inside game is also working.  
THE MODERATOR: Elem.  
ELEM IBIAM: I think we all came out and played well together. We all knew what
was on the line. We were pretty much focused and ready to go. I think it went
well for us today.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Elem, it seemed like you were making a deliberate effort to go inside
early in the game. Can you talk about coming off the bench and replacing that
effort going against Alabama with a smaller lineup.  
ELEM IBIAM: Always try to come in and feed off their energy. I try to come in,
keep the momentum up, feed off of them.  
So they found me open on the inside and the shots were just falling today, so
it just worked out.  
  
Q. What kind of confidence builder is a game like this for another shot at
Texas A &M?   
IEASIA WALKER: I think it shows that we can make a team effort to play Texas
A&M better this time. I don't think we were shooting very well that game. To
come out hitting shots on this floor on our first night here is good. We found
what plays were working for us.  
We got out to a lead, so that allowed us to rest some of our starters. We'll
pretty much be fresh for tomorrow. So I think it will be a great competition
tomorrow against them.  
ELEM IBIAM: Like Ieasia said, it was a good confidence builder for us. We know
what we have to do from the last game. We have to come out stronger and I
think we're just prepared for that.  
  
Q. How important will an inside game be?  
ELEM IBIAM: I think it will be crucial. We have to get defensive stops early.
Also on the offensive boards, make sure we're making plays.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for CoachStaley.  
  
Q. Seems like y'all came out with a conscious effort to pound the ball into
the post. For this game with their guard lineup was this much more of
something that you wanted to do?  
COACH STALEY: We knew where the mismatches were. Against Alabama, they are
very athletic on the perimeter. I think they're kind of undersized. We're
undersized, but I don't think their post players are used to playing defense
on the block.  
I thought we really made a conscious effort to get that ball in the paint and
allow our post players to kind of open the game up for us.  
Usually we open the game up by hitting shots from the outside. But I thought
we worked from the inside out and it worked out where everybody got a chance
to get shots fluidly and knock them down.  
  
Q. With Texas A &M coming up, shooting better is obviously one thing you
want to do against them. Is there anything else from this game that you take
into that game?  
COACH STALEY: We're going to take the winning streak into tomorrow. I think
it's very important. We came down here to win an SEC Championship. If it's
Alabama, Texas A&M is up next, we feel real good about where we are. We're
focused in on what we need to do to try to get that SEC Championship,
something our program has yet to achieve.  
So however we need to play, however many buckets we need to get, rebounds we
need to get, how many hustle plays we need to make, we'll be up for the
challenge to make those.  
  
Q. Texas A &M lost three straight. Do you think they're dealing with a lack
of confidence. How can you take advantage of that?  
COACH STALEY: I think they had a longer break. I think they probably have
reevaluated some things. Just looking at the games they lost, they haven't
shot the ball well. When you don't shoot the ball well in this particular
league, you can lose basketball games.  
I think we are a victim of not going able to shoot the ball well, especially
in those type of games when you go against teams that can put it in the hole.  
I think it came down to putting it in the hole, and they didn't. Hopefully we
can keep that streak going for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

South Carolina  77  
Alabama  35

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Alabama head coach Wendell Hudson,
student‑athletes Daisha Simmons, Nikki Hegstetter. We'll take an opening
comment from coach.  
COACH HUDSON: Well, I thought we had some really good opportunities the first
half. We missed some shots that was open, had the game there, a 28‑18 game. We
had certainly some opportunities in the second half.  
But South Carolina did a good job. Missed some shots. They did a good job
transitioning. I think playing that game last night, yesterday afternoon, kind
of wore us out a little bit. The effort and intensity level that we needed to
have wasn't always there.  
It's hard when you play back to back like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Daisha?  
DAISHA SIMMONS: I think we could have did a much better job. It's always a
disappointment going out like that. All we can do now is look forward to next
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Nikki?  
NIKKI HEGSTETTER: I thought we gave a lot of effort, but I think we have a lot
of work to do in the off‑season. It gives us an opportunity we don't want to
have this feeling again. It sends us into the off‑season with a little push.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could reflect on the season you had this year.  
COACH HUDSON: I thought we went through some ups and downs. We were in a bunch
of games and we didn't finish a lot of them. That's kind of one of those
things that you look at the season, the ups and downs, not finishing, not
going through and doing some of the things we need to do.  
I think Nikki hit the nail on the head: we have a lot of work to do in the
off‑season. I think if we get that done, get that across, so we don't have
this feeling this early. They'll be playing this early in the tournament. I
think that's a big key also.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Vanderbilt  53  
Missouri  40

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Missouri is head coach Robin Pingeton and
Morgan Eye and Liz Smith. We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH PINGETON: Well, obviously disappointed. I felt like we put ourselves in
a pretty good position despite the fact we gave up too many offensive rebounds
in that first half. We were able to get up 7 in the second half. Felt like we
had a breakdown in our defensive assignments, then I sensed a lot of deflation
on our team.  
We just had a hard time regrouping from that point. You saw a very experienced
veteran Vandy team who obviously there's a reason they've been to the NCAA
tournament I think the last 11 years. They were pretty steady. They weathered
the storm through the good and the bad.  
They've got a first‑team all conference player who is pretty good in Clarke
and a strong supporting cast.  
We're just not quite there yet. We'll just have to continue to learn, grow and
get better. Hopefully we'll have a chance to get to that post‑season in the
WNIT, get a few more games under our belt and get more experience.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Liz, you had 16 and 8 after the game. What is it like putting it all out
on the floor in a game like this?  
LIZ SMITH: Before the game we were all preparing. My mindset in this game is
this is the last game of my career, I'm going to put it all out there no
matter what. Tomorrow is never guaranteed. That was my mindset and I was going
to go out fighting.  
I know we're going to keep going that way.  
  
Q. If you want to talk about that turning point in the game. You had a 7
‑point lead, then they went on an 18‑0 run. Talk about that.   
MORGAN EYE: I know myself personally, I let No.10, who is an excellent
shooter, I held in on the post when I should have stayed out on her. I know I
had a few mistakes. I drove in the lane once, took a bad shot, then I drove in
the lane again, bad pass to Bri. I think those were back‑to‑back possessions
that were just bad possession for us and we weren't able to get any points
from it.  
LIZ SMITH: Yeah, at that point I think we could have stayed more true to our
offense, setting more screens for our guards, which is on me. Just getting in
the flow of things. I think at that point they really dug in on the post and
they were hopping off a lot. It was hard to get an in.  
Yeah, they had a run in there that we should have taken care of.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like the back ‑to‑back threes was the turning point. Can you
talk about those and how it seemed to shift the momentum.   
COACH PINGETON: Yeah, I agree with you. I think that was absolutely the
turning point. I just don't think we responded very well to that. They were
spot up good looks at the basket. We just absolutely had a breakdown in our
defensive assignments and didn't weather that very well.  
In tournament games this time of the year, it's going to be a game of runs,
highs, lows, but you got to continue to play in the present and not allow that
kind of deflation to set in.  
I really felt like it got the best of us and we just did not respond or
regroup from that point on.  
  
Q. Talk about the first half with Vanderbilt getting the offensive rebounds
that they were. You couldn't get your hands on it. But they only went 6 for
35. Do you feel rebounding was a big issue there?  
COACH PINGETON: Something that we've been pretty solid with all year long is
our transition. When you give up second‑ and third‑shot opportunities, I think
there's a little bit of deflation that sets in.  
But I think really what hurt us tonight more than anything, it's kind of been
our Achilles' heel all year long, they had 20 points off our turnovers. I
liked our defensive game plan coming in. We had a couple breakdowns. Just felt
like we had some good looks. The ball wasn't falling for us tonight.  
Gosh, every possession is big, especially when you're not shooting the ball
very well. I think they ended up having 11 more possessions than we did, but
20 points off your turnovers, that's going to come back to hurt you.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup zone. Seemed like it really kind of caused
them a lot of problems. What did you see going into the game?  
COACH PINGETON: No doubt about it. They've got some tremendous basketball
players on the perimeter and with Clarke on the inside. We just really felt
like, you know, not knowing what Foggie's status was going to be going into
the game, if she was going to play or not, we could pass around their shooters
and really be conscientious of their inside game.  
We felt like offensively they weren't quite as explosive in their motion sets
as they were their man sets that would allow us to help inside a little bit
more with Clarke, who is such a tremendous player for them.  
So, you know, I liked our game plan. I really did. I felt like it was a good
game plan. We didn't box out very well out of it.  
Even in the second half, we lost our shooters a couple times. But I think I'd
do it the same way all over again, to be honest with you. We had a hard time
knocking down shots today. Didn't get to the free‑throw line as much as we
would have liked. When we had good looks, we didn't convert.  
Again, give them credit. They played well defensively. Switched on a lot of
screens. Even when they had their little point guard on Liz, she battled,
played with a lot of toughness. Made it hard for Liz to get deep post‑ups.
Give Vandy a lot of credit.  
  
Q. If you just want to mention in short your experience first year in the
SEC now that it's all over.  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I've got a tremendous respect for this league. A lot of
people think it's the best league in the country, and I'm certainly one of
those people.  
It's hard when you change leagues, especially compiled with a very young and
inexperienced team. I think it makes it really challenging.  
Playing in new venues against new personnel, no matter how much tape you
watch, I think until you go through it in person, it's really hard to get a
feel for.  
Personnel and systems and style of play. You know, first time you go to
Tennessee, we've talked about this, awestruck. Playing at Vandy, tough venue
to play in if you haven't been there before. There's certainly been some
challenges.  
We're really looking forward to it. We've got a lot of work to do ahead of us.
We've got a lot of areas that we need to improve on. But I think the first
year in a new league with a young team, I'm proud of our young ladies. We're
looking forward to really getting after it in the off‑season and improving as
a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Keira Peak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24808)

### [Sarah Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21759)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Florida  64  
Arkansas  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Arkansas is head coach Tom Collen, Keira
Peak and Sarah Watkins. We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH COLLEN: I'd like first to congratulate the University of Florida. I
thought they played a good basketball game. Obviously we just played them down
there, and it was a great game. We went out, lots of runs back and forth. Give
them credit, they made big plays down the stretch, they came from behind. You
got to give them credit for the win.  
It was a big game I think for both of us. I think both of us feel we were on
the NCAA bubble trying to find a way to prove that we belong in the NCAA
tournament. I think we knew the winner of this game probably had the
opportunity to be a little bit higher on the bubble.  
So Florida has earned that right and they'll go on and hopefully do whatever
they need to do to get in the NCAA tournament and represent the SEC. If they
do, we'll be their biggest fans, even though we might not like them right now.  
So we give them credit.  
As far as our team goes, I got a great basketball team. This team has played
tough all year long. I've said this over the last two weeks: I know there's a
lot of things that have to happen for you to get in the NCAA tournament.
Realistically speaking we probably with this loss today might not get invited.  
But the one thing I can say about the SEC and this team, without any doubt in
my mind, the University of Arkansas is good enough to get in the NCAA and get
in and win games and advance.  
But the criteria is the criteria. You have to do what you have to do in order
to make that easy.  
I'm proud of my team. They came from behind several times in this game. They
did everything that I asked them to do. We just came up a basket or two short.
That's kind of been the story of this team all year long against top‑notch
opponents, especially in the SEC.  
THE MODERATOR: Keira.  
KEIRA PEAK: It was by far a tough loss. It was just hard 'cause we knew we
could go out there and if we played our hardest, we would win.  
We just fell short the last few possessions or whatever.  
THE MODERATOR: Sarah.  
SARAH WATKINS: We've had a great season in the SEC. We haven't come out with a
lot of wins that we thought we should have had. Played a lot of close games.
It's just another game that slipped out of our hands that we didn't finish the
way we should have. Maybe could have gotten the win if we tightened up on some
turnovers. The SEC is a tough conference to play in.  
COACH COLLEN: I guess I'm going to repeat myself here again. If there's no
media here this is probably not going to go out on the news wires.  
I think the SEC is the best conference in the country, no doubt about it.
There's no conference in the country that could try to argue in this
particular year. We've had five teams ranked in the top 15 all year long in
the polls and RPI. No other conference comes close to that. With LSU moving up
in the polls, now they're sixth.  
This conference is good enough to get nine or 10 teams in. Realistically
speaking, I don't think it's going to happen. I think some of us are going to
have to try to win the NIT. But this is the best conference in the country,
and hopefully the NCAA committee will take notice and decide they want to put
the best 64 teams in the tournament.

### [Adrienne Webb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21770)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

LSU  65  
Auburn  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by LSU head coach Nikki Caldwell, and student
athletes Adrienne Webb and Teresa Plaisance. Coach, if you want to start with
an opening comment.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, I was glad that the buzzer finally sounded. I thought if
there was a few more minutes, the way that Auburn really fought back, how hard
they played, the outcome of the game definitely could have been different.  
But I was proud of our team for hanging in there. We talked about the things
that we got to be better at immediately. But this team is a team that has
shown determination and has shown that even with their backs against the wall,
in a serious and clutch situation, they were able to pull out a win.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Adrienne, can you talk about the three ‑pointer that you hit that seemed
to stop their momentum.   
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, I know that we needed a basket at that time and at that
moment. I just thought in the back of my mind, I have to make this shot. This
is a momentum changer. They were coming back on us.  
But we still had the lead. This will put us up even more, give us that
momentum to push through and get the stop on the defensive end.  
Just seeing it go through the net really gave me, Okay, we got to get this
stop, we got to get this stop.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it at the end of the game not to be able to score
points?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: It's frustrating when you can't put the ball in the basket. We
were getting looks. It's frustrating when the ball plays on the rim a little
and then comes out.  
We composed ourselves enough to knock down our free throws but also get stops
on the other end towards the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like it was a tale of two halves. Talk about your team's
resolve.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, we knew in the second half that Auburn was going to come
back and really get after us. They did just that. I thought their 1‑2‑2
interrupted us. They were able to get some turnovers, easy transition baskets.
Our inability to take care of the basketball gave them the momentum they
needed.  
Our team, we've come off of a nice little stretch here, a nice high, if you
will, when you think about what we've been able to do over a two‑and‑a‑half,
three‑week span.  
As a coach, you worry about, Is your team going to have enough in them to come
back? That's always been our case.  
But I felt as though even though we were playing the last three minutes of the
game, we had a little bit of a cushion. Up until that point, we were doing
some really nice things on the defensive end where we weren't scoring and
neither were they. Once their pressure got to us, they started to make their
run.  
But our team is learning. We're still growing. We're learning how to play in
situations where we're up and then be able to still hold off a great team like
Auburn.  
  
Q. Could you talk about playing Georgia a little bit, the victory that
started this streak a month ago.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, Georgia is a team that we are very familiar with, as
they are with us. When you play a team twice, it's always difficult to come
back and try to get that second win. It's going to be a tough matchup for us.  
We did some good things. We were home. We had just came off of a loss to
Tennessee that we felt if we'd have done some things we could have controlled
that one. So our team had a different motivation about them going into the
Georgia game about a month ago.  
The big question mark is going to be, which LSU team is going to show up? Is
it going to be the team that reeled off these victories of late or the team
that's just happy to be here?  
  
Q. Theresa, late in the game you were getting some looks, they were making
plays. Was it kind of surreal the way the game was unfolding?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: That's just a testament to Auburn's play. They fought to
the very last seconds of the game. When things weren't going our way, we
weren't doing the little things to turn it around and help it go our way.
Buckling down on defense. She got that shot over me, like two seconds left on
the shot clock. Just little things like that we have to control over and
change those things to help our game turn around and help us for the
betterment.  
  
Q. Coach, I know earlier this year you had some very difficult stretches. As
you look back on it, what would you say are the things that have gotten better
to cause you to be in a position where you are today?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, when you bring a new group together, we've got four
freshmen at the time, we've got really three players who saw a lot of minutes
the previous year, everybody's trying to find their way. We were trying to,
what is our cohesion?  
The one difference is this team has been a team of late, where we've been
unselfish, sharing the basketball, supporting each other on the defensive end.
We started to like playing defense where we're not overextended, not
overrotating our defense, so our rebounding coverage became better.  
When we're rebounding the basketball, a better defensive team, we feel
offensively we have enough weapons that we can put some points on the board.  
Those are the things that, as of late, I saw a big difference. It really
started at South Carolina. Even though we lost that game, that's when I
thought our team was really turning the corner as far as being a team.  
  
Q. Talk about the spark Pedersen gave you off the bench.  
COACH CALDWELL: Anne Pedersen is a player that has just accepted her role for
this team. There's games where she has not played. There's games where she's
had limited minutes.  
Today, this was an opportunity for her to shine. Her teammates did a great job
of finding her, getting her those open looks. More importantly, Anne was
playing to her strengths. When she does that, she definitely is a plus for us,
she's a positive, and she can help us.  
I thought once we broke their press, she had some good looks along the
baseline, she knocked those shots down. Those were key for us. We only have
eight players. So when your name is called, the accountability factor is even
more so because you can't keep looking down the bench and looking down the
bench.  
  
Q. Did the big lead work against you? You're trying to conserve energy
playing four games in four days.  
COACH CALDWELL: That plagues a lot of teams. We are the team that was Auburn.
We were the team that would get down by 9, 10, 11 points, have to fight and
claw our way back, but we wouldn't have enough in the tank to finish off a
game. So we understand that mentality, how you really have got to not get
yourself in that hole.  
So we're on the flipside of that which is new for us. We don't really get up
on teams a lot and maintain leads. We typically play possession by possession
and go down the last four minutes.  
This is good for them. I've played this way, too. So it's good for me to
revisit it. This group is learning. As I said earlier, they're growing.
Everything we've been faced with, they've taken what they need from each game
and used it in the next.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Jaterra Bonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24807)

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [January Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24806)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Florida  64  
Arkansas  59

  
THE MODERATOR: From Florida we have head coach Amanda Butler, January Miller,
and Jaterra Bonds.  
We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH BUTLER: Just really, really proud of our fight today. It was in question
at some points in the ballgame, but ultimately we really dug our heels in and
made the plays that we had to.  
That last 12, 14 minutes of the ballgame I thought showed a lot of toughness.
There was a lot of leadership out there on the floor. Just a tremendous amount
of fight that is essential this time of year if you want to survive,
especially in this league.  
Arkansas is a great team. I know they're very disappointed, but they have
absolutely nothing to hang their heads about. Those kids played hard. Tom
coached a great game. It's a fantastic win for us.  
THE MODERATOR: January.  
JANUARY MILLER: Like coach said, I'm proud how we all played together, got
this win. Arkansas was a tough team. It was good to get that win and go on to
the next run.  
  
Q. Jaterra.  
JATERRA BONDS: I'm happy to be here, another chance to play them again.  
They put up a great fight. During this time, it come down to who want it more.
That's who going to win these games in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. January and Jaterra, how difficult is it, if any, to come back and play
in back ‑to‑back games or do you think it's an advantage to you?   
JATERRA BONDS: I don't really see it as an advantage or disadvantage. Like I
said, whoever wants to win more is going to win the game. Last year we had to
play back‑to‑back games, Arkansas or Auburn, then play Kentucky, who presses
the whole game. You can't let fatigue be a factor. You have to trust the
training you did all summer and prior to getting here to take over and give
you confidence.  
JANUARY MILLER: Like Jaterra said, playing them back‑to‑back, they know what
we're going to do, we know what they're going to do. It's up to who hustles
more and who wants to go to the next round. You just have to play your all.  
  
Q. Amanda, do you as a coach like having a game under your belt like this or
are you concerned more about the fatigue factor playing the next day?  
COACH BUTLER: I think we've prepared for this all year. We put our schedule
together, we went out and played at Thanksgiving in a tournament where we
played three nights in a row, for this very reason, so it wouldn't be a factor
for us, especially mentally.  
I agree where Jaterra. At this point in the year, fatigue can't be in the mix.
Your mental preparation is probably the toughest thing when you have to turn
it around this quickly.  
We've already experienced that and handled it quite well for a young team. I
know we'll be up for the challenge and we're excited. We got a little momentum
on how we're feeling about ourselves, how we rebounded the basketball tonight.
I don't think it sways things one way or the other unless we think it does,
and clearly we don't.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the first game with Tennessee, an overtime game,
could have gone either way. What kind of bearing might that have in terms of
how your kids feel in a rematch?  
COACH BUTLER: I think we take great confidence from that game. Like you said,
it could have gone either way. I think we have great explanations at this
point in our season for why it didn't go our way. We learned some tough
lessons on that matchup. There was a lot of things we learned and drew
confidence from. We had to play over half of the ballgame without Jennifer
being an option on the floor. Jaterra's leadership was fantastic.  
It gives us some familiarity that everybody has with one another at this
point. But I'm going to just tail off of what Jaterra said. I think what
happened before really doesn't have as much of a factor, as much of an impact.  
Tomorrow will be about who is more ready, who has an expectation of winning,
and who puts up the greatest fight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2013&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2013

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Christina Foggie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23232)

### [Jasmine Lister](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24822)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Vanderbilt  53  
Missouri  40

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We are joined by Vanderbilt
head coach Melanie Balcomb, and student athletes Christina Foggie and Jasmine
Lister. Coach, we'll take an opening comment from you and open it up for
questions.  
COACH BALCOMB: Obviously I'm really pleased with our defense and the ability
to continue to defend when shooting probably the poorest I've ever had a team
shoot in the first half.  
The ability to just play through it is very difficult. I thought we showed a
lot of maturity with a combination of some upperclassmen but a lot of
underclassmen.  
Then Foggie came in and hit the big threes she needed to do, which is also
difficult being out as long as she has been. And Jazz being the leader in
keeping everybody focused, calm, getting the ball to the right people.  
I'm proud of the defense and the comeback and the resilience that we showed as
a team in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jasmine, how nice is it to have Foggie back on the court with you?  
JASMINE LISTER: It's great. There's definitely not as much pressure to shoot
or score. I've always been comfortable playing with Foggie, that she'll knock
a shot down. There's more energy on the court when she's out there, so...  
  
Q. You played against Kentucky earlier this season and it ended up being the
worst loss. What is the mindset coming into the game tomorrow night?  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: Definitely protecting the ball and being more aggressive,
not letting them put us on our heels and basically protecting the ball and
being strong with it, being aggressive.  
JASMINE LISTER: And playing free. We played really tight against them last
time. Our goal is just to come out there and play tough like we know how to
play.  
  
Q. What do you think it was that enabled you to turn the corner in the
second half after such a slow start?  
JASMINE LISTER: Probably just the acceptance of, Okay, that was their run, but
now we really need to focus and like do what we need to do, convert our
defense into our offense, not just get stops but be able to execute our
offense, as well.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: I agree. I think getting transition helped us. We were
defending the whole game, but getting the offense from our defense really gets
energy for us. That really made a run for us.  
COACH BALCOMB: Just like I drew it up (laughter).  
  
Q. Do you want to talk on the offensive glass, you had 20 to their nine
rebounds. How were you able to do that?  
JASMINE LISTER: I mean, our freshman, Morgan Batey, she's always been a great
rebounder for us. She was fearless on the boards. She just kept going and
going.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: Yeah, just basically finding the gap. Playing zone, you can
find gaps. Morgan and Tiff did a really good job of staying with it, with
their hands on it, coming out with it. Those were big for us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see as the key from the time you went from being down
6 to taking the lead?  
COACH BALCOMB: I definitely think what they were talking about. We tried to
create some offense off our defense, not just stop them, make them take tough
shots, but get in transition on offense and put them on their heels and get
some looks into Tiff, get her on the block.  
To do that, we just had to get in transition. It was tough to get it into her
when we were in a 2‑3\.  
I also think Foggie being able to hit some shots and then all of a sudden the
rim was open, it was like there was a lid on it, a lid on it. As soon as she
hit two threes, then we all started to relax and realize, We can make shots,
the rim is open.  
So much of it has to do with relaxing on offense. Once you're really locked in
the way we were defensively, it really helped our offense. That consistent
defense is what caused that to happen.  
  
Q. A'dia Mathies scored a season high 28 points against you last time. How
do you go about defending her this time? Are you going to do anything
differently?  
COACH BALCOMB: God, I hope so (laughter).  
We haven't sat down and gotten a game plan together yet for Kentucky. We
didn't take Missouri lightly because they've been knocking off people. We're
taking it one game at a time.  
We'll come up with a game plan tonight. She's going to get her points. She's a
tremendous player, has a lot of accolades in this conference with the
experience. So obviously we want to do a better job on her to start with. That
will be a focus.  
And I won't tell you my secrets then either (laughter).  
  
Q. How encouraging is it to have a defensive performance the way you did
after starting off so poorly on offense?  
COACH BALCOMB: It was real important because of the consistency. I've had
teams in the past, you watch teams like this all the time, because they're not
making shots, all of a sudden they can't defend.  
I think because of the injuries, because of losing Steph, then Christina was a
main scorer for us, Kady had her moments. We scored 92 points against
Mississippi State. He told me after the game we were a pro team and could
score at every position, to going to a team that needed to hold people in the
40s and 50s to win I think says a lot for this team and where they've come.  
Not just the freshmen stepping up, but everybody understanding what we needed
to do to win games. It wasn't going to be on offense. Our offense now
obviously came when we needed it in the second half. But we are the best
defensive team and rebounding team that I've had at Vanderbilt.  
I think that showed tonight. To be consistent, I'm not saying we won the SEC
in the 40s against LSU one year, but the consistency we showed when we weren't
making shots to continue to defend was impressive. Really proud of that. That
shows a lot of heart and a lot of guts.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Tyrese Tanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23223)

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

LSU  65  
Auburn  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Auburn is head coach Terri Williams‑Flournoy,
Blanche Alverson and Tyrese Tanner. We'll begin with an opening comment from
coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: Of course I applauded my team on a great effort they
made in the second half to make a run to get back into the game. We definitely
would have liked to have had that same effort to start the game.  
But at this point, for this team, that's a great comeback from 18 down.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Blanche, can you talk about your teammate's fight.  
BLANCHE ALVERSON: I think something clicked around the 12‑minute mark of the
second half. We have confidence in ourselves. We knew when we put the effort
forward we can make a comeback. We just needed to make stops, keep pushing on
the offensive end, kind of wearing them down on the offensive end.  
Just a little too much too late. I thought our effort was incredible down the
stretch. I thought we showed a lot of fight and a lot of heart.  
  
Q. Talk about Cha's performance at the end. Making that left ‑handed layup
to get you within two.   
BLANCHE ALVERSON: I think she definitely made a spark coming off the bench for
us in the second half. If she wouldn't have come into play like that, I don't
think we ever would have made that run. She was taking care of the ball and
running the team.  
TYRESE TANNER: She just showed how good of a point guard she is, that she can
be. Just going off of what Blanche said, if she didn't do that, that run she
made, we wouldn't have been so close.  
  
Q. If you do get a chance to play some post ‑season, how big would that be
for you, Blanche?   
BLANCHE ALVERSON: Yeah, I think it's a great opportunity for us to keep
playing. Definitely for me, too. Just to be able to play with my teammates in
post‑season play, because it is a great opportunity for us. We take advantage
of that if we're given it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk about the run at the end. The last field goal was with 5:33 left.
Talk about the defense obviously, the run that you made.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: We definitely made a great effort, especially
defensively. There were a few times where we were scoring, giving up baskets,
scoring. We realized in order for us to catch up, we had to get the defensive
stops we needed.  
I thought they came in and gave the great defensive stops that we needed to
get caught up and back in the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Blanche's performance tonight.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: You know, I don't want to just talk about her
performance tonight. I want to talk about her performance in our last six or
seven games. As a senior she stepped up and realized that in order for this
team to be the team that we need to be, that she needed to step up and take
over some of this leadership of the team.  
I think it's just great on her part to put the team on her back, to knock down
shots. She's a great shooter. But more importantly, she emphasized being a
rebounder. Everything that she can do for the team she has done for this team
and it has definitely helped us over the last few games.  
  
Q. If you get invited to post ‑season play, talk about possibly going to the
WNIT?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: No doubt if we get invited to the WNIT, it's a great
opportunity for our young ladies. Anytime you can continue to play, it's
always great. I think right now we're really at a time when we're feeling very
confident and we're feeling good about each other and we got some kids playing
really well for us. It's a great opportunity for us to continue to play.
Nobody wants to be done in March.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 6, 2013

  

### [Wendell Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19262)

### [Meghan Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24775)

### [Daisha Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24776)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Alabama  63  
Mississippi State  36

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with Alabama. We're joined by head coach
Wendell Hudson, student‑athletes Daisha Simmons and Meghan Perkins.  
We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH HUDSON: I thought we played awful well and awful hard. The young ladies
did a great job of trying to do things we asked them to do. I thought our zone
affected Mississippi State a little bit, kept our big players from getting the
ball where they wanted to get it.  
I thought the intensity level of 40 minutes was where it should be for our
team. I have to give the young ladies credit for being in this position. It's
also tournament play, one game in, one game out. I don't believe they were
ready to go home.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take a comment from each of the student‑athletes. Daisha,
we'll start with you.  
DAISHA SIMMONS: I'm just really proud of my team. Just to come out showing
like that in this tournament means a lot. We feel we're playing in the best
tournament in the country. If we get a couple wins, it will be good for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Meghan?  
MEGHAN PERKINS: As a senior, this is what I live for. The way my team played
tonight, I'm very proud of us. We've been struggling this season. For us to
come out and play like this, this is very big for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. What was the difference in the two games?  
COACH HUDSON: I think the difference in the two games was rebounding‑wise. You
look at the rebounding stats, at halftime, we was leading them in rebounding.
We didn't have as many points in the paint. At half, we had more points in the
paint.  
I think our intensity level is the other thing that happened. I think the
young ladies played hard, played together, rebounded the basketball against a
much larger team as we've rebounded all year probably.  
  
Q. Coach, 36 points is the tournament record for fewest points allowed in a
game. What do you credit that to?  
COACH HUDSON: I think the zone that we played really affected Mississippi
State. They're so post‑oriented.  
The last time we played them, they outscored us in the post. If you look at
the stats now, post points, they still didn't get as many as we had. We had
30, they had 12 in the paint.  
Credit to their young ladies for their effort, their intensity level. We
out‑rebounded Mississippi State 48‑42\. We had 15 offensive rebounds. That
kind of sums the game up.  
  
Q. For the players, what's different for you in tournament play in regards
to playing games on back ‑to‑back days?   
DAISHA SIMMONS: The difference is right now we have a couple seniors that this
is going to be their last game. We don't want them to go out like that. We're
not ready to stop playing.  
We know we could compete with these teams during the season and we have a
second chance to do it. We want to go out with fight.  
MEGHAN PERKINS: Just keep the team motivated. I don't want this to be my last
game.  
When we were here last year, we lost first round and had to go home. I know
that feeling. We got five people who didn't play with us last year.  
We're just trying to keep this team motivated and keep moving in the right
direction right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Kendra Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24777)

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Alabama  63  
Mississippi State  36

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Mississippi State head coach Vic Schaeffer and
student‑athletes Darriel Gaynor and Kendra Grant. We'll take an opening
comment from CoachSchaefer on the game and a comment from each of the
student‑athletes about tonight's game then open it up for questions.  
Coach.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, certainly got to take your hat off to Alabama. They
played awfully well tonight. They 1‑3‑1 zoned us. Confidence is a fragile
thing. I think for us, we got a little shaken with our confidence shooting the
ball, got a little hesitant. They obviously took away our inside game, which
has been our bread and butter most of the year.  
Once they did that, took away Carnecia, she was hobbled tonight, been hobbled
all year, kid has been playing on nothing but guts and one wheel, and once she
kind of was infective, and Martha was very infective tonight, maybe one of her
least effective games of the year, probably in her top three for sure in the
league, it really affected us.  
Kendra played awfully hard. She had 11 rebounds. Just couldn't make any shots.
She was 2‑14\. Every one of them was a pretty good look.  
Again, you play the percentages with us. I would zone us, too. You play the
percentages. You get to come in this building and shoot 45 minutes, and that's
it.  
So for us, it was just a horrible shooting night, and we didn't play very good
defensively either. We didn't play the way we've been playing most of the
year. I think the girls would agree.  
We had a little hangover the first half at Auburn. Bounced back the second
half, played better. But tonight you saw both halves of what we dealt with the
first half at Auburn.  
This team has achieved a great deal this year. I know you look at our record
and think 13‑17\. But we had a lot of inexperience, a lot of youth, a lot of
immaturity. One senior in Darriel, and nine out of 11 kids that really have
never played college basketball. Every time we tipped it up this year, we
started three starters that haven't played a lot in Division I.  
I'm probably as proud as any coach in the country in this team and what
they've accomplished. The victories we had in the Southeastern Conference, how
we did it. Held Arkansas to 12 points in a first half, 44 in a game. You go to
Missouri after they win by 17 over Tennessee, you beat them a week after that
happens. To play as well as we played against Georgia, hold them to five
baskets in each half.  
While I'm heartbroken and disappointed about tonight's play, I'm equally as
proud about this group and what they were able to accomplish this year. I'm
certainly excited about the future of Mississippi State women's basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Kendra, your comments?  
KENDRA GRANT: I guess really just to harp on what Coach Schaefer said, it was
just a bad shooting night for us. We got a lot of good looks. Speaking on
behalf of myself, I couldn't knock 'em down. A lot of us couldn't knock 'em
down. Didn't look like the better defensive Mississippi State team tonight
either. Just weren't hooked up like we should have been.  
It shows in the score, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Darriel?  
DARRIEL GAYNOR: Just the same as what they said. Tough shooting night.
Couldn't get anything to fall. Didn't guard or rebound very well, outside of
Kendra. When you're missing shots, couldn't get any transitions. We couldn't
really do a good job, transition defense. Just a tough one.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Vic, obviously you've been on both sides of the coin. What do you see are
the one or two things you need to do to move this thing forward next year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think obviously one of the things, we've got to
continue to develop these young ladies, but we've got to bring in some help
for them, too. Our skill set has been limited all year. We've been a very
limited offensive team, if you followed us at all. We've had to win games
47‑44 over Arkansas, over Georgia. Very limited offensively. That's been an
Achilles for us all year, is if we don't defend and keep the score in the 40s
and 50s, we really don't have any chance.  
We've got to enhance our skill set a little bit. I'm excited about the young
ladies we have coming in. Then with the young ladies that we have returning
that have really played and impacted our program like Kendra, man, they're so
much better today than they were four months ago, and they're going to be so
much better six or seven months down the line.  
The big thing for us right now in this program, we've been trying to teach
them competitiveness, toughness, and I think we've instilled that in the
program. So the next step now is to add to the skill set that we don't have
and to try to change that a little bit in the program.  
  
Q. Did they zone you the night you beat them by 25 or saved it for
tonight?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, they manned us that night. Our inside players
were very dominant that night.  
Tonight, we have one rebound with each of our starters at 4‑5 offensively.
We're shooting the ball 22%. I think that speaks volumes for what took place
tonight.  
I think we talked about it at halftime. We got 25% of our missed shots,
offensive rebounds, at halftime. It got worse the second half.  
Again, I'm not sure how much we got left in the tank. These kids have done a
lot. I played a few kids a lot of minutes this year. I'm just not sure what
they got left in the tank. They've given me everything they've had all year
long.  
Again, I'm not happy right now. I'm disappointed. These two know it. There's
nobody more disappointed right now than I am. But they have absolutely done
just about all they can do this year and I'm awfully proud of their
accomplishments, especially here lately in the league, and how we did it. We
didn't do it standing around on 2‑3 zone. These kids have gone out and earned
I think their respect.  
I think Alabama coming in respected us just like Auburn was ready to play us
on Sunday. I don't think it was, Okay, Mississippi State is rolling in here,
it's no problem. I think it was, Okay, y'all, Mississippi State is playing
well, they play hard, they'll guard you, we got to be ready.  
I think these kids have earned that respect throughout the course of the
season. Again, I'm awfully proud of them and I'm really proud of what we've
accomplished this year with this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
