_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia 68  
Missouri 59

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by members of West Virginia. Far side Kevin Jones, next
to him Devin Ebanks and Da'Sean Butler as well as Head Coach Bob Huggins. A
couple of statistical notes before we get started.  
West Virginia improves to 29-6. That ties the school record set in 1959 when
the Mountaineers lost in the national championship game. This is West
Virginia's fifth appearance in the Sweet 16 in the last six appearances, and
they are now 10-0 in neutral-site games this season. That being said, Coach
has elected to pass on an opening statement. So we'll get right to the
questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. For any of the players that want to answer it. Obviously Missouri's press
was the talk leading up to this game. It didn't seem to cause you any undue
discomfort. Can you talk about how you felt about that and how you went about
it?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Kind of -- it was just like a press. It was a regular press.
We came to the ball, we met the ball a lot when they pressed and we got people
coming back to the ball and we just took care of it. We didn't really panic.
As a team we didn't really panic at all. We just stepped up to the challenge
and played like men and broke the press.  
THE MODERATOR: Kevin or Devin, anything to add?  
DEVIN EBANKS: They said being strong with the ball. That was our big concern.
Especially watching the tape. We see that they got a lot of steals when people
didn't meet the ball. We wanted to be strong. Once we got past half court we
knew we could execute the offense.  
  
Q. Devin and Kevin, can you talk a little bit about -- there's been so much
made of Da'Sean's late-game heroics. His ability to hit the shot at the end.
Today it was more like the methodical performance. 19 in the first half. The
key free-throws in the second half. I take it that's more than Da'Sean you see
on a regular basis, always hitting the shot at the end.  
KEVIN JONES: Definitely. He's been our leader throughout the whole season. We
look to him for a lot of things, and he's just been able to come through
throughout the whole season. I know he'll keep on coming through for us. I'm
just happy to be here and looking forward to playing Washington in the Sweet
16.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, it's been somewhat of a rough weekend for the BIG EAST here.
Syracuse did what it was supposed to do today. You guys came in and did what
you were supposed to do. Does that say anything about the fact that the two
teams here were able to win, say anything for the conference itself?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: That the conference is good still. Granted some of our teams
might have lost. It's a bad draw of the cards, you know. We can only play for
ourselves right now. We can't play -- we can play for our conference. But
right now we can only take care of what we need to take care of on the court
and worry about West Virginia. What happens at the end of the year happens.
However we represent our conference we represent our conference. You have to
take care of your business on the court.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, you talked the other day about Joe Alexander leading you to the
Sweet 16 when you were a sophomore. I know you have bigger goals, but do you
feel -- are you proud to lead these younger guys to the Sweet 16?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I'm just happy that we got the opportunity to come out and
play. In reality it's been a ton of games this year where they carried me. You
think about last game. Granted we won in a decent fashion, but there's been
plenty of games where these two especially come out in the beginning of the
game and carry me and made the load easier for me to go out there and just
make -- pass the ball or rebound and just play.  
But to answer your question, I say it kind of feels good to go out there and
show the younger players, these guys understand pretty much, they're ahead of
their class in a way, but just to show the younger guys, Doug and Danny, if
you come in and play hard and work hard all year, in the summer, of course,
you can do this. You can go to the Sweet 16 or even further. So...  
  
Q. Da'Sean, is there a difference in attitude or a difference in feeling for
you personally for this Sweet 16 run as opposed to two years ago when you guys
were the underdogs, beat Duke? This year you were the favorites and expected
to make it this far.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I don't think of us as anything else other than underdogs.
Always I need that mentality before I go into a game. I can't go into the game
thinking we're the best team in the country or whatever the case may be.
Always think that we're the team people always overlooked. When Coach first
got here, we were the team that others overlooked, I always put the team in on
my back. Missouri, doesn't matter who it is. Missouri, I need that chip.  
  
Q. Kevin, yesterday you mentioned about how the press was intended to wear
teams down mentally. But you look at what you guys were able to do
particularly at the free-throw line, down the stretch in this game and how you
limited their steals. I'm taking it, it didn't wear you down as much as they
had hoped it would?  
KEVIN JONES: Yes. Like I said before, it's just like any other press that you
face. The intended purpose is to get to you play faster. And I think we did a
good job of playing at our own pace then get into our offense. I don't think
it wore us down a lot at all.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, could you just describe the putback of the free-throw at the end
of the game and how important it was at that time?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Obviously Cam was shooting the free-throw. He missed his first
one. In my head if I miss my first one, if I don't go out there and take care
of business, I might miss my second one. We always crash anyway. We kind of
crossed and nobody really boxed me out, so I just went up there and grabbed it
and laid it in, but it was just a matter of just getting to the basketball. I
got there first before he did, and made the play.  
  
Q. For Devin and Da'Sean, with everything that Joe Mazzulla has gone through
on and off the court, when did you guys feel like you really had him back this
year?  
DEVIN EBANKS: As soon as he steps on the court at the start of the season, he
went through some problems earlier. He has been able to overcome it. He's just
been stepping up for us at a good time. Starting in the BIG EAST tournament
and it's carrying over to the NCAA tournament. He's being very more vocal on
the court and more into the game. You can definitely tell and sense it from
him. That's what we need from him.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: By far one of the toughest people we have on the team. He's
played with one arm the majority of the year. He hasn't complained about it or
cried or anything. He just got on the court, played as hard as he could and
did what he can do. He never came out there and hoisted up three threes or
done anything out of his game. He's done nothing but come on the court and
lead the team when he has the ball in his hands as the point guard. And just
guard -- the best player at -- whoever you ask him to guard, he guards. He had
a great BIG EAST tournament.  
He's having a great tournament now as far as doing what I told you, leading
and guarding. I don't see why he wouldn't continue to do the same.  
  
Q. Actually Devin and Da'Sean, all three can answer, the final nine minutes
I think of the first half you guys didn't get a basket. You were up I think
maybe 7 and then you went into the half up six. Keeping that gap in place,
free-throws, defense, towards the final outcome how important was that stretch
of play?  
KEVIN JONES: We just had to stay focused throughout the game. Like sometimes
you come out after halftime and we have a lot of letups. We want to make sure
especially with this team we didn't come out flat. This is a team that can
definitely take advantage of you playing bad and we just didn't want to do
that.  
DEVIN EBANKS: Same as Kevin. The other day we started off slow and we knew
that we couldn't come out like that against a good Missouri team. Definitely
the way they press. We knew if we would have dug ourselves a hole it would
have been tough to get out. That was definitely the mentality coming out
strong the second half the first four minutes. Definitely getting the stops
and making some buckets.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I just say we -- after the time without scoring, after we got
our first one about being mentally tough and taking care of the ball running
the offense and running the sets, you need to run and get the ball to the
right people.  
Kevin made some big shots in the second half as well as Devin, getting the
ball to the right people at the right times and just executing.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen. Thanks for your time. Congrats.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you can express Joe's maturity, maybe off the court as
much as on the court over the last couple of months.  
BOB HUGGINS: I think you have to understand what Joe goes through to be able
to play. He still goes in for rehab an hour a day. And he does that pretty
much -- he had done it about pretty much seven days a week. It may be down to
six now. I kind of honestly thought that Joe was kind of really, at the start
of the BIG EAST tournament, he was kind of settling for just being a role
player for us. And I had a conversation about him stepping up and playing the
way that we all expected him to play. He played probably, at least half the
season, probably more, and couldn't shoot the ball with his left hand. Shot
free-throws right-handed and -- but like Da said, he just wanted to be out
there contributing. He didn't feel sorry for himself or -- and he didn't in
any way want to hurt the team.  
It hasn't been -- I guess probably the last three weeks or month that he's
been able to shoot the ball. He has shot it really well. I mean, honestly I
was surprised the three that he took today didn't go in. Because he's really
made shots in practice for us.  
  
Q. Bob, everybody has seemingly written a story about Missouri's defense
coming into this game. Did maybe they not talk about the half court defensive
effort your team gives in the run-up to this game?  
BOB HUGGINS: I did yesterday. But I don't know if anybody else did. No -- and
I told our guys, you know, I think we have an advantage to a degree because
I've coached against Mike so many times. I had a pretty good idea -- and I
knew what we did in the past. So I think that was an advantage for us. It
wasn't like I just -- that's the first time I saw it the other day. And they
do a great job. They do a great job with pressure.  
And I thought -- I think the key thing is you have to be able to inbound it to
somebody who is going to be able to handle a double team. Da'Sean did a great
job of that all day. We talk about his 29 points. He's a guy who really
handled the double teams for us. And then Truck and Joe both did a job -- a
good job advancing the ball for us. And we tried to keep it out of spots where
they could trap us.  
  
Q. What about defensively, half court-wise and when you went to that zone?  
BOB HUGGINS: When I said yesterday we're going to guard, they're going to have
a hard time scoring against us. Everybody has a hard time scoring against us.
Thank God they do. We have gotten a lot better over the last like three weeks
to a month. We've gotten a whole lot better defensively.  
  
Q. Can you just discuss the weekend here in general and what you take out of
it, you know, just the fact that you're going on to the next round?  
BOB HUGGINS: The last time I was here for an extended period of time, I was
coaching the World University Games. We spent a lot of time at the Anchor Bar
eating those wings. We didn't make it that far this time. This time we had too
much to do. We were at the hotel. I didn't get to go to the other place
either, whatever it is. I kind of wanted to compare.  
No, it's a great town. It's a great town, great people. I was very fortunate
to be able to recruit Lenny Stokes out of here and Leonard had a great career
for us at Cincinnati. So I was in here recruiting Lenny and what a great
family he has. So Buffalo has been good to me.  
  
Q. If we can get your thoughts on moving on forward to Syracuse and seeing
some -- you mentioned the teams that had trouble scoring against you and thank
God they do. Some pretty good offensive clubs you may see out in Syracuse and
Washington and Cornell and Kentucky.  
BOB HUGGINS: They're going to see a pretty good defensive team. So -- it comes
down to do we defend them better than they score? I haven't looked at --
Lorenzo is a very good friend of mine. He's a great guy. Lorenzo was in
Cincinnati for a long time. Played with Athletes in Action. He's a wonderful
human being. I have great respect for him as a person and great respect for
him as a coach. I haven't looked at one play. So I don't know anything. Other
than I know Zo is a great guy. That's all I know.  
  
Q. Bob, I thought it was a joke the first time you said it, but the Cam
Thoroughman missed free-throw play. Was that on Da'Sean's putback?  
BOB HUGGINS: We're used to Cam missing them. It may have been a surprise to
them. It wasn't to us.  
  
Q. Bob, the criticism or the complaint against your team has been point
guard play. Was that unfair the way the guys handled the pressure today, does
that sort of answer that question?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. We had one point guard, because Joe really couldn't
go early on. And Truck did a good job for us. I think we probably asked him to
do too much, play too many minutes. And then we played Da'Sean there. Da did a
great job for us, but it takes away from the other really positive things that
Da'Sean does.  
And I think getting Joe back -- we've kind of split the minutes now between
the two of them. I think that keeps both of them fresher. I think both of them
do a better job at the defensive end. And I think both of them have done a
better job getting us into offense. It's different for Truck. Truck is the
all-time leading scorer at St. Raymond's. He's used to scoring the ball. He
and I have had several sitdowns about what a point guard is, what a point
guard does. And I think he's done a really good job. I told him I have
absolutely no problem with my point guard scoring. I coached Van Exel. I have
no problem with that. I coached Logan. I had no problem with those guys
scoring the ball. It's just you still have to be able to get other people
involved and get us in offense. And I think both of those guys have done a
better job as the season has progressed.  
  
Q. Bob, if I can just go back to Joe. Do you feel more comfortable now with
his decision-making away from basketball?  
BOB HUGGINS: He's a great kid. I think anybody who has been around Joe would
tell you that. He's a wonderful kid. We all make mistakes. I'm looking out
there at a bunch of people that made some mistakes in their life. They're
looking at one right here that's made some. It's not whether you make a
mistake; it's how you deal with it. I think Joe has done a great job. And he's
loved on campus. They absolutely love him on campus. He's a wonderful guy who
has got time for everybody. I would venture to say one of our student leaders.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you talked about how you knew going into the game that
you were going to have to use your bench second half, I think, Cam and Joe,
short rotation. Was that surprising that you didn't use the bench more or by
design?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we didn't use a lot of time-outs in the first half. And we
were fortunate Mike called some time-outs. 16-12, 8-4 is 2 minutes. That's a
long time. That's what I told our guys at halftime. I said, you're going to
play for four minutes, you get a two-minute rest. You can't do that? That's
kind of how we went about it is we're going to play for four and have a two-
minute rest. And I really didn't call time-out because they got tired. I
called time-out because they didn't block anybody out once.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about your team's aggressiveness and ability to get
to the free-throw line 33 times and convert 25 of them?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we wanted to attack their pressure. When you are as
aggressive as what they are, you're going to foul some. And we knew that. I
think you don't foul when you don't attack. And we wanted to be in an attack
mode and continue to attack them. They do a great job with ball pressure and
they do a great job of trapping you if you put yourself in the wrong spots. I
thought by and large we did a pretty good job of staying out of trap areas.
And I thought we attacked pressure.  
  
Q. I had asked the question about the BIG EAST to your players. What it all
means, you see five BIG EAST teams. Pittsburgh is playing right now. You two
are in, for the league.  
BOB HUGGINS: Whoever doesn't think the BIG EAST is a great league really
shouldn't write sports. They ought to do something else. Do cooking or
something. You have to be kidding me. The BIG EAST is a great, great
basketball league. And by the way, you all are the ones who voted four of us
in the top ten for the majority of the year. So apparently a lot of people
thought we were pretty good then. Five in the top 25. It's a great league.
We've lost some close games and things. But, you know, now is the Big 12 not
any good because Kansas lost? No. The Big 12 is a great league. It's a great
league full of great players and great coaches. And the BIG EAST is a great
league.  
So I don't know -- I actually was wondering were you guys going to start
talking about the Missouri Valley was the best league in the country. What do
you guys think about?  
  
Q. Does it say anything about how good basketball is across the country,
that the difference sometimes is very -- minute?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think we've said that for a long time. There's tremendous
parity in college basketball. And the parity is because when you have someone
like Northern Iowa, Ben does a great job -- I certainly wasn't taking a shot
at them -- they do a great job -- but when you can keep people in your
program, I think what happens a lot in the so-called BCS leagues is guys don't
stay for four years. So you're coaching guys for two years and then all of a
sudden you have to go in and retool again. And if you look at what happens in
our league this year -- year after year after year we lose underclassmen every
year. That takes a toll. I think that teams that stay together and guys play
together and they understand each other and how to play, like a Northern Iowa,
are very, very good. And they're very difficult for anybody to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks so much. Best of luck.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 21, 2010

  

### [Matt Bouldin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18286)

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Elias Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20762)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
Syracuse  87  
Gonzaga - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Gonzaga Coach Mark Few as well as Elias Harris and
Matt Bouldin. Coach, if you want to go ahead and open with a statement and
then we'll take questions for the student athletes after that.  
MARK FEW: Yeah. I thought we would have to play great tonight to have a chance
against this team and in this building. And we certainly didn't, and they have
a lot to do with it. I thought all along that watching Coach's team that
they've got a real chance to advance on and win this whole thing. I mean when
they shoot the ball like that, I mean, they are hard to handle. The way they
shot it, the consistency which -- the effort that they played with for the
whole 40 minutes, they're an impressive group.  
Rautins is really, really good live when you watch him. I don't think you see
that all the time on tape or on TV. And obviously we knew Wes Johnson was one
of the most talented guys in the league.  
But, you know, it doesn't take away from the year we had. We had an awesome
year. This team grew more than any team I've been able to coach and probably
developed more from where we started on October 15th to now. So 27 wins is a
heck of a deal for us. I'm really happy for these guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate it, Coach. We'll take questions for Elias or Matt at
this time.  
  
Q. For Matt, you guys have played Duke, you've played Michigan State. You've
seen some good teams. Can you tell me how good is Syracuse?  
MATT BOULDIN: They're really good. It was pretty obvious tonight. I think they
have a legitimate shot at going really deep in this tournament. Of the teams
we've played, I thought if not the -- probably the best team we've played. But
we didn't really come out and play nearly as well as we thought we could have.  
  
Q. For Elias, you were very successful attacking them down low early with
you and Sacre. Did you feel like you had them back-peddling a little bit at
that point and on the defensive?  
ELIAS HARRIS: Yeah, I think you're right. Like the low roll. Robert and I
attacked. Yes, worked out really good for the first five minutes of the first
half. All of a sudden we lost our concept.  
  
Q. Matt, can you comment on the difficulty just to get good open looks?  
MATT BOULDIN: I mean, they run that zone to perfection. I mean, I said this
earlier, that they're probably every practice squad in the country tries to
mimic that 2-3, but it's not. I thought we got pretty good looks. I thought we
moved the ball pretty well. We just didn't knock down the shots, and they did.
For whatever reason. But they're very long, really athletic. They're always
contesting every shot. That makes it tough, I guess.  
  
Q. What impact -- we know what impact Johnson has offensively. What do you
see from him defensively and on the boards?  
ELIAS HARRIS: He's a very good rebounder. Defensively-wise and offensively-
wise. Does a great job. As you can see, it worked out for him and for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else? Okay, gentlemen. Thanks for coming in. Great
season. Further questions now for Coach Few.  
  
Q. Coach, it was a 1-point game when Jackson got his third foul. He goes
out, and it -- it was looking good for you at that point. Then they held you
scoreless for a long stretch there. What went wrong do you think there?  
MARK FEW: I mean, I think it's all -- if you go back and watch it, it was --
we missed either a front end of a one and one and two free-throws. We had a
couple of errant passes where we had people that were open and we had been
finding them along the baseline that we didn't quite complete. It was probably
four or five possessions where they came down, we fouled Rautins once. That
kind of got him going. And then we messed up a defensive switch. We were
supposed to be switching the ball screen. It left Wes Johnson wide open for a
three. It was basically four possessions -- I think the four-minute time-out,
we were within four or six and might have had the ball and shooting free-
throws. Then we just did not stick with the plan, and turnovers and missed
shots and missed free-throws. And they were very, very efficient and really
closed it out.  
I thought that was the game, that last four-minute -- from the four-minute
time-out down.  
  
Q. Mark, when a team is not making shots, the threes, is there a
contagiousness about that almost? Did it appear that you got reasonable
shots.  
MARK FEW: That's a great call. We had very good shots. We moved the ball very
well, we found guys along the baseline, we found Rob in there one-on-one. He
hasn't seen much one-on-one coverage since the start of the year. Steve and
Matt -- I know Syracuse does a great job of guarding the three line. We were
able to move it and take it in and kick it out and getting guys wide open
looks.  
You just have to make them. You have to step up and make them against a team
this good. And then conversely, when you go to the other end and they are just
reining them in, many of them over a hand. The way Rautins just sprints out
and makes those shots, I think until you've seen him a lot on tape, you think
they're bad shots. He has an uncanny knack of just making those. Our hands
were up. When they're going like that, they're better than anybody in the
country. They are still going to have to make shots to win this thing. If they
shoot it like they did today, nobody will beat them.  
  
Q. People have wondered for a while just exactly how hurt Wes Johnson was
with that injury he has had. When you see what he's done the last couple of
games -- did you see him being hurt much of this year when he played, he
didn't look like the same player than he did the last couple of games?  
MARK FEW: I don't sit and watch every Syracuse game. I love Coach Boeheim, but
it's hard to watch every one of those games. I thought all along that they
were a team just maybe destined to play for the national championship. I still
believe that. I didn't have the opportunity to see him when he was hurt.
Seeing him live right now the way he's able to shoot it, that turn-around he
hit on us on the free-throw line over our extended hand was, you know, that's
what NBA lottery players do. He did a nice job on the glass. He gets 14
boards. He's a tough, tough guard. We tried to start Elias on him then put
Matt on him in the second half. Then he posted Matt. He's a tough matchup.  
  
Q. Mark, could you talk to Matt, what Matt meant to this program?  
MARK FEW: I would have to write like a thesis on him. I don't think I can sum
it up in one sentence. He's meant everything to this program. He's a
quintessential Gonzaga guard. Now that it's over, he goes right alongside
Stockton and Dickau and Stepp as one of the all-time greats. It's unfortunate
he didn't get to end his career on maybe one of his best games. But still, as
I told him afterwards, the fact that he was able to lead us to 27 games, we've
never had so much turnover in our program. And been so inexperienced and so
new. Matt was basically the guy that kind of had to pull it all together.  
  
Q. You guys have played some great teams this year. But talk about the 2-3
zone that Syracuse featured today. Is that one of the best 2-3 zones you've
ever seen coached in a college basketball?  
MARK FEW: Yes, you don't see really somebody that extensively plays that 40
minutes a night. You'll face zone for ten minutes here, ten minutes there. A
lot of teams are afraid to zone us. We haven't seen probably more than, I
don't know, maybe 100 minutes total all year of zone. Maybe even less than
that.  
It's hard to generate rhythm against it, because you're shots aren't coming.
In man you can almost dictate where you want your shots to come from. We had a
great approach and a 24-hour turn-around. We were getting the ball right where
we wanted to all the way up to about that 15-minute mark. Then we just kind of
-- again we lost our way a little bit with just -- but we didn't catch balls,
we didn't finish plays, we didn't finish free-throws. Kind of not generating a
stop on the other end is probably the biggest thing when they shoot 60% at the
half.  
  
Q. Real quick follow-up. In terms of when Rick Jackson picked up that third
foul for Syracuse, were you guys looking to really go inside on DaShonte Riley
and his inexperience? He has only played, I think -- he hasn't played more
than five minutes since December 22nd.  
MARK FEW: We were looking to do that. But Sacre had two fouls too. We had to
be cognizant of that fact. We were trying. But I don't think it's as easy as
you would think. In a man-to-man situation you can pop it in there. What they
do is they extend out with that zone and it's hard to make penetrating passes
into your five. They're in the lanes and they're so long that you can't just
say okay, let's just throw it right in there. Rob was scoring on Rick Jackson
as easy as he was on the other kid. It's hard to consistently get the ball in
there.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm sure it was frustrating seeing them drain all those threes
like you said, they were contested and they were still going down. Was it
discouraging at all knowing that everything -- it seemed like everything they
shot was going in and you were just going to climb this uphill battle.  
MARK FEW: Yeah, I think it was all those words that start with a D:
Discouraging, depressing, whatever. I can't think of any others. No, it was --
again, you have to tip your hat. When we go back and watch the film, a lot of
them were closely guarded. The thing that eats you as coach is when we messed
up on a switch that we've been doing all year and they get a three. When we
don't play on the top shoulder on the perimeter and either Jardine or Triche
punched the middle and kicked out for an easy three. They throw in the post.
We weren't supposed to help at the start of the second half. We kind of turn
our head to look and they pitch it right out to Andy, and he drains a three.
Those are the ones you want back. You tip your hat on the ones that are
closely guarded. The ones where we were kind at fault as far as getting the
open look are the ones you would like back.  
I'm telling you, if they shoot the basketball like that, I don't see anybody
beating them. But I don't think it's realistic to think they can continue to
shoot the ball like that. Though you watch how they played this weekend, they
were every bit as dialed in as that Carolina club we played last year in
Memphis. I can tell you that. Every bit as impressive as -- like I said last
year, that's the best college team I've seen last year in that Sweet 16 game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a great season.  
MARK FEW: Thank you, thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse  87  
Gonzaga - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: A couple of notes before we get started. The 12 threes by
Syracuse is an NCAA record for the program. Syracuse is 12-0 when Wes Johnson
has a double-double, which he did today. And the 31 points by Wes Johnson is a
career high.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Boeheim, congrats.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought Wes was tremendous early in the game. You know, when
Scoop came in, he gave us a lift. But then when Brandon went back in and made
a couple -- he made a couple of big shots, and that is how we got the
separation.  
Gonzaga has been very up and down shooting the ball. When you don't make
threes against us, it's going to be a tough day. They did everything they
could to get it inside and move the ball as well as anybody has against us.
But if you're not going to make those shots, you're not going to win.  
Again, I thought Brandon and Scoop really -- and Wesley the first half. And
then Andy came out. When he gets it going like that, he's not missing in some
of those situations. He knocked everything down. As well as we played, I told
Mark this is as well as we played all year. It was a tremendous performance
from our guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. I'll take questions from left to right for
Andy, Wes or Scoop at this time.  
  
Q. Wes, now number one question is about whether that hand is all right.  
WES JOHNSON: I think it's fine now.  
  
Q. For Wes, it seemed like you came out with an effort -- with a conscious
effort to shoot early and often. Was that the case and what was behind that?  
WES JOHNSON: Really, my mindset was to be aggressive on defense. So I think
that carried over to the offensive end. My shot was falling. The guys did a
good job finding me, and I did a good job shooting.  
  
Q. Wes or Andy, when Rick picked up his third foul and had to leave the game
in the first half, did you say anything to DaShonte when he came in and what
were you thinking?  
WES JOHNSON: Honestly, DaShonte has been playing against AO and Rick the whole
season in practice. When he came in, really just told him to play big and use
his length. He played with a lot of confidence today and he gave us a real big
spark off the bench, making people take tough shots.  
  
Q. Andy, you came out obviously in the second half looking for your shot,
maybe just tell me a little what you were thinking in that respect? And also
maybe put your national team hat on and give me a scouting report on some of
the guys out there. Sacre and Kris Joseph looked good.  
ANDY RAUTINS: Try to stay aggressive and set tone for the second half. That's
been one of our flaws in the first half of the season. We didn't come out
intense in the second half. I thought we did a great job of that. Teammates
were running me off screens and doing a great job getting me open. Just look
for my shot. When Wes and I are hitting our shots we're a tough team to beat.
I thought Canada had a pretty good performance. Robert Sacre is probably going
to have some bragging rights. He got a dunk on me. Overall I think we played
pretty well and I'm proud of our guys.  
  
Q. Scoop, did you guys come in here with a little bit of a chip on your
shoulder? Everyone was talking about what Syracuse couldn't do because Arinze
Onuaku was hurt. Lost your last two games. Did you guys come into this weekend
thinking we need to turn some heads and remind people who we are?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We go into every game thinking that way. We try to play with a
chip on our shoulder whenever we go out there. It was a team that was doubted
in the beginning of the year. Every time we go out there we try to take it one
game at a time and play Syracuse basketball. Coming into the tournament, we
had lost two games straight. People kind of turned their heads. Then we lost
Arinze Onuaku. We knew it was a good team all year and we could stick together
and just play basketball.  
  
Q. For Andy and Wes, when Jack picked up his third foul was there some sense
this is it, this is the moment we all need to pick it up?  
ANDY RAUTINS: Sure. You get a sense of that. But I mean like I said, this team
has had such great cohesiveness all year no matter what five guys are on the
floor. We're all on the same page. We're more than confident in DaShonte
stepping up and having big minutes. He's progressing every day. We have
confidence in whoever is on the floor.  
WES JOHNSON: When he went out me and Kris took it upon ourselves to get to the
boards. When DaShonte came in, we knew we would be fine when he came in. We
would have to crash the boards more and really make an emphasis on defense to
get out to the shooter and make it tough for them.  
  
Q. Andy, the way Brandon played today, is that the way Brandon played all
December through January a little bit?  
ANDY RAUTINS: Absolutely. He's a key part of our team. When he stays
aggressive and looks for his shot, and he looks to take it to the basket, he's
a strong physical guard. He's proved himself throughout the season. We know
what he's capable of when he stops thinking and goes out and plays. He's a
very valuable guy for us.  
  
Q. For any of the guys. What's it like playing in front of this crowd? It's
practically a home game. Two-hour ride. Did it help in that run? What's it
going to be like in Salt Lake City?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Our fans have been supporting us all year. It's great to play
in front of a crowd like this. It's like we're playing at home. I think our
fans did a great job all year supporting us no matter what we played at.  
Honestly, I think they are going to be at Salt Lake too. They just come out
and support us. We are just happy to be a part of it and be able to play in
front of our fans. We have the best fans in the country.  
  
Q. For Wes and Andy, did you guys, when you look at the upsets in the
tournament and you know you're playing a live underdog in Gonzaga, did you
kind of come out with a real purpose to your game today, a different kind of
mentality because you see what's happening to Kansas?  
WES JOHNSON: Yeah, you can say that. We really were just going out there -- we
didn't want to lose. Honest. We didn't want to go home early. We took it
amongst ourselves to go out there and play hard. We're coming off the two-game
losing streak and winning the previous game with Vermont. We came here and
played our game of basketball. That was the main thing we were trying to do.  
  
Q. Wes, the first 10, 12 minutes Harris had like 16 points against you guys.
What did you think of his game? What happened after that? Did you guys do
something to keep the ball out of his hands?  
WES JOHNSON: He was sneaking behind the defense and getting a lot of points
around the bucket and getting "and one." We came in at halftime and talked
with the forwards and told them we have to close in and keep an eye on them.
When we did that, he tried to step out and shoot shots. But after that it was
too late.  
SCOOP JARDINE: Definitely.  
  
Q. For any of the players, why is it that you guys really haven't let any
team sneak up on you the way that say Kansas and a few other teams that lost
in the first couple of rounds have?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Coach Boeheim does a great job of preparing us for moments like
this or times like this. Been coaching 34 years. He's seen every game you can
possibly see. Our leaders, Arinze and Andy, this day, last year, they did a
great job of preparing us. Our whole coaching staff. We all come together and
try to play together and play smart and don't make bonehead plays like myself.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Didn't make one today?  
SCOOP JARDINE: One.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Good luck. We'll open it up for questions
of Coach Boeheim at this time.  
  
Q. Jim, I would like to ask you about when Rick picked up his third there
with nine minutes or so to go in the first half. Did you say anything special
to DaShonte, and talk about DaShonte's play.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I told him get in there. You know, he's been working in practice.
He's still got a long ways to go. I think he's actually a little bit more
comfortable passing the ball on offense than he is doing anything else. But
you know I thought he gave us some really good minutes in the stretch of the
game when it was really close there. He made a good steal, made a good pass to
Brandon. Chipped a couple of balls.  
I thought his stat line doesn't show it, but I thought he was very productive
defensively and offensively when he was in there. Ricky has just got to avoid
a couple of the fouls.  
This is a very physical team. They were banging him in there. There was a lot
of banging. When there was a lot of banging, they're going to call one.
They're going to call one on them and they're going to call one on you. Their
posts really bang in there. That's how Harris got so open. The big guy was
banging Ricky so much that he was getting stuck on him and Harris was getting
behind us. They caught us on that first lob pass. After that we adjusted and
we played pretty well.  
Again, they're a good team. When we play like that, when we shoot the ball
like that, we're pretty tough to beat. I knew if we were going to get up and
play at 12 o'clock, I was hoping to make the game as boring as possible so
that they wouldn't have -- they would have struggled to fill space. Players
really don't mind playing at 12. It's me. I have a lot of trouble getting up
that early.  
  
Q. I would like to ask you the same question I asked the players. Why have
they not been really caught off guard or caught napping against anybody this
year? Is it anything you're doing or is it something about the make-up of
these players that they've stayed focused in the game?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I've been doing the same thing for 34 years. I don't know what --
I don't know -- some teams react better. Some teams -- we're usually ready to
play. Syracuse basketball is about being ready to play and being consistent.
But there can be upsets. I watched Northern Iowa play unbelievable. The
problem with college basketball is there's not a big gap. Everybody wants to
make it seem like it's a big gap. It's not a big gap. If you don't play well,
whoever it is you're playing can beat you. I mean, it's as simple as that. I
know Villanova is a good team. I watched the whole game. St. Mary's really
played unbelievably well. You look at basketball games, if you watch the
games, which unfortunately people don't do, they just say St. Mary's won the
game. Shouldn't win this game. They have a great big guy. A great big guy.
They've got great guards. They've got great forwards. They have a great coach.
If you watch the games, that was not an upset. They're a better team.  
This is different from football. We find out in this tournament who the best
teams really are. There's no doubt in my mind that yesterday Northern Iowa was
better than Kansas. Kansas really -- Northern Iowa made four or five bad
turnovers at the end of the game or it would have been a ten-point game.  
St. Mary's outplayed Villanova. It's as simple as that. These are good teams.
If you don't play really well, you're going to get beat. Simple as that.  
  
Q. Jim, how limited was Wes? Can you just speak to his ability to kind of
stay with things through that and be productive without being able to really
hold the ball or shoot.  
JIM BOEHEIM: He couldn't hold it really well. He could shoot, but it was sore.
He's just getting back -- if he hadn't had this injury, he would be up at an
even higher level now than he is. He was playing at a really high level, and
he was getting better. That just took him right back down for eight games, ten
games. He's just getting back. I still don't think he's as strong as he was.
And he wasn't able to do some things during the last three or four weeks that
he would have raised his game even more.  
But, you know, there's no question DaShonte did a tremendous job today. But
there's no question that when we don't have Arinze, we're just -- we're a
different team. We're a different team. When they have big guys like this,
those 41 points they got inside would have never happened. He doesn't allow
that to happen. He controls that paint area.  
These guys are playing good. They overcame it because we shot the heck out of
the basketball. If we don't shoot the heck out of the basketball, then those
points down in there are going to really hurt you. We're not the same team
without AO in there. Guys don't get the rest that they need, and it's just,
you know, we're asking Kris Joseph to do things he didn't have to do before.
He's not playing the way he's capable of playing.  
The big difference is, like in today's game, Scoop and Brandon really stepped
up. When those guys -- those two guys step up like that, that makes a big, big
difference in how we're playing. Big difference. You're talking 13 points we
haven't been getting. Take those 13 points away, you take those threes away he
makes when it's a 6, 8 point game. All of a sudden it's 11, 14.  
  
Q. Jim, same sort of question --  
JIM BOEHEIM: Don't compliment anybody like that here. If you want to ask me a
question, ask me a question.  
  
Q. You're a terrific coach.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Especially don't compliment media people.  
  
Q. You're lucky to have my quarter scout. You know it, deep, deep, deep,
deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, down inside.  
JIM BOEHEIM: So deep I can't find it.  
  
Q. When you guys picked up the third foul, what does it say about the
maturity of this team that that's when they were able to pick it up and pull
away?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, there's no question that was a very trying moment,
because they were playing well, and they've got post people that were hurting
us. I thought DaShonte made a couple of plays, it wasn't a lot, but he made a
couple of plays in there that made a big difference. I mean, a big difference.
And they had two threes, two good looks at threes that they missed. We went
right down and I think Brandon hit one and he might have hit two right then.
That's how these games change. Ten-point game, they missed two threes. We make
two threes. It's a 16-point game instead of a four-point, five, six-point
game.  
It's about shooting the basketball sometimes, you know. Wesley shot it really
good early when they were -- they had the better -- they got to have a better
start. They had a five, six-point lead. We really didn't have much going on
offense. They were doing a good job on Andy. Goodson was doing a good job on
him. But Wesley kept us in there. Goodson is a good defender. He gave Andy
about two inches in the second half twice and he made two threes. He really
had almost no time, and he made two threes.  
But, you know, this team has come to play every game. I've never had a team
that's come to play every game. You like to think that happens. In a perfect
world, we don't live in, it doesn't happen. And they've come ready every game.
The only game that they didn't win was when -- that they should have was when
I coached against LeMoyne like some kind of idiot. That was the only game.
Other than that, they played every game.  
  
Q. Your team played extremely well today. I'm sure you're going to nitpick
something. What does the team have to do --  
JIM BOEHEIM: How can you be so sure?  
  
Q. What does the team have to improve on as you advance through the
tournament?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think it's a tough turn-around for us. We have to go a long
ways. It's always tough. We have to play Thursday. That's not good. I guess
now it's better that we played at 12 o'clock today. At least we can get home
tonight. They did us no favors, having to go there and play at 12 -- play at
-- having to go out and play Thursday. But we have to do what we've been
doing. That's the good thing. We don't have to do anything other than play the
way we've been playing. That's what we've done all year. We played good from
the first game, and we've got to continue to do that. We got a couple more
days with DaShonte to give him some good practice time. And get him up to
speed a little bit more, if we can. We have to do what we've been doing all
year.  
In the tournament, there is no changing. You have to do what you've been
doing. The first game here we made some really bad turnovers. Tonight we
didn't make any bad turnovers until the game was over. So that's an
improvement. But we'll go back, we'll work hard. Butler -- I've watched them
play all year long. They're one of the best teams I've seen all year. I've had
them in the top ten in my poll from the very beginning of the year. I think
they have a tremendous team. And so we'll have our hands full.  
THE MODERATOR: Last one.  
  
Q. Did it feel like a home game?  
JIM BOEHEIM: The fans were great. It's always good to have the fans there for
you. But we just played well. We just played well. Sometimes -- I know we've
been in this tournament when we played in '03 and we were struggling against
Oklahoma State. The fans really helped us. We didn't need their help today,
but it was nice that they were here.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia 68  
Missouri 59

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Missouri student athletes Keith Ramsey, Zaire Taylor,
J.T. Tiller and Head Coach Mike Anderson. Coach, will make an opening
statement and we'll take questions for our student athletes from Missouri.  
MIKE ANDERSON: It wasn't the way I envisioned these guys going out, but at the
same time I couldn't be more proud of any team I have had an opportunity to
coach than these guys. They left everything on the floor. A lot of teams this
time of the year they are fully loaded, they have all their players and we had
some guys -- I always said we have some guys that didn't have an opportunity
to play. Justin Safford. We have one guy playing his hand hurt, Laurence
Bowers. We have one guy playing with a broke nose. Yet these guys gave me
everything they had each and every day. That's why I couldn't be more proud of
a team, the effort.  
Congratulations to West Virginia. They get a chance to move on. But we just
ran out of time. I don't think these guys lost; I think they just ran out of
time. But I thought it was a tremendous effort by our guys, and of course I
think the guy that had the statement on his game was Da'Sean Butler. I think
he was the big catalyst I think for the team, making big plays for West
Virginia.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Open it up to questions for our student athletes
only at this time.  
  
Q. J.T. and Keith, that game from the sidelines seemed like you didn't get
it speeded up the way you wanted, but they didn't dominate particularly in the
paint the way they hoped to. Was it a game where nobody could really get
everything done at all?  
J.T. TILLER: No, I don't think -- I don't think nobody had the dominant hand
in this game, where they were trying to slow us down, we were trying to speed
them up. I don't think anybody imposed their will fully, you know what I mean?
I think it was in spurts; who had the longest spurt of what they were really
trying to do in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Keith, your thoughts?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I agree with him. I agree with him.  
  
Q. Keith, I think back to those back-to-back possessions at the start of the
second half. I think it was seven shots. Was that kind of symptomatic of the
frustration you guys felt; your passion for the game was certainly there, the
ball just didn't fall almost all day?  
KEITH RAMSEY: Of course, man. It's tough -- it's going to be tough to win when
you have guys shoot 2 for 9, 3 for 8, another 2 for 9. It's tough. It's
frustrating. So, I mean, if those shots would have fell we would probably
talking about us winning.  
  
Q. J.T., can you just talk about dealing with Butler out there? He seemed to
be maybe the only guy for either team who could impose, like you talked about,
impose a little will on the game. How good was he now that you saw him in the
flesh?  
J.T. TILLER: I mean, he's a good player, you know. Night in and night out,
you're going to be challenged. He stepped up to the plate. He knew we were
going to try to really see what he was going to do. He put his stamp on the
game. So you can't take anything away from him. He's a good player.  
THE MODERATOR: We thank you guys for coming up. Appreciate it. Great season.
We'll take questions for Coach Anderson at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about what you saw from Michael Dixon today?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I thought I saw a young player kind of grow up a little bit
more. An NCAA basketball tournament player. That experience alone I think will
enable him to be a better basketball player next year. It's one thing to be in
the tournament. But then to come in and play in it as a freshman and to play
well, I thought he was real pivotal in what took place today, as we made a run
back in the game. We got down and he made some key shots, some key plays for
us. Again, he didn't look like a freshman out there.  
  
Q. We talked a lot about defense, both with you and Bob. In order to make a
deep run, do teams have to be able to score in this tournament and put
together some sort of offense?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think you're absolutely right. I think you have to be able to
put the ball in the hole. When you're talking about teams, the higher seed
teams playing against some of the lower seed teams, a lot of things have to go
right for you. It was evident tonight -- I thought we came with the right
mindset defensively, getting after it, putting ourself in position to have a
chance to win.  
But you're correct in what you just said. You have to put the ball in the
hole. We had opportunities to do that. And when that didn't take place, it
enabled West Virginia to get to the free-throw line. And they made their free-
throws. But when you talk about making a run in the tournament, you have to
put it in the hole, but you also have to play defense. I think they're a good
defensive team. We're a good defensive team. But the free-throw line, there's
a big difference, discrepancy in the free-throws.  
So, with that being said, they're known for their offensive, rebounding
ability. And I thought we matched that. But we had some opportunities to
really -- between the free-throw line, ourselves and some lay-ups that we
missed, it was an interesting game.  
  
Q. As a quick follow-up, you held them, I think it was 12:55 without a field
goal. Was it a case of if you could kind of get out of your own way you would
be all right and make a bucket or two offensively? Were you disheartened that
you couldn't build on to a lead or garner a lead in that you were playing such
defense?  
MIKE ANDERSON: When it was 25-all I thought we were gaining some momentum and
getting ready to take off. We took a couple of quick shots. But at the same
time I thought we attacked the basket a couple of times. We didn't get to the
line. On the other end, they got to the line. What was 25, where you say they
didn't score a field goal, they got to the free-throw line. But we had
opportunities to really gain some momentum, even in the second half. I thought
we got the game speeded up a little bit, disrupted. We had some lay-ups that
we normally cash in on, and just didn't. When you don't do that, you don't
make it happen. You don't get the winning formula if you don't cash in those
opportunities. But it wasn't because of lack of effort.  
I think these guys when you look at these seniors, they've won 31 games last
year. They won 23 this year. That's quite a few wins. When you talk about
teams across the nation. But I thought they played against a good West
Virginia team, and they came up a little short.  
  
Q. Mike, you said you told the guys -- like you said here, that you were
never more proud of a team than you were this one. Why? What especially?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Why, because I made a statement at the beginning of the year,
and I'm sure a lot of people picked up on it, a lot of people didn't. They
talked about our team losing 1,000 point scorers, three great players that are
playing professional ball. And I said it depends on how you look at the
hourglass. You can look at it half full or half empty. And I think a lot of
people probably wrote that we are probably going to be half empty. I think
people now see what I was talking about. It was half full. And with that being
said, it kind of evolved, and I think these guys put themselves into position
to almost, to almost do some of the same things they did last year. That's
what I mean, to have some things thrown at them adversity-wise. You get Joseph
Safford to go down, one of your most experienced guys to go down, that's
probably not even the fourth of the season left. And now there's adjustments
that have to be taking place. You have a guy playing hurt, Laurence Bowers.
You have a guy playing with a broke nose, J.T. Tiller. And yet, they never
complained. They continued to work. You guys wrote about it. But they
continued to work. That's why I said I couldn't be more proud of a group of
guys, because they paid the ultimate price, and with that being said, I think
they're going to be successful in life.  
  
Q. Do you think the fact you did get them back to the tournament replacing
those three 1,000 point scorers and having a sophomore league team shows your
program has some staying power?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think there's no question about it. Not only sustaining
power. We hope to be dancing again. It's not just coming to the dance. I think
a lot of people get caught up just coming here. We want to dance. I think that
baton was passed last year. It will be passed this year with these three
seniors you saw here. These guys are going to be really missed. I think when
you look at these guys here, you are looking at glue guys, guys that get in
the trenches that do all the dirty work.  
With that being said, we have to have some guys to replace those guys. They
will be dearly missed because of the -- dearly missed because of the impact
they had on the program. They were the most selfless guys I've ever been
around. You don't find that a whole lot in college basketball. A lot of guys
are about "me"; these guys were about the team. And I think if anybody got a
chance to see us play throughout the year, last year, this year, I think they
saw that brand, the same thing, the unselfish guys that play to win.  
  
Q. You guys have done a great job all year making the opposition feel
uncomfortable, get out of their comfort zone. Butler never seemed to get out
of the comfort zone tonight. Was that something you didn't do or something he
did because he played that well?  
MIKE ANDERSON: First half he got on a rhythm, he really got on a roll. I
thought the second half we did disrupt him. I think he got frustrated. I saw
him bark at the official. They were calling each other by the name. I went
"holy cow."  
Okay, Da'Sean. I was like, whoah, what was this here? I thought we did. I
thought that enabled to us get back into the game. I thought we did -- our
defense keyed, our guys made some adjustments. It was a game. People are going
to look at the final score and think they just -- no, they did not. I thought
it was a heck of a game. We got -- three minutes to go and we got the ball.
It's a four-point game. So it's a game that could have went any way.  
  
Q. You talked about replacing the glue guys. Kim English said it will be
harder to replace those guys than the three seniors from last year. Who do you
see being the glue guys next year?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Well, I think with the guys that already are on board right
now, their roles will change even more. You talk about the sophomores, Justin
Safford is going to be one of the few seniors we have. Then of course we have,
I think, a good recruiting class coming in. They have to prove themselves. So
with that being said, I mean, we'll get back and find out who those guys are
going to be. Obviously there's going to be some playing time there. When you
lose three starters from this team, three guys that were starting for us,
hopefully the competition begins in the off season. As we get prepared for
2010, 2011. We'll find out.  
But I think there will be some candidates. I promise you that.  
  
Q. Quick follow-up. This is the time of year where the talk is out there
about coaches. Care to comment on any of the speculation about you and
Auburn?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I don't know about no speculation. I guess that's you talking
-- I don't know anything about speculation. We just got finished up with the
NCAA tournament. That's all I'm talking about. I'm excited about what's taking
place at the University of Missouri. I really, really am.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Anderson? Coach, great year.  
MIKE ANDERSON: Thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to day three of the NCAA
Regional here in Buffalo, New York. We're joined by West Virginia student
athletes, from your right to left, Darryl Bryant, Da'Sean Butler, Devin
Ebanks, Kevin Jones, Wellington Smith at the far end. We'll go ahead and open
it up to questions.  
  
Q. Devin and actually anybody else that wants to address it, BIG EAST came
in with eight teams. You guys are down to four. A lot of people back in Big 12
country think they've got the best league. Can you make a case for your league
being the best in the country?  
DEVIN EBANKS: I still think we're the best league in the country. Just because
we haven't done so well in this tournament doesn't except the fact that we've
done poorly. We are a good conference. We have 16 teams that are very strong,
play against each other every night. There's no team in the conference that
you can sleep on. It's still the best conference to me. I think the best teams
are still in the tournament.  
  
Q. How about you, Da'Sean? What's your take?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: How many of the Big 12 got in?  
  
Q. Seven.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: One short. I still think we are the best conference by far. We
have very good -- we have a very good select talent in our conference as
players and different teams that are probably ranked eighth in our conference
at the time. But they can probably finish top 2 in any other conference.
That's how tough I think our league is. That's all I have to say about that.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, on that, there's always a theory that the BIG EAST is so
competitive that you guys beat each other up and come NCAA tournament time,
that's why some teams drop out early. Do you think there's any water in that
glass?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Not really. I think we had pretty much like two teams in the
Final Four last year. So every year is different. You can't really go and
judge us basically off maybe one year that we didn't -- we have four teams
fall out after probably one day. It happens. It's basketball.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, a lot was made after yesterday's slow start about how concerns
about how slow-starting West Virginia is and has been of late and just those
concerns. What do you see out of Missouri, and how much does that motivate you
guys to know you can't sleep on these guys considering the way they play?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: They're a very fast-paced team. They press. They're a pressure
team. They do what they have to do defensively and make everybody pick up
their pace to play to their pace, you know, which is extremely, you know,
chaos in a way. It's chaos.  
For us to come out successful, we can't fall into that. We need to take care
of the ball and just do what we do. Play defense, rebound and win the game.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, so many big shots this year at the end of games. When you get in
a close game, can you talk to us about the mentality you have about making the
play, when a lot of times guys shy away from that kind of play. What has made
you so successful in those key moments?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Oh, child. Honestly, I have no choice in the matter. It's
pretty much I know it's coming, the ball is going to be coming to me. My team
trusts me to take that big shot. It's something I practice and do every day as
far as just taking shots and just working at it. And it comes to the end of
the games. My teammates they trust me to make the play. When I go to get the
ball, before I get the ball, I just worry about the correct footwork and what
I have to do during that play so I can get the ball and execute. But, you
know, other than that, it's just motion. I can't really tell you that I'm
thinking exactly at that time because I'm just playing.  
  
Q. Darryl, can you talk a little -- they're a pressing team, they're a
frenetic team. How prepared are you guys for this? From what I gather earlier
in the season you saw something like that from Cleveland State. You guys have
been working on it ever since; is that correct?  
DARRYL BRYANT: We played against Louisville. A pressing team. It's the same
thing. I have to take care of the ball, me and Da'Sean and Devin. That's who
is taking care of the ball.  
We have to try to play a half-court game and try to slow the game down.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- have you guys put in more time than that on
breaking the press, on getting the ball than you have in the past?  
DARRYL BRYANT: Definitely. That was a major emphasis today in walk-through. So
it's just something that we have to do tomorrow come game time.  
  
Q. For Kevin, Darryl and Devin, how well did you guys know each other during
the recruitment process? And have you become like really good friends being
from New York and being in school in West Virginia together?  
KEVIN JONES: I played against Darryl in high school. He beat us unfortunately,
but I knew him from playing with him and against him and I didn't really know
Devin that well. I got to get to know him during our stay here so far. They
are like brothers to me now. Everybody up here is like a brother to me now.
And I'm just glad to be on the same team with them.  
DEVIN EBANKS: Yeah, it's like Kevin said. I heard about him obviously being
from the New York area but we never got to meet up. I've been beating up on
Truck in high school. So that's really -- I knew him for a while. That's
pretty much it.  
DARRYL BRYANT: It's fortunate for me I got to play against both of them in
high school. We lost to Devin and beat Kevin. I kind of knew them from New
York. Never hung out with them but we were good friends. That's just how it is
in basketball in New York City. We play basketball, you are all together. We
got here and we just -- now we live together and we are like best friends.  
  
Q. Did that influence any of you guys as far as knowing there was a
possibility others would be going there, as far as your decisions to go
there?  
DARRYL BRYANT: Definitely. When you see somebody else from New York that you
heard about and that you know about and you know they're a good player, of
course you want to play with them. That just brings other people together. Now
other New York guys are going to want to come here now. Knowing we're here and
we're family.  
  
Q. For Darryl, you said you just need to control the tempo, kind of turn
this into more of a half-court game tomorrow. How difficult is it to do this
against a team that likes to run up and down the floor the way they do?  
DARRYL BRYANT: It's probably going to be difficult but it won't be that
difficult because we're going to play the way we want to play them. We won't
let them alter our game. We're going to make it a half-court game instead of
running and playing helter-skelter with them.  
  
Q. For Darryl but also for everybody else. Is preparing for the press on
short turn-around like this any more difficult than preparing for anything
else, any other kind of defense or any other kind of strategy?  
DARRYL BRYANT: It's very difficult, honestly. Play against Louisville. They
press. Missouri is in a different league, different conference. It's kind of
different. You really know what you're practicing but you don't know what to
expect. Tomorrow come game time we have to make the adjustments.  
  
Q. Anybody else got thoughts on that?  
WELLINGTON SMITH: Didn't know if my mic was on or not. Yeah, we played against
so many people, so many teams. There's just something that it's just another
team we have to get by. Ever since Cleveland State and before then, we've been
-- every team watches tape and watches us not struggle but kind of have a hard
time against the press. And ever since then, everybody has been trying to
press us. So we're kind of used to it.  
Missouri is going to have a little something different for us. I know it.
Something we have to try to get through.  
  
Q. Wellington, you're not going to get away without answering to the smiles
when they were asking about Mr. Big shot here. You guys are used to this.
What's your reaction to that question?  
WELLINGTON SMITH: I mean, he's just always ready to play. No matter what, he's
always ready to take the big shot. We have confidence in him to take that big
shot. And we have confidence. When your teammates have confidence in you, when
your coach has confidence in you and you have confidence in yourself because
of those factors, what else is stopping you? When he has an opportunity to
take the big shot, he's going to take it. We're not going to fault him for
that. He's that player for us. So he fits that role.  
  
Q. Darryl, you sounded like almost arrogant about it's not going to be about
the press. We're going to play our game. We're going to stop them. Do you have
to have that to succeed at a high level in the NCAA?  
DARRYL BRYANT: Definitely. You have to have a niche confidence. You have to be
confident. We're confident right now. We're like on a seven-game winning
streak. Really just ready to play. Can't wait till tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for really anybody. What do you guys make of the hype in regard
to their fastest 40 minutes of basketball and they come in with this big
reputation, they actually have a motto that they've hung around themselves. Is
that kind of cool or does -- what do you guys think of that? Anybody?  
DARRYL BRYANT: I think it's cool because we are used to the press all game. I
think it's kind of fun and kind of cool to get after it. They're a tough team.
I'm not taking nothing from them. We just have to come ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you say we have to get after it, what do you mean by that, to affect
that reputation or to kind of knock that reputation off?  
DARRYL BRYANT: We're not trying to knock nobody's reputation off. We're trying
to go out there and play 40 minutes and win the game.  
  
Q. Another question about the press, if you guys don't mind. You guys are
getting bombarded by this. Is there anything specifically different about the
way Missouri does it or the personnel they use or anything like that as
opposed to how Louisville does it or Cleveland State does it or are all the
presses as far as you are concerned, all kind of the same?  
DARRYL BRYANT: Well, I say it's different, because they're first in the
country at forcing turnovers. That's definitely different from Louisville.
Louisville might be up there. They're first in the NCAA. It's going to be
tough.  
  
Q. A follow-up. You guys are all going to be involved in helping break this.
I know Wellington spoke about it. What do you guys see when Missouri does what
they do that you guys can do something different than most other teams have
been able to do?  
KEVIN JONES: I guess the whole thing about their press is to kind of like wear
you down throughout the game and just get you to make mental mistakes. I think
as long as we -- it's more about being mentally prepared than physically
prepared. As long as we don't make a lot of mental mistakes, you're going to
make mistakes throughout the game, but we have to cut down on them and I think
I think we'll be just fine.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Gentlemen, thanks for your time. Best of luck
tomorrow. Okay, joined by West Virginia Head Coach Bob Huggins. Team now 28-6,
as you know, number two seed. We'll open it up for questions for Coach
Huggins.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you've talked about how a lot of this tournament is about
matchups. Are there any common characteristics of your teams that have
advanced far in this tournament versus the ones that haven't made as long a
run?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think matchups have a lot to do with it. I think if you can
play against people who don't exploit your weaknesses, we all have weaknesses,
and if you can play against the people who don't exploit those weaknesses, I
think that's to your advantage. And then you have to make shots too.  
You look at all the upsets, those people that upset the people they probably
weren't supposed to make open shots when they had opportunities.  
  
Q. Bob, what about preparing for this press in such a tight window? Do you
worry that you, disproportionately worry about that and other things sort of
suffer in your prep time, I guess?  
BOB HUGGINS: You have an hour and a half. What's going to suffer? No. We
worked against the press on -- what is today? Saturday? When did we practice?
Wednesday. Wednesday. We worked against the press on Wednesday. We generally
work against the press every two or three days anyways. Because that's what I
said the other day. Because we figured we were going to be ahead in some games
and people are going to have to press us and we have to be able to handle
that. So we've continually worked on it.  
  
Q. How different kind of from the X's and O's standpoint is this one from
Louisville, from Cleveland State, from the ones that you've seen from other
people?  
BOB HUGGINS: Not that much drastically different. I mean, they change it. They
put a guy over the ball. They take a guy off the ball. They play some 2-2-1.
They play some 2-1-2. The whole scheme is about ball pressure like most
presses are.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Joe Mazzulla? The last couple of games where you have
had pressing teams, he's played on a different level. He's healthy. How much
can he help in this game tomorrow?  
BOB HUGGINS: We're going to need everybody to help. We pressed for a long time
when I was at Cincinnati. And I think what we try to do was have ten better
guys than the other team had ten. We may not have five better, but we had ten
better. I think Mike does a lot of that. They use their bench. We're going to
have to use our bench. We understand that. But, you know, I think the other
thing that happens in all honesty is time-outs in this tournament are about an
hour and a half. So you have a lot of time to catch your breath.  
  
Q. Bob, does the fact that out of eight teams in the BIG EAST, four of them
are already gone, does that alter your opinion of how good the BIG EAST is
this year, or not?  
BOB HUGGINS: Absolutely not. I feel bad for Georgetown. We probably got done
with that game at 11:30, maybe Saturday night and then turn around and play on
Tuesday. It's hard. Particularly a gut-wrenching loss. It's hard to bounce
back. Notre Dame had to bus back from New York. I don't know how long that is,
but it's a long way. Their planes weren't flying out of there. That was big,
big winds in New York. So there's a lot of things.  
You know, that being said, at the end of the day you still have to go play.
Our plane didn't show up last year. We didn't get in until 4 o'clock in the
morning. They're not going to cancel the game. You still have to go play. Is
that ideal? No. And I think there are a lot of different variables that come
into play.  
  
Q. There are a lot of people in the conference that you've coached in the
Big 12 that maintain that's the best conference.  
BOB HUGGINS: When I was in it, I probably would have said that too. But now
I'm not. So, I mean -- I think you have to experience the BIG EAST to
appreciate what it is. And you have to experience -- and I've told this story
a bunch for those of you of that heard it, I apologize. A year ago we played
three freshmen in our top six. We're scrambling, trying to win enough games to
get an NCAA tournament bid. We go to Georgetown, who at that time was 13th,
14th in the country, somewhere in there. We get a big win in Georgetown. I'm
usually not all that jovial but I was pretty happy. I get out and get on the
bus, might have a Jimmy John's sandwich sitting there. Again, I can't wait to
eat my Jimmy John's and watch a replay of the game on the bus on the way home.
And one of those guys in the back back there walks up and drops like seven to
ten DVD's on my chair on the bus. I said what's this? They said, "Come on,
Huggs, we have Pitt on Monday," who happened to be number two in the country
at that time. We have had four in the top ten. Other leagues don't do that. If
other leagues did that they would hail themselves as the greatest league of
all time. We were in a down year, allegedly, a down year. It's brutal. And
it's 18 games, takes a toll.  
  
Q. Bob, can you talk about Truck and how he's handled the press throughout
the year and where he's at now?  
BOB HUGGINS: Yeah. Truck has gotten significantly better. But you're going to
get significantly better when you practice it a lot. And we've spent a lot of
time on it. We just don't work against the press, we break everything down.
You know, I think the hard thing is when to go and when not to go. When do you
push the action, when do you not push the action. And I think he's gotten a
lot better in that regard in his decision-making.  
  
Q. I was just talking to Erik Martin in the locker room. He said even his
mom marvels at how much calmer you are than when he was playing for you in
Cincinnati. Can you just talk about what -- how you've managed to change your
style a little bit and yet maintain the same success?  
BOB HUGGINS: Did Mrs. Martin mention that Erik may have been part of the cause
of that? (Laughter) You get older, you know? You get older -- I was 30 I think
when I got the Akron job. I was 35 when I think I got the Cincinnati job. I
think that's where the term "youthful exuberance" came from. You are a little
more excitable.  
  
Q. The players were saying that Missouri's press sort of distinguishes
itself, it takes a toll mentally as much or more than it does physically. What
do you think of your team's mental toughness, the way that they've maintained
a mental toughness over the course of this season, not just in those
situations but in all situations?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think we've gotten better as the season has gone along. You
know, everybody thought we had all this experience. And the reality was we had
three sophomores starting with two seniors. We really only have two seniors on
our team. So we're not as old and experienced as what people have a tendency
to act like we are. That being said, I think going through two years of the
BIG EAST, I think if that doesn't toughen you up, then you're playing the
first day in the BIG EAST. Which nobody really wants to do.  
So, we're better, we're tougher. But I think, you know, we understand things
better too. I can make more adjustments now than what I could make before,
because they have a better background. They have a better understanding of
what I'm trying to tell them to do.  
  
Q. Forgive me if this has been asked already. Devin's production has been so
much better since the start of the BIG EAST schedule. What was said to him and
what has been the difference in him from January on this season?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't think we said a lot to him in all honesty. It was the
same way a year ago. I think if you go look at his stats from a year ago, he
did the same thing a year ago.  
  
Q. What's been the difference in him? What do you see differently he's doing
now that he wasn't doing earlier in the season?  
BOB HUGGINS: I mean, he had games earlier in the season where he really was
very, very good. And he had some other games where he wasn't. Devin was hurt
for -- I don't want to give you bad information, but it seems to me he was
hurt for eight or ten games. He played through it, he had a really bad
sprained hand and played with a wrap on it and didn't play as well than as
what he's played later on.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about all the great players you had at
Cincinnati, guys have to want to take the big shot in the big moment. What has
made Butler that kind of guy? What is different about his mentality that he
wants to be that person when other players may not necessarily want to take
that shot?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think it's pretty simple. Da'Sean wants to win. I remember he
kind of liked playing with Joe Alexander because Joe got all the attention.
And then Joe decided to declare early, and coming back next year, Da'Sean was
our best player. I think he got -- I don't know what he got, 36, 38 something
like that in our first exhibition game. He apologized all night. Apologized to
his teammates, he apologized to the media, he apologized to the coaches. I'm
like, "What's wrong with you, man?" He said, "Coach, I don't want to hog the
ball." I said, "Get used to it because we're going to throw it to you because
you're our best player."  
I think we went through that with Alexander to a degree. But not near as much
as Da'Sean.  
You can be too nice a guy, be too good a guy. And I think if Da'Sean has maybe
a fault, he may be too nice a guy, too good a guy. But I think above and
beyond that, he really wants to win. And I think that he's gotten -- it's like
anything else, you get more comfortable the more you do things. He's had the
ball in his hands a bunch this year. So he's become much more comfortable with
it.  
  
Q. Bob, I've sat through tons of these press conferences over the years. I
don't think I've ever seen a team giggle on the podium as much as we just saw
your guys do the last few minutes. In general, are they a loose bunch? Do they
have to be loose to deal with you? Can you give us an insight into their
personality a little?  
BOB HUGGINS: What do you mean by that? No, I mean, I want them to have fun and
enjoy the experience.  
I think in '92 we went to the Final Four, I brought seven of them in. They
were hilarious. Everybody had the biggest time in the world. They were
entertaining and engaging and funny and everything that you can think about.
And I want these guys to enjoy themselves. I want them to have a good time.
They will be very quick to tell you now when it's time to do business, then we
do business. But what's wrong with enjoying the experience and soaking it all
up and having some fun? There isn't any doubt when it comes time to do
business, they will do business. They understand that.  
  
Q. Bob, everybody is talking about Missouri's press. But there's obviously
got to be some areas where Missouri is going to have problems with your team.
Other than rebounding, what is that?  
BOB HUGGINS: We guard, Jack. We have been, I think, for the last three years,
in the top five in the BIG EAST in scoring defense. I think we were one, we
may have fallen to two now. But we were one for a while. It's generally us and
Pitt. We're going to guard. That's kind of what we've hung our hat on is we
guard pretty good and we rebound the ball. I don't think that's a secret. I
don't think I'm letting anything out of the bag. I think Mike probably already
figured that out.  
  
Q. Just to follow-up on that. You mentioned earlier in your career in
Cincinnati you pressed a lot and trapped a lot. What's the key to maintaining
that same kind of defensive success while basically changing the style?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I mean honestly what happened is we didn't have as much
foot speed as what we had before. You know, you look at Missouri and there are
two guys -- their two bigs are very mobile. They're very mobile, they're very
long. They can run, they're quick. And then you have guys that can guard the
ball. And they have guys that can guard the ball. Mike has done a great job of
recruiting guys to his style. We had some guys -- honestly, let me tell you
the truth, when we recruited Danny Fortson, he wasn't going to press. Danny
got mad when somebody beat him. So he fouled him hard. So now I have my best
players sitting on the bench with three fouls in the first five minutes of the
game. Didn't make any sense to me. So we stopped pressing. But he was a two-
time Consensus First Team All-American as a sophomore and junior before he
left. We might have done the right thing.  
  
Q. When you were out of this for a year, did you miss this, the NCAA
tournament? What's this tournament, just in general, mean to you?  
BOB HUGGINS: I really missed the media, Jack. No, I had a good time. It's kind
of fun to watch all the games. I had never been able to do that. And then what
happens is when you -- when you're young, when I was at my first NCAA
tournament I was at Akron. We lost to Michigan by four. And then you're
saying, how do you ever like advance in this thing? Everybody is so good. And
then in '92 we went to the Final Four. '93 we got beat in the Elite Eight in
overtime. Then you're mad. Then you don't want to watch anything. Then you're
mad because you think you should be playing. It screws you up, Jack.  
If we lose -- when we lose I'll be mad. I won't want to watch. It's kind of
fun that you're out. I can sit there and you can watch all those games and
enjoy it, kind of have fun. Call my buddies on the phone, and enjoy them being
miserable instead of me. It's good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by student athletes from Gonzaga. Closest to me,
Matt Bouldin; next to him, Steven Gray; Robert Sacre is with us as well. Go
ahead and open it up for questions for these student athletes at this time.  
  
Q. I have a couple of questions. First for Robert, you guys talked a lot
about the travel that you do the other day playing Michigan State, Illinois on
the road and so on. I just wonder, is that part of the challenge of going to
Gonzaga, is playing a schedule that's kind of above your conference, you know
keep yourself established as a national team?  
ROBERT SACRE: I think we just chose Gonzaga for a reason because they always
travel and play the top competition in the country. That's the reason, because
it's one of those things where we come in and we know we're going to play the
best teams every year, and it will benefit us in the tournament.  
  
Q. And for Matt, I happened to be at the Garden the day you guys had your
one really bad day this year. How much was travel a factor for that game? A
noon start, coming across the country, and what did you guys get out of that
experience?  
MATT BOULDIN: We didn't get a whole lot out of that one. I don't think the
travel was that much of a factor. We had done so many games before in similar
situations I guess where we travel everywhere. But, you know, I think that's
one we learned from and forgot about as quickly as we could. That was easily
our worst performance this year. It was a close game for about -- about until
half or so. Then we just lost it. So we really don't even think about that
game, for the most part.  
  
Q. Could you, each of you guys, could you talk about sort of the deciding
factor that brought you to Gonzaga? In other words, you're playing this whole
universe, the North Carolinas and the Syracuses and the blah-blah-blah, and
you decided to come here. And I was wondering, to share with us, what was sort
of the deciding factors that made you say, okay, this is it?  
ROBERT SACRE: I came to Gonzaga because I enjoyed being with the guys. It was
one of those things where Spokane is a great city. They embraced Gonzaga
basketball. I enjoyed that a lot. I loved everyone on the team and the
coaching staff. It's a great place. It's a big family environment. You enjoy
being with the guys off and on the court.  
STEVEN GRAY: I think for me too it was a lot of just that family environment,
the sense of camaraderie with your teammates and everyone on the team really
seemed to enjoy being around each other. Coming from a small town, that's kind
of something that I looked for, and I committed fairly early. So it was just
kind of sounds good, "why not" type thing. It worked out. I wouldn't want to
be anywhere else. Definitely worked out.  
MATT BOULDIN: I think I chose Gonzaga for the same reasons as these guys, but
also because they have had so much success with, I felt, players like myself.
The Dan Dickau's and the Blake Stepp's, a lot of those big guards. That was
big factor. And I love the way they play, the up and down pace, a lot of
freedom. Those were all factors in why I chose Gonzaga.  
  
Q. For Steven, you know what they're going to do. They run that zone
defense. Why is it so effective when you guys have seen it on tape or on TV?
And what become the keys for you guys attack it?  
STEVEN GRAY: It's so successful because they're so long. They are really
active in the zone. They take a lot of things away. And so that energy just
creates problems for most teams. As far as attacking it, we have to look to
not be afraid to get the ball inside and not really settle for outside
jumpshots. Take them when they're there. Not really settle, because that leads
to long rebounds and they're such a good breaking team, we want to try and
limit that as best we can, too.  
  
Q. Basically, as far as when you approach playing a number one seed like
Syracuse, what is the mentality? Because you're always going up against the
big guy, and people expect you to play well and give you a chance for the
upset. But it's usually in these types of situations where it would be
regarded as an upset. So what's the mental approach to that?  
ROBERT SACRE: We just come into every game viewing it as one game at a time.
We're really not thinking about the upset or where they're at in the seeding.
We're just viewing it as one game. We're viewing it basically this is our
championship, this is the finals right now. Because we have nothing to lose,
and everything to gain from this game.  
STEVEN GRAY: I think the mental approach just has to be one that we've kind of
carried all year: Just be ready to come in, work hard, and not allow ourselves
to be outplayed, outcompeted. That's something the coaches really stress on
us. Make sure you match the level of intensity from the guy across from you.
So we just have to have that workmanlike attitude that the coaches talk about
to us in practice.  
  
Q. For Matt and Steven, could you talk about Robert's development and what
his presence in the middle now means to you guys?  
MATT BOULDIN: Rob is a beast. I think a lot of people -- a lot of people
across country don't realize how big and how physical he is. That alone helps
our team. But the fact that he's developing into a scoring threat down there.
When he's knocking down free-throws, he puts so much foul pressure on a lot of
teams. He's a huge factor to our team. Defensively he bangs with any big guy
in the country. I think he thrives on that. That's just his mindset. It really
helps us a lot.  
STEVEN GRAY: I got a chance because I live with him, so I got to see that this
summer. He went down to the gym just about every day during the summer and
really put his time in. It's really nice to see all that pay off this year. I
couldn't think of another big that I would want to have in the post. You can
throw it -- his hands have gotten so much better in his time here. You can
throw it and he's going to get the ball. He's got that jump-hook, turn-around
jumper. I mean he's such a big, physical guy. You don't really have to worry
about that aspect of the game, that inside presence that we've lacked at times
in years prior. I mean, he's a big part of our success this year. We're going
to need him if we're going to want to make a run here.  
  
Q. This is for Rob. With Onuaku being out, how do you think that affects the
game? And do you see even being more critical for you to play a good game out
here?  
ROBERT SACRE: I really don't view it as -- they have great players in the post
anyways. So it's one of those things they lose a big-time scoring threat down
inside, but overall, they're a big, physical team. They're in the BIG EAST. So
they will be physical. We know they're going to come out and bang with us. I
know I need to do my role and be a threat in the inside.  
  
Q. As follow-up to anybody, (Elias) Harris, can you comment on how your view
of him, how good -- were you surprised how good he is? And what do you think
about his potential? People talk about him as being an eventual first-round
draft choice. How do you see the way he has developed this year?  
MATT BOULDIN: He's gotten a ton better this year. Obviously he's got the
physical tools to be a first-rounder easily. He can jump and run and -- with
anybody in the country. The fact that when he's hitting shots and faces up,
he's that much harder to guard. But, yeah, I was really surprised. Obviously
we hadn't heard or seen him play. Maybe a YouTube highlight here and there.
But when he got here I think his first four or five possessions during pick-up
ball were all dunks. We were like, okay, he can play. So we've seen it all
year. We know how good he is and how good he's become. He's only going to get
better.  
  
Q. With a quick turn-around like this, is it difficult to prepare? And is it
more difficult to prepare for their zone with a quick turn-around like this?  
ROBERT SACRE: We've been in tournaments all year. So I feel like we can
compete and we've always had these quick turn-arounds. If you look back at
Maui, we were very successful at that with going with the quick turn-around.
Changing with different adjustments like going from Wisconsin all the way to
Cincinnati. So I feel we did a good job on that.  
  
Q. Are you guys preparing for -- will you be surprised if Onuaku gets out
there tomorrow?  
MATT BOULDIN: No.  
ROBERT SACRE: No. It's his last year, so I wouldn't blame him if he came out
and tried to give it his all.  
  
Q. For Matt, you mentioned Blake and Dan. What stood out when you watched
them in the tournament, with your decision to come to Gonzaga?  
MATT BOULDIN: What stood out in the tournament?  
  
Q. When you saw them play.  
MATT BOULDIN: How much fun they're having and how close the team was and how
they all fed off each other. I really enjoyed watching them play because of
the way they played. I thought they played basketball like in its purest form.
They're great passers, all great-around players. Dan obviously was a scorer,
could shoot it from anywhere, he reminds me of Jimmer Fredette in a lot of
ways. I was a Zag fan back then. More the Blake era was my favorite time
becoming a Zag fan.  
  
Q. Still a recruiting question. For each of you, who was the most important
person when you were making your decision to finally pull the trigger to come
here, who was your go-to person that you leaned on to kind of confirm that you
were going to do it, if in fact there was a go-to person?  
MATT BOULDIN: Mine was obviously my dad -- my dad. My dad was my biggest
supporter in that recruitment process. My dad and my high school head coach
said to me, I think you're born to play at Gonzaga. That's the night I
committed to Gonzaga. It was really my dad and my high school coach.  
STEVEN GRAY: For me I would probably say my AAU coach. He always had a lot of
confidence in me. He told me that he thought Gonzaga would be a good fit. I
went for a summer camp, and my high school coach said, I wouldn't be surprised
if in this meeting if they didn't offer you. I thought he was a little crazy.
And they did.  
I called my dad that night and said, I think this is where I want to go. I
don't see why I wouldn't want to come here. I think it was more my AAU coach.
But it was a pretty simple decision, I guess.  
ROBERT SACRE: I would have to say my mom was there for a lot of the
recruiting. She helped me a lot. Just to have a person to talk to. But she was
like, I'm not a part of you making the decision. I do not want you to be
unhappy and blame it on me or anything like that. So I would have to put it on
myself when it comes to my decision. I just thought it was a great place. I
wanted to be here.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck, tomorrow. We're with Gonzaga Head Coach Mark Few.
We'll go ahead and have you make an opening statement, Coach, and take
questions at that time.  
MARK FEW: Hey, it's great to still be here. It's great to be playing. I don't
think there's any better feeling from a coaching standpoint when your team
goes out and gets an NCAA tournament win, and you get to keep coaching them,
keep playing in this thing. I hate to be redundant but it's the greatest
sporting event in the world so you want to stay in it as long as you can.
Especially the way we grinded it out yesterday. We beat a very good Florida
State team. A phenomenal defensive team. And to be able to make baskets and
execute against them and beat them on the boards I thought was a great
statement by our team. And now we're, gosh, stepping into probably one of the
biggest challenges we've ever had since I've been the head coach at Gonzaga.  
It's very similar to playing North Carolina last year in the Sweet 16. This is
a phenomenal basketball team we're playing in their own backyard that has
played great all year. Short preparation to play against this zone, not only
against the zone but to prepare for their transition game, is a tall task. But
it's a great opportunity also.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. We've been hearing all morning the Big 12 and the BIG EAST have been
battling who has the best conference, with St. Mary's knocking off Villanova
today and you of course hoping to advance, can you explain to us why we were
remiss in not understanding how your conference prepared you to be successful
in this tournament?  
MARK FEW: I don't -- how you were not --  
  
Q. We all counted on the BIG EAST. We talked about how many teams, we talked
about the competition and all the other conferences, making them sharp for
this, that they were prepared, and now you guys sort of come in and you're
3-0.  
MARK FEW: I think everybody gets way too into the sweeping generalizations
with leagues and affiliations and whether you have football at your school or
not. You guys probably all need to look at the teams and say okay, there's a
really good program. There's a really good team. And I think we all want to
group everything into BCS or non-BCS or whatever. You should probably look at
the basketball teams. If you watched at all this year, you could tell that St.
Mary's was a very good basketball team.  
If you watched us, we won the Maui. We had some big wins on the road. We won
our league, which has been a very good league, especially this year. I think
it would probably be better off if everybody didn't get into the groupings and
generalizations.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the quick turn-around of playing a team like
Syracuse with that 2-3 zone and their transition game. How much more difficult
is it basically having one day to prepare for it?  
MARK FEW: It's really difficult. Obviously you're not going to go very hard
today. We haven't seen anything like that all year. Obviously there aren't
many like it. Especially with the size and athleticism that they bring. Then
the other thing that's very impressive is they run the basketball and get out
in transition very much like the great North Carolina team did last year,
being able to somehow slow that thing down is a tall task in 24 hours.  
  
Q. Mark, could you talk about Jim and yourself with the Coaches Versus
Cancer and how he got you into it and all that kind of stuff?  
MARK FEW: Yeah, Jim and Juli. Juli really motivated Marcy and myself, as did
Coach B (Boeheim). We came out and actually went to theirs, which was the
first one of its kind. And theirs has been hugely successful. Ours, we've
raised over four million with ours. We are the two far and away the biggest in
the country. He's just treated me with a lot of -- took me under his wing on
Nike trips and NCAA things. I'll always remember that. He's a Hall of Fame
coach with -- I don't think you guys get to know him on the level we get to
know him. He's got a great sense of humor. He's a very, very fun guy to be
around. Until I was able to see that side of him, you never would have guessed
that. Obviously his coaching stands for itself. And the other thing I don't
think people understand is how involved he is in college basketball. He gives
so much back to this game via U.S.A. Basketball, through the NABC, with
everything he does. I mean, he has dedicated his life to not only Syracuse
basketball, but to college basketball. We're so much better off because of
that.  
I don't think people realize how many days a year he gives up to basketball
and cancer and all those things like that. So he's a heck of a mentor.  
  
Q. Is there anything from the first half last night against Florida State
that you guys were able to do offensively that could translate to tomorrow
afternoon, understanding that obviously they are two different styles of
defense.  
MARK FEW: Make a bunch of shots. That always makes life easier for a coach and
player. That one thing I would say is play with the type of poise and pace we
played with in the first half yesterday. I mean, we're going to have to be
able to do that against the zone and not get caught up in trying to score off
the first pass or the first side. Probably that would be the biggest thing.
It's obviously a very different type of scenario, hard-nosed in-your-face,
man-to-man defense. But I think Bo (Boeheim) will tell you the zone this year
for Syracuse has been so effective because they've been turning a bunch of
people over. They've really been forcing a lot of turnovers in their zone. We
have to take care of the basketball and get shots on our terms.  
  
Q. How different is Syracuse if Onuaku does not play or is playing hurt?  
MARK FEW: I certainly didn't notice a difference last night. They looked
phenomenal last night. I think they're probably better equipped to answer that
than I am just on watching them. Obviously it affects their depth. Us losing
Manny affects our depth a lot. So you're putting guys in positions that maybe
haven't been in those type of positions or playing minutes like that. Sure
didn't look like it affected them much at all last night.  
  
Q. Could you talk to the matchup problem that Wes Johnson might give you
guys?  
MARK FEW: Yeah. He's a very difficult matchup. I don't think we're the only
team in the country that's had a difficult time matching up with him. Anytime
you get a gifted athlete like that that can stroke it out to three and put it
on the deck and get it to the rim and finish above the rim and also make plays
with his passing ability, that's a really hard guard. That's why he's player
of the year. We'll have to guard him, give him a bunch of different looks.
They're so balanced and they share the ball so well this year, that makes them
very difficult. The only other team we've seen that really passes it as well
as they are is St. Mary's. Everybody is seeing the kind of success they're
having.  
  
Q. Coach, Steven Gray in talking about Syracuse's zone said he can't settle
for jumpshots. Talk about getting the ball inside. With that in mind, can you
talk about how important Robert Sacre could be tomorrow?  
MARK FEW: You have to step up and make shots against it. The only way you're
going to beat that thing. The teams that have done that have stepped up and
made shots. We won't go away from that. I think all our guys will be key
tomorrow. Obviously Rob had a great approach yesterday against Florida State.
I think it's very important for Elias to be really active in there. Our
perimeters have to step up and make shots. So I would put it on everybody and
not just on Rob inside.  
  
Q. Mark, Leonard Hamilton yesterday was speaking very admirably of your
program and how it has really grown and grown. He kind of compares it to
they've become gunslingers; you go around the country and look for people to
fight. He meant it in a very positive way.  
MARK FEW: That's great.  
  
Q. I was wondering at the very beginning what your vision was; had you ever
envisioned getting it to this point? And where would you like to see it in
another five years?  
MARK FEW: That's a great, great question. We just try -- what we try to do --
going back to that first year we got in the tournament, made a run and got to
the Elite Eight. We didn't want to be a one-hit wonder. We wanted to not be a
flash in the pan. So we've been able to continue recruiting, we just kept
trying to get better and better and better along those lines. The university
has grown tremendously from -- I think we had 3,000 students. We now have over
7,500 students since this run started. We've changed our facilities, pretty
much changed the way we do everything as far as we just continue to grow. And
now I think we've turned ourselves into a national brand and a national name.  
And then obviously the next step would be to be able to get in this thing and
get a number one seed or something, so you kind of have the advantages that
come with that.  
  
Q. Mark, over the years can you talk about the level of talent available in
Canada? Obviously you have four Canadian kids on your roster, Syracuse has
two. Are there more good players north of the border now?  
MARK FEW: Yeah. And I think -- sometimes I don't think you consider it so much
-- there's so much intermixing now with the AAU tournaments that you'll watch
a team and you'll be -- where are those guys from, they're pretty good. That's
a group from Toronto or they have a couple of Vancouver kids. So it's not like
you're going to these big international tournaments and exotic places. They're
showing up in tournaments in Vegas and Orlando and Kansas City and Texas and
pretty much everywhere all the other guys are. I think they're changing their
approach up there, and the youth basketball has gotten a lot better, and
there's lot of good coaches up there. Who knows, might end up being more
popular than hockey and curling if we keep going on this pace. It will take a
while, but...  
You never know.  
  
Q. Could you just comment on Harris' development this year and how you feel
he's been playing of late.  
MARK FEW: He's been phenomenal all year when you think of freshmen and
somebody internationally coming in and adjusting to just the whole aspect that
is college basketball. Whether it's living in a dorm and immersing yourself
with a bunch of new guys that you've never been around to -- obviously the
crowds and things that we face are nothing like what he's seen over there.
He's pretty much kind of playing in front of not a whole lot of people. So how
he's adjusted, has just been unbelievable. He's a great student. He's a very
responsible guy. He's a wonderful teammate. And then I mean he's a really
tough, hard-nosed kid.  
When it's game time, he's been remarkably consistent all year. I think that's
probably the most impressive thing with him right there, is just how
consistent he's been.  
  
Q. You talk about eventually getting up to that level where you can get a
number one seed. When you look at this year, were you surprised to be as low
as an eighth seed given you had been up in the rankings in the year. And do
you think that conference tournament loss hurt you, whereas Syracuse stayed a
number one despite losing their first conference game?  
MARK FEW: Well, I mean, I thought Syracuse all along should be number one
seed, if not the number one seed overall. Just the way they played this entire
season, just kind of how they're built for this NCAA tournament. You know, as
I said, the night of the selection, again, the overwhelming feeling I had, to
be honest with you, was pride. Pride being we made it 12 straight in the NCAA
tournament. North Carolina wasn't up there this year, UConn wasn't up there,
Arizona had a streak of 25 end this year, UCLA. There are some incredible
programs.  
What stood out to me is just it's so hard to get in this thing year in and
year out. That far overwhelmed anything -- the seedings, you get caught up in
that. What this comes down to really is matchups, you know? And some of these
guys ended up with high seeds and ended up with some really tough matchups,
like Cornell or something. It doesn't matter if you have a great seed, if you
end up playing somebody that's kind of like your kryptonite which I think
Villanova and Richmond and those guys found.  
  
Q. But in terms of respect for having been there -- for this being the 12th
year, should you have gotten on the four, five, six line?  
MARK FEW: I think -- I wasn't in the room but I think we probably took a hit
for losing in our league tournament that in retrospect now if we all look back
at it here this afternoon, probably shouldn't have taken that big of a hit. I
thought we've been pretty darn consistent all year with how we've won and
where we played and who we beat and to win our league. The other thing I
always say is you go into those league tournaments and when you know you're in
the NCAA tournament and the other teams that aren't are playing with a sense
of desperation, sometimes it's really difficult to match. I think you can
really garner a lot from those teams that still go in there and win them.  
Kansas won theirs, Duke won theirs, Butler won theirs. Those guys were all in
the tournament. Kentucky won theirs. That says a lot right there. Because
that's a hard deal when you know you're in the tournament and those other
teams are playing for their lives.  
  
Q. You were talking about the growth of the program. What role did the AAU
play in that growth? I know there's been a movement from a lot of coaches
saying I think we need to kind of reel this back in. But I'm wondering what's
your perspective on that?  
MARK FEW: You know, that goes back to what I alluded to earlier. All of us, me
included, we want to group everybody together and say all the AAU guys, 95% of
the AAU guys are great guys, and they're doing such an honorable thing to get
kids playing and taking them under their wings and doing things like that. You
know, obviously we've -- most of our guys have played in those tournaments and
been very successful in those tournaments. I think we're a program now that's
very accepted to a lot of the powerhouse AAU programs. Yeah, if we can send an
I go to Gonzaga, that would be great. So it's been a process of educating
those people, much like it has been with scheduling and even with the media
nationally. I think they serve a very good purpose. I do think that there are
some things going on with people that shouldn't be going on that -- everything
has to go through them or whether it's money or whatever, that you hear about.
So obviously those are the ones that have to get out and keep the good ones in
somehow.  
  
Q. Mark, I hope you didn't cover this earlier when you talked about Boeheim.
Going forward, do you see anybody staying at a school for that long in a
pressure business like this is?  
MARK FEW: Well, I think that's what's great. Coaches came up and had other
offers, to go other places, it's great to be able to talk to him. He has been
out to our Coaches Versus Cancer been out on our campus and seen what we have.
For me he's been a great source of somebody I can lean on and ask him hard
questions. I think that's incredibly honorable and a great thing. You wish you
saw more of it. If you think about what he's been able to do and Coach
Krzyzewski has been able to do staying at the same place now, Tom (Izzo) has
always been there, Michigan State quite a while, I think sometimes that gets
lost. Everybody always jockeying around to leave. He's created a legacy that
will be there forever at Syracuse. And I think everybody in the world
identifies Syracuse with Jim Boeheim or Jim Boeheim with Syracuse. And that's
something pretty cool.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're with the Syracuse student athletes. Closest to me, Scoop
Jardine; next to him, Wes Johnson; and Andy Rautins is at the far end.
Syracuse advancing to 29-4. The early game tomorrow against Gonzaga. We'll go
ahead and open up for questions at this time for these student athletes.  
  
Q. Wes, can you explain to me when you're looking at the move that Scoop
made last night, what's going through your head? You've seen it enough times,
I'm sure. You kind of can anticipate what's about to happen before it
happens?  
WES JOHNSON: I saw when I was running down the court I was wondering what he
was about to do. I've seen him do it in pick-up and in practice a lot. When he
put it out in the game, it was like, "Wow?" I was excited he made it and he
made his free-throw. That's what sealed it off.  
  
Q. Just a follow on that: Can you feel the electricity in the building when
he comes in there and takes over like that?  
WES JOHNSON: Of course. Especially when he makes moves like that and he comes
in off the miss. He gives a real spark off the bench. When he comes in you can
feel the energy pick up when he steps on the court.  
  
Q. For Wes and Andy, what do you think of when you hear the name Gonzaga?  
WES JOHNSON: I hear a good team. It's going to be a real good matchup. I think
going into tomorrow's game we have to be focused and really just come out and
take it to them. They've been in the top 15 the whole year. So I know it's
going to be a good game.  
ANDY RAUTINS: Like-wise they're a top-tier team every year. Always considered
a Cinderella team in the NCAA tourney. They've proven themselves time and
again. They have great players on every end of the floor. We know it's going
to be a defensive battle tomorrow. That's where we're going to get the win.  
  
Q. And one last thing, what did you guys think when you heard that now
Villanova was out?  
SCOOP JARDINE: I guess we got to root for the BIG EAST. There's us and
Pittsburgh left and West Virginia. We have to win for the BIG EAST. I feel
like the BIG EAST is the best conference in the country. We have to go make it
be known. We have to stay in this tournament. Villanova and the rest of the
teams are out.  
  
Q. Andy, a question for you. Gonzaga is a team that likes to -- seems to
pass the ball around, make that extra pass. Do you see a lot of your offense
and the principles of sharing the ball with all the assists in the Gonzaga
team?  
ANDY RAUTINS: Absolutely. They're a very unselfish team. They move the ball
well. They have a bunch of smart players out there. They make the extra pass.
I think that's what makes those type of teams great. They're good decision-
makers out there. They're very head strong. You're going to have to be very
well rounded game for us on defense and also crash the defensive glass too.  
  
Q. For Scoop and Andy, last night was really the first night you guys had to
play without Arinze. Can you talk about adapting and changing the way you
played and specifically Rick and DaShonte's play last night and looking ahead
to tomorrow as well?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Losing "AO" is a big hurt to our team. We know that. I think
Rick and DaShonte did a great job playing in there together. I think DaShonte
did a lot of great things. Using his body getting a lot of blocks and getting
some rebounds. And Rick has been a force for us all year. We have to play like
he's on the floor. If he's not on the floor, he's still with us no matter
what. We have to continue to win and hopefully have him back.  
ANDY RAUTINS: It was certainly a different feel playing without Arinze out
there. Like Scoop said, DaShonte did a great job of stepping up last night
going from almost no minutes during the regular season to being pushed out of
here in the NCAA tournament. So very proud of what he's done so far. He was
patient. He played aggressive. And I think he's got a lot more big minutes to
come. Rick as well. He stepped up his minutes time played last night. We're
expecting that out of him. He's a great player. Every time we feed him in the
post we feel like he's capable of scoring. We have enough talent and depth to
compete without Arinze as much as we wouldn't like to.  
  
Q. Scoop, about that cross-over -- I'm kidding. We don't want to talk about
that. The crowd, do you think it will be even louder tomorrow night? Do you
think there were times you guys noticed it helped you with energy?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Yeah. It was like we were playing a home game. When I first got
subbed in the game, they was cheering my name. It got me energized and I was
ready to go. The crowd was great for us all year. No matter where we played
at, they've been coming out to support us. I want to thank everybody for that.
It was times where we knew it got loud in there, especially when Andy hit the
two threes in the second half. And of course the move I made it got loud. I'm
just happy everybody is coming out to support us.  
  
Q. For Scoop and for Andy, this time of year styles of play become very
important, and there are a lot of programs outside of the BIG EAST that don't
face the 2-3 the way you guys play it. I'm curious, do you notice early on in
the game when you are playing someone who hasn't faced it, is there almost a
couple of seconds or hesitation when they're trying to figure out what is
going on?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Yeah, I feel like teams don't know what we're going to do as
far as when we play a BIG EAST team, they try to slow the game down, make
extra passes, try to slow our zone down. When teams don't know what our zone
is about and know what our zone is capable of, it kind of hurts them
especially in the beginning of the game because we're so long and we're so
active out there. We communicate with each other to trap the corners.  
A lot of teams don't see that much out of the zone. They think a zone is just
for you to just rest and be lacking. But not our zone. Our zone gets out the
shooters, we come out with the hands high, we cover every area on the floor
and we try to get out of the zone and get rebounds, and Wes get blocks out of
the zone. We try to be active more than anything.  
ANDY RAUTINS: I think initially off the jump ball when they come down on
offense that they get a little bit staggered out there. Looking at our zone, I
think we have a lot more length than the people we're used to seeing. I think
our zone is a lot more aggressive than other passive types of zones you see
out there in college basketball right now. Especially the way we trap and the
way we recover for each other with a high hand.  
But, yeah, it's definitely a different look for teams that are coming into the
NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. For Andy, I have two questions. They're sixth in the nation in field goal
percentage. What do you think about the key to defending them and then for
Wes, with all their height, how much of a concern is that with all the seven-
footers and the height they have?  
ANDY RAUTINS: They're an extremely efficient team. We know we're going to have
to contest every shot. We're going to have to crash the glass hard. But, you
know, that's just going to be a challenge for us. We look forward to that.
We've seen this all year, playing against the types of teams like Villanova.
Really efficient. You know they're a great team. We're going to have to come
out and have a great defensive game.  
WES JOHNSON: With their height, we're just going to have to come and play
solid defense and use our athleticism to take the height away. That's really
just walling up and making them take tough shots and try to limit their
touches as much as possible.  
  
Q. This is for Wes, because these guys have been -- Andy grew up in
Syracuse. Do you think all this talk of the zone, do you think it gets in the
heads of teams? You saw from afar when you were in Iowa. Do you think it gets
into the back of their minds a little bit?  
WES JOHNSON: I think so, especially with this team now how we play. It looks
like a matchup our man-to-man basically, how Kris and Rick will be out in the
wings.  
Other than that, how we move and we talk in the zone a lot really just gets in
their mind. They are probably playing in the conferences -- that's how our
conference looks like it's a regular 2-3 zone which when they come and play us
it's not. We're moving around so much and basically like a man but we cover
our areas very well.  
  
Q. For Andy, if he's not texting Wes. You guys have a sweatshirt I think
that says, "Syracuse Basketball, Shut It Down." Do you know who originated
that and what the thought is behind it?   
WES JOHNSON: It started from Coach Rob Murphy. "Shut it down" is a little
movement and process that we have. It's this whole theme to our defensive
mindset is shut it down. He also came out with a song "Shut It Down." He's
rapping in it. It blew up throughout the year. It came from Rob Murphy.  
SCOOP JARDINE: It's a great song.  
WES JOHNSON: Manny's, you can order a T-shirt, sweat shirt, hat, whatever you
need, so Manny.  
  
Q. Can you bang out a couple of lyrics?  
WES JOHNSON: Later on I can tell him.  
SCOOP JARDINE: "We run the BIG EAST."  
WES JOHNSON: He can get you later on in the day. I'll tell you to play the
song for you.  
THE MODERATOR: YouTube sensation later. Other questions?  
  
Q. Give us an idea how you've been able to seamlessly integrate yourself
into this team and play so well and not just in your first NCAA tournament,
how it's come so easily for you.  
WES JOHNSON: The whole year sitting out, being a spectator, seeing what the
team needed, knowing my role and just wanting to do -- not wanting to do too
much. Stepping in this year, the whole chemistry of the team helping me
translate to my play on the court, just working hard with Coach Murphy on and
off the court and coming in with these guys, they give me the ball at the
right time and I make plays. That helps.  
THE MODERATOR: Are we done now?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Yeah, I think so.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck, guys. With Syracuse Head Coach Jim Boeheim. Orange
goes into tomorrow's matchup 29-4. The first top seed since 1980, going back a
ways. Coach, we'll have you go ahead and open up with a statement and we'll
take questions.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, we're happy to advance. It's not the easiest thing to do in
this tournament. We're looking -- I've watched Gonzaga play so many times this
year. Coach Few is a real good friend of mine going back a few years now. He's
a tremendous basketball coach. We do one thing together, we fish. He just
kills me. He's an unbelievable fisherman. I'm trying to catch up to him. The
handicap world in fishing, I'm about a 22 and he's about a plus 4. So I got no
hope of catching him. He can go fishing out his back door.  
I have had tremendous respect for their program for a number of years. They
just have a major league program. They can play with anybody, and have been
for a number of years. This will be a real great test for us tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Open it up for questions for Coach Boeheim at
this time.  
  
Q. Jim, we heard you many times over the years talk about the job Jim
Calhoun did in Connecticut in bringing that program from basically Yankee
conference level. Does what Mark Few's done at Gonzaga rival or even top
that?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, he's had an unbelievable run. I think obviously it started
when he was an assistant with (Dan) Monson. Since he's taken over, it's just
-- he's managed to take it to an unbelievable level. I've been out there. They
have great support. They just have really built a tremendous program. Again,
he's as good a coach as there is.  
  
Q. Coach, I just want to get your impressions on how Triche and Jardine have
done handling their roles this year and how well they complement each other.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think they've given us everything we hope for in the beginning
of the year. That was the one question mark that I had looking at this year. I
knew we would be fine with the front line. I knew Andy would make the
transition back into the two spot without a problem.  
The one question that I had is how is Scoop and Brandon going to play. Scoop
played as a freshman, but not a lot. Then he was out a whole year. You never
know how that's going to work. Of course Brandon is a freshman playing a key
position. I think for the most part they've almost never been on the floor
this year. One averaged 21, one averaged 20 minutes a game. So they both
average about 8 points a game, 4 assists. That's tremendous production from
that really one spot. They've been really -- done everything we could have
asked for. That's why we won when the league played this well. One of the
reasons.  
  
Q. Going way back in your head coaching career, was there ever a time when
you sort of in your mind's eye thought, gee, I'll maybe move on to a different
level, or any thought about moving from Syracuse back then?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Is there any connection to anything else by that question or is
that just directed only at me?  
  
Q. You.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Okay. I'm from Syracuse. I'm from outside of Syracuse, about an
hour. Before I got to Syracuse, I've been near Syracuse for 17 years. I've
been at Syracuse for 48 years. I honestly have really never contemplated going
someplace else. I had one interview, and I wouldn't even leave Syracuse to do
it. I only did it because somebody just said we're coming in to see you. I
said, you know, that's fine. I don't want anybody to know about it. I'm not
going out of my house. If you want to come here, you can. That's the only time
I ever talked to anybody else. There was never a thought in my mind of
leaving. I just did it as a courtesy to people that wanted to come in. But
I've always felt that we have a good situation. I know the area. I know the
people. We've always -- I think the thing you have to have in a good
basketball program is fan support. We've always had that. We have parking for
1500 cars. And we get 30,000 people to come to a basketball game in the winter
time. There aren't many places that can do that.  
So I really never thought about leaving. I think when you get into a great
situation, I think you have to recognize it. I've never been a believer in the
grass is greener on the other side of the fence. I've seen too many cases --
sometimes it's worked for people. I've seen too many cases that somebody has
moved and it just hasn't been a good situation. Although there's other
examples of people that have moved and it's been a good situation. But I've
never felt that way. I really don't like change at all. And I think sometimes
you have to look at what you have and realize this is a pretty good thing. I
give that advice from time to time to people.  
  
Q. Have you always felt appreciated there?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I've never really analyzed that. My good friend Mickie Krzyzewski
thinks I should have left a long time ago.  
Mike doesn't say that. Mickie would. You know, I think that -- I really feel
that the people that support our program, the fans that come to our games,
that buy two tickets, they both work for a living, they've always supported
me. I think there's always the great group of educated lawyers and business
guys and doctors sometimes who are smart in what they do, and I don't want to
be negative right now, I'm in a good mood. I don't really pay much attention
to those people. I know they're there. They're in every program. They know as
much about basketball as I know about what they do, which is absolutely
nothing, and I'm willing to admit that. It's just like with you guys. I know
as much about writing as you know about basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Should we change subjects?  
JIM BOEHEIM: The older I get, the more I like saying that.  
  
Q. Can you educate me please on how you expect Gonzaga to attack the zone?  
JIM BOEHEIM: First of all, I don't have near enough time to educate you. I
don't have decades. You know, I never talk about what somebody is going to do
or what we're going to do. They're really a good team. We have to be very good
on both ends of the court. I'll say what I say every time somebody asks me a
question about what we're going to do. We have to play good defense, we have
to rebound, we have to take care of the basketball, we have to execute on
offense and we have to make some shots.  
  
Q. Coach, just talking to Andy inside the locker room, he sounds like a guy
who wasn't expecting his starting center to be playing tomorrow. Can you
update us on what you think?  
JIM BOEHEIM: He has not practiced. I never play somebody that hasn't
practiced.  
You've been with me years. You haven't gotten educated yet.  
  
Q. I haven't quit.  
JIM BOEHEIM: No.  
  
Q. I'm learning.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I'm hoping.  
  
Q. I'm dumb but I'm stubborn.  
JIM BOEHEIM: It's a good trait.  
  
Q. Jim, over the years, has the pool of talent in Canada gotten deeper,
because we're looking at the two teams that are playing tomorrow, there's half
a dozen Canadian kids.  
JIM BOEHEIM: It's gotten deeper all over the world. But it's deeper -- it's
definitely expanded in Canada. There's more coaching, there's more AAU.
There's more emphasis.  
When we first started going to Canada, the kids couldn't get a court to play
in, just hockey rinks. But basketball is getting better all over everywhere.
There's really good players in Canada now.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Boeheim?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I'm not ready to go yet.  
THE MODERATOR: We have lots of time.  
  
Q. This is a quick follow-up on what you talked about earlier. How long ago
was your interview or your sitdown?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Derrick Coleman was coming in as a freshman. It had to be '86.
Spring of '86. I had Derrick Coleman, Stevie Thompson coming in and Ronny
Seikaly and those guys sitting there, Sherman Douglas. There was no way in
hell I was going then. That would be like Roy Williams leaving Kansas with all
those guys coming back.  
  
Q. Jim, you're having to go from playing a game on Friday that ended at
nearly midnight to playing the very first game tomorrow. Would you have hoped
for a little bit better treatment as a one seed?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I don't know what the process is in this, so I'm not going to
really -- I was going to try to find out, so I don't want to be upset about
it. I don't see any reason why we would be playing at 12, unless it absolutely
had to be. It makes no sense.  
  
Q. Your zone is so tough for teams that know you to prepare for. Does it
make it extra difficult in NCAA tournament situations where a team has a day
to prepare for you?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I don't know. I think if you're good against a zone, you're good
against a zone. Our zone is a little better than some. I think if you know how
to play against zones, you can adjust to playing against our zone. I hope it's
a problem for people, but I think any good defense is a problem for people.
Any good defensive team that you come up against. I think it's a problem.  
We have a good defense and we hope it causes problems. Sometimes it does,
sometimes it doesn't.  
  
Q. We all talk about the zone, we write about it, you've talked about it.
How did you --  
JIM BOEHEIM: I don't talk about it much.  
  
Q. Who taught you the principles or the philosophies behind playing this and
really relying on it?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think anything a coach does is something you start out with,
work on it over the years and you adjust it and adjust the things you do and
change things. Sometimes you add something that's better. Some players adjust
better to it. It's like any defense that you coach. Some years you'll be a
little bit better on defense than other years. Some years you're better on
offense than other years. But it's always changing. It's never the same.
Basketball is never the same. It's always changing.  
  
Q. Do you think all the talk about this defense, it gets in the minds of
other players, just the aura of the zone.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Georgetown shot 71% against us in the second half. I guess it
didn't get in their minds. Anybody can get beat. Any defense can get beat. Any
offense can get stopped. Our defense is a good defense. Not a lot of people
play zone. So people don't see a lot of zone. So that helps it. When I started
out coaching in our league, there was about eight teams out of nine that
played some zone or quite a bit of zone. And today there's like no teams in
our league that hardly play any zone. So I think that's -- it is a weapon that
people don't see it.  
The fact that people talk about it, I don't know if that really matters that
much. I've never been a big one to rely on people talking about something.
That's why those guys get paid. They have to talk about something. They didn't
have the bubble teams to talk about half of them would be out of a job. That's
why I like expansion. I think if we could get those people, half of them, Joe
Lunardi would have to go back to being a press guy, whatever he does. I like
him too.  
All right, guys. We'll see you tomorrow.

THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon. Let's get a few questions for the Cal student-
athletes.  
  
Q. For Jerome and Patrick, talk about your impressions of Duke, this
particular team, what you've seen, and also just the idea of playing against
Duke.  
JEROME RANDLE: I think a lot of people are making a big deal out of just
playing them. They strap on their shoes just as well as we do. They're a
basketball team just as we are. You know, I know they're going to come out and
play hard, which they do every time they step on the court. We just have to
come out and try to match their intensity and just really do the things that
we do best to try to get a win.  
PATRICK CHRISTOPHER: Jerome said it pretty well. We're two teams coming out
here to compete, five guys on the floor for each team. Just coming out here,
play hard, play aggressive, do the things that we need to do. We got a chance
to watch film this morning and see the things that they do, check out their
personnel.  
  
Q. Jerome, what, if anything, do you remember about playing against Jon
Scheyer in the AAU in Chicago? Do you remember him at all?  
JEROME RANDLE: I do. He was a heart breaker. We had a young guy on our team
who I think was probably three seconds left and passed the ball directly to
Scheyer and he got an and-one to win the game. But I remember eighth grade he
used to whip my butt like every single time, like they would beat us by like
30 points every single time we played them. But that was eighth grade, and he
beat me again in AAU. He's a real nice competitor. He plays hard every time he
steps on the court, has great fan support from his family. That's what I
remember.  
  
Q. I just wonder if Jamal was giving you guys any insight into playing Coach
K or Duke at all.  
PATRICK CHRISTOPHER: I don't think that -- well, he hasn't really given us any
insight as far as their plays or anything. He obviously has some great stories
about Duke, and he's definitely also excited to be playing against them,
having gone there.  
  
Q. Almost everybody who grows up playing basketball has an opinion of Duke.
They love them, they hate them, whatever. When you guys were growing up, what
was your opinion of that school and its players?  
JEROME RANDLE: I loved them. They was great. They had a lot of great players
playing for them. Me and Sean Dockery is actually good friends, and just
watching him play for Coach K was great. So I never had anything against them
until now. (Laughter).  
PATRICK CHRISTOPHER: Same here. I grew up one of the young guys that respected
their program for being a successful program and building a great legacy, and
just like Jerome said, as well, now, having an opportunity to play against
them is an opportunity of a lifetime, I believe. So we're just going to take
it possession by possession and cherish every moment of it.  
  
Q. In conference play, over time you're used to seeing the same teams and
the same players over and over. Now you're playing Duke, only have a day and a
half, two days to prepare. What are the biggest challenges in preparing with
such short time?  
JEROME RANDLE: The challenge is you just have to go out there and really put
it all on the line. You know, they obviously have a decent scout of us as well
as we do of them, but I mean, they don't really know what we're really capable
of. The same as we don't really know what they're capable of until we both
step on the court.  
You know, so it's just going to be whoever goes out there and puts it all on
the line.  
PATRICK CHRISTOPHER: And for me I think that's what makes the NCAA tournament
so exciting, the preparation for it, the attention to detail, and the focus
that you have to bring to everything, watching the film and everything being
magnified so much more.  
You know, as well as Jerome said, once again, who wants it more, who comes out
and just leaves everything on the floor will be the team that will take it
away.  
  
Q. Jerome, you guys have already said Jamal is pretty excited about this
game, too. Does anyone have a fear, though, that he may be too excited
tomorrow, and will you try to say something to him and say don't go out of
your limits here?  
JEROME RANDLE: One thing we know about Jamal -- well, we have five seniors on
our team, so Jamal knows his limits. And Jamal is excited to be able to play
against them. We're definitely not worried. We don't have to go to Jamal and
tell him not to be too excited because we know he's going to be just mentally
prepared to try to go out and get a win come tomorrow. It's not even an issue.  
  
Q. Jerome, can you talk about the match-up against their style? I mean,
there are teams you could play like when you played Syracuse and they had a
couple of big guys inside so that was a difficult match-up. Is this a style
that you at least feel comfortable playing them?  
JEROME RANDLE: We're comfortable just playing basketball. It doesn't matter
about the height or whatever, style, because we're great players just like
they're great players. Like I said before, it's just going to be who puts it
on the line and who plays hard come tomorrow.  
  
Q. What does it mean for Cal -- what would a win over Duke mean for your
program? You guys are seniors obviously, but what would it mean for the
program?  
PATRICK CHRISTOPHER: You know, playing against a team that, I've already said
this before, already been established and already has a great legacy, being
seniors, being here for four years and trying to establish something for
ourselves and for the future of this program, I think, is what we're trying to
accomplish here, for the recruits coming up, for the underclassmen, and really
for ourselves at the end of the day. We're trying to go out as seniors the
best way we can. Eventually this has to come to an end, so ending on a high
note is, I think, the way we want to.  
JEROME RANDLE: He really answered it. I mean, I agree with him 100 percent,
with the things he said.  
  
Q. For either of you, this has really nothing to do with tomorrow's game,
but did you watch the St. Mary's game at all, and do you start thinking about
how weird that would be to see them in the regional final if such a thing
happened?  
JEROME RANDLE: One thing that I don't do, I never look past the game that we
have coming up. That's great that they won the game, but Duke is our focus
right now. We won't be able to get to that game if we don't win tomorrow's
game, so we just focus on Duke right now.  
  
Q. Describe what it was like last night once you guys left the arena and
went back. What was the feeling like among the team?  
PATRICK CHRISTOPHER: Well, I missed a lot of it because I was selected for a
drug test, so I was here until about 1:30 or maybe close to 2:00 because it
was so thorough, but I'm sure the team enjoyed the win. (Laughter)  
  
Q. And how did you enjoy it, Jerome?  
JEROME RANDLE: I enjoyed it. It was great. I mean, my senior year, just to be
able to win an NCAA game was great. Last year was a heart breaker, but coach
told us it was going to be hard to get a win, and it was tough just trying to
sustain a lead. It was really hard. They came back and kind of got me a little
nervous at the end, but we was able to hold the lead, and it was great.  
  
Q. After watching the tape of Duke this morning, do you feel better about
things? Do you feel a lot better kind of knowing what you can do and who
you'll be going up against?  
JEROME RANDLE: One thing about film, you see them do a lot of great things.
There's a lot of highlights, so you're seeing all the things that they do
great, which is good for us because we get to see it on tape. But you never
really know what players are capable of until you step on the court and guard
their first move or whatever. You know, so it is good that we got the feel of
just looking at them and seeing what they can do, but we'll never know until
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks a lot.  
Coach, good afternoon. If you could, coach, please give us a few opening
thoughts about tomorrow's ballgame and we'll take some questions.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, Duke is, in college basketball, Duke and Mike
Krzyzewski are probably as good as it gets. Mike is a good friend and a guy
that I really have a lot of respect for. His teams play very hard. They're
always well-coached. They're very skilled, and this year's team is no
exception.  
I'm looking at the scouting report, and I'm seeing 7'1", 6'10", 6'10", 6'10",
I'm thinking, my goodness. Of course they can't play them all at once, but
they've got a lot of depth size-wise. The Singler kid is just a fantastic
basketball player that does so many things for them.  
Scheyer, knew his dad and knew of him in high school. I think we tried to
recruit him a little bit way back when, and just a very, very sound player and
grown into a very good player.  
It's going to be a tough match-up. We put so much time into Louisville just in
terms of preparation, and it's interesting, you get to the biggest game of
your career potentially and you have an hour and a half really to get ready.  
But fortunately or unfortunately, the things that Duke does we've seen. We
know what they do, they just do it better than most people. It's a great
challenge for us without question. That's why they're a No. 1 seed. But I
think our guys are excited for it.  
  
Q. What kind of concerns do you have about your depth in this game? It was
only six guys really that got what you call significant minutes last night.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, we've played this way all year. We've never really
gone big minutes past about seven. Big minutes, we've played more players, but
we've never really gone big minutes past seven or eight. Of course it's a
concern. We're always at the mercy of foul trouble. If a key guy gets in foul
trouble, it changes things appreciably.  
But at this stage of the game, what I worry about has no bearing on what's
going to happen or what we need to do. We need to do the things that we do
well. We need to be smart.  
Last night I was worried about Jorge got one early, and he tends to get feisty
out there sometimes, and if he would have got a second, I probably would have
had to bring him out. But we're capable of going deeper. We just feel like our
best chance to win is with the players that we are playing with, and that's
why we're here. If I have to play five players 40 minutes and that gives us
the best chance to win, that's what we'll do.  
  
Q. Mike had said that he could not remember ever coaching against a team
that had as many guys who could shoot from as deep as your three and maybe
four. Is there anything unique in your experience about this Duke team, or is
it pretty much standard Krzyzewski?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, I've played against them twice. I would say it's
pretty standard Mike's teams. They really defend. They really play hard. They
share the ball. They know their roles. They don't get outside their roles very
often. They know who's supposed to shoot it. They know who's supposed to
rebound it. They've got some physicality inside. Zoubek is a monster that sets
screens, he goes to the boards and he fouls out. As long as they can play,
that's what they --  
So no, I think it's pretty standard. I mean, how many times have they been a
No. 1 seed in the tournament? How many times have they won the ACC and the ACC
tournament? He's just got a program that's almost second to none as far as --
and he does it the right way with good kids. I think it's pretty standard
Duke.  
  
Q. Conversely, is this a standard Mike Montgomery college team, and has your
time in the NBA changed things a little bit?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: No, I miss some of those NBA guys. Well, I shouldn't -- I
know what you're thinking. (Laughter)  
No, for me, I've always played big. Over the years that was kind of the
trademark that we developed, even going back to Montana. I had a bunch of good
big guys, and continuing on at Stanford, and this was just a team -- we had
some bigs, but we just, through injury and attrition, mostly injury, we lost
all our bigs. So we tried to adapt our style to the kids that we had, and it's
worked very well for us.  
But no, I've never shot so many jump shots. But it seems to me that what
you're supposed to do as a coach is give your kids the best opportunity, the
best chance that you can to win, and for us that's what this is. There are
times when you'd like to have an inside presence that you could go down to to
squeeze the defense in a little bit. But we just don't have that, so we play
on the perimeter a little bit more, and we've caused some people a lot of
problems with that. And if the ball is going down, as you saw last night
early, it can be a little bit startling. If you can do it for 40 minutes,
obviously that would be the perfect world. We knew we wouldn't going to be
able to shoot like we started last night.  
But no, this is a little bit different. We've gotten better defensively,
though, I will say that. I'm pleased with how much progress we've made
defensively in terms of fundamentals and the little things. You know, we're
not very big, but we haven't gotten dominated on the boards all that often.  
You've got to do what you can because the bottom line is to try to win games.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the Duke program. Every kids that grows up
playing basketball kind of has an opinion of Duke one way or the other. Talk a
little bit about what a significance of a victory would be over that team, and
talk about if you need to demystify Duke to your players or are they beyond
that?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: I don't know that our guys spend that much time -- pay that
much attention to Duke. Obviously Jamal Boykin will be geeked. He may ball
fake more than you've ever seen him. He's going to be fired up to play. I
think for him, he feels like this is a dream come true or fate or whatever,
because he's gone to school.  
I think for -- well, again, I go back a long way with this thing. I think for
the student-athlete in the country, the real kid that is at the top, Duke was
always the school we felt at Stanford that we had to compete with for that
kid. We knew that they were a player in that arena.  
But I don't know that other kids that don't have that specific desire
academically or have done that level work or so forth, which is 99 percent of
the kids, I don't know that they spend a lot of time worrying about that as
far as a school. They're looking at a lot of schools that provide basketball
opportunities for them, a vehicle for which to try to show what they can do.  
So I don't think they'll be that with us. I think the first time they climb
over our backs and knock us into the second row going after the offensive
boards, that's when we're going to find out what we need to do.  
  
Q. Regarding the style of play, and particularly their three-point defense,
what do you see there that you can sort of tell us about in terms of -- in
your hour and a half of study?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, Duke forces you to put it on the floor. They overplay
everything. I mean, for you guys in the Bay area, Stanford is a microcosm of
what they do, minus the extraordinary talent that Duke has. It's the same
principle. They try to force you to put it on the floor. I mean, I don't know
that their thought process is you have to put it on the floor, but if you're
playing against them, you end up having to put it on the floor because they're
not going to let you catch, they're not going to let you shoot an open shot.
So you have to provide help opportunities for your guys, and they will help if
you drive. They try to drive you into their bigs, and the bigs are going to
take no prisoners and try to have to make you make a play in traffic.  
The success that people have had over the years is by being able to do that.
Now, obviously in a day and a half or a day or an hour we'll have on the
floor, we're not going to be able to change everything that we do. Part of
what we do is a little bit of that anyway, as long as we're making good
decisions when we go on the floor.  
But they have a very specific way of playing, and anybody that knows Duke over
the years will tell you that you have to be able to put the ball on the floor.
You have to be able to drive them. If you can't do that, you're going to end
up in problems.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
MIKE ANDERSON: Joined by members of the Missouri Tigers. Missouri was 22-10
going into the matchup against West Virginia tomorrow. We are joined by
closest to me Keith Ramsey, next to him Zaire Taylor and J.T. Tiller at the
far end. Go ahead and take questions for these gentlemen at this time. We'll
start over here and come down front.  
  
Q. You all stumbled at the end of the regular season and yet you were
extremely confident Thursday coming into Friday's game that you would dominate
Clemson. It happened. Can you tell me what you saw in yourselves and
especially the guys next to you that gave you that much confidence?  
J.T. TILLER: We were just going out there -- what Coach preaches is that we
should have a short-term memory loss. You can't dwell on what happened in the
past. You have to look forward to the future and you have to play our games.
Zaire and Keith, they really stepped up as senior captains yesterday and just
led the way and let our guys start off really strong.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I was just there. They did all the work. Keith I mean he gave
you 20 and 10. When he gives that you that kind of effort, I mean I don't
think anything is going to beat us. I mean I knew coming into the game he was
going to give us that effort because he never came to me with so much
reassurance and just so much confidence going into a game. And I think when we
have that, Keith, then we are a completely different team. I'm pretty sure
we're going to have that the rest of the season.  
  
Q. That's what I was going to ask you. All three of you feel the same way
about Sunday?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Yeah, I feel real confident about Sunday. You can't win a game
if you're not. I mean I think the guys to the left of me -- left and right of
me, the guys in the locker room are all confident. The coaches are. And we're
ready to just get on the court and start practicing and get prepared.  
  
Q. Zaire, you grew up in the BIG EAST backyard. What do you make of the
comparison between which is the better conference, BIG EAST or Big 12 this
year?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: This year I would say -- I would have to say the Big 12. I say
this every year. I say this since I've been in the Big 12. The BIG EAST has a
lot of talented teams. Some elite teams. But at the same time they got about
30 to 40 teams in the conference. So you have got to measure -- so when you
figure the BIG EAST brings eight out of 20 into the tournament, and then the
Big 12 brings seven out of 12, so you're going -- we're going over 50%.
They're still around 30.  
THE MODERATOR: Numbers may vary depending on where you are.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I still take nothing away from the conference. The conference is
still a very strong conference. The Big 12, it's been proven. I think we're
great example, that any team can beat anybody. We lose to Nebraska, Iowa State
beats Kansas State while they're still in the hunt for first place. I mean
every game is a battle. That's who finished 11th and 12th in the conference.
When you get more to the bottom of the BIG EAST, I think they are still
competitive teams but I think the teams in the bottom of the Big 12 are
better.  
  
Q. One follow-up. Keith, I don't know that you can, but would you like to
top that and address the same question?  
KEITH RAMSEY: I really couldn't top this. Let Zaire have that one.  
  
Q. How important is it for the younger players like Mike Dixon and Bowers,
the role they're playing with the team this year, especially someone like
Dixon who came in as a freshman and how he's matured?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Well, I mean Mike -- just from the second he got out there, I
think he felt like he was at home. He made some big plays yesterday. He seemed
extremely comfortable. I think I need to talk to him a little bit more, had to
feel that comfortable out there. The way he was playing I think was amazing.  
  
Q. You guys have given great answers about the two conferences. The West
Virginia guys were in here earlier talking and the Syracuse guys were talking
about it last night. It would seem in this tournament you wouldn't think that
much about -- you would only think about, hey, my next opponent. Is that
rivalry between conferences the thought of outdoing another conference really
a motivation; is that something you actually can be able to bring into the
game tomorrow?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Personally, I don't think so. It's Missouri versus West
Virginia. That's where it stops. It has nothing to do with the conference. I
honestly don't think there's a rivalry. I think -- looking at the conferences,
I don't think that people really judge it as much. I think -- I know
personally I'm concerned about what we do. I mean if teams from the Big 12
win, hey, that's great. Whatever. But at the end of the day, we want to win. I
mean, I don't think we're going to be celebrating if Kansas or any other team
in the Big 12 wins the national championship. I don't think we're throwing a
party at Missouri's arena. But at the end of the day, we want to win. I'm sure
West Virginia wants to win. I don't think they're going to be the most excited
team in the world if Syracuse wins the national championship.  
But I don't think there's really a competition. Because I think a couple of
years ago you would have been saying the same thing about the ACC and the BIG
EAST. Right now I think we're the two best conferences in college basketball.
So there's a lot of talk about it.  
  
Q. For Zaire, when teams have been successful against your press and it
hasn't been very often, what have they done to beat it?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I mean, I don't know that's a question we really want to answer
right now, if I do know the answer. I think I'll just leave that question
alone. Honestly, I don't know the answer. But if I did, I wouldn't answer that
one.  
  
Q. If you were playing against your press, what would you do to try to be
successful against it?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I think that's the same question.  
  
Q. This is for J.T. Is there any sense of pride or motivation in trying --
don't disrespect last year's team because you guys did so well, but to build
on last year's accomplishments and show that you guys are just as good as you
were last year without those three guys?  
J.T. TILLER: Last year was a great team. But this year we want to put our mark
or our stamp in the history books for Missouri. So like every game, we want to
prove something new. We want to win more games than we did last year. But with
even five more wins we wouldn't do that. With this chance, with this
opportunity we do want to take it one game at a time and go past that Elite
Eight mark that we had last year and try to get even further.  
  
Q. Along the same lines, when did you get a sense that this team had it in
itself to at least reach this point?  
J.T. TILLER: I believe we had this type of team to make a run in the
tournament right after, you know, we ended the season last year. We have ten
returners from last year's experienced team. So I figured we could use that
experience to really go even further than we did last year.  
  
Q. For J.T. or Zaire, I'm wondering how much does the pressure help you
particularly in the postseason when you're facing teams that haven't
necessarily seen it before?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I think the pressure is good. I think sometimes you need
pressure. Pressure can bring the best out of people at times. I think only the
future will really tell how much the pressure is really going to affect us, if
it's going to be in a positive or negative way. But I feel pretty good about
it.  
I like the fact that there is pressure and knowing that any day could be the
last game. As you can see, I mean, from Keith's performance and J.T.'s
performance yesterday, they definitely rose to the occasion.  
  
Q. That's a good answer. I was referring to your pressure defense. How much
does it help when you are facing teams that haven't necessarily seen your
full-court pressure?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Oh, pressure busts pipes. Like pressure, that's the way we're
going to play. We're going to live or die by that. I mean, the pressure is
what -- that's what got us here. We can't stray away from what we know and
what got us to this point this far.  
We don't know any other way to play but to pressure.  
  
Q. J.T., what is -- West Virginia has a core of three really good players:
Da'Sean Butler, Devin Ebanks and Kevin Jones. What's your impression of them
and how much of them have you seen on tape from the BIG EAST tournament?  
J.T. TILLER: From the BIG EAST tournament, unfortunately, I got to see a
couple more games than I really wanted to seeing that we at our tournament we
got bumped really early. Those three are some really good players. They are
really talented. In the BIG EAST you really have to be really talented. Those
are some physical players that can shoot from the outside and take it inside.
So it's going to be pretty much a battle of wills tomorrow to see who can
overpower the other.  
  
Q. Zaire, can I ask you the same thing?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I would go as far as saying they have four good players if you
add Wellington Smith, then you add their two guards, I mean they have two
starting point guards. Like with Mazzulla and Bryant. I think they're both
talented. But at the end of the day, we're talented too.  
  
Q. How would West Virginia fare in the Big 12?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: That's neither here or there. I can't answer that question. I'm
sure they will be one of the better teams in the Big 12. I'm sure they would
be a real solid team in the Big 12. But at the end of the day, they're
talented and we're talented. It doesn't really matter who is more talented. It
matters who plays better that day, who executes and who lays more out on the
line and who plays with more heart. God willing, we'll be that team.  
  
Q. Keith, can you tell me what you expect of what you're going to face in
the paint with three guys that will bang, and can you compare it to any other
game you might have played in the Big 12?  
KEITH RAMSEY: Every game in the Big 12 for us. It's so physical. And I've seen
them play. They have a lot of strong guys on their team. I mean, me, Laurence
and Steve are going to be in for a challenge all night. We have to box out.
Because they crash the boards like Kansas and Kansas State. We faced both of
those teams twice.  
  
Q. For Zaire or J.T., either one of you. When you talked about bursting the
pipes of guys when you're putting that full court press on them, how much is
it about the mental aspect of it, making guys overthink their game, pass too
quickly, handle the ball poorly, and you just want to get in their heads with
that kind of style even before you take the court?  
THE MODERATOR: J.T., do you want to start?  
J.T. TILLER: I think the mental aspect of the game is very important.
Especially with the pressure game that we put on. If we can get you
psychologically and mentally out of doing what you want to do, then that
really plays into what we're trying to do to be successful in the game.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I mean, I think the press, I feel like it's supposed to wear
teams down. When you look at the way we've been playing, there's games where
we were -- we were down last game. And I think the wear and tear of the press
both physically, mentally and even emotionally, I mean in every possible way,
I feel like it will wear teams down. Teams start to get on each other, start
to yell at each other, or coaches get on you. There's just a lot -- the
pressure just -- when we say pressure busts the pipe, that's in every way.
Physically, I mean, you're breaking the press in the first ten minutes of the
game, come the last ten minutes you're starting to get a little more tired.
And I'm out of the game. Now you have Mike Dixon, a fresh body on you. When
he's tired, Miguel Paul is coming after you. It never stops. It seems like the
number of bodies never end. So I mean that's how we try to wear a team down. I
think it pays its toll physically, mentally and emotionally.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Good luck to you tomorrow. Head Coach
Mike Anderson joins us. After getting his team to the Elite Eight last year
has them in the second round here in Buffalo. Coach, good to see you again. Go
ahead and make an opening statement.  
MIKE ANDERSON: We're still here. Obviously we must have done some good things
yesterday.  
Tell you what, the game, Clemson and Missouri, a hard-fought game. We were
just fortunate to come out on the winning side of it. I think we got one of
those spurts. It was a game of runs. I think we had the run the longest and we
kept it the longest in the second half. We were able to keep off a Clemson
team that was charging there at the end.  
With that being said, it allowed us now to advance and to face against one of
the better teams in the country in West Virginia. A team that has been in the
top five, top -- all year long.  
Coach Bob Huggins does an outstanding job. They have a tremendous assembly of
talent when you talk about Da'Sean Butler, Ebanks, Smith. You can go on and on
about that basketball team. And one of the guys that's really playing well for
them is the Jones kid.  
With that being said, it's a long athletic team. We're not an overly-sized
team. We certainly are going to have to play this game and play lights out
from the standpoint of matching their size, their toughness and especially at
the rim. I think that's what they do well. They can shoot it and they can go
get it. It's going to be a game of will of tempos. But I think our guys are
looking forward to the challenge and the opportunity to continue to advance in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, what is a coach's concern when you have to compensate, change
rotation, that type of thing as late in the season as did you after you lose
player?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Well, I think that was obviously, when you look at what took
place in the last four games with our basketball team, last five games, it had
an effect, because now we have a lot of productivity. We had one of the best
benches in the country. When you have Bowers coming off the bench, you have
Marqus Denmon, you have two of your top scorers coming off the bench. Now
there's got to be an adjustment with Justin Safford going out. And Justin, he
was really starting to play some real good basketball. That was another guy of
size. I think the adjustments started. When that took place, we're going into
places like Kansas State who is one of the top five teams in the country. We
play a team, Iowa State, and we eked one by. Zaire makes a big shot.  
So you could just see the adjustment. That's why the score -- it goes the
opposite way. Our defense, I thought, was pretty decent, especially at Kansas
State. And then of course you play one of the best teams in the country in
Kansas at home. And of course we shot the ball well earlier and then it kind
of went away.  
I thought those adjustments -- those guys adjusting to roles, that's huge for
our basketball team. And so then we go to the Nebraska game. And I thought we
just didn't show up from an energy standpoint. So when you look at the last
few games, we lost I guess three out of the last four. What people don't
understand -- that's a big adjustment. I'm glad you kind of brought that up.  
Justin, he's one of the few veterans we have. We have 11 guys on our team that
are first or second year. The other two are -- J.T. Tiller, who started for
us, I think he was the only one. Isn't that right? J.T. Tiller. We have
Justin, and J.T. and Justin is out of the equation. Eleven guys are in the
first or second year. That's a big-time adjustment. But I'm proud of these
guys in terms of what has taken place.  
Now, Steve Moore has an opportunity to step up. He's given us some quality
minutes.  
  
Q. I was wondering, the pace you play at, how much does it help you
particularly in a tournament atmosphere where teams don't have much time to
prepare for it and they're not necessarily as familiar with it as maybe your
Big 12 opponents?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think that's been the secret as we got into tournament play.
I always talk about that first game being the most important one. Because you
don't know how your kids are going to come out. You just have to survive and
get past that one there. I think as you get more and more through the
tournament, I think your kids get more into a rhythm. Not only that, the turn-
around, the quick turn-around. And I think with the depth that we play with
and hopefully that will pay difficult tends as we continue to move. I don't
just play these guys when it's a game when we're blowing people out. I play
these guys when the game is on the line from the non-conference through the
conference. So it's times like this here that can draw back on those
experiences and continue to help our basketball team.  
  
Q. Even back to your time with Coach Richardson, whether it be a kid taking
a long time to tie his shoe or officials needing to beckon people out of time-
outs, what are some of the things specifically you've seen from other teams to
sort of kind of slow the game down?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think CBS is helping a little bit. They got them long time-
outs. They've got them long time-outs. Man!  
  
Q. Have you seen specific things like that whether it be guys purposely
untucking their shirts or their shoe laces? Do you feed off of that when you
see team tiring such as that or trying to do that purposely?  
MIKE ANDERSON: We've seen it where guys are grasping for their shorts.
Especially within that last ten minutes mark. I heard Zaire while I was coming
in, he talked about that last ten-minute mark that they think those ten
minutes are ours. Because of the depth and how many guys we play, they
actually believe that. And the game may go back and forth. But we feel like
the last ten minutes fatigue will become a factor. That's when our guys really
step it up.  
  
Q. Coach, along the same lines, Kevin Jones in the locker room had mentioned
that we've got to make this the slowest 40 minutes of basketball. How do you
respond to that? You have their respect, I guess.  
MIKE ANDERSON: Well, it's a game of wills. Wills and tempo, I guess. We'll see
what takes place. We can play a lot of different ways. The bottom line is you
want to find a way to win. And I always say we want to be unpredictable. And I
think when you watch our team play, you may see us in a bunch of different
defenses. But at the same time, we still want to -- the up-tempo. I think
that's what we thrive at. That's what we do, that's who we are. But I think
our defense, that's what I always talk about. Our defense is the key to what
takes place with our basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about it yesterday. Seeing Da'Sean over
the summer at the World University Games and Team U.S.A. Can you talk a little
more about what you saw in him then and after that can you elaborate on how
much he has grown since then?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Tell you what, I like his toughness I like his basketball IQ.
He's very versatile. He can post up, he can put it on the floor, he can shoot.
Makes tough shots. One thing about him, he loves to go to that glass. He loves
to go to that glass. I think he's playing off guard for them now. His ball
handling has gotten exceptionally better. And he's a leader. He's leading this
team. He's willing this team. When you look at what he did in the BIG EAST
tournament, that's phenomenal. Guys know you're going to get the ball. They
know what you're going to do. He just comes through. That's a big-time player
there. That tells me he's got a lot of heart.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple of minutes ago about one of your deep benches.
This is sort of another growth question. Michael Dixon, the role he's playing
in this team, he really came through yesterday and earlier games.  
MIKE ANDERSON: I tell you what, he's done a phenomenal job. He started off
real fast. I think non-conference he played really well. We got him to
conference play and I think the sense of urgency goes up many, many more
notches. I think he found that out.  
I think through the conference and through practice, having an opportunity to
go against J.T. Miller, Zaire Taylor, each and every day. I always tell him
they pop him around. He really is popped around in practice. On the floor. But
I think that is hopefully the proving ground to get him ready for situations
like this. But he's quick, he's got good basketball IQ. He's learning as he
goes. But he's a spark off the bench. He was certainly a spark last night --
yesterday.  
  
Q. Coach, there's been a lot of talk today about BIG EAST versus Big 12.
When you look at West Virginia, who would they be comparable to in the Big 12
that you've played in terms of either personnel or style?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think we probably played against every kind of style in our
league when you talk about guys that rebound the basketball, toughness at the
rim. Baylor's got some big guys that go to the board. Kansas State. They're a
team that is one of the top offensive rebounding teams in the country. They
are going to push the ball, throw it inside and try to go get it. They get to
the free-throw line. And because they get offensive rebounds, you end up
fouling them. So they attack the rim. So I guess -- Frank was with Bob, so I
guess if you want to say similarities, it would be that.  
But at the same time, I mean West Virginia is a totally different team. The
versatility that they have. They have a lot of guys that can handle the
basketball. They can make passes, they can score. And evidently they have a
tremendous leader in Da'Sean Butler.  
  
Q. Mike, along those same lines, if this team for you was in the BIG EAST,
how might they fare?  
MIKE ANDERSON: They would do well. I think they would do well. I think they
would do well. There's a uniqueness in terms of how we play. I think -- I
really think we would do well in the BIG EAST.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach Anderson? Tip-off the second game
tomorrow against West Virginia. Coach, best of luck.  
MIKE ANDERSON: Thank you.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Missouri - 86  
Clemson - 78

  
THE MODERATOR: From Clemson Tigers, we have on the far end Andre Young,
Demontez Stitt and closest to me Head Coach Oliver Purnell. Coach will make an
opening statement and then we'll take questions for the student athletes that
have joined us.  
OLIVER PURNELL: First of all, my hat goes off to Missouri. Congratulations on
winning a tough ballgame. I thought both teams played extremely hard.  
You know, I was quite frankly disappointed that we didn't get Trevor on the
line a little bit more because maybe we weren't aggressive enough in there.
But Missouri made their runs in the second half by knocking down some three-
point shots, some big shots. And our issues were some turnovers that you can't
defend, points off turnovers that you can't defend, and I thought we did a
really good job on the back boards, evidence that our guys played extremely
hard.  
I thought we got the ball where we wanted to get it, particularly in the
second half down in the paint. We just didn't finish like we needed to, as
Missouri heated up from the perimeter.  
Obviously, our guys in the locker room are pretty sad right now. I thought our
guys were prepared and ready to win here today. I thought they gave a great
effort, but Missouri obviously stood in our way, and we'll give them credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions at this time for
Demontez and Andre only.  
  
Q. Can you two guys talk about the three-point shooting in the first half,
and how it didn't really seem to open up inside like it often does?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Well, I mean, first half we seemed like we attacked it a
little bit more. We sort of got in the lane a little bit more and got the ball
to Book (Trevor Booker) more and he was able to kick it out for open shots. I
guess with our style of play, you know, you drive the ball, you kick it, hit
guys with open shots. Second half some shots didn't fall for us. Book got the
ball inside. We just didn't execute like we wanted to.  
THE MODERATOR: Andre, anything to add to that?  
ANDRE YOUNG: I think the main focus coming to the game was to slow down
Trevor. They doubled and triple-teamed him all night. And then I mean in the
beginning we had our legs and we were able to knock down shots. Coming into
the second half, some of the shots didn't go down. And they were still
doubling on Book. I mean they were pretty much making him earn everything. We
just knocked them down in the first half. We hit some in the second but not as
much.  
  
Q. Guys, just talk about their press and obviously they forced 20 turnovers
and get a lot of points off those turnovers, uncontested baskets. Is it
something you weren't expecting or did you not handle it well?  
ANDRE YOUNG: We were definitely expecting it. From watching film, that's just
the kind of team they are. They press 40 minutes. We were expecting it. We
just didn't do a very good job in the first half. I think like we had like 14
turnovers in the first half. And so we just weren't strong enough with the
ball. They converted those turnovers into points, easy points that we couldn't
defend. I think we did a little bit better job in the second half of
protecting the ball. But we just didn't make the big stops that we needed
towards the end.  
  
Q. You guys shot I think 72% from the three in the first half. That's not
really a sustainable number. Did you talk about what you're going to have to
do in the second half to mix it up offensively and find some different ways to
create points?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I mean, we knew we wanted to, you know, not depend on the two-
point shot. We were shooting it well the first half. We still wanted to get
the ball inside to Book. The reason why we were getting -- why we shot a high
percentage was because we got the ball inside. Book was doing a great job of
finding guys. Even though they were doubling and triple-teeming him all night,
he did a great job of finding guys for open shots and we were able to knock
shots down.  
Second half, I mean, like Andre said earlier, shots weren't falling. I think
as a team we had to find other ways to be more effective when our offensive
shots aren't falling.  
  
Q. For both guys, what were they doing to break your press? Seemed like you
guys I think had nine turnovers and two steals and they got a lot of easy
runout baskets and were able to do a lot on the fast break.  
ANDRE YOUNG: They just did a good job of kicking it in. They leaked out a lot.
A guy would contest a three-point shot and he would just keep going and they
would get the rebound and throw it over our defense. I mean, they really just
tried to spread us out also and try and get fast-break points. And easy points
off of that.  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Basically the same thing. They did a good job of getting the
ball in quick. I think there were certain points in the game where we weren't
alert. And they got some easy run-outs. I mean but I think for the most part
our turnovers in the first half led to a lot of lay-ups for them. Against a
team like Missouri who thrives on that, I think you have to cut that out.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Clemson?  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about how frustrated Trevor might have been there? Even
Keith from Missouri said that he thought he might have been fouling him and
they just -- he wasn't getting the calls. Was he frustrated out there?  
ANDRE YOUNG: I feel like he was frustrated. I think mostly all of us were. We
knew that he was getting fouled. This whole past week we've been talking about
different ways to deal with frustration, because that's been a big downfall
for us this year, cost us some games. That was our main focus. So I mean we
really can't use that as an excuse. We've been talking about it the whole past
week.  
We definitely felt like Book wasn't getting enough calls down there. They were
banging on him. But we had to play through it.  
  
Q. Were you guys loose out there? Missouri's Coach said he felt his guys
were having fun, played with that great intensity. Were you guys tight? Loose
enough? What was the mindset?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I believe we were loose enough. Like Andre said earlier, we
knew what to expect. We knew they were going to come out and there was going
to be a high intensity game. I mean some things didn't go our way. But the
frustration sort of crept in and we sort of let it get to us. The refs weren't
making calls. Guys got frustrated, including myself.  
I mean, like Andre said, we talked about it the whole week. We were expecting
it -- we were loose. I think during points in the game we were having more fun
than other points of the game. For the most part, I think we were loose and
playing hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Andre, Demontez, thanks for your time. We'll open up for
questions, questions for Coach Purnell at this time.  
  
Q. It was a four-point game there in the final minutes, and -- I'm sorry in
the final minute -- and they got the lay-up. Did you want a foul in that
situation or did you want to play straight up?  
OLIVER PURNELL: Yeah, we were going to give ourselves a half court to get a
steal and then we were going to foul right there. I think that Demontez was on
the kid and it just kind of separated and he came back to try to take the foul
but it was too late. He wanted to take a foul there.  
  
Q. Just about the first half, second half difference, for all the turnovers
and all that stuff that happened in the first half, you were still dead even
with them and you were shooting over 50%. Then you end up shooting, you know,
much less than that in the second half. What were you trying to do in the
second half and what didn't happen that you were looking to happen?  
OLIVER PURNELL: First of all, in the first half, I thought we played well
offensively. The turnovers kept us from having a lead. In fact, we had -- I
don't know -- eight, nine, maybe ten-point lead there at one time. And the
turnovers led to their run to get it even. We went back and forth going into
the half. I didn't really feel good at the half that we were tied, because we
shot the ball so well and we struggled a little bit of late offensively and
our guys really were knocking it out and Trevor was making great passes. So, I
thought we were exploiting them offensively. But the turnovers at the top that
you can't defend were the problem in the first half.  
In the second half, we just wanted to do more of the same offensively. And
what we wanted to do was take care of the basketball. And well, we took care
of the basketball much better. And we got the ball where we wanted, and we
just didn't -- we didn't finish inside.  
As I mentioned, I would have liked to have seen our bigs on the line a lot
more in the second half, because we were getting the ball where we wanted to
get it. I didn't -- and I didn't think they were coming as much and as
quickly, which has a tendency to happen as you get into the game.  
  
Q. Anderson said he felt his team was playing pretty loose and having fun
out there. He felt that was the difference along with intensity. What did you
think the mindset was for your guys?  
OLIVER PURNELL: I thought our guys were fine. I thought they were loose, I
thought that as they spoke, I felt they dealt with frustration in a positive
way. It's a game of runs. We turned it over a few times in the first half, but
they hung in there.  
Second half we didn't finish some inside, and I just thought they hung in
there. I would not say we didn't get frustrated. I wouldn't say they didn't.
But I thought we dealt with it well, to the point we were putting ourselves in
a position coming down the stretch we were right there.  
  
Q. Coach Anderson said that his guys, they tasted a lot of success in the
tournament last year and he felt that that is helping them. Is the tournament
all about matchups or is there something to teams that have had success
feeding off of that in future years?  
OLIVER PURNELL: Well, yes and no. You watch the games yesterday, yes and no.
I'm sure there's something, some teams having success in the tournament. And
then you turn around and look at some teams yesterday that win in upset manner
that either weren't in the tournament and didn't have success a year ago. You
can't kind of put it in a box like that.  
As I watched the tournament over the years, it's a great tournament because
you have upsets and you have all kinds of things happening. Sometimes matchups
make for an exciting game. I didn't watch the game on television that we just
played, but I would imagine it was probably a pretty exciting game, runs, here
and there, up and down, that kind of thing. So, it's just hard to say that
premise is true, because all you have to do is watch two or three day's of
games and they're all over the place.  
  
Q. Three straight losses in tournament games. Do you feel like there will be
a perception in your program you can't win in March? Do you feel there's a
mental block in your team when it comes to these first round games?  
OLIVER PURNELL: Yeah, I think there will probably be a perception among some
people. I certainly don't subscribe to that. Next year we'll have a different
team. This team was different from last year's team. And that's the approach I
think that we have to take. I thought our guys were determined to win today. I
thought they prepared well, they played hard. I wouldn't say we played
extremely well because we turned the ball over too much in the first half. We
kind of fixed that in the second half and we couldn't finish at the rim which
is where we want to get it. I wouldn't say we played extremely well, but we
competed, we were ready, they wanted it and it just didn't happen for us.
Hopefully we can get back next year. It's extremely difficult to get here out
of the ACC, and have a different outcome.  
  
Q. How many minutes did you want to play Young and Stitt together tonight?  
OLIVER PURNELL: How many minutes? I didn't have a set amount of minutes. I
knew I wanted to play them a bunch together because of the pressure and that
kind of thing. So I didn't have a set amount of minutes.  
Demontez, of course, got into foul trouble in the first half. Probably would
have liked to have played him a little more in the first half.  
  
Q. Did that take any aggressiveness out of Stitt when he picked up that
third at the end of the first half?  
OLIVER PURNELL: Yes, because he's over there with me. It has a tendency to
take it out of you. Again, once we had that run and had that lead, you would
like to have had him available and not in foul trouble more, obviously. But
you have to make those adjustments. You have to make those adjustments when
you get a guy in foul trouble.  
We were hoping to nurse him into the half with two and he picks up a third.
And then we had he and Potter with three going into the second half, which is
not ideal.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.  
OLIVER PURNELL: Hope to see you next year.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Gonzaga - 67  
Florida State - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Florida State Head Coach Leonard Hamilton and
Deividas Dulkys, Ryan Reid and Chris Singleton from my left to right. We'll
start with an opening statement by Coach Hamilton.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought that in the first half, Gonzaga showed a
tremendous amount of poise and a very high level of concentration when they
had open looks and had shots in the lane. I thought they really did a very
good job of finishing their plays. I thought we had equal, as good a looks,
especially in the inside and on the perimeter. But I thought we were a little
anxious and a little bit of our inexperience I thought showed.  
But I thought the second half that we calmed down, executed a lot better. The
looks that we had in the second half I thought we knocked them down, we
finished our plays inside. And we came up a little short there towards the
end. Had some clutch free-throws that we just couldn't finish off, and a
couple of easy baskets. But we fought back, and hopefully that will be
something for us to build on as we move into next season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for our student athletes
at this time from Florida State.  
  
Q. Deividas, when you made that bank shot, I think there was about a little
over two minutes left, what was going through your mind? You almost erased a
16-point deficit. At that point, did you know that the things were going the
way they were? What were you guys thinking?  
DEIVIDAS DULKYS: I really thought we had a chance. We hit a lot of tough shots
in the second half and we missed a lot of them -- a lot of open looks in the
first half. Some of them had to fall. I'll take it. I banked it in. I'll take
it.  
  
Q. Chris, would you talk about the difference in the first half and second
half, and how the first half they were pretty effective on the inside, second
half you guys shut that off and y'all were more active then.  
CHRIS SINGLETON: I think the first half their five man, he got good post
position. I think the guards were just feeding him. He was just turning around
and making tough shots. He would just finish and get "and ones." Something a
five man should do. Second half, we adjusted at halftime. And we came back out
and made sure he didn't -- wasn't as big a factor in the second half. And that
was a big part of our semi-comeback.  
  
Q. In the first half, it seemed like the way they approached the offense
kind of took you guys out of your comfort zone on defense. Maybe some fouls
you guys weren't used to seeing called in the ACC and maybe just some things
that kind of took you out of what you were used to. Did you notice that or
things just not going the right way? For any of you guys.  
RYAN REID: I think just it's in the game. Our coach always tells us that it's
going to be some calls -- all calls, we just can't listen to the refs. We have
to play through it. At the same time there was some tough calls. We were
questioning it. At the same time we had to play and keep fighting.  
  
Q. Chris, Coach Hamilton talked about using this as something to build on,
the way you guys played in the second half. Can you even make sense of that
right now, with the disappointment of the loss?  
CHRIS SINGLETON: You can tell just by the energy we had in the second half. We
played Florida State basketball in the second half. Our defense turned up.
They weren't getting as easy looks as they were. I mean, they had a couple of
prayer shots that they made in the course of the game that made them -- that
stopped our run a little bit. It was just that -- I mean, we're headed there.
We just missed out on this one.  
  
Q. Chris and Ryan, can you talk about the difference on the boards? They
really pounded inside and they did have that success. But they still, for the
game, outrebounded you guys, which I don't think happens a whole lot. And it
was obviously a very physical game. What were they doing to have that edge
there?  
RYAN REID: I think they're just going hard. Every time a shot goes up, a guard
would come in and try to rebound and get tips out. The big guy, if he couldn't
get it, he would try to tip it out to someone. They were just going hard for
the rebounds. And at the same time it was there too, everybody was battling
down there and they ended up winning the rebound battle.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks for your time. Great season. Questions for
Coach Hamilton we'll take at this time.  
  
Q. I know it's disappointing now, but you talked about building a foundation
and you talked about building. When you look back at this year, can you be
satisfied?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think every team at the start of the beginning of the year
you want to win a national title. Anything short of that you shouldn't be
satisfied, obviously. But we made a tremendous amount of progress.  
We lost three seniors and I'm not really sure -- many people thought we were
picked to finish seventh or eighth in the ACC. We finished third. I think we
are moving up. Last year we finished fourth. I think we picked the levels. I
do believe we're moving our program forward from where we started, but when I
speak of a foundation, Ryan is the only senior. We have a walk-on in A.J.  
We have basically the entire team returning with a pretty solid recruiting
class. I think a lot of the lessons we've learned this year, the guys will
pass on to incoming players. A lot of the shortcomings that we have had this
year have been obvious. So we still have a ways to go in terms of some areas
of skill development.  
But I think basically most coaches will tell you there's a big jump between
most kids from their sophomore and their junior years. And I feel that our
guys have made progress from last year to this year. Basically, we are a
freshman, sophomore team. I think the foundation has been laid the last couple
of years. And I think that they'll work hard and improve in their skills. And
I also think that the lessons they've gained from the last couple of years
they'll pass on to the incoming players. And I think that's the way you build
a solid program.  
  
Q. Would you tell why you thought you had so much trouble on the boards
first half, and then secondly, how you felt -- what got the offense going in
the second half?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: In the first half, they outrebounded us by six. Now, that
maybe in your eyes that was a dominating fact.  
  
Q. They talked about it a lot. They talked about how important it was.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought -- 7'4, 7 foot, 6-11, 6-8.  
They're a pretty good team. I thought you had to give them credit. They did a
pretty good job. I don't think they dominated us on the boards. We have 11
offensive rebounds. They had six. But I think in the first half I just didn't
feel -- I thought we were anxious. We had I don't know how many shots in the
lane point blank that we just came away where we just didn't finish the plays
off. I thought we had some open looks in the first half that just didn't fall.  
That would discourage you sometimes when you haven't been in this situation
enough. I thought that we could have -- we could have maybe been a little more
patient on the offensive end. But seems as though those shots were coming to
us were open, and we took them, and probably could have been a little more
patient and moved the ball, maybe made the extra pass like we did the second
half and probably wouldn't have dug such a hole for ourselves.  
I thought the second half we executed a lot better, we moved the ball, made
the extra pass, and we pretty much got the shots that we had hoped that we
were going to get in the first half. Maybe a little bit more high percentage-
type shots we got than the ones we took in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got such a good defense. That first half, did it surprise
you at all the way that Gonzaga was able to run their offense and hit their
shots and build such a big lead?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, I think that as I looked at the shots that they got,
they made some nice moves. They earned those shots. They moved the ball, they
make a couple of tough shots. I thought that they posted up a couple of times.
They had some very good retreat dribble-type shots. And I thought they made a
couple of -- some tough shots. I was disappointed that we had maybe better
shots than what they had. We didn't make ours.  
So had we shot anywhere close to being a decent percentage the first half,
maybe it would have given us a little more of an opportunity. But when you
look back at the open looks that we had that just didn't go down, for a young
inexperienced team, sometimes that saps your emotions a little bit. I thought
we adjusted mentally and emotionally at halftime. We just wanted to win the
four-minute segments. We won just about all the four-minute segments until the
last several minutes. And then when we faltered at the free-throw line. We
have not -- we've gone from leading the nation in free-throw shooting to
shooting 60% tonight.  
So I'm sure that we'll be a much better free-throw shooting team next year. I
think all the little things that, areas of our game that we've -- why were not
quite as efficient this year, I'm sure we'll work on during the spring and
become a lot better. I'm still positive. I must say that it was a little bit
of a concern that they had the open looks in the first half, they knocked it
down. They worked for their shots, and we came down and had a couple of early
looks that just didn't fall.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Hamilton?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think in the end you have to give them a lot of credit. I
thought they did a very good job with the game plan. Early in the first half,
I thought they pounded the ball inside. We got some guys in foul trouble.  
Xavier had a virus and we -- he just didn't -- he wasn't quite up to par. We
couldn't get him in. Ryan was not playing as well as he's capable of playing.
But I like the fact that our guys adjusted in the second half. And hopefully
that will be what we pick up next year and finish the rest of the season.  
  
Q. What's your perception of Gonzaga, the way the program has grown? If you
look at from the time you were an assistant to now --  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think somebody had the foresight and the vision years ago
to seize a unique and special opportunity. They challenged themselves by
playing a national schedule. A lot of "mid-major schools" that are non-BCS
schools, that's the cliche that we use, are not quite as ambitious. So
consequently, they were able to attract quality players who maybe were a
little bit under the radar with potential because all kids don't like going to
well-established programs. They found kids that found their program somewhat
appealing, the opportunity to go and build and be different, or make a
difference. And I thought they found enough of those youngsters that like
those types of scenarios. They were competitive and wanted to be a part of
making the difference.  
As the years evolved, those guys improved, they got two or three players that
were big-time players that attracted more players. And all of a sudden now you
have them being just as successful as a lot of the "PAC-10" or other schools
in that area. And they've carved a little niche for themselves where they're a
good academic school. Not a real large school. Where it's a little more
intimate, smaller classrooms, that appeal to certain youngsters. And now they
have -- they're one of the more elite programs in the country. You have to put
them with -- you speak of them in the same breath as you do the upper echelon
programs. They have a little cult following. People respect them. And I look
at their out of conference schedule this year, the likes of Michigan,
Illinois, Cincinnati, Wake Forest, Colorado State -- I'm sorry, Michigan
State, Duke. And they came out of that 7-3, in that little mini-conference.  
Well, they play -- they have their own conference to play, but their non-
conference schedule was tougher than a lot of teams playing in their
conference at the highest level. So you have to give them a lot of credit.  
To be very honest with you, I would like to see more schools take that
approach. It's exciting to watch. I think the kids are confident. And now I
told my players they are kind of like gunslingers. I've been watching some of
the old cowboy movies when the tough guy would come in town and stand on the
street and take on all comers. That's kind of what they've done. They have
gun, will travel. They are a team that has a tremendous amount of courage.
They will take their show on the road. A lot of BCS schools won't do that. So
I'm impressed with them. I told our players that, you know, we have moved --
we've elevated our status. And you can use programs like that as an example.
They have just worked hard, and they've gotten the most out of their talent,
and they ought to be commended for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Great stuff.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia  77  
Morgan State - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. Joining from us the victorious West
Virginia Mountaineers who improved to 28-6 on the season. To the far end there
Kevin Jones, next to him Devin Ebanks and Da'Sean Butler as well as head coach
Bob Huggins. Coach Huggins, let's start with our players. Let's take questions
for our student athletes. Please raise your hand and we'll get a microphone to
you.  
  
Q. For Devin and Kevin, did you have any visions in the early going of what
happened to Georgetown last night? And what did you two in particular do to
kind of take charge there?  
DEVIN EBANKS: I kind of thought about the Dayton game too from last year.  
Started off 10 points to our zero. Just trying to get it going with my
teammates. Let's go. Can't have another close game. We have to step on the --
during the game we stepped it up and broke it out to a big lead.  
KEVIN JONES: I thought the same way Devin do. Just thinking about last year's
NCAA tournament game. I definitely didn't want to end it off like that. I'm
just glad we got our minds right and at the end of the first half and going
into the whole second half, we just do what we needed to do to win.  
  
Q. Devin, can you talk a little about your defense on number 11? He really
never got a chance to get off in the game.  
DEVIN EBANKS: Holmes is a great player as far as his team and his coverages.
Watching tape with him the last three days, I really tried to study his moves
to the basket. Two dribbles in, step back, create open shot. I was trying to
eliminate his touches. When he got the ball just stay in his face and not let
him get a clean shot off.  
  
Q. Do you think your size and your height against him -- he's quick -- but
you were able to neutralize him?  
DEVIN EBANKS: I try to use my length. I'm taller and way longer than he is. I
try to keep my hand in his face and not let him get a clean look at the
basket. And if he did get a clean look, just keep it in his face so it'll be
difficult to make the shot.  
  
Q. Kevin, you got on a little run there where you scored about 8 or 10
points in a row. Were you calling for the basketball there? Was everybody
looking to go to you there?  
KEVIN JONES: I mean, yeah, I felt in the beginning I wasn't being aggressive
enough. I had to go and still play team basketball. But just be a little more
aggressive. I mean my shots was falling. I was just in one of those zones and
I'm glad that it worked out for my team that -- and it got us back into the
game.  
  
Q. Devin, Kevin, Da'Sean, did you all pay attention to what happened with
the BIG EAST teams yesterday and what a struggle it was for them or were you
so concerned about your own situation that you didn't really pay that much
attention to it?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: We're our own team. Granted we're in the same conference and
we wish our conference teams well. We're a different team from everybody else.
We do different things. At the end of the day we had to worry about ourselves.
But they had their games. Their games were all close as opposed to -- aside
from Villanova, everybody else was pretty much even teams. They were all even
compared to Villanova and Robert Morris. We came in and didn't want to leave
early. We wanted to take care of our business. So we did.  
  
Q. This is also for Da'Sean. How important was it, though, in that sense
that you didn't have your "oh, no" moment and the team rallied while you were
being double-teamed and really taken out of the game in the early going?   
DA'SEAN BUTLER: To answer that, I kind of give everybody else the same answer
when they say how does it feel to be on a team from this year compared to last
year. We had a good team last year. But everybody was so young. I kind of felt
that I had to do a lot more. This year we have a team. Everybody has matured.
The freshmen are now sophomores. And upperclassmen understand their roles and
things they can and can't do. It's a lot easier for me to go out there and
play and make that one more pass to Devin and Kevin and Wells and Truck and
Joe too. Everybody can score. Everybody knows what they can do. So it's a lot
-- it makes it easier on myself and not to worry about scoring.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for West Virginia student athletes?  
  
Q. Da'Sean and Devin, could you just in that vein you were talking Da'Sean,
can you talk about the progress that Kevin has made this year? You two guys
were all BIG EAST pre-season. Kevin's really picked it up. Can the two of you
talk about what he's done for the team this year and today too?  
DEVIN EBANKS: Kevin is the perfect example of student athlete. He works hard
on and off the court. He put a lot of time in the summer. Now it's paying off.
It paid off for him all season. That's why I think he has produced the way he
has. We need his strong play the rest of this year for us to make a deep run.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Same thing Devin says. Kevin has been the hardest worker on
the team consistently during the off season and during the season as well. So
it only goes with the territory as far as him being consistent during the
season. He's been our most consistent player all year-round. As far as
rebounding and scoring and just guarding his man and doing all the things --
all the little things that he does. And off the court, he's generally an
excellent person to be around. I'm just glad he's on our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks for your time. Congratulations. At this point
we'll open up for questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Coach, in a similar vein to you, what was your reaction to the slow
start? What did you tell them? Was there any mention at all of what has
happened to some of these other BIG EAST teams in this tournament?  
BOB HUGGINS: No, we didn't mention anything like that. We just -- we've done
this -- we didn't attack them. We were playing pitch and catch on the
perimeter. We started some games that way. I honestly thought we were ready to
play. We just didn't do a very good job of attacking their 2-3 early. I think
after the first media time-out, we did a much better job of doing what we're
good at doing.  
  
Q. Do you feel like rebounding was the key to getting it turned around?  
BOB HUGGINS: We didn't rebound it early. We have to rebound it for us to be
successful, we have to rebound it. But we -- you know, we have to throw it
where we're good at scoring it too. There's days when some of our guys shoot
the three pretty well. Then there's a lot of days they don't. We just try to
ham-and-egg it to the one that's making it that particular day. But the core
of what we have to do is put pressure on the rim. We didn't put any pressure
on the rim. And that was my -- my conversation with them had a lot more to do
with us putting pressure on the rim than it did anything else.  
  
Q. In that first media time-out, did the players realize what they were
doing wrong; is it something that you told them?  
BOB HUGGINS: Hopefully I helped them. I mean, they were fine. I think they
understood -- and then we changed some things what we were doing too.  
  
Q. Any thoughts on the slow start by the BIG EAST yesterday, and did you
warn your players about that?  
BOB HUGGINS: I didn't. I didn't say anything about it.  
  
Q. Any thoughts on why the BIG EAST was -- started off slow and got upset
yesterday?  
BOB HUGGINS: I didn't watch any of the games. I'm a bad one to ask about those
things, because I was watching tape last night.  
  
Q. Coach, I was talking to Devin, is that a common thing for you to have him
playing defensively, players like that, smaller and quicker? He really just
took him out of the game.  
BOB HUGGINS: He's played everybody. We put him on Scottie Reynolds for
instance. We've put him on a lot of small guys. And Dev has good feet. He's
got good feet but he has such great length. And I think the things that he was
talking about, Reggie's step-back move, the step-back move is a lot better
when you have somebody who's not 6'9", and as long as Dev is. He's done a
really good job on smaller guys for us.  
We usually but Da'Sean on the small forward and put Devin on whatever their
better perimeter guys guy is. Unless their small forward is really good then
we put Dev on them. He's accepted the challenge to go out and guard other
people's best players.  
  
Q. Bob, Casey came in two shots and he's been doing this a lot. What's
working with him and how is his knee?  
BOB HUGGINS: I didn't ask him. I don't know. I think it's all right. You know,
because Casey's knees bother him a little bit, I try to go with Pep (Dalton
Pepper) earlier. Pep didn't make any shots. We had to loosen it up a little
bit. Casey -- he missed the first couple but then he made a couple. I think
he's fine.  
  
Q. It's not just threes. He had a couple of steals tonight, assists. It's
not just a one-time thing now with him.  
BOB HUGGINS: He's smart enough to know he'd better play. I think he's figured
that part of it out. He better, when he gets in the game, he better play.  
  
Q. Bob, could you address what I had asked earlier of Devin and Da'Sean
about Kevin? From a coach's standpoint, his progress this year, what he's done
and what he's meant to all this?  
BOB HUGGINS: He had a great summer, I think, to start with. He was 215 pounds
when he came in. I don't know what he is right now, but I know at one point in
time he was between 245 and 250. He got knocked off the block before. He got
pushed under the basket. And he's a big, strong guy now. I think that's one
thing. And I think he's worked really hard at his skill level. He's worked at
his footwork. Kev is a great kid. He's going to give you everything he has.
Kevin is a guy who really enjoys being in the gym and really spends a lot of
time in the gym. I mean, he's -- I think he's like Da'Sean was earlier in his
career. Da'Sean still is. We have a day off, probably if you go in there at
some point in time of the day, you're going to see both of those guys in there
still working on their game.  
  
Q. As big as Devin's job was on Reggie, didn't you also feel like you had a
big advantage at the point? And did you maybe pressure them a little bit more
than you normally do or is that about what you do?  
BOB HUGGINS: No, we are what we are. We try to pressure all point guards.
Sometimes we don't do as good a job as we need to. We wanted to do that. We
want to try to take them out of what they want to run. If you let them run
what they want to run, they're very, very good. We try to take them out of it
a little bit.  
  
Q. Bob, when it was 10-0, did you sense any panic from your kids? Were you
proud of the way they kind of didn't deviate from their intended course?  
BOB HUGGINS: They've done it all year. We have not been -- we have not gotten
out of the gate very good the majority of games. For whatever reason, I'm not
sure what it is, but I thought -- I thought we -- I thought we were ready to
play. I didn't think it was a matter of us not being ready to play. I just
didn't think we attacked them very well.  
  
Q. Beyond the obvious of helping K.J. physically in the block, the way you
talked about, there was a perception maybe he sort of physically tailed off
the end the last season, postseason-wise. Do you feel like it helped him
sustain his effort through postseason play?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I'm sure being bigger and stronger and going through the
rigors of a season, I'm sure he's better at it. We're also playing a lot
better teams. We were -- we played the BIG EAST tournament. About then we
played a very good Dayton team who has -- all those teams we played had
bigger, stronger guys. So I'm not -- I'm not positive it was a matter of K.J.
just breaking down physically. I think he just got outmanned from a physical
standpoint. And then that hasn't happened at all this year. We've played
pretty good people. And he hasn't physically got outmanned ever.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Huggins?  
  
Q. It's been a little while since anybody really pressed you for more than
just token. Are you better at handling it now, and maybe is that why people
have stopped pressing you?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know why they've stopped pressing us, but we're ready to
handle it. I can tell that you. We've spent a lot of time on it since the
debacle in Cleveland, for a lot of reasons. Because I think there's going to
be a lot of situations where we're headed at the end of the game where we're
going to have to take care of the ball.  
I don't know why anybody -- I think it helps us, to be honest with you, it
opens the floor. It gives us a better chance to score. We can score with the
floor open. I mean, I think that's when Da'Sean has big games. I think that
plays well into Devin's hands. Mazzulla's hands. And so I hope people do
extend their defense a little bit and spread it out a little bit. Basically,
what we've done is played against people who have stood five guys in a line.  
  
Q. Certainly, it's not going to hurt that you were able to rest some guys
today.  
BOB HUGGINS: Hopefully not. That's the first time in a long time we've been
able to rest anybody.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks so much for your time.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia  77  
Morgan State - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Morgan State is Head Coach Todd Bozeman, as
well as next to him Reggie Holmes and on the far side, Troy Smith, who will go
ahead and open up with a statement from Coach Bozeman and then questions for
our student athletes.  
TODD BOZEMAN: Those damn 40-minute games. If we had it at 12, we would have
won the game.  
Obviously, you have to tip your hat to West Virginia. We knew coming in it was
going to be a tough, it was going to be a hell of a challenge. They were, as I
said before the game, I thought they were a number one seed. And they turned
it up and played like it. So we got off to a good start. That doesn't always
bode well for teams.  
I thought the guys -- I'm just proud of them. It was a hell of a year. And
really I'm sad to see these two guys leave. These seniors. Reggie has been
here since the first practice at Morgan. So I got emotional at the end because
it's like watching one of your kids go away to school or leave the house.  
Hats off to West Virginia. And they have had a hell of a year. I know it's
going to keep going. They possibly can go to the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. I'll we'll take questions for Reggie and Troy.  
  
Q. Reggie, talk a little about going against Ebanks and the fact that he had
that reach and extension and everything. And then secondly, I would like to
know what Todd said to you, if you would, when you came off the floor for the
last time.  
REGGIE HOLMES: He's a great defender. The shots just weren't falling today.
When I came off the court, it was very emotional. That's my last game as a
college basketball player.  
  
Q. Did Todd say anything in particular meaningful to you at that point?  
REGGIE HOLMES: Great career. We've been here since Morgan. The last four
years, since the start.  
TODD BOZEMAN: You ain't going to tell him I told you I love you?  
REGGIE HOLMES: He love me.  
  
Q. Reggie you play guard. Ebanks is 6'9 ". Have you been defended by a guy
that tall; is that an unusual matchup?  
REGGIE HOLMES: DeWayne Jackson he's 6'8".  
We go at it at practice every day. Wasn't no difference.  
  
Q. This is for both players. What do you take away from a season like this?
It's hard right after the game, but what do you take away from a season like
this?  
REGGIE HOLMES: Like I said, we were grinders. We ain't never quit. Even though
we lost, we still ain't quit today.  
TROY SMITH: The same. Preparation is the whole key. I take away you have to be
prepared for every situation. Every situation could be different in life.
Basketball, life, they're the same basically. You go through the same things.
So I'm going to take this as a learning experience.  
  
Q. Troy, talk about the offense and what happened with the offense. Did you
reach a point where the offense was just not effective because of the way they
were playing, or did you get to that point because you guys became
frustrated?  
TROY SMITH: We wasn't frustrated. We had a hard time getting to our offense
the way we wanted to, getting the ball inside like we wanted to.  
To be honest, they just played a good game. They played a good game, and we
ain't played too well. The ball wasn't going in as much as it usually goes in
for us. Didn't get as many open looks as we usually get. Hats off to West
Virginia for what they done.  
  
Q. Was that size? Was it a difference of size? You don't face teams like
that in the MEAC?  
TROY SMITH: Size has something to do with -- I wouldn't say size. We just
wasn't hitting our shots, you know?  
  
Q. Reggie, you talked about being grinders. How much does everything that's
happened this year contribute to that mentality?  
REGGIE HOLMES: I mean, we've been through a lot. A lot of adversity from our
children to our teammates, we've been through a lot. Like to never quit.
That's all I tell our players in the huddle before we go out and play, never
quit. No matter who they are.  
  
Q. Reggie and Troy, what was going so well those first eight minutes when
you guys were up so big, West Virginia couldn't hit a shot? And also, did
things change after Kevin got his second foul? How much did it change?  
REGGIE HOLMES: I think we had a lot of energy, a lot of energy. And our shots
were falling. But Kevin, he's a great rebounder, no one person is going to
block him out. Two people were trying to block him out. We were getting the
rebounds. I guess the energy went down. We started missing shots. That's how
the game changed.  
TROY SMITH: I think Reggie hit it on the nose. Kevin in the game, you have to
box him out. It's going to take more than one person. Guys like us, we off-
side rebound. So when he went out the game, they knew they had a rebounding
advantage over us and they took advantage of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student athletes from Morgan State?  
  
Q. Both players, sum up your career at Morgan, how you feel about it and how
you feel about a legacy, if you feel you have left one.  
REGGIE HOLMES: I mean, I feel great about my career. Right now I'm not
thinking about it. I'm still mad about the loss. But I feel great to have two
championships -- two conference championships and three regular season
championships since I've been here from day one. To say it and do it is a lot
right now. Right now I'm still feeling the effects from that loss.  
TROY SMITH: Yeah, I don't like to lose. That's one thing. I don't like to do
-- I've been winning for a long time. When we first came in last year from
junior college, coach said we're going to win and go to the tournament this
year and do some good things.  
Like Reggie said, we put the work in and we done it. We didn't win the game
that we wanted to win, but I think we prepared ourselves to keep playing
basketball in the near future.  
  
Q. You guys did a pretty good job. Certainly Da'Sean Butler didn't do a
whole lot in the first half. The other guys obviously in West Virginia did
hurt. How much did Ebanks and Jones hurt you, and how were they able to do
it?  
REGGIE HOLMES: I think -- what's his name -- Jones, in the middle of our zone,
he killed us in the middle of the zone. That's what I was saying. Ebanks, he
was getting a lot of rebounds that first half. That really kept them in it.  
TROY SMITH: Reggie said it. He had 13 rebounds. Ebanks and Jones. That's the
shot. You get it, pivot, don't travel and going to knock it down if you don't
have a hot hand. Like I said, we give credit to them. They played really,
really good game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Great careers. Appreciate your time. We'll open it
up to further questions for Coach Bozeman at this time.  
  
Q. Talk about the foul trouble of both Kevin and Reggie, how much that
affected you and the fact you sat them down and you had to sit them down the
end of the half.  
TODD BOZEMAN: I'm answering that question but I'm not taking anything away
from West Virginia because they're a good basketball team. But our margin for
error is very slim when we have those two off the court.  
Reggie is a top scorer in the country and Kevin is a top rebounder. I was
trying to get out of the half without them stretching it to double figures
without those guys on the floor. We have depth, but we don't have BIG EAST
depth on the other side. So it's a little bit different. They went to subs,
and they were able to adjust some things. We don't have that kind of depth. We
have depth, but not that kind of depth where you can continue to play at a
high level. So the level of play kind of goes down a little bit.  
And we struggled a little bit at the point guard. Their length is significant.
Early on we were being aggressive in the zone, kind of slowed them up a little
bit. But that was our best opportunity, was the zone. We couldn't guard them
man to man, not without size. When you go to the bench you don't have the same
kind of experience. I was going to say, that did affect us. I'm not going to
say that's the only reason why we lost the game. I was trying not to let them
stretch it out like that. But we've had -- if we have a deficiency, it
probably is with our point guard play. But with that said, we won 27 games
with the back court.  
  
Q. What about Rodney? You used Rodney with Ameer out. You used Rodney in the
middle. Was the size in there a part of the reason that you were able to get
the early lead and maybe confuse them a little bit?  
TODD BOZEMAN: I don't think it confused them. You have to try to attack people
where you think you have the best opportunity. The best opportunity was in the
zone, because they shoot 33% from the three. So it was playing in our favor
early on. It was just a matter of us scoring on the other end. We missed free-
throws, we missed four free-throws. It was front end of one and one. You are
talking about we have an opportunity to score. And you have to score. You
can't -- you can't go down and come up empty-handed. So that will affect you
against a team like that. And so I mean, even though we were up like that, it
was a matter of time before they made a run.  
Most teams it happens to, when we watch the tape of Villanova game, they were
down like that. We're not Villanova, but still they were down like that, and
they came back.  
  
Q. Todd, was there a point there when you were so effective early that you
allowed yourself to think this could be another Georgetown-Ohio?  
TODD BOZEMAN: I thought that coming into the game. So that's not -- during the
game you don't really get caught up in that. You know it's a long game. Like I
said in the beginning, damn games are too long. 40 minutes is too long. Should
run it at 12 and then end it the first time-out. I mean, it didn't -- I wasn't
thinking that far in advance, because if you coach long enough, you know that
you start out on a run and often times the other team is going to make a run.
If you can extend that like Ohio did against Georgetown, they created a
cushion. But if you can't create that cushion, you are going to have a problem
because they're going to make a run. It's just a matter of time.  
Those guys have a lot of length. They did a good job -- we did a good job on
Butler. Kevin Jones, he got loose in the middle there and then Ebanks, they're
really, really good players. We played against that kind of length when we
played Baylor. Baylor has the same kind of length. They have a three man at
6'11".  
We've seen that before. That's why Reggie wasn't necessarily that surprised by
it. They do a good job. They really take you out of your offense. They put
extreme pressure on you. And they force your offense out further than where
you want it to be. So normally we can play. Normally we can play with that. We
didn't do a good job today.  
  
Q. Because it was a 2-15 game, did you guys watch and talk about the Robert
Morris game, either you and your kids? When it was 10-0 and you came into the
huddle or the first media and you came into the huddle, what did you say?  
TODD BOZEMAN: I watched the game because I just watch basketball like that.
But we didn't talk about it. We didn't talk about it with the team. And then
in terms of the first time out, we were up 10-0, to be honest with you, I
didn't even look up at the score. I knew -- I had a feeling what it was. I
said, forget the score. That has nothing to do with this. You guys have to
keep playing. You have to keep playing hard. You have to keep talking and
rebounding. Because I mean I knew it was a matter of time before they would
get comfortable with it. And I knew I was going to have to go to the bench.  
Like I said, we have depth, we don't have that kind of depth to keep up a
level of a rebounder of Kevin Thompson and the scoring of Reggie Holmes.  
  
Q. I know the game is over now and there's nothing you can do about it. But
can you take something out of the fact that you really kind of shut Da'Sean
down and really made West Virginia have to make adjustments and find other
people to beat you?  
TODD BOZEMAN: No. That category there, I don't get anything out of that
category. We didn't get any trophies or recognition for it. All they're going
to say on SportsCenter is we got drubbed. Ain't not going to say shut Da'Sean
Butler down. No. That's a team. It's a team sport. So you would hope that if
one guy doesn't have a good game, somebody else will step up. We have had that
during the course of the year. So you would think that -- they're not a --
they're a top ten ballclub. They're not doing that just because of him. But we
knew that coming in. It's not like he's Blake Griffin. He's a great player but
not Blake Griffin. Blake Griffin, he carried the whole show. So hopefully I
answered your question.  
  
Q. You keep referring to depth and there's BIG EAST depth. Last year
Oklahoma, this year West Virginia. As a coach, you're a competitor, you want
to win, is there a point you get frustrated sometimes where there comes a
point in the game where, you know, you have to go to your bench and you
realize it's just another level. Does it get frustrating or do you as a coach
just kind of make peace with where you're at?  
TODD BOZEMAN: I told the staff, I said, fellows, it is what it is. That's what
we got. It's not like we -- we can't make a trade. It's not like we're going
to go and somebody else is going to come in the door. I said, it is what it
is. You have to keep things in perspective.  
We are at mid-major -- I know that others might consider us low major. We
might have been low major when we first got here, but we're mid-major. We
compete like that. That's a different kind of depth with guys with that kind
of physicality coming off the bench. And so, and our guys don't have the same
kind of experience. So against the mid-majors or some of the high majors you
can't compete like that. But they just continue to bring guys in that play at
that level, it does affect you. I wasn't frustrated, because I know the
reality of it. And I've been on that side of the ball. So I know what it's
like to have that kind of depth and have guys -- for all intents and purposes,
we had five or six pros that played together at Cal. I know what it's like to
have that kind of depth. But you just can't sustain it if your top players
come off the floor. That's the way it is. But that doesn't mean that we're not
going to recruit to try to get that now. I'm trying to get that. I'm trying to
get it at this level as much as I can.  
The weight room comes into play. It played dividends for us this year from
last year, when Kevin went up against Blake Griffin. He came back with a whole
different mentality. Now DeWayne Jackson has that taste. Joe Davis has that
taste, Sean Thomas now has that experience with it. Rodney Stokes has more
experience. We want to build on that.  
  
Q. It's easy for us to look at your season and just say the word adversity.
How would you describe it? It's easy for us to sort of say there was tons of
adversity for you guys. How would you describe the year?  
TODD BOZEMAN: Well, I mean, it was adversity. But my thing is I try to tell
the guys, I try to impress upon them that sports and life mirror each other.
So I hope they can draw from the fact that the things we did, we went back to
basics, we stayed fundamental. They're going to face those kind of things in
life. If they draw from that, that's what this whole experience should be
about. For them to know -- although it's sports and some people might
disregard it, it really is life. You're going to have tough times. You're
going to have situations. I told them in one of the huddles, Kevin got really
frustrated. I said, listen, man, you have to think big picture. Do not act up
out on that floor. I said you're going to win some, you're going to lose some.
Somebody gets the best of, you have to keep playing hard and be -- that's just
how it goes.  
I'm not going to tell you to be a good loser, but you still have to handle
yourself with class. I tell them there's consequences for your actions.
Obviously I lived through that. That's my job to impress that upon them. But
to take from it, it's a microcosm of life. Hopefully they'll get that.  
  
Q. You can see the frustration on your bench. Is that just how you've
learned -- how would you describe the team's personality usually?  
TODD BOZEMAN: I mean, like I said, that's a part of life. They were
frustrated, but they're kids. They're not necessarily sure how to handle that
and where to direct that energy. And they've had a great season. As I told
them in the locker room, there's only one team that's going to have that
feeling. Only one. It was a great season. It's just that their's came earlier.
Fellows, you have to build upon this. This is how it goes. You guys know, they
know, I won't talk about it here that we didn't do or we didn't follow
directions. Hopefully they'll learn from that and they will say, you know
what, last year this happened. Boze told us to do this and we have to make
sure we correct it. Hopefully it will be a total learning experience. But I
told them don't hang their heads. They beat you. That's how it goes. You can't
stop living because they beat you. They beat you. Now you have to come back
and get better.  
But it helped us this year through tough games in situations like that.  
  
Q. How much did Ebanks send Reggie into this game into a spiral, as opposed
to -- Reggie hasn't shot the ball well in March really. Didn't shoot it well
in the MEAC. He struggled with his shot lately. How much of that was Ebanks
and how much was Reggie maybe not forcing things too?  
TODD BOZEMAN: Well, you say, sent him into a downward spiral.  
  
Q. 4 for 17.  
TODD BOZEMAN: Yeah, but if that's sending him into a downward spiral; he just
didn't shoot the ball well for this game. He hasn't shot it great for -- as
you say, March. But we've won. And that's the maturity of him not forcing
shots as freshman/sophomore he would force shots. I was proud of him, he
didn't force shots. He didn't make himself look bad. He still was a basketball
player. The length, it's hard to get your shot off sometimes against a guy
that's 6'9".  
You have guys -- I'm good friends with Dell Curry. He talked about that when
he went into the league where he had to get his release quicker so he could
get his shot off. That's why Stephen ended up having a quick release because
he taught him that. Reggie is going to have to learn how to deal with that
kind of length on a consistent basis. He has it with DeWayne. But DeWayne
doesn't have the body that Ebanks has. DeWayne doesn't have the experience
that Ebanks has. And he doesn't have the teammates that's pushing you to that
has the same kind of length and denying you so you can't pass the ball to a
guy. But he'll adjust to that.  
That's nothing different than when you first get in the NBA you have a
7-footer like Patrick Ewing and David Robinson running it and now you have to
now make your shot quicker. It's just a part of the game. It's not a knock on
Reggie. It's just -- that's just how it goes with the length. Everybody talks
about West Virginia's length. It is what it is. I heard Huggs say he put him
on Scottie Reynolds. If he can guard Scottie Reynolds, he's an All-American.
BIG EAST player of the year.  
It is what it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks. Great season.  
TODD BOZEMAN: Thank you very much.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Gonzaga - 67  
Florida State - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by athletes and Head Coach Mark Few from Gonzaga who
advances on and improves to 27-6. Matt Bouldin, Steven Gray and Robert Sacre
have joined us. We'll have the same format as earlier, opening statement by
Coach. Coach, if you want to make your opening statement, we'll go from there.  
MARK FEW: Any time you can dig out an NCAA tournament win, it's a great thing.
For us to come all the way across the country here, play the number one
defensive team in the country and be able to execute the way we did and put
ourselves in position to win a game like that, I'm extremely proud of these
guys. We knew it was going to be hard-fought. We knew it was going to be
physical with their length and athleticism and just how tough they were on the
glass. But I thought our mindset was great from the start.  
We ended up out-rebounding them and had a big edge on the glass at halftime. I
think when we're in that frame of mind, that's probably when we're at our
best. So it was a great job by these guys keeping their poise down the stretch
because we knew they would make a run, and they did. And they made some tough
shots and they deserve a lot of credit for that. They showed a lot of heart.  
I thought Florida State did hang with it, hang with it and they pushed us all
the way to the very end. But these guys did a great job of keeping their
poise.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Take questions just for Matt, Steven and
Robert at this time.  
  
Q. Steven, can you express your anguish about the time that Dulkys banked
the three in and they were making a run at you?  
STEVEN GRAY: It's just one of those things. When a shooter like that gets it
going, you know, they always say he can throw it up from anywhere and it seems
to go in. It was just one of those -- this really can't -- he's not going to
bank that three. Now try to make the next one tougher on him and just try and
do anything you can to get through screens and contest the shots.  
  
Q. Again, did you feel like -- what were you trying to do to get a clamp on
Dulkys at that point? What were you trying to do to cut him off?  
STEVEN GRAY: Just stay on his hip. You know, when he catches it, make sure I'm
there on the catch with the hand up. Just make it tough for him.  
  
Q. Rob, could you talk about how tough it was inside tonight?  
ROBERT SACRE: It was very physical. But Coach has been emphasizing in practice
that it was going to be a physical game. So going in, you just knew you were
going to hit bodies. We knew coming to Buffalo it's going to be a Buffalo
Sabres game, basically.  
THE MODERATOR: Good reference.  
  
Q. For Matt and Robert, you guys as a program go anywhere any time to play
anyone. When a game like this is over, do you have a second to realize how
much that experience helps on a day like this?  
ROBERT SACRE: You need to talk.  
MATT BOULDIN: You know, it obviously helps us a lot. We play on in so many big
games like that all across the country that they're essentially NCAA
tournament games, really. But after the game I'm not really thinking about all
those other games we had. I'm just really happy about that victory, really.  
ROBERT SACRE: Like I was just thinking about the Illinois game when we were in
there like how they came back on us and it was one of those things where we
knew we could pull it out. I have confidence in all these guys and they have
confidence in me. So we just knew -- it's not new to us basically.  
  
Q. You guys shot 50%, seemed to get pretty good looks most of the night. Can
you talk about the keys to that and maybe the balance of inside and outside
production?  
MATT BOULDIN: I think that was a huge part of it. I thought our bigs,
especially Rob, really attacked them down low. Got to the foul line a ton. And
Elias was really active down there. He was stepping on the short corner and
knocked counsel some threes, getting second-chance points. I think anytime you
get easy buckets or get points in the paint, you're going to shoot a high
percentage. And from the outside, I thought we shot it pretty well. We got
decent looks. But I thought all the points in the paint were huge and a big
reason why we shot such a high percentage.  
  
Q. For all the players, you got a good seed in the tournament but it's going
to put you against potentially the top seed, Syracuse in the west region. But
you're going to be playing against a very pro-Syracuse crowd here possibly on
Sunday. How do you feel about that? How tough will that be?  
ROBERT SACRE: Well, like we focused one thing at a time, one game at a time
basically. Florida State we pretended this was our championship game. Then
we're going to go in basically against Syracuse viewing it as our championship
game. One game at a time that's how we view it. I feel that's going to help us
in the long run.  
MATT BOULDIN: I kind of look back to what Rob said. We've been there before. I
think of that Illinois game, that Michigan State game, that Memphis game. This
won't be any different. We watched them all year and we look at it as an
unbelievable opportunity to come out and play them and hopefully play our
best.  
  
Q. Steve, talk about that shot you made with the shot clock winding down.
One of your memorable shots, maybe?  
STEVEN GRAY: Maybe. (Laughter) I don't really know. I don't really quite,
looking back, you -- you don't understand the magnitude of something until you
can look at it down the road. It was just one of those things, end of the shot
clock, ball hits your hands and you just got to get it up on the rim. I
thought it was a decent enough look with that much time on the clock. I just
hoisted it up. So...  
  
Q. Robert, from a distance it looked like you got a kick out of the Canadian
National Anthem being played; is that the case?  
ROBERT SACRE: We don't play it enough at Gonzaga. So I thought might as well
take it in. We're close to the border. It was really appreciative. I was
enjoying it a lot, actually.  
  
Q. Steven, can you tell us what maybe they were doing differently in the
second half? You had that big 18-point lead late in the first half and then
they dwindled it down below six. Were they doing anything differently
defensively? Were you doing anything differently offensively?  
STEVEN GRAY: I think kind of had a little drought on defense where gave them
easy baskets. A lot of dumpdowns, dunks, dribble penetration were given up
quite a bit. And then later in the game they just started knocking down
jumpshots, knocking down threes.  
I think it was a combination of things. We got a little panicked, rushed,
forced some passes in we probably shouldn't have thrown. I think it was a
combination of giving them easy baskets on one end and turning it over on the
other.  
  
Q. What did you make of your matchup with -- we were talking the other day
about playing more physically considered. He's a pretty physical guy for
anyone, I suppose.  
ROBERT SACRE: Coach Few scheduled some big guys against me. I felt it was just
another big game. Another big guy. So I'm kind of used to it now. You just
have to hit some bodies and throw my body around. We're in March now. So you
just have to give it your all.  
  
Q. Robert, who was your favorite NHL team and how can you describe Sabres
hockey?  
ROBERT SACRE: Dominik Hasek was one of the greatest goalies of all time. When
he brought them to the Stars, to the NHL Cup, that was amazing. I have to go
with the Vancouver Canucks just because that's a local team. And then I'm torn
between Calgary as well. Jerome Iginla is a great captain.  
  
Q. Who was your favorite curler while we're on this subject?  
ROBERT SACRE: Leslie Nielson in "Men With Brooms."  
THE MODERATOR: Can't get any better than that. Thanks, guys. Appreciate your
time. We'll open to further questions for Coach Few. Start right down here.  
  
Q. Mark, the combination of shooting 50% and outrebounding them, how much of
a hurdle or challenge was that going into the game?  
MARK FEW: It was a monster challenge. I don't know if this is factual.
Somebody said in the locker room they didn't shoot 50%. Whether that's true or
not, the fact of the tape I watched, for us to be as efficient on the
offensive end as we were, our guys just played with an incredible amount of
poise and they stuck with the game plan and that would be very much true on
the glass. We spent a week talking about that. Our numbers were down a little
bit since we lost Manny. He's one of our best rebounders. That was a big
concern.  
We had a really good approach tonight on the defensive end and on the glass, I
thought.  
  
Q. You guys played real physical and played real tough, physically, but also
mentally tough. How do you develop that with such a young group?  
MARK FEW: It just -- takes a lot of time. It takes a season. And it takes
putting yourself in positions like in the Breslin Center in early November
with a great Michigan State team pounding on you and coming at you and trying
to continue to execute and make plays there and make plays on the defensive
end and just playing with poise and then some of that has been handed down.  
It's been handed down over the years. Handed down to Matt and Steve and now
Matt and Steve are in the process of handing it down to Rob and Meech and some
of the other guys.  
  
Q. I know in the course of the game you are absorbed in what you were doing.
Does this feel like any one of those games that you've booked along the way;
Illinois, Michigan State?  
MARK FEW: Well, yeah. A lot of those games we were able to jump out and play
fairly well in the first half. And then you know, a lot of teams make
adjustments and other teams usually starts getting some momentum if you let
them. We gave them a couple of easy baskets. Some momentum started. And I
would say very much so. But in all those aforementioned games we played with a
lot of poise and were able to kind of withstand some rallies.  
But they were every bit as physical as the game was tonight. Actually this
game might have been a little more physical. There were some big boys banging
around out there every time a shot went up.  
  
Q. How good of a feel to start the game -- I think you had seven assists in
the first nine baskets?  
MARK FEW: It felt great. Again, if you remember what we talked about
yesterday, I thought it was very important for us to be able to -- our offense
versus their defense. Those -- something had to give. It's always great when
you spend all week with a game plan and your guys come out and show it on the
floor.  
We want to make a couple of extra passes. We want them to move it around and
execute our screens, ball screen or down screen. And then see if they would
help and set up guys. So we set up guys all night for the most part. I thought
in the second half we just got a little bit anxious and we tried to make plays
off the first screen. We just needed to swing the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, I'll ask you the same question: Do you think it's fair that you're
going to have to play Syracuse here most likely?  
MARK FEW: I don't know if fair exists out there in the world. It is what it
is. It says we have to, so we're going to be here and look at it as a great
opportunity. It's one of the tough things when you're in that eight or nine
game. You have to play a one seed. Last year we ran into a great one seed.
This year we're running into another one seed. Hopefully we can fare a little
bit better. They have had an awesome year.  
And I think this might have been one of Coach Boeheim's greatest jobs. He's
had some great ones. He's one of the all-time best. He's a good friend of
mine. I've always looked up to him and how he's done things. I'm just
marvelled at how this team has played throughout this whole year. So very
deserving of a number one seed.  
It's going to be quite a task. But, you know, like we talked about earlier, a
lot of those games we played in earlier hopefully will prepare us for this.  
  
Q. Mark, talking about those games and what you're going to face, talk about
the players' poise. What are they like before a game? Do you notice how they
relax? How do they handle it?  
MARK FEW: What you just saw is, you know -- there's no more laid back player
in college basketball than Steven Gray. Sometimes you have to take his pulse.
But there's also a fire that burns in that belly of his. He's also one of the
greatest competitors I've had the chance to coach. And he's a warrior and the
same with Rob. Rob is a funny, charismatic clown but when it's time, I mean,
Rob is a warrior. Matt is just more of a stoic, solid what-you-see-what-you-
get. I think all three of those things -- all three of those guys, Elias is
very much like Matt. Very stoic and just so consistent both of those two have
had such consistent years. That gives you kind of a window into what I see, I
guess.  
  
Q. Maybe lost in the shuffle of their big surge in the second half, your
surge in the first half, was late in the game your guys were able to hit free-
throws. I think eight of their last ten. Can you just speak of the importance
of that?  
MARK FEW: No, very big. Goodson hit them. He's been struggling at the line. He
stepped up and hit some very, very big free-throws. Steven and Matt have been
shooting them great all year. We thought coming into this they're a very
physical team. Sometimes when you play physical teams you have to be able to
deliver through foul or get yourself to the line. We got to the line 30 times,
made 22 of them. That was a big part of the game.  
  
Q. Mark, two wins by WCC schools. I don't know when that's happened last in
the first round. Any thoughts on what's at work there?  
MARK FEW: They're good teams. I think we got knocked pretty hard in the
seeding process for losing to St. Mary's. And I think it shows how good of a
league we had this year. I think the top-end teams this year were the best
they've ever been all the way down probably to fifth place, Loyola went on the
road and beat Notre Dame. Certainly the way San Francisco was playing at the
end of the year, they were a tough out. And then everybody knows what Portland
did early. Had they not lost Raivio, I think that was a team that probably,
who knows, could have made the NCAA tournament or maybe the NIT.  
So St. Mary's is playing really, really good basketball right now. They're
shooting it -- probably the best shooting team left in the tournament, maybe
them and Cornell. They'll be a very tough out for Villanova tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse  79  
Vermont - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: I'm joined now by head coach Jim Boeheim and Scoop Jardine,
Andy Rautins, Wesley Johnson. Same format. We'll ask Coach Boeheim to make an
opening statement, and at that point we'll take questions just for our student
athletes and go from there.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Tonight I thought our defense was much better. I thought that was
the one thing we talked about over the last few days, to get back on the
defensive end. We just had the bad turnovers at the end of the first half. Got
them back in it. But other than that, our defense was really good the whole
game and we were very good on offense.  
I thought everybody really contributed. We got great first half out of Scoop
and Brandon hit a couple in the second half. It would have been a much
different game if we hadn't hit a couple of those to get it going.  
Vermont is a good team. They played well all year. And I just thought we
played very well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. We're going to take questions just for our
student athletes here.  
  
Q. Wes, I was just wondering if you had any nerves going into your first
tournament game here?  
WES JOHNSON: Not at all. It was more so excitement just to get back out
finally playing. This being my first NCAA tournament, just the thrill of it to
finally get back out there and experience it. It was fun.  
  
Q. This is for Andy. The way the game started and you guys always talk about
keeping underdogs, putting them in their place, could it have started any
better for you guys?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I don't think so. We came out aggressive. Our defense was good.
We just got a little bit passive. I think it's tough to play with a lead like
that. You have to maintain the killer instinct throughout the game. Second
half we made better adjustments and a little bit -- got out of our lull a
little bit. We adjusted in the second half.  
  
Q. Could you guys just talk specifically Coach said about the defense there,
I guess what you guys were able to do defensively tonight that you felt in the
previous two games you hadn't been doing?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We were able to locate the shooters. We did a great job
trapping the corners and getting out and getting some steals. Our big guys did
a great job coming back and getting blocks and able to start the fast break. I
think we just did a great job overall communicating with each other and
locating the shooters.  
Couple of times we didn't locate the shooters, they got a good shot. I think
for the overall part we located the shooters and tried to get out to them.  
WES JOHNSON: I think going to practice, that was our emphasis to focus on the
defensive end, like to get out and play defense like we did at the beginning
of the year. I think the whole week of practice that we had to prepare for
this game it helped us go into this game to step up on defense.  
  
Q. Andy, could you talk about how good it was to see Brandon Triche hit a
few shots tonight and also the play you got from DaShonte Riley.  
ANDY RAUTINS: It was great. Big minutes from both those guys. Brandon remains
confident. When he lets the ball go, he shoots it. He's a very good shooter.
There's a point where he missed one shot. We got an offensive rebound, kick it
back out to him and he hit another one. It goes to show when he has his
confidence going, he's a great player. Getting in the lane and making plays
for us too.  
DaShonte had big minutes for us rebounding the ball, moving it. He had a
couple of assists out there too. It was good to get those guys time and
especially DaShonte.  
  
Q. Andy, looking at the big picture and the focus that's been on the BIG
EAST over the past couple of days, it doesn't look like the BIG EAST is down
here in Buffalo considering how you guys opened and how West Virginia opened.
Have you noticed, are you surprised by what happened yesterday?  
ANDY RAUTINS: Yeah, I mean there were some letdowns, but I think teams came
out ready to play. Still no doubt in my mind the BIG EAST is the best
conference in the country. We still have the best teams. Just the first round
games are always a little bit tough. Maybe more so in our bracket. We came out
ready to play. I don't know. But there's no question the BIG EAST is still the
best conference.  
  
Q. Scoop, it seems like later in the year you seem to have excelled in the
beginning of the first half. You did in the Villanova game. You came out with
a great first half. What is it that makes you get out to those great starts?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Just try to be ready when I get in the game. I mean, I've been
coming off the bench all year so I kind of did my role. When I get in the game
I try to be aggressive. Try to make plays for myself and for my teammates. And
today I just got some easy lay-ups. Coach drew up some plays I was cutting to
the basket, and watched film. A couple of lay-ups. I just got it going that
way.  
  
Q. Scoop, the cross-over dribble, do you remember the play I'm talking
about? The crowd went nuts. Wes is shaking his head. Can you tell us about
that play? Describe it a little bit.  
SCOOP JARDINE: As Coach says, a playground play. I just tried to -- I seen Wes
running. Andy was running. They kind of made the play and I slowed down like I
was going to go to one of them. I crossed over, he went for it and I finished
the play. I give credit to Wes and Andy because they made the play, because
they ran hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Take two more for these guys.  
  
Q. Wes, can you talk about tonight, the rebounding, not letting them get
second chance points and controlling the glass?  
WES JOHNSON: I think we were very active using our athleticism to get on the
boards and try to limit them to one chance, one and out. Really if we get on
the boards and Scoop and Andy fill the lanes we can get out in transition a
lot. I feel like me, Rick and Chris and with DaShonte coming in, to try to
limit them to one shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time. Congrats. See you on Sunday. We'll take
other questions for Coach Boeheim at this time.  
  
Q. Similar to what I asked the players. The way you guys started, the
energy, were you concerned about a slow start, and again letting a team play
with you?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We haven't had slow starts this year very often. We've been
pretty good. Our defense was better at the beginning. That was the big key. We
gave them one early. After that we covered them. I just thought our defense
was better, and then when our defense is better it picks up our offense and
our offense kind of gets going.  
We had 24 assists. These guys passed the ball. They looked for each other.
They are unselfish. Ricky made a couple of great passes tonight. I thought the
key for us, Andy got eight defensive rebounds. That was a big plus.  
And the passing, the assists were tremendous. Vermont made no mistakes, which
usually we need to force some turnovers, and we could not do that. But we
forced their shooters out a little bit, and made them take tough shots. We did
a good job on the boards.  
  
Q. Jim, I would like to ask you the same questions about Brandon Triche's
night and DaShonte Riley's contributions.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought DaShonte was good. He's had good practices this week.
It's tough -- he's really struggled in practice so much this year that we just
weren't able to get him into games because he just was not ready. It wasn't
necessarily that Arinze and Ricky were playing that good. He just was not
ready. He's been better in practice, again like a freshman, when he knows he's
not playing, I think they tend to lose the edge and aren't ready. I think
knowing he was going to play some tonight, he was better in practice.  
He's a very good passer. He had two -- a couple of assists tonight. He's a
good passer. He was close on a couple of other passes. I was impressed. I was
happy with what he did, and Brandon is a very good player. He's proven that
already this year. Now he's kind of got back into a funk. I told him at
halftime to stop taking the running shot and get set, get his feet set and
take some perimeter threes or pull-ups. He went out and, you know, he
listened. Amazing. He's a good player. We need him to play good.  
  
Q. You kind of played around with the lineup a little bit tonight. Were you
happy with what you saw, specifically with DaShonte in there?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, he's got to play. We can't play six. If I could, if I
thought I could, I would. But he's going to play. He's going to play.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you make about -- of the fun that your guys were having
when they were talking about the playground play and just -- it looked like
you guys were loose and relaxed and enjoying themselves after a couple of
tough games.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think you have to be relaxed in the NCAA tournament. If you get
too tight and you want it too much, you don't play well. We want to be loose,
we want to go out and play the way we played all year long. These guys have
played well all year long. We played very well against Georgetown on offense
and we played pretty good against Louisville. Those are two pretty tough
games. We played well in them. When you are coming off bad losses where you
don't play well, I think there's a lot to be concerned about. But we played
well.  
Georgetown just played great. They shot 70% against us. We've played well all
year long. We've been very consistent from the first game all the way through.
Pittsburgh played great against us when they beat us. Louisville at Freedom
Hall played great. Georgetown. The only bad game we had was Louisville at
home. We just didn't play very well. Other than that, we have played very
well, very consistently all year long. I expect to play well here.  
  
Q. Jim, how do you feel Kris and maybe his brother too handled the whole
situation of the two brothers having to play each other tonight?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I didn't talk to Kris about that. I just don't -- I just ignore
stuff like that. He's got to go out and play and play his game. I think that's
always -- you never know what's going to happen in those situations. But I
thought Kris really struggled the first half. And then I thought the second
half he was much better on defense. I thought that he did a much better job
overall the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, what are your thoughts about the BIG EAST teams that had
difficulty winning yesterday?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Everybody has difficulty in this tournament. Notre Dame lost a
one-point game. Marquette lost a one-point game, two-point game. That's going
to happen. That's the way things go, you know? It's a difficult tournament.  
I mean everybody does it, but it's hard to measure a team or a league by what
happens in the NCAA. The matchups you get and where the games are, there's
just so many things that come into play that you really -- it's hard to judge
a league based on that. I think it's very difficult.  
We've got a very strong league. The Big 12 is very strong. The top three or
four teams from any other top leagues can play. There's no question about
that. It just happens who plays well on a given weekend. Notre Dame has done
an unbelievable job just to get to where they are. They didn't shoot the ball
well. When they don't shoot the ball well, they're not going to win. That's
what they do. Sometimes in the tournament, particularly the first game out of
the box, sometimes you don't shoot the ball well because it's the NCAA
tournament. Guys get a little tighter. First time they've played in it. And
that can affect how you play. But Marquette had every chance to win, and
Washington won the PAC-10 tournament last week. Obviously they're a pretty
good team.  
It must be bedtime for you. It's way past mine.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks. Good luck on Sunday.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse  79  
Vermont - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Vermont Head Coach Mike Lonergan, as well as
student athletes Marqus Blakely, closest to me, and Evan Fjeld at the far end
there. Vermont finishes up an excellent season 25-10 record. We'll open, as we
have, with an opening statement by Coach Lonergan and take questions from the
student athletes.  
MIKE LONERGAN: I want to congratulate Syracuse. I thought they played great.
You know, I thought if we could have made shots, we could have stayed in the
game and made it a little more interesting. We did not shoot the ball well
against a great team like that. You have to really make open three-pointers
and open jumpshots.  
I'm proud of our guys. They hung in there. Got down 12 at halftime. We were
getting blown out; 12, 14, whatever it was. We had some open looks and
couldn't do it. They made their shots and they played a great game. I wish
them the best of luck and hope they make it back to the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Go ahead and raise your hands if you have
questions for our student athletes.  
  
Q. Marqus, can you talk about how difficult this may have been? It was not a
neutral site by any shape or form. How tough was it to basically play an NCAA
road game? And when it was 25 and it looked like the doors had been blown
open, what did you guys do to summon that run and make it a game again?  
MARQUS BLAKELY: Well, you know, come into this type of atmosphere, I mean,
Vermont 3,200 people and coming out here and playing in front of a couple of
thousand people, and the small percentage is Vermont fans, I mean, it's a lot
different. I mean, you just got to go out there and give it your all. Try to
put it in the back of your mind that you are playing the number one team in
our bracket. I mean, just to go out there and compete and once they did get up
25, not to let my teammates kind of get discouraged and quit, because that's
not what we're about. Going out there and just giving it your all for 40
minutes.  
I told all the young guys you only get one chance in college. You have to play
every game as hard as you can for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. I guess for either Marqus or Evan, what stood out to you about Syracuse,
their athletes? What impressed you the most about them?  
EVAN FJELD: They're all good. Everybody they play, only six guys in the
rotation, really played tonight. But all of them can play. All of them can
shoot. All of them rebound. They are really good in the zone. They get out in
passing lanes and they make it difficult for you. I was kind of surprised how
-- I knew how good they were. But I didn't realize it like Scoop Jardine and
some of these guys that don't get the publicity that Wes Johnson gets or
(Arinze) Onuaku or Rautins, how good they actually are. It's tough when
everybody on the floor can play like they can.  
MARQUS BLAKELY: I mean, I was surprised how fast they got out after a missed
shot. We missed a lot tonight. I mean, it seemed like once they got the
rebound, they were just -- there was somebody at half court and there was
somebody at the other three-point line. It was tough to crash the boards and
get back in transition.  
  
Q. Marqus, what can you take away from this NCAA tournament appearance for
you? This is your only one, and this is it for you for your career in terms of
collegiate basketball.  
MARQUS BLAKELY: Well, I mean, I wish, I wish every teammate the best and
hopefully they can get back here. My freshman year we missed it by one. I just
hope they don't have to experience that and they'll be able to get back here
soon enough.  
  
Q. Those dunks there in the end of the first half, that's kind of like where
you've been all your career in terms of the highlight reel. Was that kind of
nice for you to do that on this stage?  
MARQUS BLAKELY: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of just read and react. The zone was
kind of high, pushed up towards half court. So I mean just seeing that and
reacting is kind of what happened. I mean, the dunk is just as special as a
pass. I credit Nick Vier for seeing that and throwing a good pass.  
  
Q. Evan, can you talk about the mindset of the team at halftime. It was a
25-point game and now it's a 12-point game. You guys clearly went into the
room with some momentum.  
EVAN FJELD: It seemed like they were about to blow it open. Marqus came with a
couple of dunks and it kind of settled us down. We realized we could play with
them. We're going to have to make some shots, we're going to have to improve
defensively. It wasn't going to be this blowout like it looked like it was
going to be. We wanted to circle the wagons, regroup and hopefully go out and
have a better effort in the second half. But we came out, didn't really make
shots. They came out and hit threes. It's tough when they shoot whatever, 10
for 22 from the three-point line. We kind of -- we need to shoot better and we
need them to shoot worse if we're going to pull off an upset like this.  
  
Q. Was there a moment out there for either one of you guys where you were
able to step back and think, "I'm at an NCAA game, I'm having fun"? What was
that moment like for you guys?   
MARQUS BLAKELY: When we first got here and we walked into the arena and just
to see how huge it was and knowing that it's going to be packed with Syracuse
fans, it was kind of -- you had to realize that you're there now. It's not
playing Stonybrook and 1,500; packed gyms, screaming fans like this is the
real deal. The fact that we went out there and kind of just never gave up. The
scoreboard might show something different, but I mean I'm proud of all my
teammates. I want to thank the fans too. They've been great all four years,
and the coaching staff here has been great. There's nothing really that I can
change. I just wish Syracuse the best and hopefully they'll win it all.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything to add to that, Evan?  
EVAN FJELD: I think I stepped back when we came out of the game at the end. We
kind of got our butts kicked by Syracuse. But I was a little disappointed, but
I realize that's not what really matters.  
I had a great year. Full of ups and downs, obviously, if you know. Just to
experience this, especially at this time going through my life, and having
these guys here with me I wouldn't want anything else. It was a really great
experience. I'll never forget it. Hopefully I can come back next year with a
different result sitting up here at the podium.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, appreciate it. Great season. We'll open up the
questions for Coach Lonergan at this time.  
  
Q. Was it the kind of hornets nest you expected? What was it like to deal
with all that orange and all that noise?  
MIKE LONERGAN: It was awful. I've been worried about this all week. I was
like, man, I just -- I felt like I was going to be at the Carrier Dome too,
19,000, whatever it was. Pretty impressive. I came -- came to see Matt's dad
and see his mom. Try to get used to the atmosphere. It wasn't crowded. It
wasn't the same. I tried to bring them late to the game so we didn't get here
too early. Even watching some of the second half Florida State game, just
seeing all that orange, I was like, we're going to have trouble. We got off to
a bad start. Kind of expected. We settled down. We just couldn't make shots.
But I didn't -- it wasn't about playing Syracuse. I didn't want to play
Syracuse in Buffalo. It was a great experience for our guys. They're the
better team. Whether we're playing here or anywhere in the country. When you
play great team like that, you have to make shots. We didn't and they did. I'm
a man to man coach. I play man to man 99% of the time. We had to play zone
tonight because we couldn't guard them. They scored against the man, came out
the second half, made four of their first five threes and the one they missed
they got the offensive rebound. We tried everything and nothing really worked.
But it was a great atmosphere. I watched the game on TV today at the Bradley
Center. Pittsburgh was playing. It looked like it was a third full. This was
unbelievable. The Orange fans, they do a great job. I know all about them.
They have tremendous fan support.  
  
Q. Only nine turnovers today. Are you happy with the way the guys took care
of the ball? Didn't really make any mistakes. Obviously the shots weren't
going down. Seems like there wasn't a lot of careless turnovers.  
MIKE LONERGAN: I mean, we were talking all week shots, not turnovers. They
played 2-3 zone. You shouldn't turn it over that much. We had some silly ones.
I didn't think we were -- we got beat pretty good. But I thought it was -- it
wasn't because we kept turning the ball over. We just didn't make shots. Even
our good shooters, wide open, I kept thinking, "the next one will go in, the
next one will go in." They did a great job taking our inside game out of it.
So I'm happy we didn't turn it over. Neither -- they turned it over a little
bit. They had 24 assists. They really shared the ball well. They did a great
job. I give them all the credit in the world. I know we didn't turn it over --
we didn't play well. We really didn't.  
  
Q. You talked a lot coming in, you didn't want the guys to have any regrets
after this game. And after listening to Marqus and Evan's comments, are you
satisfied that the team really reached their goals this year?  
MIKE LONERGAN: Yeah, I think so. We lost 2,000-point scorer Mike Trimboli.
Great player. Taylor Coppenrath. We lost a lot of offensive firepower. We were
the second worst three-point shooting team in the American East and we still
won 25 games. We were down 25 in the first half. I said this could be 40, so
we cut it to 12.  
We were feeling pretty good at halftime. They came out and lit us up again. I
told the guys, I'll never yell at you for missing shots. We had open shots. So
I didn't think we played scared in the second half. I just didn't think we
played well. And that has a lot to do with their defense. But also we were
missing shots all year. I'm happy we didn't pack it in. An I don't think we
gave up or anything. But I would have liked to have given Syracuse a better
ballgame tonight.  
  
Q. I know it's always hard to put it into words only a few minutes after the
season ended, what's your assessment of this season and the careers of some of
the seniors, Marqus in particular?  
MIKE LONERGAN: I thought we had a great year to win 25 games at our level. We
played our first ten games on the road. It's hard to get home games. We have
great fans and we're pretty good. So it's really hard. Our team lost to
Cornell by eight without Garvey Young. We played a pretty tough schedule. We
beat Rutgers. Beat a good Buffalo team up here. We had lost three in a row one
point this year and our guys came back. We were one win away from winning the
regular season which was one of our goals.  
I couldn't be happier outside tonight to go to Hartford, tremendous fan
support we received. Catamount Nation came to Hartford. We got two wins and we
got a home game. And with Evan's mom passing away, it was one of the hardest
weeks of my coaching career.  
These guys did a great job supporting Evan. He was unbelievable. He's strong
young man. I'll never forget the season. I'm all about winning. I love to win
more than anybody, and I hate to lose. The University of Vermont, I think the
athletic department school is about more than that. These guys taught me a lot
this year, especially the last couple of weeks. I was happy for Evan. He had a
great year. They were able to cut down the nets and make the NCAA tournament.
The matchup was tough. And I was worried about it all week, trying to keep the
guys loose. But we didn't reach every goal, but we reached a lot of them.  
I'm going to be bumped out tonight and for a couple of weeks. You know how I
get. I'll be down. But keep working harder recruiting. This summer I'll have a
smile on my face. These guys did a great job. We have one first team all week
player. And we have a lot of good players. But to get this far with just one
really great player, that shows me that we were a team that won with
rebounding and defense. So I think to win 25 games, I'm pretty pleased. I'll
be a lot more pleased in a week.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? One brief announcement. Coach, I want
to thank you and congratulate you on a great season.  
MIKE LONERGAN: Thanks. Thanks for the host city here. It was great.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Missouri - 86  
Clemson - 78

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by the Missouri Tigers. Head Coach Mike Anderson,
closest to me; the far end, J.T. Tiller. Next to him, Keith Ramsey who had a
career-high 21 points. Next to him Kim English. A couple of notes before we
get started. Missouri is now 34-1 when having 20 or more assists in a game
under Coach Anderson which they did today. Obviously on to the second round
this year after reaching the Elite Eight last year. With that being said, turn
it over to coach for an opening statement. Then we'll take questions for the
student athletes after that.  
MIKE ANDERSON: Well, we want to take our hats off to our guys. Our guys
really, really stepped it up today. We talked about, you know, having the
focus, especially defensively coming out with energy. And I thought they
brought that. And I thought the game was very in a rhythm for our basketball
team. Clemson, outstanding guard play of Trevor Booker. I thought we did a
great job on it.  
The game was tied at the half. I thought we had the rhythm going the way we
wanted to. I thought in the second half we really came out and turned up the
intensity.  
Our bench, which I always say is the strongest component to our basketball
team, and we have guys now that are on our bench in the starting lineup, still
yet today I thought that was the biggest difference in the game. Guys coming
in and giving us great minutes; Steve Moore, Miguel Paul, Marcus Denmon.  
These guys to my right, I thought they showed the leadership early on. Didn't
get rattled. And they did what they had to do to win the game. That first game
you always wonder how your kids are going to come out. I thought our guys came
out and really took it defensively to Clemson.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. At this time we'll take questions for Keith,
Kim and J.T.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about what Coach said? You were in a tie game at
halftime. I did see you guys took the game to another level they couldn't
match.  
KIM ENGLISH: He just emphasized that we're a second half team, that the first
five minutes would be key. He said this is a game of runs and we just wanted
to go on our run the longest. And it will start defensively and not just
become a half-court team. Just stay on the attack full throttle for the 40
minutes. But at that time it was just for the last 20.  
  
Q. For J.T. and Kim. Can you guys each comment on the usefulness perhaps of
the Nebraska loss, the shock value? And also can you each comment on Keith's
play today?  
J.T. TILLER: The Nebraska loss has really put us in -- I think it really got
us back to the right mindset, what we need to be doing if we want to be
successful for the rest of the season. We used that as motivation last week in
practice. And we just knew what we had to do to come into this game today,
really just play our game if we wanted to get the win.  
KIM ENGLISH: And not only the Nebraska loss, the Kansas loss right before
that. So we still had a bad taste in our mouth. So we just had to just come
out with the same feeling we felt after the Nebraska game and know that we
didn't want that same locker room after this game. And Keith played huge. 20
points. It feels like he had a triple-double. But he played huge. Coach said
he was going to cut back on his minutes. (Laughter) I don't think he did. He's
going to sleep good tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything to add to that or say to your coach?  
J.T. TILLER: Nothing to Coach. Keith is on it. He played 34 minutes. He really
put his stamp on the game. Really every minute that he played. Just being able
to guard one of the best players in the ACC and hold him to 11 points, that
says something about his effort. That says something about his pride, his
integrity and his character.  
  
Q. Keith, you had four assists too, I believe. And there were a lot of balls
going over the top. You guys were not cautious; was that by design as well?  
KEITH RAMSEY: No, Coach told us to go out there and play loose. That's what
we're going to do.  
  
Q. Keith, did Coach threaten your minutes?  
KEITH RAMSEY: I mean, Coach say a lot of things. (Laughter) Most of the time
he don't go through with it. I was going out there and playing.  
MIKE ANDERSON: Have some love, I tell you.  
  
Q. This is for Kim. Can you just talk about the intensity that you played
with defensively? You gave up 78 points. Defensively you played actually
pretty well. What is it like to play in that environment that your coach has
tried to establish?  
KIM ENGLISH: Coach Anderson said this would be an up-and-down game. And it
felt a lot like practice because we don't have guys in our league pressing us
that much. So it was a welcome sight to see a team wanting to speed us up. So
I think that's what attributed to the high score. But we're a defensive blue-
collar, gritty team. And I think it showed today.  
  
Q. Keith, can you talk about why your team -- what you did and why your team
was so successful today against Booker? Especially defensively?  
KEITH RAMSEY: I mean, we were just harassing him. If he got past one person,
he had to get past the next. So we did a good job, me and Laurence. Even Steve
Moore came in and gave us good minutes down there.  
  
Q. J.T. and Keith or Kim, following up on Trevor, he seemed to get really
frustrated when the game was still tied; did you notice that?  
KEITH RAMSEY: Yeah, he was. I mean, to be real, I think we were fouling him a
lot. He wasn't getting a lot of calls but that's a part of the game so that
made him real frustrated.  
  
Q. Kim, yesterday you said both teams wanted to go fast. Did you feel you
sped them up more than they were comfortable with?  
KIM ENGLISH: I don't think they get pressured a lot either in the ACC. But I
think we sped them up. And it shows in the 20 turnovers that they had. And to
our advantage, a lot of those were live balls, turnovers, they weren't going
out of bounds. So that started our break. That made our offense a lot more
potent than in Kansas where we were getting scored on and our offense was a
lot more stagnant. When we're getting stops, our offense is a lot better. And
it showed.  
  
Q. J.T. and Kim, can you comment on the man sitting between you has suddenly
turned into a comedian? Is he always like that?  
J.T. TILLER: Ask his brother, Kimmy.  
KIM ENGLISH: That's him. He's laid back. He's funny to me all the time. I
don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Congrats. We now turn to questions for
Coach Anderson.  
  
Q. Mike, you've seen this in Keith for a while. This was kind of a breakout
game in a lot of ways for him. Can you talk about what he brings to the game
and why he was able to do all he did today?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Keith has a great basketball IQ. I think he's so much more
comfortable in that role now, the leadership role. That's why I leave him out
there, sometimes it's hard to keep him off the floor. But I think with the
long time-outs, it enabled us to let him play. He was like a point forward
today. You look at his stat line, it was unbelievable. It's something that's
been taking place lately with our basketball team, especially with his play. I
don't think he wants it to end. I really don't. That's how he played in high
school. That's how he played in junior college. And so it's kind of gratifying
to see him step it up when it matters the most. That's what seniors do.  
I couldn't be -- I think our guys follow his lead. Again, you can look at his
stat line. I just don't think if you watch the game, he was more effective in
a lot of ways. Changing shots, fixing things on defense. He had some
tremendous assists. One of them Bowers missed a lay-up at the end, and no
turnovers. That's like a point forward. And we needed all that today.  
  
Q. Mike, Keith and J.T. seemed to be a little more vocal today, a little
more emotion. Is that something you wanted to see from them?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Well, they're the captains. That's what seniors do. These guys
have got to show these young guys the way. They experienced it last year.
That's the only thing I want them to bring in this year was the experience
they had, what it took to get to this point. You know, not only that, when you
do, how do you come out and perform? That first game is always important. So
with that being said, I think the young guys followed their lead.  
To me it's all about trust. I think our guys are starting to trust one
another. When you start seeing the stat line we have, 20 assists, they are
sharing. Not only that, they're fixing things on defense. I thought it was
great defensive play by our guys. I really did. Clemson wouldn't quit at the
end. That's why we -- we made stops and they would get some stick-backs at the
end, Booker would grab it and put it in the hole. When you play at that pace,
we scored 86 points but only had nine turnovers. That's efficient basketball.
Not only that, we had 15 steals, forced 20 turnovers. They outrebounded us by
15.  
Surviving and advancing in tournament play I think the key is the final score.
I thought we imposed our will on a very good Clemson team.  
  
Q. Mike, yesterday Laurence Bowers said he wasn't surviving and advancing,
it was win or go home. He said losing in the NCAA tournament would have felt
like the end of the world. Did you sense that intensity out of the kids before
they ever took the floor today?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I thought our guys would play. I thought our guys -- they were
embarrassed what took place in the Big 12 tournament. I really did. And not
only that, once that took place, a lot of people kind of look at these guys a
little different with Justin Safford being out.  
So, I think our guys probably in terms of being motivated -- but when you get
to tournament play, they understand. It's about energy now. It ain't the X's
and O's. It's who wants it the most. I thought our guys displayed that today,
I mean from 1 to 12, all the guys on the bench, I thought they came with the
focus. And then not only that, they took the energy out there. That energy
became contagious.  
  
Q. Other than like Keith said, fouling him and getting away with it, what
was the strategy on Booker? Did it change at all when they started hitting the
threes in the first half?  
MIKE ANDERSON: We were going to go and double up. I thought we did a better
job of pressuring him once he threw it out of the double team. I thought early
on they were getting clean -- they were drawing the guys down and skipping the
ball over. I thought we came with better pressure and I thought we mixed it up
as Keith mentioned, try to make them guess.  
So, that being said, so other guys were the beneficiaries of what took place.
I thought we were in an attack mode. I thought we got some key guys on their
team in foul trouble. Potter got in foul trouble. Stitt got in foul trouble.
Now you have the young guy Young, he was carrying them for the most part by
himself, he and Johnson. But I thought fatigue was a factor even going down
the stretch for him because he played a lot of minutes. So we just tried to
keep them off-kilter with our pressure defense.  
  
Q. You worked under Nolan Richardson. Is that performance today reflective
of what you remember when he had that 40 minutes of hell? I know it's -- just
in terms of style and effectiveness?  
MIKE ANDERSON: It's unique. It's a little different. Clemson, they're a
pressuring team. I just don't think anyone presses like we do. And it's
something we do every single day. And as we get to tournament play, I think it
benefits us. If we can get past that first game or get on a run, like we did
today, if our guys are in tune to one another. So I played it. I had a chance
to play it at Tulsa for Coach Richardson. I worked for him for 17 years. By
you bringing that up, I take that as the ultimate compliment, that we look
like one of their teams because all his teams did were win. They played
exciting, fun basketball.  
You saw some highlight plays out there. Our guys were -- they were having fun.
I thought they were having fun today.  
  
Q. It's almost taken for granted that Laurence will keep playing but
obviously that has to be a pretty great effort with what's going on with his
wrist. Can you describe what he was able to give you in terms of that,
please?  
MIKE ANDERSON: He's been doing it. Ever since it took place. He's been doing
it. He gets more and more comfortable with it. You look at a guy like J.T.
Tiller. That is a guy that played for about half a season with it. It just
tells you the make-up of him, toughness. He's got toughness.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like this time of year there are certain teams that have
success in the tournament and certain teams that can't get over that hump. Is
there something different versus the regular season in tournament play? And
why some teams have had success in the tournament?  
MIKE ANDERSON: Our teams typically start playing some of their better
basketball right around late February, March. And I guess it's March Madness.
So our guys -- I guess we really turned up our intensity. And I think it was
reflective today. It's something all our teams I've been associated with. I
think you build your team up until you get to this point. Because to me this
is what you work towards.  
With that being said, I want our guys to be loose and go out there and have
fun, do what they've been doing all year long. Once you win, I think you taste
it. I think you want more. And these guys, they had some success last year.
They really did. And I think that experience is really hopefully what paid
dividends. And I thought it was today; I thought they drew on that experience.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on West Virginia. I know you faced Huggins when he was
at Kansas State and Cincinnati. Does this team look similar to what you've
seen --  
MIKE ANDERSON: Very similar. You know what you're going to get. You're going
to get a blue-collar team, have some tremendous, tremendous players
athletically and seems like they're all the same size. They all are versatile.
They are going to be hard-nosed and blue-collar.  
We have to find that toughness, because they will attack the glass. All his
teams have been notorious for that. Defensively they are a great -- they're a
good team. They are not only that, they're athletic. And they got a prime time
player in Butler. This guy -- I had an opportunity to work with him at the USA
Games. I actually wanted to take him off that team and bring him down here
with me to play for Missouri. I don't think Huggins would have liked that.
He's a tremendous, tremendous player.  
So it's going to be an ultimate challenge for our basketball team. Right now
we'll just enjoy this one, the Clemson win until midnight. And then we'll turn
our focus and get ready for one of the top teams in the country. When you talk
about West Virginia, they are an outstanding team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by West Virginia University student athletes.
Closest to me, Da'Sean Butler, Devin Ebanks and at the far end, Wellington
Smith. West Virginia comes in as the number two seed. 27-6. Same rules apply.  
  
Q. Mr. Butler, one of the Missouri players has hit four game-winning shots
in two years and they call him "Big Shot." What do they call you?   
DA'SEAN BUTLER: "Da'Sean." Honestly, I don't have any nicknames. Anything like
that. I just go out and play, do whatever my coach tells me to do and we're
successful. So I'm just happy with how everything has turned out so far.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, Reggie Holmes' first comment today this morning to us was when
asked what he thinks of West Virginia and how they stack up, his first comment
was "Da'Sean." What do you know of Reggie Holmes and have you had a chance to
see him play? And how good of a player might he be?   
DA'SEAN BUTLER: He's a very good player. We watched him on film. I saw the
game they had earlier in the year against Louisville. You know, he can shoot
the ball, he's flat-out one of the best shooters in the country and one of the
best scorers in the country. He does a lot for that team, you know, in
general. So overall he's just a really good player. I look forward to playing
against him tomorrow.  
  
Q. To any of the three of can you, I was wondering what were your
expectations Saturday night if you think you had done enough to deserve a
number one seed at that point and what were your reactions last Sunday when
the brackets came out and you had the number two.  
DEVIN EBANKS: We felt if we win that game probably have a good chance of being
the number one seed. Obviously we didn't get it. But I don't think we were
disappointed as a team being the number two seed, really. You're going to have
to go out there and play on the floor anyway. As long as we play hard, we
should be fine.  
WELLINGTON SMITH: Same thing as Devin. At first we were kind of disappointed a
little bit seeing that we have done everything that we've supposed to to get
that number one seed. Obviously it didn't happen. So when this team goes out
there next year, we're going to show them we should have deserved that. So
yeah.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, you were here two years ago when Joe Alexander went on that
amazing run and really kind of became a household name. I'm just kind of
wondering if you felt any similarities between what you've done in the BIG
EAST tournament and your game-winning shots this year compared to what Joe
Alexander went through couple of years ago.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: No, I couldn't compare myself to Joey. He brought us --
brought me especially to my first Sweet 16. First tournament appearance ever.
He did so much for the team in general during the season that, you know,
things I get to do still. He's just a different player than I am. So I can't
really compare myself to him. Just things are just going good now. I'm just
grateful for that. I can't really say that on the level of his game where he
was his junior year and this is my senior year.  
  
Q. Popularity-wise?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: No. Everybody likes the white guy that can jump. I can't jump.
That's his thing. I can't really keep up with that.  
  
Q. For Devin, at the BIG EAST it seemed like you were doing a lot of the
little things, the passes, the rebounding, blocking shots, stuff like that.
Not looking as much for your offensive game. Was that by design or did it just
not come to you in that setting?  
DEVIN EBANKS: Not really by design. That's how the flow of the game was going.
Especially when you see Da'Sean and definitely Kevin Jones hitting shots as
well. I just try to do little things to win the game. I want to win the game
more than individual stuff. So that's what I was trying to do. We won the BIG
EAST championship. So I'm not too mad about that at all.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, you touched on this a little bit. Can you speak to kind of being
the state's team and playing for the people in the State of West Virginia?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Definitely. It's one of the reasons I came. There's no NBA
teams or any pro teams at all. There's nothing really there except the
college, the school. And everybody loves our school to death. So for us to win
the BIG EAST and have the season we're having so far, everybody is excited.
Everybody is overjoyed because, you know, we are it for them. And the way of
us winning that and doing what we're doing this season, we're thanking them
because they showed so much support for us. They're there every game, whether
we win or lose. And they stay after the games and they are staying and they
tell us what to look forward to the next game. They do everything real fans
are supposed to do. I'm glad I'm here, you know. So...  
  
Q. This is for the seniors. You weren't recruited by Coach. Can you talk a
little about the transition from a different type of playing style, different
coaches, and maybe also the physical style from a more finesse to a more
physical style that you guys now play, what that was like with him as your
coach? And also can you talk a little about the trade rumor?  
WELLINGTON SMITH: The styles are completely different from offensive-oriented
team to a defensive-oriented team. Both coaches love to win. Both coaches have
a desire to win.  
But the only difference is there's more defense on Bob Huggins' side of the
spectrum and Coach Beilein just instilled liked to do the fundamental things.
We like to do fundamental things now. It's more of hard-nosed get-into-
people's-faces type stuff that we really like to do. He has instilled that
into us right when he got here. That's what we try to bring on, you know, when
we go into this tournament. The treadmill, that's just something that nobody
really enjoys, is instilled in every practice no matter how far you go. If we
go back to Morgantown, and we're still practices, it's still going to be
instilled then. About 15 miles-per-hour, 44 seconds, and it got escalated from
22 seconds to 44 seconds since we weren't learning our lessons. It's something
that I just still get on. I don't know about these guys, but I get on every
now and then.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I'm not on it as much. I kind of learn from my mistakes. So
about the treadmill. But just in term of the styles, when I was in high
school, just like Wellington, we played against each other a number of times.
We played this kind of style of basketball. And we came here -- we came to
West Virginia and played under Coach Beilein. That was new, just learning how
to play in the system where he used to create and doing things ourselves, our
high school, just like every other high school player, to learn the system. So
when Coach Huggins got back, he brought us back to what we used as far as just
playing and just doing what you need to do to play. To play basketball, excuse
me. So at the end of the day, it's kind of like he brought us back to what we
used to be and we've gotten better as opposed to standing around in the system
and letting things happen. We kind of take the game into our own hands.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, all of you, if you can, the question was asked to
Todd Bozeman earlier about whether they can handle your physicality. And he
said in their league they're sort of known as the West Virginia of their
league. They bring a lot of physicality. Is that something you've seen on film
and how would you describe their style of play from watching them?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Honestly, we watched them play, and they are a very physical
team and they are very good defensive team as well. Our coach tells us all the
time just about what he used to do a long time ago at Cincinnati, everybody
knew their reputation, how physical they were. So any coaches or any other
teams know they're playing against a Bob Huggins team they're going to come
out and play physical in general because their coach is drilling it in their
heads, you have to be physical, you have to be ready to go out and play and
keep up with them. We're going to go out there and play our game and play with
great intensity and if they come out with great intensity as well, just try to
beat their intensity. All you can do is go out there and take care of our
business first.  
  
Q. For Da'Sean, what -- last year's tournament experience, what lessons can
you take from that into this year having lost in the first round a year ago?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Pay attention to what's in front of you, as opposed to looking
down the road. I think we did a better job our sophomore year just paying
attention to what was in front of us. Because we were worried about getting
in. Whereas we were so worried about getting in, we got in, we're not going to
take this for granted. We're going to play every game. Last year I think we
were kind of -- we already knew we were in. We wanted to see where we were
seeded. Everybody was like, oh, well, you guys, I can't wait to see you guys
play Kansas, and, I can't wait to see you play Michigan State or whoever. We
never really got the chance to worry about -- I know the coaches drilled it
into our heads about Dayton, but as a team I don't think we were focused on
Dayton. I made this a point in my head; honestly just thinking about Morgan
State right now. That's about it.  
  
Q. Along the same lines for Devin, just as being part of that freshman
class, what have you, like from a couple of years back, what have you and your
fellow classmates gotten out of last year's experience? And how much have you
grown, maybe, perhaps going into this year and going into this tournament?  
DEVIN EBANKS: We definitely felt disappointed last year just because we knew
that we were a better team than Dayton. But they were a better team that day.
Left a bad taste in my mouth and definitely my other teammates losing in the
first round and being our first time in the tournament and having an early
exit. So this year we are looking to turn it around. Hopefully make it to the
final four and just play as hard as we can every minute we're out there.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks for your time. Good luck. Coach wants to go
right to questions. We will do so. Please let's just raise your hand. One
follow-up as always.  
  
Q. Got ask you about you're a two and Kansas State is right up there with
you. What are your thoughts? Have you had any contact with Frank over the
course of the season?  
COACH HUGGINS: I probably talk to Frank every three or four days. I talked to
him last night for a minute. He was going to call me right back, which is --
that's Frank. I actually just talked to him a minute ago for just about two
minutes. We talk a lot.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their success?  
COACH HUGGINS: I thought it would happen. I'm the one who talked to Dr.
Wofford and Tim about having continuity and the job that I knew that he would
do.  
He's a heck of a coach. He's one of those guys that he can be hard on guys,
but they still like him. And that's because they know he cares about them. He
does a great job. They play as hard as anybody I've seen play in a long time.  
  
Q. Bob, you've said before when you were at UC, even with those great teams,
they were always the Reds. There was always another game in town. Can you
speak a little bit to being the state's team? As a quick follow-up, how many
the people in the state need to realize that teams like this don't come along
all the time and they should wrap their arms around what's going on right
now?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I think they realize that. I think they have. We're
averaging -- we average more per game. We had more people come to Morgantown
to see the games than ever before in history. I think they have wrapped their
arms around the team. But, you know, the truth of the matter is they're going
to do that anyways. It's West Virginia's team. The Steelers didn't make the
playoffs. That didn't stop people from going to the games and supporting the
Steelers. We are West Virginia's team. We are West Virginia's franchise.
They're going to -- I mean I don't know that there will be anybody in the
state other than that little pocket over there by Ashland that's not watching
or listening to the game when we play at 12 o'clock tomorrow.  
  
Q. Any tough feelings about being a number two seed? Even Coach Bozeman
suggested that he had you picked as number one.  
COACH HUGGINS: No. The committee has a hard job. I fully realize that. I've
been doing this long enough to know what a hard job they do have. I was a
little surprised that we weren't a higher 2. But I'm sure there's reasons. I'm
not sure what they are, but I'm sure there are reasons.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Da'Sean Butler's game is a lot different than the way
Joe Alexander played. But is there any kind of comparison that can be drawn to
the run that Da'Sean just had in the BIG EAST tournament as compared to what
Joe did a couple of years ago, popularity-wise? Just the way things ended up
for both of them?  
COACH HUGGINS: Da'Sean does a lot more things than what Joe did. Da'Sean I
don't think is as explosive as what Joe was on a day-to-day basis. I mean, Joe
just had games where they just couldn't guard him. And Da'Sean just does so
many things for us. I think that what we appreciate I think what his teammates
appreciate about Da'Sean is he's a very good defender. And he's a very
versatile defender. He's probably our best passer. We give him the ball when
we're trying to get it to somebody else. I think he said it and I think he's
absolutely right. He's good at everything. He may not be great at anything,
but he's good at everything.  
  
Q. Coach, you played for your father, all-state player in high school. He's
a Hall of Fame Coach in Ohio. Can you talk to similarities, coaching styles
between yourself and him? I talked to him the other day. Had some interesting
things to say. What you do now as a coach is much what you did as a player
what he did?  
COACH HUGGINS: He's a lot tougher than I am. I mean, he was pretty tough. We
still -- we've changed a little bit in the last couple of years. But for -- I
don't know -- probably I would have been coaching almost 30 years, I guess, 28
of those years we were in the same zone offense that he ran and that I ran in
high school. Actually, we're coming over on the bus, I was talking to Larry
Harris. Larry said, Coach, we need to go back to the other zone offense that
we ran. And probably we do.  
He had a great mind. He's very, very intelligent guy and remembered
everything. You could screw up something on the opening tip, and there wasn't
a time-out for the whole first quarter. At the end of the quarter, you were
going to hear about what you screwed up when they threw the ball up. He
remembered everything. What we do man-to-man wise is what he did. We've thrown
some variations in there just to kind of take advantage to what our guys can
do. The basic premise of it is what he did. He got it from Ed McCluskey from
Farrell. That's my roots. I mean, he won whatever it was, 88% of his games or
something like that. I would be foolish not to do what he did.  
  
Q. Last time you coached against Todd, he had a higher profile, bigger --
obviously a bigger program. What have you seen in looking at his team now,
what have you seen, what kind of job do you think he's done at Morgan State?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think he's done a great job. I mean, how he continues to get
guys that are as good as what they are. Jackson to me is all league in any
league in the country. He's going to be -- he's going to be on the all
freshman team in any league in the country. He's very good.  
They can shoot it outside, they're good inside. They play together. They play
hard. They guard you. I think he's done a great job. But I think everybody
knew he would.  
  
Q. Do they give you -- is there anything -- as long as you played your game
you probably feel okay. Is there anything about their game that concerns
you?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, yeah. When they get making shots, they're pretty good.
They're like everybody else. What they do conceptually is hard to guard
because they stretch you so much because they can make shots. And then they've
got people inside who can score the ball. I think every time we're watching
tape, every time Thompson got isolated he got a pretty good shot. It didn't
matter whether it was Louisville or Arkansas or whoever it was, he got a
pretty good shot. So when they spread you and throw it in there to him, he's
very effective. And what they do to be able to do that is very sound
basketball.  
  
Q. How much do you speak about the Dayton game and about Minneapolis last
year?  
COACH HUGGINS: I haven't brought it up.  
  
Q. Is that calculated?  
COACH HUGGINS: No. I grew up in Midville, I got in this guy's pick-up to go
play one day. There was no rear-view mirror. I said you don't have a rear-view
mirror. He said we ain't going backwards, boy."  
  
I don't deal much with the past.  
  
Q. Do you think the kids have spoken about it?  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah, I keep hearing them talk about it. Probably don't know
what else to talk about, you know?  
  
Q. What's it like for you coaching your dream job? That's how you're going
to describe coming to West Virginia.  
COACH HUGGINS: I think the first thing is it's an unbelievable feeling when I
walk out the tunnel and my dad is sitting there and my brothers and my
sisters, just being able to be able to be close to my family again is always a
wonderful thing. We're so much closer now than when I was at Cincinnati. I
mean they're a couple of hours closer than what they were. It's -- that's a
great feeling. And then to have all the friends that I have, former
classmates, life-long friends, and just -- I was born in Morgantown and lived
there until I was nine years old. So I know what it means, and having played
there, I know what it means. To have a guy like Jerry West come around and
Jerry wanted to do a fantasy camp. Jerry was on board. Hundley was on board.
Those guys care so much about the state and university. That's what I think
the people on the outside don't understand. They don't understand the fabric
and the core of the people in West Virginia which I do. And that's why I
appreciate being there so much.  
  
Q. In fear of asking you to look in that rear-view mirror, can you see how
much this team, this group has grown from last year, especially the freshmen
class of last year that was its first NCAA tournament and how much forward
they have come?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think the biggest thing to happen to them is they're all
about anywhere from 20 to 30 pounds stronger. They're not kids anymore. And I
think we're much better equipped to handle the physicality that is certainly
in our league. You know, they're good guys. I think that's something that
needs not to be overlooked. They're really good people. And, you know, it's
not easy to spend 12 months a year in Morgantown when the other students are
gone and being there and lift and go in and get your shots up every day and go
in and play. But they did that. They did that willingly. They were excited
about it. They were excited about this year I think from the minute last year
ended.  
  
Q. They all talked about how much tougher they've become in your program. Do
you see that? And also, with their experience and toughness, how well does
that put you in good position going into this tournament against a lot of
other teams?  
COACH HUGGINS: Still got to make shots. Nobody's ever won nothing-nothing. We
are tougher. I think when you work as hard as what we work every day, you're
going to get tougher. You're going to get more physical. But the great thing
about these guys is they don't fight it. You know, you have teams sometimes
that you just -- you have to go in there every day and fight with them to get
them to play hard. These guys, you know, by and large you don't have to do
that. They love being in the gym. And they're in the gym when -- I gave them a
couple of days off, they were still in the gym. They love being in the gym.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning, everybody, welcome to Buffalo. We will go through
a few ground rules before we get started. Please, if you have cell phones turn
them to either vibrate or off for us throughout the press conference.  
The way this will work is please raise your hand if you have a question for
our student athletes from Morgan State. We will get a microphone to you.
Please wait for the microphone to get there. You are allowed one follow-up
question. I would ask let the folks with the microphone know if you have a
follow-up so they'll stay with you. Please give the name and organization
before ask you your question. Joining me up here from Morgan State Reggie
Holmes, DeWayne Jackson and Troy Smith. And we'll open with questions from
there. Go ahead and raise your hands and we'll get a microphone to you.  
  
Q. To any of you all, just what catches your attention about West Virginia
and how do you think you match up with them?  
REGGIE HOLMES: Catch my eye, Da'Sean Butler. I know that he's a great leader.
Always put the team on his back and he's a very mature player.  
DeWAYNE JACKSON: What catches my eye is they're a real physical team.
Everybody say Morgan State, we're physical. We're going to go out and play and
match their physicality.  
TROY SMITH: I was going to talk about I think the coaches. The coaches are the
key, because if you have two great coaches with West Virginia and our coach,
so Todd Bozeman, so I think that's going to be the key there.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you. Not necessarily you DeWayne, but what did
you other guys learn from last year's NCAA appearance?  
REGGIE HOLMES: I mean, last year was just like an experience, first time in
the program has been there we always excited. But this year we're more
focused.  
TROY SMITH: Reggie just said, last year was new to us. We never experienced
the different things that come with going to the NCAA tournament. Like you
say, this year we come more prepared, more focused, trying to win the game,
trying to play the game, play our style of basketball.  
  
Q. Do you have any idea -- this will be really for you DeWayne, as far as
the physical nature, what level -- do you have to step up to meet their game?
What's your feeling about where your game is compared to their game?  
DeWAYNE JACKSON: We really just got to bring the energy and play.  
  
Q. This is for Reggie: You came to the school as the all-time leading scorer
this year. You passed Marvin Webster. Can you talk about what that means to
you and just sort of talk about what that means to your career? Not only
finishing up with that record, but also, you know, being part of the first two
Division 1 tournament teams in school history.  
REGGIE HOLMES: Really, I didn't think about being the all-time leading scorer.
I was worried about finishing out the season on a strong note. I mean, it
means a lot but I never sat around and thought about it. To be able to take my
school to two championships in my four years, it means a lot.  
  
Q. This is for Reggie: Reggie, you said it right off the bat, Da'Sean
Butler. What fascinates you about him and what do you see that makes him so
good? And how do you stop him?  
REGGIE HOLMES: I've seen a lot of their games this year. And like when a game
on the line, they go to him.  
For tough shots, defensive plays, all that. They go to him.  
  
Q. Just as a follow-up for any of the three guys, how do you stop him? How
do you go about in containing this guy, especially in the clutch?  
REGGIE HOLMES: You don't let one person beat you. Defense helps -- if a person
help you out, you help him out.  
TROY SMITH: Defense evils is the focus. If you focus on defense for the whole
game, shut down the guy and playing your role, that can make it happen. That's
what I think it's about.  
REGGIE HOLMES: I mean, saying just what they said: Team defense.  
  
Q. This is for Reggie. Seeing you've been here for four years. You came in
with Coach Bozeman. You know where the program stood when you got there, and
you're a Baltimore guy. When you got to Morgan, could you have envisioned
going to the NCAA tournament? What was the vision that you saw? What was the
vision that Coach Bozeman instilled?  
REGGIE HOLMES: My recruitment, on my visit, I remember telling Coach Bozeman I
was going to bring him an MEAC championship, than automatic bid to the
tournament. To say it and do it means a lot right now.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about your relationship with Anthony Anderson and what
you went through this year? Is there a disappointment? I know there was talk
he might be able to be here for the tournament. I guess he's not going to be
able to. Is there a disappointment involved with that?  
TROY SMITH: Yes. I mean, it is a disappointment for us because we really
wanted to get him here and bring him here, give him the opportunity to watch
us play basketball. He hasn't had an opportunity to watch us play because of
what he's been going through. That's been something we have been wanting to do
all year. For it not to happen, it's kind of like, we still have to do what we
need to do and we talked to him and told him what we need to do. So...  
REGGIE HOLMES: I mean, I only know him for like two years. Last year he sat
out and this year he was my roommate in the summer time. We all joked and all
that. To hear the devastating news at the beginning of the season, that
motivated me more to prepare for the season.  
  
Q. Did any of you guys go to talk to him yesterday after practice or before
you left? And what kind of conversation -- what kind of spirits were they at
that point?  
DeWAYNE JACKSON: I talked to him after practice yesterday. He told me he
wasn't feeling well but he was like it's not going to keep him down. He told
me to tell the team to go out and play. He said if we win our first game, his
parents -- he might still make it to the second game.  
  
Q. How did you guys decide to honor him by wearing the number on your
jersey? Were you thinking about his stuff or how did that come about?  
REGGIE HOLMES: We were thinking about him not being here physically. So we put
a patch on our jerseys spiritually for him.  
TROY SMITH: We know how hard he worked to be on our team. He was our -- he
would do things that none of us would do. He was the guy that couldn't play
after sitting out one year. So for us, it's crazy because we're young and we
think about it -- it hits us at a young age. So it's weird having a teammate
going through what he's going through.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Morgan State student athletes?  
  
Q. This is for Troy. After last year, you know, the questions touched upon
last year's experience at the NCAA tournament. But is there a feeling that you
know you want to get that taste out of your mouth, losing to Oklahoma the way
that happened? And I mean it's a tough test, number two seed here. And how do
you rally against a West Virginia?  
TROY SMITH: Like I say, you have to come prepared and do what you do. Last
year it was Blake Griffin. He was the number one pick. He's Superman. This
year, you know, we play basketball, we've been playing basketball just as long
as the next person. So we just trying to come in here and do what we do; not
focus on what they do. Focus on what we do and try to execute our plan.  
  
Q. This is for anybody who wants to answer it: The fact that Ameer (Ali)
won't play tomorrow, how does that affect -- how do you think that will affect
you? I mean it obviously takes one guy away in your rotation. Is that a
potential problem?  
TROY SMITH: No. I mean, of course you would like to have him here. But it's
not a problem because we practice hard every day. You know, the other guys
practice for the time and they are trying to play. So, you know, we're going
to be good to go. We're going to be ready to go.  
REGGIE HOLMES: It's all about opportunities. Once you get the opportunity, you
have to make the best of it. One man out, another man's dream, I guess.  
  
Q. The fact -- your bench has been strong this year. The bench has always
gotten somebody to step up, it seems like. Does that give you a comfort zone
there? Did you expect somebody to come in and replace him?  
REGGIE HOLMES: Yes, yes. We lost three of our top scorers last year. And three
more came in. It was just rotation.  
TROY SMITH: Like I say, we practice hard every single day. So just because a
person is not playing as many minutes as the first person doesn't mean he's
not prepared, you know?  
THE MODERATOR: Time for two more questions.  
  
Q. For each of -- maybe this one for you Reggie and the next. What's your
relationship with Coach Bozeman? What has he meant to you in your development?
And then for you two: How much did you know about his background back at Cal
and that kind of stuff? And again how much has he meant to you?  
REGGIE HOLMES: I mean, I knew about his background. There was no need to talk
about it. Because I knew it. He means a lot to me. Since day one, since I was
a freshman. Good times, bad times. If I'm doing good, he's still trying to add
to my game. Since day one he always told me shoot a throw or drive to the
hole. He changed my game.  
Made me add the mid-range. Made me a better player.  
DeWAYNE JACKSON: I really didn't know about his background. But he means a lot
to me because he was the really the only coach that really took me in. That's
why I'm really at Morgan.  
  
Q. What do you mean took you in?  
DeWAYNE JACKSON: I'm at Morgan. He's the only coach that really talked --
other schools could talk, but they weren't really doing.  
TROY SMITH: For me, I was going to come here as a freshman with Reggie. I took
another approach. I wanted to go to college and do the right thing. I looked
at it wrong because he was the perfect guy. These two years I became a much,
much better leader. I owe that to him. My teammates, they kind of might not
like me but they respect me because of what I'm trying to do. The approach I
have is really the kind of approach, one way, the straight way, the right way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Appreciate your time. Before we get started
with Coach Bozeman, I want to introduce the Morgan State Sports Information
staff that's here.  
Leonard Haines and Kevin Page are down here, far left here. If you have any
other needs for Morgan State, folks, you can see them. Coach Bozeman, if you
want to open with a statement, and then we'll take questions after that.  
COACH BOZEMAN: In the words of Jay-Z, "what you want me to do, I'm sorry, I'm
back."  
No, this is an honor and a privilege. Just excited about being at the
tournament. Excited for my guys. Because as college athletes, college
basketball players, this is what you want -- every year the beginning of the
season, it's everyone's goal to get to the NCAA tournament. So Morgan State
four years ago when we came here, no one expected a whole lot, except the
president, because when he hired me, he expected me get to the tournament. But
no one expected a whole lot. And guys like Reggie Holmes and Kevin Thompson
and Troy Smith and those guys to come in and accept the vision that we put
forth and to be committed to the work that we said that you had to do to get
there, for those guys to believe in that, because it wasn't anything tangible
for them to hold on to when we first got Morgan, in terms of success on the
basketball floor, for it to come to fruition now is -- you know, it's an
unbelievable feeling. It's like having children and telling them if you study
hard, you can be anything you want to be. It's kind of like being Barack's
mother and telling her you can be the President of the United States, and for
him to believe it and then to achieve it, I mean there's nothing better as a
parent and as a leader and as a coach for kids to be able to follow through
with those kind of things and to fight through adversity.  
This year has been -- always tell them that success is lonely, and a lot of
times people don't understand the things that you go through. But this team
has been through an awful lot from the beginning of the school year when Ameer
Ali's father committed suicide, Troy Smith's daughter, who was born blind, had
a tumor and had to have it removed, and then Anthony Anderson, our first day
of practice, he had to sit out all last year just imagine waiting for
Christmas, and then Christmas they take it away from you. So our first day of
practice he participated in Midnight Madness. He came and said, "Boze, I'm not
feeling well." They sent him to the trainer, they sent him to the infirmary,
they sent him to the hospital. Later that night he was diagnosed with cancer.
I told the guys at the beginning of the year before it even started when we
first got back to school I told him you have adversity in life. And it's all
how you deal with it. I said we all have it. So everybody is going to have
adversity. It just depends on how you deal with it. You guys are family. You
have to stick together. And it's going to come. And I did not have any idea it
was going to come in those forms. But it came. And the guys persevered.  
We went through all kinds of things during the season. And as I said, Anthony,
it was a tough practice when I told the team on Sunday, and everyone, it was a
very emotional practice, but we practiced. Because I told them that things are
going to happen. But you have to keep your head down. You have to keep
grinding. And they did it. Anthony has been going through chemo. Our first
practice, he sent us a text, all of us and he's told us that he loved us. And
that he wished us well and that remember that we're grinders. That was our
motto from the very first practice or first pre-season conditioning drills. We
said we were grinders. And it is true to form. We are grinders. And we've
grinded out victories, we've grinded out different things during the season.
And Anthony has been a trooper all the way. We took the bus to see him before
he went to the MEAC tournament. He said he wanted to go to the NCAA tournament
guys. Get me there. The fellows all said we're going to get him there. And
they did it. So when you see them hold up the number 4, that's what it's for.
It's for "Big Ant." And I'm just happy to be here. So we'll field the
questions and we're going to -- obviously we're a two seed going against a 15
seed. As I told the guys, the only people that don't have a chance are the
people that are not here. That's the way you have to view it. That's life.
That's my long opening statement. Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions?  
  
Q. Coach, as you're going through litany of people of that have been through
stuff. You skipped over yourself and you've been through your fair share. Did
you doubt that you would be back here?  
COACH BOZEMAN: I also had something this year. My son was undercut playing for
his high school team. Had to get six staples and had swelling around his brain
and a bruise. So I had my thing as well.  
But in terms of my professional career, you asked if I ever doubted? No, I
didn't. I really hope it doesn't come off as cocky. I just believed that I
would get back in. I didn't really think that I would have to wait out the
whole sanction, but I did, and I kept my mouth shut. I didn't complain. I
admitted to my faults. I didn't talk about other schools. I didn't compare
myself to other coaches. I didn't say, well, this guy does this, that, this
and the third. I didn't do that. And I did that for a reason. Because I wanted
to be able to be an example for kids down the line. You want kids to be able
to admit their faults. And you want people to be able to accept the fact that
we're not all perfect. And so when you take that approach, you have to
understand that there's going to be consequences for your actions. And I took
the consequences for my actions. You know, I would like to think that I moved
past that. You are talking about almost 16 years ago. And to still be held
accountable for that. It would be different if I didn't pay the price for it.
It would be different if I continued to say, I didn't do it, I didn't say
that. I said I did it. I took the responsibility for it. I didn't put anybody
else's name in it. I took sole responsibility. I'm the head coach. I did it.
And I moved on. So -- and the harder part is to see other folks come through
things like that and to be able to get back to doing life as normal.  
Now, obviously I'm not as attractive as Martha Stewart. But she had her thing
and is back. And Steve Jobs from Apple had his deal and he's back. You just
want to be able to continue to move forward now. So that's all I ask. But I
use that with the guys as well. I tell the guys that they all know my story. I
tell them that I made a bad judgment decision. There's consequences for your
actions. I tell them that now. You think before you do things. I said
sometimes people think more about what they're going to eat than whether
they're going to put a seatbelt on in the car. So I use it as an experience,
even for my children as well. My son is fine. He had to sit out for a whole
month. He's fine. He's here on a trip with us. So he's fine. But as I tell
them, things are going to happen. It's all how you deal with it. Will
determine your fate or level of success.  
  
Q. Todd, on your own personal journey, what was the darkest moment for you
and what's the brightest moment?  
COACH BOZEMAN: Believe it or not, it was really tough. Like I said, there was
two people that believed I would get back in. Me and my father. And only one
of us is here. My darkest moment was seeing him on that bed and knowing that
man, this cat is not going to be here when I get back in. I will never, ever,
ever -- I think about it every single day. Every single day, I think about it
that he's not here. And he didn't see me get back on the sideline. So all the
tough times -- yeah, I had people that wouldn't take my phone calls and the
like. When I was trying to get back in. I don't hold any grudges, because at
that time, that's what they felt. I couldn't be mad at anybody. Even any of my
friends that didn't hire me. I don't hold any grudges because they have to do
what they have to do to protect their own interests. And I understand that. I
knew if I kept knocking at the door, someone would give me a chance. I just
needed one. I didn't need 20. I just needed one. That's all I wanted to do.
Like I said, I use that with my guys. For us to come to Morgan and to win --
no one thought -- first of all, no one thought I would get back in. I had
close friends that said, hey, look, dude, do something else. Try something
else. I said I'm going to get back in. And then to get back in and people, no
one expected to us win in Morgan.  
I'm not that guy you can tell I can't do something. I'm going to put the time
into it and I'm going to keep my head -- my nose to the grind and, you know, I
just believe this is a country that you can do that. You can have success if
you put the time into it. But, you know, not everyone -- maybe is not willing
to go through that. I sat out ten years. So when people talk about it and act
like it was nothing, ten years to have the same fire, to work pharmaceuticals,
Coach AAU, I went from coaching a PAC-10 team to coaching a nine-under to have
a parent tell me how to coach the team. I didn't say anything. I just said
okay. I'll take that into consideration. We would come back to practice and
coached all the way up to 15-years-olds. I did color commentating. I put the
time in.  
They can say what they want I should still be out or have a chance to get back
in. I volunteered at high schools, girls' programs, college, junior college
programs. I did so many clinics, I couldn't even begin to tell you. I did free
clinics, I went to camp. Sponsored kids to go to camp. I sponsored over 50, 60
kids to go my camp during the summer. Disadvantaged kids. I put the time in.
They can't tell me I didn't. That's the way that I view it. I guess that's not
necessarily my darkest moment, to answer your question.  
  
Q. Your brightest moment?  
COACH BOZEMAN: My brightest moment was one getting the opportunity to coach.
And then the first game, I can't tell you how excited I was, at East Carolina.
I was so excited. The team -- I didn't -- really didn't even say anything to
them. I just cried. I said, my dad, if he was alive, he would be here. Come
on, let's go play. That was pretty much it.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at playing West Virginia to speak of adversity, I think
Reggie put it best when he was asked what he thinks about West Virginia, and
then immediately went to Da'Sean Butler. How good are they? And how good is he
and how do you hope to contain him, especially in the clutch?  
COACH BOZEMAN: He's very good. He's one of the top players in the country.
He'll play 82 games next year. As far as the team goes, you have to really
start with Hugs. I've known Huggs -- I've known Huggs for years. Coached
against him when I was at California. His team is always aggressive, physical,
tough. That's how they play. They will wear you down. They will beat you up,
so to speak. I don't mean that in a negative way, but they're a tough team.
They're a tough-minded team. And he coaches them like that. So I mean they're
a top ten team. Should have been a number one pick -- number one seed. And I
mean, they take you out of what you want to do offensively. And they push the
ball at you.  
So, it's a challenge. But that's what this is all about. Who doesn't have a
challenge? So, you know, every team whether you're a top team or whether
you're a lower-seeded team, you have a challenge. Because you have a challenge
to respond. Because every team here earned a right to be here. So -- and
that's the beauty of this competition, the tournament, is that on any given
night anybody can beat anybody. And you are allowed to dream here. You are
allowed to dream at the beginning of the year and you can dream again when you
get here. And then it's all about getting out on the floor and playing.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, can you draw any comparisons from playing -- being the
15th seed last year and facing Oklahoma, and might that help the guys who were
there last year?  
COACH BOZEMAN: The difference is Superman was here last year. So we went up
against Superman and we did not have any Kryptonite. But in terms of drawing a
comparison and how it might help us, I spent the first couple of years trying
to explain to these guys the beauty of going to the NCAA tournament. And the
excitement and the emotion that they would feel. And I couldn't do it justice.
I said, I tell you what, get there and you'll see what I'm talking about. So
last year, the whole experience of people on the baseline and -- I mean the
media completely filling both baselines, 19-, 20,000 fans, the police escorts,
the fans at the hotel want to get their autographs, they all said it to me to
a man, each one came and said, "Boze, you were right. This is an unbelievable
feeling and experience." I knew having guys returning that they would want to
drink from that cup again. So that's where we draw from.  
It's more of a business approach this year. They're not wide-eyed, goggle-eyed
and all that stuff. You can see how they are walking and how they talk. That
part of it makes a difference.  
  
Q. Coach, DeWayne mentioned the physicality and something that stood out
about West Virginia. You're a physical team also. Do you try to match that or
do you look for something else, some other way to attack?  
COACH BOZEMAN: It's funny that you say that. Because I think that that's going
to tell a tale in the game, because the nation knows how physical West
Virginia is. The nation doesn't know how physical Morgan State is. Our
conference, they treat us like that and they say we're physical. So if the
officials look at it and they're going to say, well, both teams are physical,
we're going to let it go, fine. They might say, West Virginia, we already know
you're physical. Morgan, you can't play physical like that. That's a
difference. So that's a point of emphasis for sure. But he mentioned the
physicalness of it just so we are aware of it. Not that we're intimidated by
it.  
  
Q. Do you think the schedule you played this year has prepared you for this
step, this competition?  
COACH BOZEMAN: Well, first of all many you didn't say where you were from? The
Baltimore sun? I think I know you.  
Well, we schedule games all around the country. And we're going to approach
this game like we would if we scheduled it during the regular season. So
during the course of the year, especially I'm going to use Reggie because he's
been here the whole time. We've beaten Arkansas, Maryland, DePaul, Marshall.
Those are all conferences that are the major conferences. Towson, bracket-
buster game. We've traveled around the country.  
We played Louisville, Utah, we've played them all. As many as we could. That's
what that was for, to prepare for situations like this. Unlike other teams, a
lot of teams in our league, that's what we try to do, we try prepare for
moments like this, and not just take guaranteed games just to take them. We're
trying to prepare ourselves for something bigger down the road.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke of those ten years and the time that you had people
around you. Can you speak to what Billy Kennedy did for you and kind of --
he's also playing in this tournament. And kind of him being a friend there for
you.  
COACH BOZEMAN: BK is definitely one of my closest friends. I love the guy. I'm
really happy for him and his success. And during that time, I've stayed in
touch with all my assistant coaches, my managers, players. So many
administrators. The marketing director that was at Cal at the time. Kelly
Wilder and her family. Melvin Wilder who is the ticket lady there. I stay in
touch with all those people. All of those people helped to keep me -- I mean
to keep things as normal as possible in terms of our friendships and our
relationships. BK was definitely one of those. We had to play this year in the
bracket-buster. Immediately both of us texted each other and said, I hate that
we have to play. Because I would never play him. I would never play my friends
like that, closest friends anyway. So it was tough. But I'm really happy for
him. He's done a great job at Murray State. If I had to vote, he's the coach
of the year for mid-majors at least. No less than that. He's done a great job.
I wish him well against the volunteers. He's -- not volunteers, the Vandy's.
He's got a tough draw as well. But I think he's up to the challenge. He called
me during that time and he called me during that time and always told me he
was saying prayers for me and my family. I've always been appreciative of him
for that.  
  
Q. How is your approach to recruiting changed? Like you say, you went from
Cal where you basically kind of just auditioned people. Everybody knows who
you are. Everybody wants to go PAC-10. And then to a place like Morgan, where
-- how have you changed as a recruiter? What's the recruiting change been?  
COACH BOZEMAN: Well, I still look for the same type of guys. There's a
grittiness, a toughness, there's a resiliency I look for in players. And I
don't always just look for the guys score the most. I look for little
intangibles. I look for things that are similar to myself. I want guys that
can fight through things, fight through adversity. Even at Cal I recruited
guys that weren't necessarily I'm going to say hype guys. That Jason wasn't a
hype guy. Jason was I'm coming and building my own thing. LaMond Murray, Al
Grigsby; those guys were like that. At Morgan when I first got there,
interesting you ask me that, I had a coach call me and said I have a player. I
said who did he play for -- it was another friend in another conference
considered higher than Morgan. He said, no, no, no, he can't play for him. He
can't play for you -- he can play for you. I said I don't want him. I want
guys that can play at a high level but can do something different and do
something special. We had a heated conversation. And so I said I'm not going
to recruit like that. I don't take calls when people say he can play in the
MEAC. That's not what I want. We're not preparing for the MEAC; we're
preparing for something higher than that. We are recruiting different than
that. Guys like Kevin Johnson, Reggie, Holmes, DeWayne Jackson, Troy Smith,
those guys were recruited by other people but they wanted to come and do
something different. That's kind of the approach we take and it's been
successful for us.  
  
Q. Has it changed your perspective? In other words, when you were at Cal,
may look at the Morgans of the world one way, as kind of gator bait. You know?
Then when you get to a place like Morgan, you may look at things differently.
I'm wondering, do you look at the world a little differently now than maybe
you did when you were in the PAC-10?  
COACH BOZEMAN: I have an appreciation for the fact that it is different. It's
two different levels. But I don't have a difference in how I approach the type
of guys I want or the goals that we set. And so the type of kids that you
bring in, they're still basically the same. I mean, I can tell you there's a
lot of similarities between -- not necessarily game-wise, between Reggie
Holmes and Jason Kidd in terms of their competitiveness, in terms of how
competitive they are. So those are things that are very, very similar that I
look for. And yeah, it is a little different because of the pool that I have
to pick from. I can't tell you how many high-level recruits that I know and
know their families well. But I would never even bother them because I know
that's not where they're going to come. But there is a segment there that I
can recruit from. And that's what I focus on. I focus on that segment. I
wouldn't go -- go to one of those guys and say come to Morgan when I know they
have an opportunity to play like North Carolina or something like that, or
Georgetown or Maryland in our area. So I wouldn't necessarily do that. An
alumni kept telling me we want to beat Maryland. You guys don't understand.
There's a difference when you visit that locker room in Maryland and you go
visit our locker room at Morgan State. There's a clear difference. I'm not
oblivious to that fact. I've been on that other side before.  
  
Q. When was the last time you talked to Anthony? Do you have anything
special planned?  
COACH BOZEMAN: I saw him the day -- the 15th. I saw him the day before we
left. It's when I gave him the game ball and I gave him a T-shirt and I gave
him a hat before that. His mom told me yesterday that if he felt better, that
they would drive up. So, that's kind of -- that was the last time I saw him.
But he was asleep. His dad was in there. His dad was asleep on the couch. He
wasn't feeling well that day. That's what I told him the day before. I told
his dad.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Appreciate it. We have Missouri here at 12:05.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the second half of our
day-long interview processions here. Joined by Gonzaga student athletes.
Closest to me Matt Bouldin, Steven Gray and Elias Harris. Welcome to Buffalo,
guys. We welcome Gonzaga, the eighth seed, 26-6 making their twelfth NCAA
appearance. They'll take questions at that time.  
  
Q. For Matt, what's the take and what's the feeling after the St. Mary's
loss?  
MATT BOULDIN: That St. Mary's loss, it hurt pretty bad. We looked at it as an
opportunity to improve on things. We struggled late in the season. It gives us
a chance to respond. Something we've been really, really good at this entire
year. So we look at it as a chance to respond and just get back out here.  
  
Q. Elias, can you talk about the challenge facing Florida State when you
have a team like that with that many shot blockers, big trees in the middle;
how does that force you to change your game offensively?  
ELIAS HARRIS: I don't think we need to change our game. We need to stick to
our game plan and not changing our game.  
  
Q. For any of you, maybe Steven first, how do these guys compare with who
you guys have played, maybe the Wake Forest or Cincinnati, Michigan State-type
team?  
STEVEN GRAY: Those teams definitely, and then a lot with Memphis because
they're so athletic and they really get out and pressure you on defense. We
know they're definitely an athletic team that offensive rebounds really well.
So I mean those are going to be the two -- we have to slow down and not let
them hurry us up on offense. Make sure we block out and rebound like we did at
the start of this year. So I think definitely those athletic, physical teams
that we faced earlier in the year definitely remind us of Florida State.  
THE MODERATOR: Matt, Elias, anything to add to that?  
MATT BOULDIN: I agree with Steve. Just those athletic teams. Cincinnati in
terms of offensive rebounding, so they rebound the ball so well.  
  
Q. Their defense is well-known. You guys know the field goal percentages and
all the stats. What are the keys offensively to attack, to be able to score
against these guys for Elias and maybe Matt?  
ELIAS HARRIS: Well, I think just like I said, we shouldn't change our game
plan. We need to attack the basket, play hard, play together, play as a team
to be successful at the end.  
MATT BOULDIN: I think games like this we need to execute really well. I mean,
teams that really get after it defensively, you have to play hard and execute.
And definitely run. We need to keep running like we have been all season. So
they don't get a chance to really, you know, get in their set D's as well.  
  
Q. Matt, maybe if there's one team in this tournament that could handle a
2,300 mile trip, it's you guys. You guys are so used to it the way your
schedule has gone this year and many years. Teams in the East don't do nearly
the amount of traveling as you guys do. What are the keys to having success on
the road when dealing with all the travel you guys are going through all the
time?  
MATT BOULDIN: I really think we've been better on the road this year. But I
think some keys would be obviously rest. We try to rest up as much as we can,
drink a lot of water. And then going with the right mind-set. We go in with
these games on the road. Like you said, we've been in many of them before. We
just go with the right mind-set. Go in there and know it's going to be a
battle. Yeah, just really tough-minded.  
  
Q. Really, for Steven or Matt, the tradition, the NCAA tradition that
Gonzaga has established, this being your twelfth straight appearance, there's
got to be an expectation of being just more than a one-and-done type thing. Do
you feel the pressure of that tradition? And maybe not the pressure, but the
responsibility to uphold the tradition that's been established for Gonzaga?  
STEVEN GRAY: You know, you want to represent your school and the program in
the best possible way. Expectations are all fine and good. People can expect
you to do whatever. But it comes down to the game. As long as we go out there
and play hard and, you know, it's clearly visible that you know we're giving
everything that we have, you know we're going out there and not surrendering
or rolling over. Just playing with that tough-minded mind-set that Matt talks
about. Just going out there and doing the things that we're capable of doing,
I don't think people can really expect any more than that. And so I think, you
know, with this team, you know, that makes it pretty simple. As long as we go
out there and play hard, that's all anyone can really ask from us or that we
can ask from ourselves. So I don't think that there's a pressure or a
responsibility past that.  
  
Q. Just as follow-up, Matt talked about how much the St. Mary's loss stung.
Was that more of a factor of you guys losing that game the way you played or
in part -- maybe you can't speak for Matt, but was that also part of the
responsibility of upholding Gonzaga's tradition to a certain degree or was
that just stinging because of the way you guys lost?  
STEVEN GRAY: I think it was more stinging in how we lost that game. It was a
close game up until the nine-minute mark or something. And then as a team we
just pretty much just crumbled. And so I think that's what stung more, is the
fact we didn't finish the game out playing hard and playing like we had been
the majority of the year.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student athletes from Gonzaga?
Thanks for your time. Good luck. Coach Mark Few joins us now. His number-
eighth-seeded Gonzaga, 26-6. Twelfth consecutive NCAA appearances. Happy to
have you here. Go ahead and make an opening statement.  
COACH FEW: We're happy to be here. I speak for my players and staff and all of
Gonzaga. It's a thrill to be involved in the NCAA tournament again for the
twelfth consecutive year. And I just think of all the neat things we've been
able to accomplish at Gonzaga, that's probably the thing we're most proud of.
It's the greatest sporting event in the world. And to be involved in it again,
and out here in Buffalo is a very big deal, and especially for this group that
we started the year with.  
This is probably the least experienced group of guys we've ever embarked on a
season with. They've really grown a lot during the course of this year and
developed a lot, and it's something we're very proud of and obviously want to
keep playing our best basketball and keep this thing going.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up to questions.  
  
Q. As much as your team and players are happy to be here, some of your
players expressed a lot of disappointment after that St. Mary's game. Steven
Gray, I think, said, "we crumbled." There's just a lot of -- they're stung. Is
it good to be motivated in that sense, to know what you did wrong? Not good to
come off a loss like that, but I guess they're not happy.   
COACH FEW: Yeah, I mean, I've been around here the last ten days. I don't
sense that. No, I mean, you're going to be motivated to play in the NCAA
tournament no matter what. I don't care if you came off a loss, a win, a
buzzer-beater, a forfeit. You're going to be very, very motivated to play in
the NCAA tournament. So I don't really think anything that happened prior to
this might have -- it might have helped for the first couple of days of
practice. We have had a little bit of time off. That's probably the extent of
that.  
  
Q. A dozen straight years in the tournament is obviously a great
accomplishment. How much has that made your job easier? And can you compare
what it is now to what it was then?  
COACH FEW: I mean, it's changed. Just look at the enrollment of our school.
Prior to our first appearance 12 years ago, I think we had an enrollment of
about 2,800. Now it's over 7,000. You know, there's a lot of things. We built
a brand new arena. We've made steps every year. The school, the leadership of
the school, from the president, the board of trustees to the athletic
director, Mike Roth, down to myself, it's been a very cohesive unit that kind
of understands that if you can invest in your basketball program, that it can
kind of be a big giant window or door for a bunch of people to see into your
university and can go from there. So a lot of changes since then. A lot of
things still the same.  
  
Q. Coach, there's a great deal of interest in your team. You have four
Canadians on your roster. I'm curious, what's happening in Canada that's
making it such an attractive place to recruit talent? There's 75 players from
Canada; what's going on that makes Canada an attractive place to look for
talent?  
COACH FEW: I think there's a lot good players. They're playing a lot more
basketball. Playing a lot of basketball early. You know, I think there's a lot
of good coaches up there that are helping these guys play basketball early and
develop them. There aren't many secrets now in Division I or especially with
all the AAU things and international competitions going on. So there's a good
player somewhere, you know, all of us Division I coaches are going to find out
about it and go up there and -- it's and it's such an easy adjustment, I
think, for a Canadian player to come to the States and play, a lot of good
players.  
  
Q. Obviously their defense is what they've kind of prided themselves on.
What do you want to see from your guys offensively to be able to attack them?
And is it important to stick to what you've done this year or do you have to
alter a lot of things?  
COACH FEW: No, we're not going to alter -- you are who you are this time of
year. We've been pretty, pretty darn effective all season on the offensive
end. It might not have been pretty or aesthetically pleasing but at the end of
the day we've been pretty efficient with our numbers. It's going to be hard.
It's going to be hard to consistently generate baskets against this type of
defense, big, long, athletic, physical they are. I think that's a big key to
the game. But I think we've got to get stops on the offensive end to try to
get our break going. And then also do a good job on both -- the defensive
glass to get a break going and also the offensive glass to get some easy
baskets there.  
  
Q. Mark, you came 2,300 miles to this sub-regional. That's not anything new
for your program with the schedule you play. Eastern teams, we cover road
trips, it's a hop and a skip. You guys do these kind of things a lot. How do
you get your guys in the mindset to make these long trips and really thrive on
them and do well?  
COACH FEW: We start early in the season. We -- second game of the year we flew
to East Lansing and put our guys in a pretty tough environment there at the
Breslin Center against a very good Michigan State team. I knew right then and
there we were going to learn a lot about ourselves. These guys battled and
battled down to the last possession. We ended up losing. But I think it really
helped us. Whether it's flying to Maui or flying to Memphis or flying to
Madison Square Garden, you know, we try to play in a lot of these games. The
reason I do it is to help prepare us for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. In following up -- I'm sorry -- in following up on the recruiting
question, you stayed among the nation's top programs without recruiting some
of the nation's top high school players. What's your recruiting philosophy?
And how do you find the Gonzaga players, so to speak?  
COACH FEW: I mean, I think evaluating is a huge, huge part of recruiting. A
lot of times in the evaluation process, maybe there's better players out
there, or players that can develop into great college players that weren't on
those lists that you mentioned that were evaluated by other people other than
college coaches that put them on that list in the first place.  
I think evaluation is key. I think finding the right fit that fits into how
you want to play, and then I'm very, very big. Our staff is very big on player
development. I think once you get to a school, we try to make them better, and
try to tap out their potential as best we can while they're with us.  
  
Q. You hear coaches a lot say from smaller conferences that when they get
good, it's harder to get better teams to play them. How are you able to get
these top teams on your schedule year in and year out?  
COACH FEW: I just think we've proven out over the years, you know, and so it's
been pretty -- especially the last five or six years, it's been very easy to
schedule and do whatever we need to do in that area. TV has been great to us.
All the major tournaments have been great. So it's easy. The problem I have is
sometimes we overdo it and play too many of these tough ones, to be quite
honest with you, when we need to probably mix in a couple of easy ones at
home.  
  
Q. Coach -- I'm sure your expectations probably haven't changed since you've
gotten there, been there, but have you noticed -- how have you noticed that
expectations outside the program from the public, from the fans and you
touched on TV, how they've changed in regards to Gonzaga?  
COACH FEW: It's changed drastically. It used to be -- and again, I'm speaking
from that perspective, not from mine and our programs -- to us it's still a
very, very big deal to win our league championship. And I think to a lot of
people they expect that. And it's kind of ho-hum. And it's kind of -- to us,
as I said earlier, it's a thrill to be involved in the NCAA tournament.  
People that follow us, the fans, and things like that, I think they're upset
with an eighth seed. And so that's where the expectations are. But that's
fine. I think that's not such a bad thing. As long as you don't let it affect
your player's mind-set or burden them in any way with any kind of pressure.
It's better than the alternative which is apathy. We have great interest in
our program nationwide. Obviously if they have those kind of expectations,
those can be a good thing in some ways.  
  
Q. Just as a follow-up, you touched on it, I mean, people are wondering why
you're the eighth seed. Yet how do you deal with the pressures now of being an
eighth seed? And still facing the outside expectations where people want you
to go to the Sweet 16 or the Elite Eight this year. I'm sure they are your
expectations. You know what -- maybe you know what I'm saying.  
COACH FEW: Yeah. I keep it pretty simple in my life. I don't really deal with
anybody else other than my family and close friends. I'm not a big computer
guy. I really don't delve into that world. Like everybody is finding out this
morning or early this afternoon, no matter what game you play in this
tournament, it's going to be a hard one and a tough one. If you're not ready
to go and if you're not playing your best basketball, you're probably putting
yourself in position to get beat. Seedings, location, all that stuff gets
thrown out the window and your team has to play. We've been in this thing long
enough. We understand that and our players understand it.  
  
Q. You were asked more generally about Canadians before. How about your four
specifically? How have they progressed this year?  
COACH FEW: Very well. Very well. I think Robert Sacre has had -- made a huge
jump from where he was at as a freshman through his red shirt year where he
was injured last year. He's really, really had a fine year for us this year.
You know, losing Manny hurts us. Manny was really coming on and doing a great
job pursuing the basketball. And knocking down shots. And Kelly, Kelly has had
some very good minutes for us, played in important minutes for us. And Bol
Kong has played good minutes for us. Hit big shots and made great plays
throughout the year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

### [Demontez Stitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18405)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by student athletes from the Clemson Tigers who come
into Buffalo as number seven seed. 21-10. Closer to me Trevor Booker and next
to him is Demontez Stitt. We will open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Hi, Trevor. The Missouri players say they know you because you played for
them last year under a different name. His name was DeMarre Carroll. They
think that your game is a lot like his. Do you? Are you familiar with what he
did?  
TREVOR BOOKER: I know he was a hustle player. I mean that's the only thing I
really know about him. I mean, I go hard. I try to hustle. But that's really
the only thing I know about him.  
  
Q. They called him "Junk Yard Dog." As a man in the middle, I mean there's
guys that are a lot taller than you, obviously. What makes you so successful
in the middle?   
TREVOR BOOKER: Well, I try use my strength, and like I said, I hustle, I try
to go hard into the other player. I know a lot of people say I'm undersized.
But I just put that in the back of my mind and let it motivate me.  
  
Q. Trevor, do you think Missouri has an advantage and coach worked with you
in the World University Games tryouts. He says he knows you a little bit.  
TREVOR BOOKER: I don't think so. He coached me probably one or two scrimmages
down there. He didn't get to see too much. I didn't think about that he could
end up playing against me. But I don't think they have an advantage.  
  
Q. With Missouri's injuries, both with Justin Safford being out with an ACL
and also it was revealed that Laurence Bowers is playing with that pretty
serious wrist injury, how important will it for to get Trevor in the offense
and keep him involved as the game goes on?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I think it's going to be very important to get the ball
inside. They are going to be scrambling around a lot, doing a lot of trapping.
Sort of like we do. But from what we've seen on film, from what I've seen on
film, if we get the ball to Trevor on the inside, I don't think that they have
the post presence to guard him, and if they do double down, we have to be
ready to make shots on the perimeter.  
THE MODERATOR: Trevor, your thoughts?  
TREVOR BOOKER: Like you said, I think it's an important part to the game just
to get the ball down low, I know they like to pressure the ball. I mean if we
get it down low they're probably going to double team. I have to be ready to
pass the ball out and trust my teammates.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about two things: One, the idea that teams that press
don't like to be pressed? And the other one, do you have any concerns that it
might be a really tightly officiated game with lots of fouls and that sort of
thing?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: We can't really worry about the officiating. We just have to
see how the officiating goes as the game goes. But as far as teams that press
don't usually like to be pressed, I mean, we've been playing high speed the
whole year since I've been at Clemson. We always played at high speed. So I
believe that I mean we're going to be ready for their pressure just as well as
they are. It depends on what team imposes their will on the other team.  
Like I said, we are used to playing at this pace. We're used to playing a fast
pace. So I think if we just control the ball, I mean push it, as coach has
been talking about pushing it intelligently, knowing when to pick and choose,
when to attack and not to attack, making the smart play, I think we'll be all
right.  
  
Q. Just for both guys, third straight year here in the tournament, still
looking to get out of this first round. What is the experience the last two
years taught you about coming into this game?  
TREVOR BOOKER: The experience for me, just got to play 40 minutes. You can't
play one-half and expect to cruise to the next -- through the next half. I
know my sophomore year we played Villanova and had them up 17 at the half and
they came back and ended up beating us. We have to play 40 minutes.  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Pretty much basically the same thing. I mean since I've been
here we've been to the tournament twice. This is the third year. I mean both
of those years, I mean I felt we could have won both of those games if we
would have played Clemson basketball throughout the whole 40 minutes. Like
Booker just said. I mean we're more experienced now. Some of the guys, we're a
more experienced team. We've been here. Some of the younger guys we have to
put them along and help them recognize the significance of this game.  
  
Q. Demontez, so much of this game is probably going to be about ball
security. Both teams like to force a lot of turnovers. How important is it to
take care of the ball knowing that you got a guy like Trevor inside to go to
on offense?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: It's very important for us to, like I said earlier, to control
the ball. I mean these last couple of practices we've been working on pushing
the ball, I mean working against pressure. But at the same time when you push,
you have to be aware that guys are going to be running behind you, trying to
tip the ball. They're going to try to speed you up. And half court offense is
very important to keep your poise. Just looking at some of the teams on film
that sort of kept their poise, they did a better job against Missouri and
their pressure. Controlling the ball and limiting turnovers and getting the
ball inside I think that's going to be the key for us to win this game.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the ACC being down. There's one poll or
something where no one felt Duke could even make the Final Four. Is there a
little bit of resentment among the players and teams you think trying to prove
it's not quite that way in the ACC?  
TREVOR BOOKER: I think so. I think every ACC team that's in the tournament is
going to try to prove them wrong. If you're in that conference, you don't want
to hear that type of stuff. So you try to go out and prove everybody wrong.  
  
Q. Guys, Demontez, particularly you, you talked about teams that had success
against Missouri, and you're right, teams of that slowed them down. Can you
really imagine -- you guys aren't going to turn into Nebraska all of sudden,
are you?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: No, like I said, pushing the ball intelligently. Just limiting
turnovers.  
When I say controlling the ball as far as that, that doesn't necessarily mean
slowing the game down and running at a slow speed. Just we got to be able to
limit our turnovers and get the ball inside. We don't want to come down and
shoot up a lot of quick shots. That's what we want teams to do, because we
play at that pace. Watching it on films that's what they want teams to do so
they can get out on breaks. Bad offense turns into good offense for them. I
mean, controlling the ball I mean doesn't necessarily mean not attacking.
Coach wants us to attack. I mean but we want to limit our turnovers and get
the ball inside.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Clemson student athletes?  
  
Q. This is for Demontez. Do you kind of favor the pace of the game that's
going to be tomorrow? High paced game? It seems like you guys have struggled
when it's been half court, kind of slow it down pace that's got you guys into
that sort of offense.  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Yeah. Me and Andre are going to push the ball all night. This
is the type of game that I personally like to be in, up-and-down game. Guys
are going to be scrambling everywhere on both ends, for us and for them. So
it's going to be a type of game that's going to be fun, it's going to be high
intensity. But basically it's going to come down to the team that keeps their
composure and the team that imposes their will on the other team and which
team, you know, breaks.  
  
Q. Demontez, will we see more of you and Andre together on the court and
have the ball to sort of control the pressure?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I'm not exactly sure. You have to ask Coach that. It will
probably be most likely we'll probably be on the court together a lot like
we've been doing. But who knows, Coach may change up the game plan and have us
on the court a little bit more to have two quick ball handlers on the court to
sort of break those traps. I guess only Coach knows that.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks. We're joined now by Clemson Head Coach
Oliver Purnell. Tigers come in the seventh seed. 21-10. Welcome to Buffalo,
Coach. We will go ahead and have you make an opening statement and then we'll
take questions.  
COACH PURNELL: We're extremely pleased to be representing Clemson here in the
first round of the NCAA tournament. As I think about -- think back on the
year, the thing that stands out to me is how tough it is to get here from the
ACC. We've got a great league. We beat up on each other coming down the
stretch of the season. And you've just got to kind of hang in there and
obviously you've got to win. But you've got to hang in there and do a good
job. I thought our non-conference schedule was also very tough, starting way
back with the tournament out in California, with a number of teams that are
now in the NCAA tournament. And then getting into the early ACC season
schedule, I thought our guys were resilient. We went through some difficult
times, went through some challenging games. But our guys really do enjoy and
get up for big games. And for the most part, they distinguish themselves very
well in those big games. We've got one coming now. Doesn't get much bigger
than this from the standpoint that you're in the first round of the NCAA
tournament.  
If you want to compete for the national championship, you have to find a way
to get through this game. Our guys were disappointed the last couple of years
when we went out in the first round. I'm hoping that will be motivation for
us, as we prepare for this game. And as we play this game, that our guys want
to stay here for a while and move on and stay in the tournament for as long as
we possibly can. And I think the obvious thing is to win that first game and
see what happens.  
  
Q. You obviously like to play at a fast pace. But could you just talk about
the luxury of having a guy like Booker in the paint when the game does slow
down into a half court situation? And how important is it going to be for him
to get multiple touches in this ballgame for you?  
COACH PURNELL: Well, Trevor is one of the best players in the country. It is a
luxury to have first-team All-ACC player, one of the best in the country. A
guy that can go inside and out. Offensively we like for him to get touches in
the lane. We like to run our offense through him, inside-out. And it creates a
situation where teams have to choose whether to double or triple-team him in
some cases. It presents our other players with opportunities to score. And if
they don't, he's pretty good from a scoring standpoint. So it is a luxury to
have him. If you are leading coming down the stretch, and the team is in a
chase mode, at the end of the shot clock, you want the ball in his hands. If
you are behind in a game when the clock is winding down the last six, seven
minutes of the ballgame, you want to score when the clock is stopped.
Obviously, he's a guy that can get you a bucket and get fouled. So it is a
luxury to have him. He's had a great career for us. Not only scoring, but
defensively, passing the basketball and doing so many other things, not to
mention he's won more games than any player in Clemson history. He's probably
the best all-around player that's ever played in Clemson. So it has been nice
to coach him.  
  
Q. You talked about how good your league is. Listen to some of the experts,
you think you guys were the SWAC or something. Because Carolina is down,
that's overstating the idea that this league is down has been overstated?  
COACH PURNELL: Yes, I do. By the way, if you talk to most coaches in our
league, we think Carolina will be right back next year. Yeah, I think that's
the case. That's been the story line so many times this year, whether it be
the print media, talk radio or TV. That's a popular story. So when a story
gets repeated over and over, it can sway the perception of something. And I
think it does sway the perception of our league. Certainly the league numbers-
wise is right in the area it's always been. In the top three, in the RPI and
all of that stuff. If you want to use that.  
So Carolina is down this year. But we've got some excellent teams. They won
the national championship last year. There are a lot of people that feel like
Duke will be in the Final Four this year. So we still have that "premiere
team." But the other teams in this league, trust me, are awfully good.  
I think any of them can beat any other team in the country on a given night.  
  
Q. Oliver, will we see more Andre Young, Demontez in the back court against
this Missouri pressure or not really?  
COACH PURNELL: Yeah, maybe. Maybe. I like that -- we talked all year long, I
like that combination. The concern you would have is the concern that you
always have, is from a stamina standpoint and having both those guys kind of
tuckered out particularly in this kind of game. But it's a one-and-done
situation. If you don't win. So I'm not going to be too worried about stamina
and that kind of thing. If those two -- those two guys obviously make us a
better ball-handling team. Andre and Demontez are two of our better scorers,
so particularly if we're struggling scoring, you'll probably see them more
together.  
  
Q. Coach, both teams play very similar styles. The press, the high-tempo
offense, how do you see this thing matching up against Missouri?  
COACH PURNELL: I think you stated it very well. I think there are a couple of
subtle differences. They probably play a little more zone than we do. They
like zoning out of bounds underneath, anytime the ball is out of bounds
underneath they like the zone. So that puts them in the zone for a few
possessions right there. They can choose to go to that some. We're more of a
post-oriented offense. A low-post-oriented offensive team and they're more
perimeter-oriented. I think those are two subtle differences. But from a
mentality standpoint, we like pressure defense. We like to push the ball on
offense and so do they.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the selection committee, do you think that it's
getting to the point where they've become just sort of infatuated with
statistics, almost to the point of ignoring the old eye test, Mississippi
State being the example this year that clearly seems to be better than, you
know, maybe a dozen or more teams?  
COACH PURNELL: I personally don't think so. I think the committee does a good
job. I think they use -- they use a number of different criteria to make a
decision. I think they line them all out there and then there are some obvious
teams that, you know, go on the board right away. I think we are one of those.
And then they get down to a certain number of teams. And I think they do a
comparison contrast. I think they look -- one of the messages I think that
have been sent for a long time is if you're close, they're going to look at
what you can control in your schedule. I know we pay a lot of attention to
looking at our non-conference schedule feeling like we're in the ACC, so it's
-- it's a high likelihood that we could be closer on the bubble. And if you're
in that situation, you want to make sure that you have every advantage. We've
gone on the road to certain places that I would rather not go, but we've gone
on the road with an eye towards the RPI and the eye towards at the end of the
year, how many road games have you won? That question I think comes up in that
room. And you want the answer to be -- you want that answer to be a positive.
So I think they look at a number of different things. And I think they do --
by and large, I think they do a pretty good job.  
  
Q. How much of an advantage is the fact that this will be an up-tempo game
considering some of the struggles you guys have had in kind of slow-down half
court games like last week at NC State?  
COACH PURNELL: I hope it is. I think you are talking about one of the best, if
not the best pressure team in the country, Missouri. And so it's hard to look
at that as an advantage. The advantage is that maybe we can duplicate in
practice more so than most teams the kind of pressure and the kind of pace
that we'll see. Because we like the up-tempo. We practice it every day. We
press each other every day. We run on each other every day. So we didn't have
to spend a lot of time figuring out how we're going to simulate some of the
things that they do. But they do it better than anybody, and so that means
you're going to have to be effective in what you've done in practice.  
  
Q. Mike Anderson said that the people who say that teams that press don't
like to be pressed probably never played basketball. Do you agree with that
with him, I mean?  
COACH PURNELL: I don't know about whether or not they've ever played
basketball. But I've never felt that way. I think that sometimes when you're
being pressed, it can generate offense for you, as opposed to calling a play
and figuring this out and that. And if you're effective and attacking the
pressure, it can generate offense for you. So we've actually liked teams
pressing us at a certain point, particularly when we're leading in the second
half.  
  
Q. Apologize if this has come up already. The team that you're going to be
facing has -- with the injuries that have occurred, they're a little different
than what you've seen on tape the last course of the season, and possibly
you'll see people that even Missouri fans haven't even seen play whole lot
this year. How do you prepare for that?  
COACH PURNELL: Well, the young -- the really good player, his name escapes me
-- I watched tape with him in the game -- he's a glue -- he's been a glue guy
for them, and so on and so forth. The last three tapes we've seen, he hasn't
been there. We have seen them play without him. So that's the way we're
preparing. We can only watch him on tape. Last three tapes we've seen him,
he's not there. Part -- I think it was an Iowa State game, we watched --
actually watched him get hurt. Which was -- didn't look good. That wasn't nice
to see. So yeah, we've had a chance to look at him that way.  
We understand they have other good players, they're going to plug them in
there. Their style, their philosophy has not changed. Somebody was saying how
much they've struggled and so on and so forth. It's similar to saying we've
struggled. I think you better look at who they're playing before you say
they're struggling. Kansas, Kansas State, they're okay. So I don't view it as
they're struggling. They're certainly adjusting from losing a very good player
and one of their insiders. And we've had to do that this year with Demontez
Stitt. But good teams find a way to adjust. And they move on.  
I don't see them -- we didn't change the way we played when Demontez was out.
Missouri has not changed the way that they play. So we have to approach it
just like the guy was never there, almost.  
  
Q. One quick follow-up. Do you specifically target a game plan to take
advantage of Laurence Bowers' wrist, for instance?  
COACH PURNELL: No, no. I don't think so. I think he's one of their long
insiders that blocks shots and goes to the glass and still runs the floor.
He's so long. So, no, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much. Coach, appreciate your time.  
COACH PURNELL: This has been fun. I hope to see you again soon.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Syracuse, student athletes closest to me, Scoop
Jardine, Wesley Johnson and Andy Rautins. Guys, welcome to Buffalo. We'll go
ahead and open it up to questions.  
  
Q. This is a question for Andy Rautins. As you can imagine, a lot of
Canadians are following the Orange exploits right now. As the son of a
Syracuse Orangeman and as a Canadian, tell me about how significant this
experience is for you in your final season?  
ANDY RAUTINS: It's big. The NCAA tournament itself is a wonderful experience
to be able to represent Canada here. It's also something that's great. I love
to represent my country. Going to be playing against another guy tomorrow in
Joseph, who also represents Canada basketball. So Gonzaga has a few guys who
represent too. So I think Canada is well represented throughout this
tournament.  
  
Q. Andy and Scoop, can you talk about last April when Flynn and Harris and
Devendorf left the program, what was your outlook for the season at that point
in time?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Our main focus was trying to get back to where we are at right
now, NCAA tournament. We lost three of our main starters and we knew Andy had
to come in and play big roles in this year's team. Our main focus was just
working out and getting better, getting stronger in the off season and also
becoming vocal leaders in this team because we lost so much fire power last
year.  
ANDY RAUTINS: I don't think that our confidence ever wavered on this team. I
think we knew we had a ton of talent. But our work ethic was there too.  
When you put all those things together, I think it was a successful team. Last
year we may have had a few more individuals. This year's team is exactly that:
It's a team.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask, do you have a sense that losing those top three
scorers you could be even better coming back?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I don't know. Certainly hurts to lose your top three scorers.
But at the same time it made us into a better team. We have a lot of chemistry
this year. Everybody is always on the same page regardless of what five guys
are on the floor. I think we're a very unselfish team. That's what has made us
so successful.  
  
Q. For all three of you, do you recall that 2005 game against Vermont and
what memories do you have?  
WES JOHNSON: Honestly, I just know that we lost. That's the only thing I know.
I know it's going to be a real big game tomorrow for Coach and I think all of
us coming off a two-game losing streak. So I think it's for us to bounce back.  
ANDY RAUTINS: I certainly recall watching the game, being a hometown kid. I
think all of Syracuse was destroyed by that game. So this is definitely a
little bit -- serves as a little bit of motivation for us, try to redeem
ourselves a little bit, not have any letdowns. We know Vermont is certainly a
great team. We have a hard week of preparation. We have some good practices
in. We're not taking anybody lightly at this point.  
  
Q. Andy, if you have to think of one thing your dad helped you in your
career basketball-wise, what would it be? A particular skill or an attitude he
thought was important to have as a player?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I think the main thing he always reiterated was to stay
confident with myself. Just to keep working as hard as I can. I have the skill
sets and the available tools. I just think the work ethic took me over the
top.  
He's been there since day one for me, whether it be in the gym or the weight
room or just being there for me with some encouraging words. I appreciate
everything he's done for me to get me to this point.  
  
Q. Just talk about, for any of you, being able to play so close to home and
there will be so many of your fans here; does this first round location give
you any type of advantage at all?  
SCOOP JARDINE: It's great to play in front of your hometown crowd. 'Cuse
Nation is going to be out. Buffalo being so close to Syracuse. We love playing
in front of Syracuse fans. It's going to be like a home game for us. We're
going to feed off the crowd as usual. But we've been a good road team as well.
It's an honor to play in front of our hometown crowd.  
  
Q. I know you guys just answered the question about Vermont. From the moment
you saw that pairing come up, you guys probably knew you were going to be
bombarded with questions all week. How exactly did you guys decide to deal
with it, and would you prefer to not hear anymore about it? Does hearing about
it drive you a little bit more for the game?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I mean, it certainly fired us up when we saw that. It's just
another game for us. That's been our motto all season. Look forward to the
next game. I think that's been a huge part of our success is that we haven't
looked forward or looked behind us. Vermont is a great team. We have our
preparation down. We did our scouting. Our coaches did a great job of
preparing us. We're not feeding off the past right now. We're just looking
forward to what we have to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. I guess I'll ask Wes, I assume you saw what happened to Villanova. Does
that get your attention and make you even more aware you can't look past
anybody?  
WES JOHNSON: We did that the whole season. Can't look past anybody. But seeing
that game knowing how the NCAA tournament is, we can't go into this game
looking over anyone. I know Vermont is a great team. We have to go out there
and play our ball. If we don't we can end up losing. Villanova escaped today,
we can be doing the same thing tomorrow. We have to go with a mindset ready to
play.  
  
Q. What do you say to the people who don't believe you deserve this number
one seed based on what happened the last two games of the season?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I think we've proven game in and game out throughout the whole
season that our body of work, you know, certainly got us to where we are right
now. We've been proving people wrong all season. It's nothing new to us at
this point. We're taking it as a little bit of fire right now and using it to
light us up. I think that we have something to prove every game. That's what
we feel like. I think that's what's going to continue to feed our will to win.  
  
Q. We interviewed your dad today in Ottawa, and he was talking about how
much he has enjoyed watching your final year. He played in the tournament
years and years ago. I don't know if you've spoken to him lately. What advice
has he given you?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I think -- he says time and again there's no pressure out here.
Just have fun. You put your work in throughout the season. Now is when it
really matters. So just go out there and play Syracuse basketball. Keep the
theme of being unselfish with the guys. Your hard work and what you've done
all season will take you to where you wind up. Hopefully that's the
championship.  
  
Q. Scoop, coming off the last two losses, what's the mindset of the team?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Basically we are just trying to look forward and look past the
last two losses and get back to playing defense, the defense that got to us
this point as the number one seed. We know now we lose again, we're out. We
have to put the losses behind us and move forward from it and just learn from
our mistakes, which I think we've done. This whole week we had to practice,
get back to our defense and back to the unselfishness that got us to this
point.  
  
Q. This is for Wes or Andy. We're assuming Arinze is not playing tomorrow.
How much of a motivation has it been and has it weighed on your minds that you
guys keep winning there's more of a chance he'll be on the court? How much of
a motivation is that?  
WES JOHNSON: Him being -- his presence is going to carry us. He's getting
better. Unfortunately he's not going to be able to play tomorrow. Him being on
the sideline and being the leader is going to help us. If we keep winning,
he'll eventually get back to playing. Other than that, him being on the
sideline and around us is going to uplift us and really carry us throughout
the tournament, hopefully.  
  
Q. Just talk about Arinze a little bit. What has it been like running your
practices without him, and will we see kind of a different team, I guess,
without having your center tomorrow night?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Arinze has been with us all through practice. Of course, he
hasn't been on the court playing with us, but we play a lot -- our lineup has
been different. We can play with Kris Joseph at the three and Wes at the four.
Is he there, is he not there because we switch up so much. Arinze has been
with us the whole time.  
  
Q. Andy, I believe your uncle played at Niagara in the early '70s. How
familiar are you with his career and is he someone you played with --  
ANDY RAUTINS: I heard my uncle had a great career at Niagara. I don't remember
seeing any games like that. From what I hear, he was kind of a legend growing
up in Canada, St. Mike's. Definitely I grew up every summer playing basketball
in Canada. He's always there with us working us out there with my dad. I
certainly tip my hat off to him for that base of work that I have right now.
It's always great to kind of play and represent Canada like he did as well for
the national team. So it's a special feeling.  
  
Q. Wes, what's your impression of Marqus Blakely from Vermont from watching
video, or have you seen him this season?  
WES JOHNSON: I just saw the top ten dunk he had. I know he's a freak. And I
think he leads his team in all five categories. So he's a great athlete. So he
can come into the BIG EAST and be an impact to any team he's on in the BIG
EAST. I know that. He's an animal.  
  
Q. For Wes and for Scoop, a lot has been made about how you guys were under
the radar at the beginning of the season, no one expected this from you. When
did you guys start to believe that this could be a special team?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We knew this coming into conditioning, to pre-season
conditioning. Our whole team, we all worked hard together. We all clicked and
gelled right away. When the team does that as fast as we did that, you've got
something special.  
When we got to the Garden, we put on a show where everybody knew we were a
good team and we were a top team from there. Plus it was the coming out party
of Wesley Johnson. We had a whole year to see him. Nobody had seen him yet. He
kind of played really great down at the Garden. Once he came out there, we
wasn't looking back.  
WES JOHNSON: I think the Garden too. He had a good game against Cal. So can't
just throw me out there. I think it was both our coming-out parties. For the
team in general, after beating North Carolina and coming back to the 'Cuse we
took that to a whole other level. Our defense stepped up and than carried us
from that moment on. Our momentum coming out of New York City really helped
the team.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks for your time. Good luck.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: Just a clarification of Arinze.  
Obviously he's still very sore. Just to clarify what -- there's been some
question, anyway, in the newspaper what happened with Arinze. When he hurt his
leg in New York, we had no idea obviously. We wanted to wait until we got back
to Syracuse. Friday we did the testing and thought there was a chance that he
could possibly get back to practice on Monday. It just -- Sunday night it was
obvious that he just wasn't going to be able to make it back to practice. He's
getting better. At no time -- to clarify, we never talked to anybody from the
NCAA or the committee. I never did, the doctor never did and our trainer never
did. So -- and we're still in the same position we were Sunday.  
He's being treated. He's still got pain when he puts pressure on his leg. So
we've been practicing and playing and thinking that he would not be able to
play tomorrow night. Beyond that, we still don't know. If we were able to win,
whether he would be able to go Sunday, it's doubtful, in my mind. That's
really where we stand with him. He's definitely not going to play tomorrow
night. And that's the only definite that we have right now.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions at this time.  
  
Q. As much as you want to treat every game differently when number one seeds
are 100 and 0, can you ever totally take it out of your kid's head that
they're supposed to beat this team and avoid the pressure that occurs when
they start to play with you?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've never really thought about what we're supposed to do or
what people think in the few games that I've coached. We prepare to play, we
get ready to play, and I don't think about those things. We just think about
getting ready to play. Vermont, we know, is a very good team. We know they
played very well this year, particularly over the last part of the year.
They've got a very, very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Some people think that with Joseph in the starting lineup, smaller
lineup, you're just as effective if not more effective. How will you be
different with that kind of lineup?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We played that lineup 60 or 70% of the time this year. We think
it's an effective lineup. But without Arinze, we don't have the depth and the
size that's been very helpful to us all year long. It changes our rotation. It
changes how we can play, how we can attack the game. With Ricky starting at
forward, we have a backup center who is in the game and used to playing. He
moves over to the center spot. It also gives us more depth at forward as much
as at center. And enables us to rest both our forwards when he's healthy. That
gives us depth up front and we have the three guards in the back court. So we
have good depth there. But certainly it definitely affects our depth. Our
starting lineup, the difference when most teams lose a starter, they're
bringing in a guy that's playing 15 to 20 minutes or so. We're bringing in a
guy that played 30 minutes a game. So we think our starting lineup is fine. We
just don't have the depth.  
  
Q. One follow-up. For the time that you use Riley, how well prepared is he
to fill the role in the zone?  
COACH BOEHEIM: He's practiced every day, from the beginning of the year till
now. If he had played in games, he would have played about five minutes,
maximum. So we're asking him now, he'll probably have to expand that a little
bit. We have had a week to kind of work with him a little bit more and try to
get him in there. I think he's had a good week of practice. I think he's
prepared to play some minutes for us.  
  
Q. Back to the question of the depth. Obviously the games come quicker now.
With one day off in between. Is there anything you can do for these guys at
this point or do you tell them you've been through this all season and you're
just going to have to deal with it?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm not concerned at all. We've had a lot of rest. I'm not
concerned at all about playing two games.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on being here. This city as an opening round location
and being so close to home; does it offer you any advantage at all?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, I don't think there's a tremendous advantage in this
tournament. I think that hopefully we'll have some fans here. But I think
that, you know, the bottom line when you get to the NCAA tournament, you have
to play. The team that plays the best is going to win. And, you know, it's all
about playing good at this stage of the year. We've worked hard. We've had a
good season.  
These guys coming out of where we started the year, to win the BIG EAST
conference for these guys was probably as good a regular season as we have had
at Syracuse. We have had a few good ones. But I think what they've
accomplished this year, they've earned everything that they've got -- the one
seed. They've earned that. They've really played hard and they've played well
over the whole season. We played well in our last two games on offense. We
slipped a little bit on the defensive end. But Georgetown is a pretty good
offensive team and so is Louisville. I'm not concerned about our last two
games. This team has been consistent from the beginning of the year. They
played well at home. They played well on the road. So I expect us to play well
here tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jim, I'm wondering what kind of advantage, if at all, or resource is
maybe a better word, to have a guy like Gerry (McNamara) in the locker room
who has won a national title, a young guy who can relate to these kids at this
time of the year?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think we have a great staff. I think Gerry is a part of that
staff. It's good to have him around. But we've got a great coaching staff.
They've been tremendous all year. But we have two point guards that played in
the Final Four on our staff. Not too many staffs have that.  
  
Q. Why is this year's team better than last year's team, at least so far?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think this team -- last year's team -- don't forget the team
went to the Sweet 16. Last year the league was much tougher, the top teams
were much better. I think that last year's team won 28 games. I think people
for some reason think that team wasn't very good last year. It was pretty
good. The league was tougher. I think the thing that makes us a little better
this year, I think our defense has been better. I think offensively we led the
league in scoring last year. And we're second I think this year in the league
in scoring. So I think offensively we were just as good last year. I think our
defense is better. And the reason it's better is Wesley is bigger up front and
Andy is bigger in the back court. And Brandon and Scoop are bigger.  
So we have more size. That's the big thing with our defense. And I think size
does matter and our defense. And I really think that's the difference between
this year and last year. The size that we have, physical ability.  
  
Q. What kind of defensive adjustments do you have to make without Arinze?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think the biggest thing is our depth. We just -- he's so
physical and so strong out there in the middle, takes up so much space. He's a
big part of our defense. And offense, the same thing. He's a guy you have to
account for. Sometimes some teams have to double team him which opens up
things for other guys. But he's a very good low-post offensive player. And
defensively, he's a physical presence out there.  
  
Q. How do you describe what Brandon is going through in terms of not playing
as well now as he did earlier in the year?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think Brandon typical freshman, he actually started better
than I had hoped and played really well earlier in the year. I thought he was
through that part. He hit a little bump in the road during the conference,
which freshmen do quite often. And he started to think about things a little
bit too much instead of just playing. Which is not unusual for a freshman.
Particularly not unusual when the guy behind you really plays well. I think
you start thinking about it more. But I'm confident. He's had some really good
games this year. I think he's a really good player. And I think he'll play
well up here.  
  
Q. I don't know if you can remember all the way that far back --  
COACH BOEHEIM: I can remember a lot farther back than you can, boy. I wouldn't
be wearing that green shirt. The Irish people in this town are going to be
really probably insulted.  
  
Q. That I missed it by one day?  
COACH BOEHEIM: What would you like me to remember?  
  
Q. If you can remember when you first got into the tournament, do you
approach things any differently now? I mean, do you sleep better now? What
have you learned from back then maybe that helps not just you but maybe --  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm 34 years older. I do sleep a little better now. If I don't
I won't be able to get up. Yeah. The tournament -- I think the first round now
is like the third round used to be. It used to be it came to the -- the first
round there were no stupid questions -- no questions and no people bothering
you and you just kind of played the first two games. And then the people, the
stupid people -- the other people came around and you had to deal with all
that stuff. But you had a bye, really, a pass on the first two rounds. Now
it's just starts a little sooner. And you know the teams, the quality of teams
are just really -- it's unbelievable to me how good the teams are in this
tournament are. The 16 seeds, they're good. Vermont should -- a few years ago
would have been a 13 or 14 seed. We had trouble with them when they were 14.
I'm sure we'll have trouble with them when they're a 16 too. There's just --
we played Robert Morris earlier this year. They're a really good team. Murray
State, these teams are all good.  
I watched the NIT over the last couple of days. Those teams are good. There's
just a lot of good basketball teams. I differ with some of our -- your
colleagues on the TV sets. I realize you don't associate with those guys.
They're a little different level. I'm not sure which way it is, up or down.
They keep talking about well there's mediocre teams. Really, all it is is
there are teams that got beat by the top three or four teams in their league.
That's why they've lost 10 or 11 or 12 games, because they couldn't beat the
top three or four teams in the league. I've always felt like if you lose three
or four times, five or six times to the teams in the top 20, that doesn't mean
you're a bad team. It means you're just not quite a top 20 team.  
I always thought the object of this tournament was to be in a tournament. I
didn't realize you had to have a chance to win it to get into the tournament.
I thought it was just a matter of we try to get the best teams around the
country to play in a tournament, because if you just took teams that had a
chance to win it, you would only take about 12 teams or 16 teams and play.
Some years you might just take two like they do in that other sport. The
object of this tournament is to give everybody a chance to play in this
tournament. And I'm really tired of hearing every time they mention about any
kind of expansion, it's for coaches. There's one coach on every team. There's
15 players. Ask those 15 players what an opportunity to play in this
tournament is. When we don't like something, we try and attack somebody.  
There's a lot of good players out there in this country. And until people
realize that, I don't believe it's mediocrity; I think it's balance. I think
they talk about that in football all the time now, about balance and
mediocrity. It's the same thing. Just depends on your point of view, which
words you use.  
  
Q. Coach, when did you become aware of Andy Rautins as a possible recruit?
You probably had known him much before that.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I would say what grade he was in; seventh or eighth. I'm not
sure. He was a good player in high school. Really good shooter. We liked him.
There was only two Division I schools that really liked him. You know, I
thought he could really shoot. But I always thought he did other things. He
was a very good passer, like his father. He plays a lot like his father. He
doesn't turn it over quite as much as his father. But some days he tries to.
He hasn't quite got to that level yet. He's always been a player that I liked.
I just felt he could develop into a very good player. And he's really worked
hard. He's really just done an unbelievable job of improving himself, making
himself a better player. He's really been a key guy for us all year at both
ends of the court. He's a much better defensive player than people might
think. And he's been tremendous on offense all year. He's played some games
where he hasn't scored much and been the key guy for us. He's really made
himself into a tremendous player, tremendous player.  
  
Q. A lot of people when they got recruited thought it was only because of
his dad. Did your relationship with Leo maybe give you some information or
insight into Andy that would allow him to become the player he is?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No, no. My only conversation with Leo was that I'm not sure
that Andy can be a great player for us. I think he can. I think it's going to
be a close call. He's going to have to work really hard. And I think Leo said
he wants to come to Syracuse. That's what he wants to do. You know, he'll do
what he has to do to be able to become a good player at Syracuse. He's been a
very good player for us for all -- his whole career. He's really had an
unbelievable year this year.  
  
Q. A few guys on your team who sat out a year because of either injury or
transferring, what type of value does that year without games but still in
practice add?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think guys that are able to sit out -- Arinze did, obviously
Andy, and Wesley sitting out this year -- I think it can be a tremendous year.
It can really benefit you. Andy particularly benefited. He got stronger. He
worked hard in the weight room. Wesley I thought really worked hard last year.
The one thing when you sit out, you have to work hard. You have to really work
hard. We have had tremendous success over the years with fifth-year players,
guys that either redshirted a year because they were hurt or just needed to
redshirt a year. Going back to Rony Seikaly redshirted half a year. Lazarus
Sims and we have had a lot of guys redshirt one year. It's a big help in
today's world, a guy that's a fifth-year player playing against freshman and
sophomores a lot. They have an advantage in that situation. The experience of
our team has been very important to the success that we have had this year,
without any question.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, joined now by student athletes from Vermont. Comes in
with a record of 25-9. Fourth appearance for Vermont in the NCAA tournament
and first since 2005. I'm joined by closest to me Marqus Blakely, Evan Fjeld
and Maurice Joseph. All the way down on the end. So as we've done all day,
please raise your hand if you have a question. We'll take questions for these
student athletes right now.  
  
Q. Marqus, we'll start with you. Now that you've been here for a day or two,
what's your impressions of being in the NCAA tournament for the first time?  
MARQUS BLAKELY: I mean coming from Vermont, it's a lot different. We chartered
a flight out here, brought everyone with us. So I mean it's a lot different.
Something you can get used to. Hopefully Evan and some of the underclassmen
will be able to get back to this point and experience it again.  
  
Q. Does the Syracuse zone people talk about all the time, have you guys seen
many zones, have you seen anything like their zone, and what do you think
makes it so tough? Any of you guys can answer that.  
EVAN FJELD: I don't think we've seen anything like their zone, played against
it, because they're the only team that really runs the 2-3 zone all the time.
They play it a little differently than other people. And they're so used to
it, they're very effective in it and they're long and athletic which is hard
to simulate in practice.  
We've been preparing for it. And hopefully we'll make some shots from the
perimeter as well as try to get the ball in the middle and maybe feed Marqus
down low and hopefully we'll have some success against it.  
THE MODERATOR: Maurice, Marqus, anything to add to that?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Going along with what he said, they're long and athletic. You
know, they've got Andy and Scoop and Brandon Don out there. They're long and
they disrupt a lot of people, kind of take them out of their comfort zone,
what they want to do. They extend it really high on the wings so guys are
really pushed down on their offense and guys are taking 25-foot three-pointers
as opposed to 22-foot three-pointers. It's hard to penetrate. They close up
and you're scratching and clawing and all that stuff. It's a really tough
defense to play against and prepare against. It's tough to simulate in
practice because they're so athletic and so long on the wings and it's a
matter of really executing, being sharp and hopefully making the open shots.  
And I think the biggest thing is getting paint touches. Getting the ball into
the free-throw line and I think teams try do that a lot but not many teams are
successful doing it. But I think that's where the weak spot is. If you can
attack that, that will open up shots on the perimeter. Hopefully we knock down
some shots, get it to the free-throw line and see what happens.  
  
Q. Maurice, just saw your brother Kris out there in the hallway. I was
wondering if you had seen him yet today and during this past week how much
have you talked or texted since Sunday night?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I haven't seen them. I saw them change in the locker room.
They rushed us in here. We have been talking ever since the selection show.
We've been in contact every day, pretty much discussing what family is going
to do in terms of tickets, how we're going to get everybody down here. We're
so happy we're playing against each other. Our city is happy we're playing
against each other. We've been talking quite a bit. I don't know at what point
I'll see him. We're excited to get to see each other.  
  
Q. How many family members are going to be able to make the game?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: We have 12 tickets, 12 people are coming. Other people bought
tickets. I'm not sure who is coming but our core group will be here.  
  
Q. Do you guys remember watching the 2005 game?  
MARQUS BLAKELY: Yeah.  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Yeah.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that? Was there a reason for you guys to come to
Vermont in the first place?  
MARQUS BLAKELY: Well, yeah. No one really could forget that game. When you get
recruited by Vermont, that's the first thing that sticks in your mind. I mean,
they just played a hell of a game. And no one really thought that they were
going to be able to stay in it. I mean, a lot of people are counting us out
tomorrow too. So anything can happen on any given night.  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else have any memories from that game?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I was committed to Michigan State at that time. I was actually
at the game, the game when Michigan State knocked out Vermont in the NCAA
tournament. I was cheering for Michigan State. It was a great story. I
remember the media coverage. T.J. hitting that shot and Jermaine had the game
of his life that game. People don't remember that. Jermaine was incredible in
that game. I don't think he missed a shot the entire game. So transferring
here was -- that game definitely did stick in my mind because I saw them play.
They actually played in Vermont my sophomore year. I knew a little bit about
the program. So it was -- that game was definitely a staple not only in the
basketball program but in the Vermont community as a whole.  
  
Q. With that '05 game and of course with your brother, it seems to be more
intrigue coming into a 1-16 matchup than there normally is.  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Right. It makes an interesting story. I don't know what the
history is, but I think it might be -- has to be -- can't be that many times
two brothers on opposing teams matched up against each other in the first
round. It makes the story a little more interesting. But the biggest story
here is there's a game to be played. It's going to be Vermont Catamounts
against the Syracuse Orange. When the ball goes up we're going to try to make
history.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Vermont?  
  
Q. When it's a one-seed versus a 16th seed, I know it's a cliche saying you
have to take it one game at a time or one possession at a time, but in this
case, you really have to, I'm assuming, that maybe break this game down into
two-minute segments or five-minute segments and develop some motivation like
that; is that maybe how you guys look at it?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I don't think you look at it in segments like that. I think we
look at it as playing a solid 40 minutes. Going in and making every possession
count. I don't think we look at it in segments per se. We want to really be
sharp in everything we do. Obviously you can't afford to take bad shots or
turn the ball over. They'll turn that into easy buckets. We're more looking
into it as a solid 40 minutes of basketball as opposed to little segments. We
need to play well for 40 straight minutes.  
MARQUS BLAKELY: I mean one thing we want to do is kind of control the tempo of
the game. They're a great team when they get out in transition. If we're able
to take good shots and kind of slow them down and make them run their half
court offense, I think the game will be a lot closer.  
  
Q. Evan, did you guys get a chance to watch the Villanova game today? Do you
draw any inspiration from that? All three of you guys?  
EVAN FJELD: Hopefully we get a better whistle than Robert Morris did. It was a
great game. I feel bad for Robert Morris. They played their hearts out and
just to come up so short. Nobody will remember that it was that close, 10, 20
years from now, they will just have lost in the first round. It was a great
game. I loved watching games all day. There have been no blowouts. Every high
seed needs to be on the upset alert, I guess.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Joined by
Vermont Head Coach Mike Lonergan who brings his team into an NCAA game for the
first time that Catamounts have been in since 2005. So, Coach, great to have
you here. We'll let you open up with a statement, and we'll take questions.  
COACH LONERGAN: We're very happy to be here, and Buffalo has done a great job
as host city. We're having a great time so far. It's my first Division I NCAA
tournament. I've been to nine as a Division III coach. I looked around the
room today, the meeting, not only every other coach has been to this big
dance. I think they've all been there three times or more. So I felt a little
bit inexperienced amongst all those great coaches. But our players are
excited. We know we have a heck of a challenge. Might be playing the best team
in the country in their backyard. But we're very happy to be here. Hopefully
we'll play well.  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead and open it up to questions at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, just looking from today, I was just coming out of the locker room
and the guys were talking about seeing Robert Morris hanging and some of these
13, 14 and 15 seeds playing tight or playing the games close. Not that they
needed more motivation, but to see this, what do you think that does to give
them confidence that pulling off the upset is possible?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think it should give our guys some confidence. You
definitely worry about some guys being intimidated by the atmosphere and
everything. But Robert Morris hanging with Villanova and all the games seemed
to be close. Hopefully they'll all be close tomorrow as well. But I think
that's good for our guys. I think my hope is when the ball is tossed up, we
kind of forget who we are playing and play hard. They definitely have been
watching the games. We want them to be excited about the NCAA tournament,
being a part of it. I'm glad that no one got drilled today and our guys
started thinking too much about that. I think the way the scores have been
going is good for our guys to see.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been a long trip on the road this year. You guys had a lot of
road games to start the season. A lot of road experiences. Obviously it's
pretty much a road game for you guys tomorrow. Is all those experiences going
to help you in this hostile environment tomorrow?  
COACH LONERGAN: I hope so. We always pride ourselves on playing a great non-
conference schedule. We've traveled a lot. The travel here was easy because we
got to take a plane and charter which is a lot of fun for our guys. But I
don't think we have played in any atmosphere that we'll see tomorrow night. We
travel well and we'll have some fans here and right behind our bench. That
will really get the guys fired up. But this is definitely going to be a
Syracuse Orange crowd. But some of our guys really react well to that. About a
week left in the season we had the best road wins in the country. I think we
finished second. We're a pretty good road team. We also know Syracuse has a
great team, Hall of Fame coach. We're going to have to be at our best to make
this a competitive game.  
  
Q. Can you just basically break down Blakely; what makes him such a gifted
and talented player?  
COACH LONERGAN: Marqus is a great player. I think he's the only player in the
country that leads us in all the major statistical categories. He creates
matchup problems with big guys who aren't quick enough to guard them. He jumps
over smaller guys. Not only does he have tremendous athleticism and jumping
ability, he's strong. He's a very strong young man. He's a great passer, can
handle the ball. The only weakness in his game was his free-throw shooting
which he has improved on a lot this season, his outside shooting. But what I
like about him is he doesn't really rely on an outside jumpshot. He plays to
his strengths and he definitely has many strengths. So I think he's a great
player and I'm very happy for him that he's reached most of his goals this
year.  
  
Q. Congratulations.  
COACH LONERGAN: Thank you.  
  
Q. I'm sure for the moment the bracket came out and you saw Syracuse on
there, you've been hearing questions almost non-stop and have probably had it
on your mind all the time. How can that be used by you and by the players in
any way, even in the basketball sense, in terms of the fact there's a team
from the school that has seen what Syracuse has done and beaten them? Is there
any way that that experience from five years ago can be used even if the guys
there weren't a part of that?  
COACH LONERGAN: They know it can be done. That was a great Syracuse team. That
was a great Vermont team. Taylor Coppenrath, T.J. (Sorrentine) possibly the
two best players in the school in the history of the school. That is a
different team. Syracuse is the number one seed. So it's going to be a heck of
a challenge and the game is in Buffalo. But at first I saw it, I couldn't
believe it. I couldn't believe it. I said that's a cruel joke having us play
Syracuse. You look at the positives for recruiting, for selfish reasons, it
makes my job a little easier that we've gotten a lot of great publicity. I get
to play against -- against a Hall of Fame coach I have a lot of respect for.
He's done a lot for Coaches Versus Cancer. I have a lot of respect. My mom
died of cancer.  
Jim Boeheim is friends with my former boss. I was a Syracuse fan growing up.
Sherman Douglas from DC is probably my favorite college player, and Maurice's
brother went to my high school. It's kind of neat. But that game five years
ago, I think some of our fans think it's the greatest thing ever. Maurice was
celebrating like we won the national championship when he saw it on the
screen. But there's a lot of positives. The first few minutes I was a little
upset that we were playing them. I want our guys to really enjoy this. We're
just going to come out and try to do our best.  
  
Q. Mike, could you talk about or explain big an influence Jack Bruin was to
you especially early in your career?  
COACH LONERGAN: Jack Bruen is like a second father to me. I have a great
father. His name is Jack. My first son is named Jack after my dad and Jack
Bruen. His wife, I still keep in touch with. His mom still lives and calls me.
Still lives in the city. He's my mentor. A great, great man. A lot of people
don't realize my second coaching job I worked for three years at Colgate, and
actually snuck up to the Dome and saw Syracuse-Georgetown games, one of the
great rivalries ever.  
Coach Bruen, not only was he a great coach, he's a great person. I wish he
could be here right now. He meant a lot to me. That's what's great about the
sport of basketball. He's probably the best coach most people have never heard
of. And a lot of people don't realize he got Colgate to the championship game
before Adonal Foyle came and he did a remarkable job. It's not easy at our
level. He went to three straight NCAA tournaments and tragically died of
cancer. But he's a great man. And I'm glad you brought him up. I owe him an
awful lot. I think about him every day.  
  
Q. Can you just explain how much zone have you seen so far this year? And
how is Syracuse's zone different from what you've seen so far?  
COACH LONERGAN: Truthfully we haven't seen as much zone as I thought we would
see. I always joked around with my assistants to say that to stop Blakely, I'm
surprised we don't see more zone. Statistically we're the second worst three-
point shooting team in the conference.  
I was surprised going into the season with Maurice and Joey, I thought we had
really good shooters. Marqus gets open shots for guys. The thing with
Syracuse's zone, they play it all the time. They're used to playing it. They
have a great coach. They've been running zone for years. And their length and
athleticism is incredible.  
It's not an ordinary 2-3 zone. It's really hard to get open jump shots. They
can trap you out of it, do a lot of things, it's hard to get second shots. My
concern is it's a way that might be harder to get Marqus the ball and it might
be harder for him to score in there because of his size and we really need him
to score points for us to be in games and to win basketball games.  
So, the zone definitely concerns me. That was why the matchup, another reason
I didn't like it. They're a zone team. But they do -- I'm a man-to-man coach.
I tell you they do a great job with the zone. I talked to one of my friends,
an assistant in the BIG EAST -- Rod Balanis, Notre Dame, four years at Colgate
and ten years at Notre Dame 14 years -- he said this is the best zone he's
ever seen them have.  
  
Q. What's been your message to the team this week? And what's going to be
your message to the team going into the game tomorrow?  
COACH LONERGAN: I told them they have to enjoy this. The rest of their life
they have to think about this. We had an emotional week last week. It's still
emotional with Evan's mom passing away. We have a great group of guys. I'm
happy for them we won the America East championship, the third year in five
years being there. I felt great they finally got to cut the nets down.  
The thing I want to stress is now that you're here, you don't want to have
regrets saying, you know what, I didn't play well in that game against
Syracuse. We could have done a better job. I want them as individuals to play
the best they can probably play. We're trying to keep the scouting reports
simple. They watch Syracuse on television all the time, especially with Kris
Joseph. They're familiar with the team. I don't want them to have any regrets.
If we're not good enough to beat them, fine. I want them to go out and give
their all. I think they will be motivated to play as hard as they can.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, Coach. Good luck.  
COACH LONERGAN: Thank you, appreciate it.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to get started with Missouri student athletes.
Keith Ramsey, Zaire Taylor and J.T. Tiller. I'm happy to have them here in
Buffalo.  
Same rules apply as our previous sessions. Go ahead and open it up to
questions at this time.  
  
Q. This is for any of you guys. A lot of times these games come down to
contrasting styles. That's not going to happen on Friday. So if you guys can
talk about how much you appreciate facing another team that runs like you guys
do.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Well, I think both teams like to run. That's a good thing. So
it's not as much a battle of tempo, that we, both teams, probably have to deal
with throughout the regular season all year. But I do think there's contrast
in the styles of play. I don't think it's as similar as people say. I think
the way we go about pressing and trying to play up-tempo game is different. I
think both coaches like to play fast, but they do it differently.  
J.T. TILLER: I want to say I think it's going to be -- I think the game is
going to really just come down to who wants it more. The tempo is not going to
be a factor. Just who feels more comfortable down the stretch. Those last ten
minutes, that's going to make the game what it is.  
  
Q. For Zaire, you said that you guys kind of do things a little bit
differently. In what ways are these two teams different in terms of your tempo
and what you try to do?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Well, I was watching -- I haven't gotten to see them. Being in
different conferences, you don't see them play throughout the whole year. I
managed to catch some games, see them play Illinois and once I found out we
were playing them I watched a couple of the tapes of them. I think that from
the outside view, when you watch us play sometimes, it looks a little helter-
skelter even though I think it's a little organized chaos going on. Whereas
when I watch them, it seems a little more organized in appearance. But both
styles I feel are effective when both teams are executing them right. And I
think both teams -- it's not a matter of who controls the tempo, as much as
who executes better.  
  
Q. You guys have been here -- not here in Buffalo, but been in this before
now. Can you talk about how the time between selection Sunday of last year and
where you are now has either changed or is the same from last year? And how
you're sharing that with younger kids like Mike Dixon?  
KEITH RAMSEY: It's basically the same. We just come here and try to get some
wins, play hard. We had two losses we didn't come to play. We are trying to
get everybody else ready. Especially Mike Dixon, freshmen, and even Tyler
Stone and John Underwood because they're so young and they have to help us on
the floor situation. We have been preparing since we lost to Nebraska. I feel
like everybody is ready.  
J.T. TILLER: Since we have experience being here, it's just more of trying to
calm the younger guys down and getting their anxiety levels down anyway so
they can come out and play the game that we know and play the way we always
play during the year.  
  
Q. Zaire, you guys were all pretty down after the loss last week in
Nebraska. Has the layoff been good?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I don't think there's nothing -- anything wrong with being down
after a loss. It's natural as a competitor. Sometimes -- usually after you
lose, you can't wait to get back out there and then losing two in a row, I
mean, there's just a lot of -- you just want to -- you want a chance to redeem
yourself. So the layoff is good in some ways. It gives you a chance to clear
your mind and get ready and get focused. But at the same time, you don't want
to take that eagerness and desire to get a win.  
  
Q. This question really is for Keith and for J.T. First, Keith, talk about
the challenge of going against a guy like Trevor Booker? And secondly for
J.T., how important is it for you and Zaire and the other back court guys to
keep their guards frustrated so that they can't make those entry passes in to
Booker.  
KEITH RAMSEY: It's going to be tough. He's a good player. I watched a lot of
tape on him. He's an athletic freak. We can stop him or we can just contain
him. It's going to be one of each. It's going to be a tough challenge for all
the four of us to handle him. One, from the guard's perspective, our job to
help the bigs out definitely is to harass and pressure their guards so they
can't make those easy entry passes. We just got to really pressure them and
make them work to get up court so they can get fatigued and they can't make
the moves they usually want to make and try to get the ball inside to them as
they usually do.  
  
Q. J.T., last year about this time you weren't letting anybody look at a
wrist that needed work. Bowers has the same problem. What have you or what can
you tell him about day-to-day getting through with something that hurts?  
J.T. TILLER: Well, I think the mentality coming into this type of situation,
coming into something as big as the NCAA tournament, you realize that you got
to get your priorities, if you want to call it that, in order. I think
Laurence knows that. He's not going to let that wrist bother or just anchor
him to not play as good as he's been playing. With the injury or without the
injury. I think Laurence is really going to come out and give us all he has
and play as hard as he does. It's really not much you can tell him. If
anything, I just tell him keep playing his game and don't let the wrist get in
the way of doing what he usually does.  
  
Q. Easier said than done. How do you manage it physically? When it hurts, it
hurts.  
J.T. TILLER: When your adrenaline gets going, the pain fades. Fades into the
background.  
  
Q. Close games, Zaire, I imagine that, you know, you wouldn't mind that,
given your knack for knocking down shots at the buzzer. How much of a comfort
level do you have in those situations that allow you to have so much success
in those situations?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I feel like everybody on the team has confidence at the end of
the game. And I personally, I feel confident with the ball in my hand. I mean,
I think that it's easy to feel confident when it's in your hand. I also feel
confident when it's in J.T.'s hand or Keith's hand or Timmy's hand. I feel
like we have players that are going to make plays. I think being the point
guard, it's kind of natural to want to have the ball in your hand to make a
decision. And sometimes it comes down to me taking the shot. And J.T. is a
point guard as well. He's proven that he can make the play at the same time.
He did it last year in the tournament against Marquette. So I mean we got guys
on this team that are willing to make plays in pressure situations. We've been
in a lot of pressure situations this season and prior seasons. So when it
comes down to it, I feel like we have enough experience to be successful
during the clutch parts of the game. God willing, we will be again.  
  
Q. Keith, a lot has been made about the number of minutes you and Bowers had
to play since Safford came down. You have had quite a while to rest since the
last time you played. Just two games in any given week: Does that mean
anything anymore? The number of minutes you have to play?  
KEITH RAMSEY: No, it's tournament time. You have to suck it up. You can't be
worried about your body, really. As coach always tells us. We have to go out
there and play through it. I believe Coach sees Steve a little more and some
of the freshmen, try them out a little bit because it is a tournament. Even
two or three minutes there, that will help us a lot. So we're going to see
when it comes to game time.  
  
Q. Zaire, this is your chance to play as close to your home as you've had
since you've played for Missouri. Talk about the experience for you personally
and family and friends.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Well, this is I guess the closest thing I have to a homecoming
this far. God willing, Syracuse is a little closer. But I mean it's a good
feeling. It's a great feeling to be able to come home. My mom gets to see me
and coming down to the latter parts of your career. I mean, it's just a
blessing to be able to get one more chance to play. Just to play one more game
is a blessing. And to be able to do it in your home state and in front of some
family and friends makes it that much more bigger and that much more memorable
come years down the road. So it's going to be -- I'm excited to play the game.
I don't know if being in New York can make me even more excited with how big
the game already is. But it's still a good feeling.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate it, guys. Appreciate your time, guys. Joined by
Missouri Coach Mike Anderson. Welcome to Buffalo and go ahead and make your
opening statement.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, first, it's certainly a great opportunity to be able to
play in the NCAA tournament, the field started out 65. Now it's down to 64.
We're one of 64 teams playing. With that being said, we are certainly excited,
especially coming to Buffalo, an area we came two Labor Days ago. We spent
some time in Niagara Falls, Canada; exhibition season with some young players
and a young team. That team got to the league Elite Eight last year. So it's
kind of ironic that we're back here in Buffalo where we flew in to to have an
opportunity to hopefully survive and advance playing against an outstanding
Clemson team coached by Oliver Purnell. When you talk about styles and tempo,
it certainly will be an up-tempo game. It's going to come down, I guess, who
can survive the longest. And hopefully our depth will be a key to this
basketball game. But we're looking forward to it. It's a tremendous
opportunity and a tremendous challenge at the same time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how concerned are you with your front court depth considering
Justin Safford's injury and also the fact that Laurence Bowers is playing with
wrist ligament tears. How much of a concern is that going against a guy like
Booker?  
COACH ANDERSON: We have had some problems going down the stretch with respect
Justin going out one of our veteran players. But at the same time I think this
team has had players play throughout the year. So hopefully some guys can step
up and contribute in this particular tournament. A guy like Steve Moore. He
will certainly warrant many more minutes.  
John Underwood, you'll see him out there maybe one or two minutes at a time
hopefully to give guys like Keith Ramsey and Laurence Bowers, who I really
admire, a guy that's playing with some pain. We all know that. But if there's
a word to describe him, that's toughness.  
I will sit back and listen. I heard J.T. trying to explain, they asked him
what advice should you give him? It comes down to toughness. I think this team
and Laurence in particular, I think he has that. And hopefully that's the
toughness we're going to need against a Clemson team. But when you talk about
their front line, with Booker, who is an outstanding player, I had a chance to
work with him at the USA games and in Colorado Springs. He's a warrior. He's
elevated his game to another level. He's a leader of that basketball team. But
Oliver has done a great job with them. They've done well in ACC. And I'm sure
they're excited about being here in this tournament. I think it's going to be
a key. We have to match I think their intensity. We have to match their
aggressiveness on the boards. We have to make sure that we're -- don't allow
those guys to really, Grant, Booker, Jennings, to keep them off the boards.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been quoted as saying you don't want to be in the dance.
You want to do some dancing. What have you seen in the last week that's sort
of gives you some confidence there?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I, you know, I think our last outing wasn't very good.
Maybe that's the reason why. I think this time of year is all about the mental
make-up and I think the energy. And hopefully we're a team that will play with
some energy.  
I like how we've been playing defense. I think we have had to make some
adjustments with Justin going out of the lineup. But I like this basketball
team. And hopefully they can bring the same feeling they have brought into
this tournament last year. That's all they can. They can't think about -- they
understand the first game is the most important game. But I want them to bring
that feeling. We have enough guys that play that hopefully they can come out
with that same mind-set.  
  
Q. On that point, more specifically, what have the players that went through
this run last year done to help impart some wisdom on the Mike Dixons and the
John Underwoods and those who weren't here for that experience?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think in practice every day they've really gotten after it.
Since the Nebraska game we've had some pretty intense workouts. Again, it's
just -- I think the mind-set you have to have when you go into tournament
play. Officials tend to let you play little bit more. The sense of urgency, if
anything else, it's just a sense of urgency. We have seniors that -- this
could very well be their last game. So I think there's some urgency that's
going to take place. But I tell you what, I try to keep things as simple as
possible. That means we're going to continue to do the same things we've been
doing all year long. I think that's when you get the tournament play. As a
matter of fact, I want us to really turn up our defense intensity even more.
We don't change a whole lot.  
  
Q. Talking about intensity, Zaire and Keith and J.T. were talking about how
you and Clemson play similar, but some differences in style. Can you talk a
little bit about how you feel you do or don't play the same kind of tempo?  
COACH ANDERSON: I mean I don't know exactly what they do to the T but I know
what we do. It's very unorthodox. Not many people doing what we do, even in
Oliver's situation when you talk about teams that are getting out there for 40
minutes. But it's something that I believe in, something that has worked for
me. I get the comparison all the time about your team reminds us of the Nolan
Richardson teams of the '90S in Arkansas. I take that as the ultimate
compliment. In terms of Oliver, I'm sure they play with a lot of depth, they
play balanced. They got balance with their team. If you look at their -- the
score and the minutes spread, there's balance. And so I'm sure he's trusted
his bench and it's something I want to do. I've always trusted my bench. And I
think more so in tournament play. I think if you can somehow survive that
first game, the way we play, I think it bodes well for us in tournament play.
Most teams have to prepare for us. We prepare for everybody else every single
day. Throughout the whole year. So I think the key is what kind of
adjustments, solo adjustments you make as the game goes on.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if there's an answer to this question, but you're playing
against a (Oliver) Purnell Leonard Hamilton in this region. A lot of friends,
a lot of people in this region you kind of came up through the ranks with. And
I'm just wondering, it's kind of a coincidence, does it bring back memories
just about you guys were assistants and now, you know, years later all in your
30s --  
COACH ANDERSON: Thanks, Bill. I appreciate that.  
  
Q. I mean, it's just sort of a coincidence. I guess it's something you like.
You just kind of you're all here together. You're playing against each other,
see somebody else play. I don't know what the answer is, but is it good to see
each other and kind of remember how you guys really just come up through the
ranks together?  
COACH ANDERSON: It is. I was standing right there in my locker room and Todd
Bozeman came by. Of course, I remember being out -- out on the assistant
coach's circuit. Of course Todd was out there. Leonard, of course, Hamilton.
So it happened we were at the same site last year in Boise, Idaho. We go from
Boise and now Buffalo. We're actually staying at the same hotel. So it's just
amazing how things go full circle. I think more than anything else, you talked
about the people that you have seen out there. And ultimately I guess it means
that guys are doing -- they're being successful. Doing something they enjoy
doing. So I think from that standpoint, the tough part about it is as you
continue to do that, you play against each other. That's the toughest thing.
We're all trying to vie for the same thing. And that is to try to win a
championship. But at the same time, I think there's good feeling about it.
Those guys are doing well. And hopefully we're doing well.  
  
Q. Without trying to make Clemson a carbon-copy of you -- they do press
throughout the game -- can you recall the last time as a head coach you played
a team with such a similar style to yours? Not trying to make it exactly the
same, but roughly the same kind of approach. Does that happen very often?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, it doesn't. It doesn't. As a matter of fact, I guess you
always hear commentators say, hey, teams that press don't like to be pressed.
Well, I beg to differ. Because that's something we work on every single day.
But you hear guys saying it. Those guys probably have never played basketball
before.  
Now, to answer your question, we played at Loyola Marymount when I was at
Arkansas. That's when Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble and that bunch. Of course
theirs was more up-tempo. They want to get the ball down the floor in four
seconds and let it fly. I tell you what, our guys went in at halftime. That's
the most tired I've ever seen guys get. Even after the game we had some guys
that had to have a drug test. They could not piss for -- I mean it took them
to midnight before they took a leak. It was just -- so when you talk about up
-- you all bleep that. I hope you bleep that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll edit that.  
COACH ANDERSON: It was up-tempo at its finest. Paul Westhead's team. It was --
even as a coach sitting there watching it, it was taxing.  
To get back to your point about teams pressing each other, you see teams press
out there. But you don't see teams press for most of the game. That's why I
think it's going to be an interesting, entertaining matchup.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you talked to Nolan Richardson recently and what's up
with him? I have some vague memory I read something about a documentary or
something on him recently. Have you talked to him? What's up with him?  
COACH ANDERSON: I talked to him. He's a movie star, book star, I guess. He's
got a movie out called "40 Minutes of Hell." And so as a matter of fact, I got
a copy of it and my daughter wants him to sign it.  
Coach is doing well. He's getting ready to start training camp. He's coaching
a WNBA team, the Tulsa Shock. He's excited about it. Of course, as always, he
certainly is proud and excited for us to have an opportunity to be in the NCAA
tournament. He keeps up with this team. He comes down every year and just
watches us work out. He'll catch a game here and there. But I always tell our
guys, he's like the grandfather of what we do. He's the grandfather of 40
Minutes of Hell; the fastest 40 minutes in basketball, most of the stuff I
learned from him.  
  
Q. Coach, a proud Missouri journalism alum so I'll give you a softball
question.  
COACH ANDERSON: Go Tigers.  
  
Q. I won't go quite that far but close. When you came up here, and I
apologize if you covered this first, when you came up here a couple of summers
ago, you didn't know what you had. You had come off a .500 season. You had a
lot of young freshmen, English and a lot of the kids, you didn't know what you
had. Can you talk a little about how you saw kind of what you had develop up
there in Canada as you came into Buffalo for that brief period of time?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, to me it all kind of basically started from the
standpoint of having an understanding of what I had in terms of a team. I had
a chance to see an option. I hadn't practiced with these guys much. You have
to remember these guys were just coming to school where the freshmen were. We
put them against and played one of the teams that had won Division 2 over in
Canada. And I just saw -- we averaged like 132 points a game. I'm going like,
whoa, okay. But can we play some defense? But it wasn't just basketball. We
had an opportunity to bond.  
We were over there for that weekend. Guys had a chance to go over some tours
together. We made it to the Maid of the Mist. Put ponchos on and ride around
in the boats. We did a lot of things together. I thought those guys formulated
a tremendous bond, which I thought was very evident throughout the whole year.
They trusted one another, and cared for one another. And hopefully it was
something that they built that will continue to thrive in our program. I think
that's why we're here this year. We had some adversity take place. I think
some of the leadership, those guys that were here last year have really
stepped up. You saw them on the podium. J.T., Zaire, Keith Ramsey. I think
they were responsible for what was taking place here. Hopefully we can
continue to play good basketball and advance in this tournament. But again, I
have a fond memory of this area. As a matter of fact, I got some relatives up
here. So hopefully we'll have a few Tiger fans in the crowd.  
  
Q. You've got one New York native on your roster. Boise wouldn't strike most
Tiger fans as a fertile recruiting ground. I'm wondering if you're looking at
this as an exposure opportunity for your program and expanding the recruiting
reach?  
COACH ANDERSON: I tell you what, what took place versus when I got to Missouri
to where we are, what took place last year, and this year, I think with this
group here, I think it makes a statement in terms of our program and what it's
going to be about and where it is. And hopefully the TV exposure, people get a
chance to watch our basketball team play. We play an exciting brand of
basketball. I think it excites a lot of young people.  
I'm getting more and more calls from a lot of different people getting into a
lot of doors. And you look at Zaire. He transferred here. His two years, he
only knows the NCAA. And what would be a great, great story to continue that
career in NCAA play. Has made some big, big plays for our basketball team.
He's a glue guy. How well he is known in New York, I don't know. But he's
known now, not only in New York, but Missouri and all across the country.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. Wish you the best of luck.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Representing Florida State, the ninth seed coming in with a
record of 22-9, I have closest to me Solomon Alabi and Ryan Reid and Chris
Singleton. Back-to-back appearances for Florida State in the NCAA tournament.
These guys have been here before. We'll go ahead and take questions for them.
If you just let me know where the questions are we'll get a microphone to you.  
  
Q. Could all three of you address the importance for the program of winning
here to take the next -- the logical next step for the program?  
RYAN REID: Well, right now our school is known for football and everything.
Right now we're trying to build this program and let everybody know we have a
really talented team right now. And at the same time basketball is coming
around. Although everybody talk about we're a young team. But we're kind of
experienced and we still have a lot of work to do. But at the same time, the
basketball program is coming up at Florida State.  
SOLOMON ALABI: Just like he said, we're trying to I mean, build up the
basketball program at Florida State. We made it to the tournament. It's a good
achievement. We accomplished, went in and get a win in this tournament and
prove to the nation that we have a pretty good program going on at Florida
State.  
CHRIS SINGLETON: I think last year before I came in I think we all knew
Florida State was unknown for basketball. Collectively we all came together
and we just made it a goal to get to the NCAA tournament and be a factor in
the NCAA.  
  
Q. Guys, last year five seed upset in the first round. What can you use from
last year's loss to make sure that doesn't happen again this year? Even though
you're a ninth seed, what can you use and learn from last year and make it a
success tomorrow for you?  
CHRIS SINGLETON: I think last year we had control of the game throughout. It
was just the last ten minutes we buckled under pressure. It was a big stage
for us. We had never been there. This year we all know what to do. I think
we're going to play all 40 minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously you guys are noted for defense with the stats of the
field goal percentages. What are the key reasons you guys have developed into
such a good defensive team? Because defense is hard and players don't
necessarily like to play it that much.  
CHRIS SINGLETON: We all bought in on the defensive end. I think the Coach's
philosophy, we want the program to be known for our defense. We know our
offense isn't always going to be there, as people have seen. But I know that
every time we step on the court, our defense is going to be there. It's
something we take pride in. Some people take pride in their offense and being
able to run up and down the court. We take pride in our defense. We've got
each other's back.  
  
Q. Could you -- anybody who wants to, talk about whether you feel you are
close to being an elite program? Do you feel like you're right there or do you
think it's going to take another season?  
RYAN REID: I think -- as for me, I think we're there right now. But at the
same time we still have a lot of work to be done. And right now we're just
trying to really focus and win a lot of games and come back to the tournament
as much as we can. And also winning in the tournament and going deep inside of
the tournament so everybody knows that we're an elite program and we also
believe in ourselves and we think we can do that.  
  
Q. Just following up on the defense question, obviously you have to have
skill, it's the system, working hard are keys. How much is it also attitude
and like you said, pride, how big is that? And a follow-up to that is do you
have any -- in the locker room is there any motivational signs or winks or
anything that you guys do that say okay, we have to D it up?  
RYAN REID: We just basically let our defense take care of our offense, and our
coach, he always preaches on defense. And at the same time we can't let our
defense or whatever -- we can't come down on offense and think we're just
going to score every time. At the same time we have to play defense. Right now
coaches preach on it a lot. We just take a lot of pride in it. And the guys
take a lot of pride in it. And we've been real successful so far about it.  
  
Q. Solomon, 74 blocked shots in a season, certainly that's a game-changing
stat. Do you sense early in a game when you get a blocked shot that you can
essentially spook the other team and change their offense because of the
things you can do defensively against them?  
SOLOMON ALABI: Sure. You know, like blocked shots is part of the defense. Just
like they all talk about defense, that's what really gets our team going. So I
mean I feel if I block shots it's really going to help our team and get us
going. And it's really going to -- I think the team we're playing against is
going to affect their offense.  
  
Q. Would you guys talk about what you think the key against Gonzaga will be?
You've seen enough of them I'm sure to have a pretty good feel.  
RYAN REID: For Gonzaga, it's really they're good inside and out. At the same
time we have to control their penetration, guard penetration. As far as their
transition, we have to get back. If somebody shoots the ball, the guard has to
get back in the hole and slow down the bigs if us big men go and rebound. And
the big guy, especially their four man, he also can shoot the three and also
take you off the dribble. He's pretty mobile. So right now we have to play
them straight up and everybody has to talk on defense and just do our
defensive principle.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything to add to that?  
SOLOMON ALABI: Just like he said, we have to stick to our system. They're a
pretty good team. They've been to this tournament a few times over the past
few years and stuff. I mean they're pretty experienced. So we're going to have
our own game plan for them and stuff. We have to come out there and execute
for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Florida State student athletes?  
  
Q. One more for Chris. Somebody told me that you had an aunt up here in
Syracuse who has a barber shop who is a big Florida State fan? Can you talk
about that?  
CHRIS SINGLETON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Did she bring the whole group down here?  
CHRIS SINGLETON: My dad's side of the family. Half of my family lives in New
York. She's based in Syracuse. She has a shop, a barber shop in Syracuse. It's
my first time in New York. I've never been up here. I'm expecting a lot of
people to come for me and for Florida State, our family members.  
  
Q. Do you have any idea how many?  
CHRIS SINGLETON: Not right now. I'm still getting word how many are coming.  
THE MODERATOR: Ok, thanks, guys. Appreciate your time. Good luck tomorrow.
Joined by Florida State Head Coach Leonard Hamilton now. Florida State comes
in as the ninth seed, 22-9. Making back-to-back NCAA appearances for the first
time since '92/'93. Coach go ahead and make an opening statement and we'll
take questions after that.  
COACH HAMILTON: Take the bottle on the floor? Sorry about that. NCAA protocol.  
THE MODERATOR: We both want to have these jobs again.  
COACH HAMILTON: Let me turn this around. Take nice shot of this. Probably
don't know very much about our basketball team. We've been a team that's been
kind of a grind-it-out team this year. We've hung our hat on our defensive
prowess. We've been fairly consistent with that all year. We are a team of one
senior and one junior and sometimes we play like we are a young team. But
overall, I like this team. I like our potential. I think that our best ball is
still ahead of us. We're developing and growing. But we're very capable of
playing very good basketball. And we -- when we are a little more efficient on
the offensive end, we can be a very good basketball team. And hopefully as we
move into this tournament this weekend that we will show some improvement over
-- in some areas we worked very hard on over the last week or so.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. We'll go ahead and take questions.  
  
Q. Leonard, my name is Ken Murray. I'm filling in for the Miami papers.  
COACH HAMILTON: Did you say Miami?  
  
Q. The Florida papers. I'm sorry. Several Florida papers. It's a Tribune
thing.  
COACH HAMILTON: You really don't know who you are working for?  
  
Q. Right now, but I'm still getting the checks.  
COACH HAMILTON: That's the main thing.  
  
Q. Could you talk about where your program is right now? How important would
it be to the program to get a win here? You came last year, you lost as a
fifth seed. How important is it to win here and where is the program right
now?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think every team that's participating in the NCAA tournament
that's here, we all have aspirations of wanting to win a national title.
That's why you work so hard during the year, to do that. And I think you come
here knowing that you have to be at your very, very best in order to make that
happen. We have a tremendous amount of respect for the Zags. We know they're a
very good basketball team. They've developed a lot of tradition over the
years. So we realize that this would be a very important step for our
basketball team is to come into the NCAA tournament and not only just win but
move deep into the tournament and put ourselves in a position that we're
playing at our very, very best and let's just see what happens.  
  
Q. You mentioned in your opening that not a lot of people know about your
program. You're playing against a team that 25, 30 years ago no one knew about
their program. But now they've kind of got a cult following with their fans
and people across the nation. Do you feel that you're going up against -- I
know it's an eight, nine seed, but do you feel you're going up against not
only a team but a cult?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I think in college basketball, the good and unique thing
about basketball is that you have a right to earn your reputation. And you
have to give credit where credit is due. These guys have earned the right to
be considered one of the better basketball programs in the country. When you
look at their non-conference schedule, they play a non-conference schedule
that's as tough as probably 85, 90% of the teams in the country. You look back
at Michigan State and Duke and Cincinnati and Illinois.  
I'm sure there are several other great teams that they played -- Wake Forest,
that I probably missed on. But they've earned the right to be 14th in the
country. And I almost feel honored that if they're an eighth seed and we're a
ninth seed, people are considering us being -- kind of close to where they
are. I know that that's going to be a challenge. But that's what excites you.  
Anytime you're a competitor, you like to be put in those situations where you
are playing a team that's nationally ranked, that's gotten a lot of
recognition. They have earned that status, and you have an opportunity to go
play against them. I told our players I can't think of a better bracket to be
in than to play against -- I guess you have to call them a perennial power
now. And if we're successful against them, you get a chance to play against
the local team that's the number one seed. I think the stars are lined up for
us. All we have to do is go out and play and be successful. I like this
opportunity and I give them a lot of credit. They've earned the right to have
the following that they have. They are really committed. They definitely have
earned it.  
  
Q. Leonard, can you talk about the qualities that make Chris Singleton such
a good defensive player? How has that developed? It's easy for guys to play
offense. A lot of guys don't want to play defense. What has made him that kind
of player?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think that's an excellent observation. It says a lot about
his character, his tough conditions, his ability to understand that the -- to
evaluate his abilities and see how he can best take advantage of his God-given
talents. He played center in high school. Was basically the back to the
basket; step out and shoot a standing jumper. He's basically come from -- he's
gone from being an interior player in high school to a perimeter player in
college, which is even more of an adjustment. He never played in a high school
game where he took 15 shots in a game. That's unusual for a guy who is a
McDonald's All-American. But I think what he's done, he's adapted, realizing
the transition on the offensive end is probably one that he's still in the
process of making. But the thing that he's capable of doing is using his left,
his anticipation, his size, his strength and athleticism to impact the game.  
I think he does a very good job of taking away vision because of his long
arms. I think he is a good athlete, he has good anticipation and he has a
strong athletic body. And I think that he has innate quickness. He has a sense
of how to anticipate where the ball is going, that gave him the ability -- the
opportunity to lead the ACC in steals this year. That has never been done by a
guy 6'9".  
I think a guy 6'9", playing the perimeter that leads the league in steals and
in the top five of blocked shots is -- says a lot about the direction that
he's allowed his ability to take him. I think he's only scratched the surface
of his game. He's still adjusting to the perimeter. I think you're going to
see him just continue to keep going up and getting better and better as he
moves through his career.  
  
Q. What do you think your guys learned from last year? And does it carry
over? Does it apply?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think if it's anything, when I look back at last year, they
are going to have a better understanding that you have to play 40 minutes. You
can't -- if you have a lull in any -- at any point, anything is capable of
happening. I also think that we've talked about the fact that I'm not real
sure you can give a lot of credence to seeds and how you're placed in the NCAA
tournament. A lot of people vote. You don't really get a chance to see a whole
lot of teams. You go in with information on paper. But it's really a very
difficult process to properly seed these teams. You saw what happened today. I
mean -- and I think you have guys who have been on the committee all year,
they've been thinking about it, they've been reading, they've been watching
some games on TV. Now you still have those seeds that are supposed to be not
as good as the higher seeds and they still have the upsets. There have been
near upsets in even some of the other games. So this tells you that this
process is very, very difficult. And that's why I think I'm always champion in
increasing the field for that simple reason. This happens every single year.  
You have a lot of people playing very good basketball. And I think we need to
include a lot of people. When you take that into consideration, there are a
lot of good teams that are still not participating in this tournament. Not to
get off the subject, but I'm just saying that this is very difficult process.
That's why I think our guys understand that it shouldn't matter if the 16th
seed or the second seed, whoever you are playing will be a good basketball
team if you want to advance, you can't take any of those possessions off. Last
year we went up at halftime and came out the first five or six minutes, we
weren't totally as sharp as we were and we got our hats handed to us in an
overtime game.  
  
Q. Is there any part of Gonzaga's game that keeps you up at night, that you
guys have been studying or anything you look at and say, "okay, there's one
thing we need to focus on"?   
COACH HAMILTON: Good basketball team. They are a typical ACC opponent for us.
They're loaded with talent. They have quality, depth; seven foot, 6'11", 6'8".
They got two 6'5" guards that are as good as any guards we faced all year. We
are faced with these type of opponents on a regular basis. They are a good
basketball team. You have to put them in that same category. And so we have
tremendous amount of respect. But I'm not sure I'll stay up at night worrying
about anybody. But I do have a healthy respect for them. Because I think
they're really, really good basketball team. Very well coached and loaded with
talent.  
  
Q. Leonard, you won 22 games, you won 10 games in the ACC. There's not many
people in this room, a lot of talk in the town has been about Gonzaga. The ACC
tournament, the Final Four, people said was a sign of the struggles the league
had this year. Do you guys -- you guys who are in the tournament for the ACC
think you are trying to play for the league and show it's not what the pundits
have said it's been all year?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think what has happened over the years, we have had such
great basketball in the ACC. Most people think they've dominated for a long
period of time. But you have had a lot of perennial powers, basically Duke and
Carolina, that's always been consistent at the top. I think we've added three
additional teams and the gap is narrowing just like it is all over the United
States in every league. I think there's lot of close proximity from the top
teams in our league to the bottom teams in our league.  
Last year Carolina just kind of blew through the NCAA tournament. But when you
go back and look at the games they played in the ACC, they won a lot of close
games throughout the whole year. They had a lot of hard-fought games. They
might have had some games that maybe on paper they won by 12, 15 points, then
the last four or five minutes of the game, they were 3-4, 5 points going down
the stretch. No one said that the league was a great, great league because
they -- because the best -- the team that walked through the NCAA tournament
by a large margins, you know, had a lot of close victories against very good
basketball teams in the ACC.  
I think sometimes beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. You can use stats and
things and come to your own conclusion. I don't think there's anything I have
to try to prove. I think the league speaks for itself. I think the whole
climate of basketball is changing all over the country. I think you have a lot
of great, good basketball teams that don't get the exposure and the acclaim
and recognition.  
Once again, I'm a champion for adding more teams because I think that's the
nature of what's going on in our league. And I think it's obvious that's
what's happening in the ACC. No longer will you be able to just pick a
favorite and say the team is going to win a game. Every night in the ACC we're
going to war in the conference play.  
  
Q. You talked about grinding out wins this year. Is it safe to -- and you're
the top-rated defensive team with opposition field goal percentage. Is it safe
to have to say that you win games with your defense and you could lose games
with your defense as well? And how important is that defense going to be
tomorrow?  
COACH HAMILTON: It's interesting. We took a tour to Spain this summer. We
averaged 106 points per game. And as we practiced those ten days prior to
going to Spain, we didn't run a defensive drill. We did all offense. Because
we feel that we wanted to be that running team that averaged 80 or 90 points a
game. Once we got into the practice session, we found out that our skills
still had not developed to the point where we could be quite as efficient on
the offensive end as we like to. But we're very capable. I think when we go to
practice, it's amazing to me how consistently and how well we shoot the ball
from the perimeter in all our shooting drills and a lot of our scrimmages, how
well we shoot the ball, how well we shoot the ball from the free-throw line.  
I think that sometimes when you have those freshmen-dominated type teams
against the competition we're playing against, you have a period of
development in growing up. I think we're going through that. And I think we're
very fortunate to find ways to win games in spite of the stage that we're at.
So I'm not overly concerned about how we have to win games. I just want to
make sure we go out and just kind of play as well as we can each and every
game. And then we'll see what happens from there, offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. What went into when you made the change about ten games ago, move Snaer
to two guard and how has he played? What has he given you?  
COACH HAMILTON: What happened we were playing Michael and Deividas Dulkys were
both playing 22 minutes a game. Deividas is a sophomore, Michael is a
freshman. Michael went through periods most freshmen go through. They are
developing, they are learning, they are making a few mistakes. They still are
playing hard. Michael developed into one of our better defenders while he's
going through the early stages of making the adjustment to college. Deividas
had been shooting 40% from the three-point line. He was shooting the ball
extremely well. But for whatever reason, I thought Deividas was starting to
put a lot of pressure on himself and he was getting great looks and he went
through a period where he's 1-of-16 from the three-point line. We thought we
would take a little pressure off of him and switch the roles. And Michael is
playing better now that -- he was inserted into the lineup. Deividas started
shooting the ball much better when he had a little less pressure. They both
were playing about the same amount of minutes. So it was kind of a wash in
terms of who started, because they both -- Deividas might be playing more
minutes than he was playing when he started. I'm not real sure it made that
much difference from that standpoint. I thought it helped the overall team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

Duke  68  
California - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could please give us some opening thoughts about
the game tonight and we'll get questions for your players and questions for
you later.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Okay. We played an outstanding defensive game tonight
against a championship team. Cal with Mike Montgomery right away did something
that no one has done for 50 years at Cal and their conference; they won the
regular season. And we knew that they would have that pedigree, that air of a
champion about them. And we had unbelievable respect for them, and especially
their perimeter. Those three kids are such good shooters, and I thought the
discipline that we had defensively was the difference in the ballgame.  
Also we could match up a little bit better with them with Lance being on
Robertson instead of a bigger guy, and so we -- the kids played really hard,
and Brian and Miles on the highball screen with Randle stayed up there long
enough so Randle couldn't measure Nolan until Nolan got back.  
Just the kids played a beautiful defensive game. I'm really proud of them. And
when it got down to seven points, then there's a lot of game pressure on you.
We went to run motion and Brian got two big buckets. Zoubs was huge for us
throughout the game, especially at that time. We know we beat a really good
team, and we're happy to be moving on obviously.  
  
Q. Brian, can you talk a little bit about your dunk at the end of the game?
I think it was your first dunk since the Maryland game. Could you talk about
your enthusiastic response to that and what it did for the team?  
BRIAN ZOUBEK: For me two points is two points. Getting the dunk felt great. I
haven't been able to get that many open ones where I could just go up without
any contact, and I was excited. I knew that was a big point in the game where
we just created a little separation there. So it felt good.  
  
Q. Nolan, could you talk about the job that you did against their three-
point shooters, what tactics you guys did that you felt were effective?  
NOLAN SMITH: We stuck with their shooters. We couldn't give them any breathing
room, and we just really stuck with them. We really gave them no open looks on
ball screens. Our big guys really helped us, and Jon and Kyle, their perimeter
three-point shooters, they just stayed with them the whole game.  
  
Q. Do you expect the physical play that you got tonight? It seemed like the
bodies were kind of flying around inside tonight?  
BRIAN ZOUBEK: Yeah, it was a really tough game inside, a lot of elbows thrown,
a lot of contact. Both teams were playing hard, and we knew that the
rebounding was going to be an essential part of the game, so both teams were
fighting for it. I know that Boykin and Sanders were really being physical
underneath, and I know that for me without Lance being just as physical or
more physical than them, I wouldn't have gotten a lot of rebounds, and I
wouldn't have gotten a lot of stuff, so I've got to give a lot of props up to
him. He did a hell of a job.  
  
Q. For both guys, all the talk all the time is about the big three. Today
Jon was 1 of 11, but yourself and the Plumlees and a lot of guys who don't get
a lot of attention really played big games and had big roles. What does it say
about this team that you can win and win going away with Jon going 1 of 11?  
NOLAN SMITH: This team has so much talent and so much potential. Every game
somebody steps up, and that's the exciting thing about this team. We might not
shoot good every game, but we play defense and play hard, and any game
somebody is going to surprise you.  
  
Q. Nolan, did you sense any frustration from Randle as it became so clear
that he was not going to get any open looks? And if so, when did that occur?  
NOLAN SMITH: Really no frustration, because obviously he's a great player and
he's a great scorer, and looking at him, he stayed calm the whole game. But
from the getgo, I really wanted to make it clear that I was going to be in his
jersey the whole game. That was the game plan. I just stuck with him with the
help of my big guys. They really helped me out, and I owe it all to them. They
made my job easy fighting over screens and giving them no open looks.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you very much.  
We'll take questions for Coach Krzyzewski.  
  
Q. For those of us who haven't seen him all year, talk about the way Nolan
has blossomed and matured this season.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Good question. He has been probably the unsung hero, he and
Zoubs, I think, because you knew that Kyle and Jon coming in were going to be
-- and they have been really good. But Nolan, especially at the end of a
clock, is our go-to guy. He's been our on the ball defender the whole year. So
he's scoring and defending on the ball.  
That's a great combination. You have to be a very, very good player to be able
to do that. And he can still get a lot better. He can get a lot better. But
he's playing great basketball for us all year.  
His match-up against Randle was the key match-up of the game, just to make
sure Randle -- Randle gives them such verve. I mean, I've watched tapes of him
the last two days, and the first half against Oregon, I don't know if I've
seen a kid play better. And Nolan sees all that, and he helped keep him under
control while still scoring 20 points. That was a marvelous performance by
Nolan.  
  
Q. About Jon's shooting again, did you see anything other than what you were
talking about earlier in the week, the responsibility load? And you took him
out for about ten seconds --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I think he's -- Jon wants it so badly that I think
he's making every shot bigger than they are. I really believe that. It comes
from a good place.  
In our business or in any business, you want people who have great attitudes.
His attitude is so good that sometimes I think he just puts too much pressure
on himself.  
I will say this, that their kid Gutierrez is a very good defender. It's not
just Jon missing shots. Gutierrez gets in on you, and that was the guy
covering Jon all day. So to give that kid credit, Jon missed a couple open
ones, but he had to work hard to get a look.  
In saying that, Jon came up with one of the best defensive plays on their out
of bounds under, and we got the three play. That was a huge play in the game.  
  
Q. In past years if your team shot 3 for 17 from three, you probably
wouldn't have won the game. What makes this team different from past teams
that allowed you to do that today?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, in past teams, meaning the last few years, those kids
achieved as much as they could achieve. You know, I hate when somebody
compares those teams of the last couple years with our national championship
teams, and they say they under achieved. Are you kidding me? They won 30, 29
games. But they were limited teams, and they couldn't play the defense that
this team can play because we have big guys.  
That's the difference. We're a better team this year. I don't know if we'll go
any further, but this is a better team because it can play total defense, and
it doesn't have to rely on that other stuff. I mean, someone will say in the
past, well, they relied on the three-point shot. Well, what else were we going
to rely on? We relied on it enough to win 30 games. Just because then you
lose, doesn't mean those kids under achieved. They maxed. They maxed. This
team is better. It's not a great team, but it's a really -- it's an excellent
defensive team that hopefully can be a little bit better offensively as we go
forward.  
  
Q. We watched Kansas lose as the No. 1 seed yesterday. Did you mention that
at all to your players and kind of warn them of the dangers of possibly
overlooking a team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, no. Our team hasn't overlooked anybody at year because
we're not a great team. We've got to really prepare for every game, and every
team in the NCAA tournament prepares that way. Kansas didn't lose because they
looked ahead. Kansas lost because Northern Iowa played a great game. Kansas
didn't play badly against them.  
We didn't talk much about it, but we had our team meeting last night. It just
occurred at 8:00, right after the game. So they -- obviously they knew it
right away. And what we pointed out was that the reason Kansas lost was two of
Northern Iowa's kids took charges in the last few minutes. So any one of you
guys could take a charge and it might win a game. The other thing is I think
the kid Cook got that offensive rebound and then dunked it. It was one of the
great plays of this basketball season. And it wasn't a called play, and so
that was our theme to our team is that those are the kind of plays that the
winning teams will make going forward.  
The other team didn't make losing plays; you have to make winning plays in
this tournament. So that's what we talked about after the Kansas game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Thank you to the organizing committee and everyone here in
Jacksonville. You all have been fantastic to all the teams. We won, so it
makes it even better, but I would say that even if we lost, all right? Thanks.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

Cornell  87  
Wisconsin - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could please give us an opening statement about
the game and we'll take some questions for your guys and then questions for
you last.  
COACH DONAHUE: You know, I just thought in all my coaching, all the experience
I had on any team that I ever played on, this game here was as well executed
that I couldn't even imagine that we could play that well in the stretches
that we did. That's not to say that I don't think we can play well, I just
think -- I have so much respect for Wisconsin and how hard they play, how well
they defend. These guys did a remarkable job of staying poised throughout
every single possession, had great confidence and great awareness for each
other and just executed on both sides of the ball as well as you can do.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you, I guess, talk about the start that you guys got off to? It
was 11-1 before they really knew what hit them, and what was kind of your
plan? You came out and it looked like you were looking for your shot right off
the bat.  
RYAN WITTMAN: Yeah, you know, obviously the start is an important part to the
game. It wasn't necessarily us trying to start a game plan of getting me shots
right away. I think I just found myself in position coming off some ball
screens and stuff. I think one was an out-of-bounds play. I think they were
just kind of in the flow of the game. It wasn't necessarily something that we
said in the locker room that we were going to start out doing or anything.  
  
Q. Ryan, has there been another game in your memory where you've had as hot
a shooting night, or is that a personal best?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Probably not. You know, I got a lot of good looks. A lot of
credit has to go to our bigs, Jeff Foote is one of the best screeners in the
nation. I know our coach always talks about how he just swallows guys up, and
that's critical when you play a team like Wisconsin who's always trailing,
who's always fighting through some screens extremely hard.  
I think just about -- it seemed like every one of my baskets was coming off a
ball screen or a dribble handoff from him.  
  
Q. For Ryan and Lou, can you just address the next game with Kentucky, and
do you feel like you can continue to run your offense at such a high level
against a team with such great athleticism?  
LOUIS DALE: You know, watching Kentucky on TV, they're a great team. You can
tell that from the beginning. They like to push it, and I think we just want
to stay within ourselves and do what we can do and do the things that we can
control.  
We've got eight seniors on this team, and we want to take this ride as long as
we can because after this it's just nothing but babies and memories, so we'll
just keep going. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Louis, what do you think the key to your offensive execution as a team
was?  
LOUIS DALE: I just think we have so many unselfish guys on this team. Nobody
really cares how it gets done, and we come out to make plays. And I think we
were able to do that tonight. It's just great to play with these guys, and I
think the key to our success is just being unselfish.  
  
Q. Louis, this game you were pretty much getting to the basket at will.
You're obviously not an average Ivy League type player. Do you feel like you
as a point guard can compete with any point guard in the country? I mean, next
game you're facing John Wall who a lot of people think is the best point guard
in the country. How do you compare yourself to guys like that that get all the
national attention?  
LOUIS DALE: Yeah, I think starting with myself and guys on this team, we're
all confident in ourselves and what we can do. You know, we all want to go out
there and we're going to compete, and we're just going to give it our best
shot.  
As far as playing in the Ivy League versus I guess Kentucky or SEC, I feel I
can play on any level, and so it should be a good match-up.  
  
Q. Chris, the way this game unfolded, obviously you guys got off to a great
start and just played better and better as the game went on it seemed. But you
come out in what is probably the biggest game you've ever played in. You have
to have butterflies or you have to have concerns. Things start going your way.
How much easier is it to play as the game goes on and things start to go your
way, and did you guys just get into the kind of flow mentally where you felt
like, all we have to do is play the way we play?  
CHRIS WROBLEWSKI: Yeah, I mean definitely Witt got off to a hot start, and
when he's hitting shots like that and Louis is playing like that, it's a lot
easier on the rest of us. We got off to a good start, which obviously is going
to help our confidence and everything.  
But I think coach scheduled -- a schedule like we did this year for games like
this, so we've been in this kind of environment before. So I think that was a
lot easier to keep our poise and composure down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks a lot. We'll start with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Wisconsin leads the country in fewest turnovers allowed per game.
Can you talk a little bit about your team today having fewer turnovers than
Wisconsin and what that says about your squad?  
COACH DONAHUE: Well, I think they obviously didn't turn the ball over too
much. I thought they missed some shots. Mixing up the defense was, I thought,
a key to the game because they're very methodical in their man to man stuff. I
thought our ability to play some different zones made it difficult.  
You know what, we're not a team that really turns it over a lot, and this
game, although Wisconsin is a very good basketball team, especially
defensively, they're not a team that really turns people over. I was pretty
confident that they hadn't seen a team like us in their league play. The
beauty of this tournament is that after you get out of your league play, no
one knows you as well, so you're able to do what you really do well, and the
other team has to make adjustments, and it's difficult.  
Wisconsin plays a certain way that's very successful in the Big Ten. I just
think we have guys who have different skill packages that make it difficult
for them to guard us like they guard most Big Ten teams.  
  
Q. In both the Temple game and today, your guys never really had to fend off
that run that they may close it to two or three points and then you guys
respond. What did you guys do to keep them at bay and sustain that lead
throughout both second halves?  
COACH DONAHUE: Well, I do think getting off to a great start was key. I go
back to the Penn game where we weren't ready to go from the start, and we've
used that to our motivation, that we're going to deliver the first punch.
We're going to go out and make plays. Even if they're bad plays, we're going
to make mistakes, great, but we're going to be the aggressor. I thought we did
a great job of coming out and really knowing what Wisconsin was going to do.
Go out and make plays. Be the aggressor. It just flowed.  
I don't know why we kept in that frame, we just played great basketball.
Looking at kids that played 120 games together that are very good basketball
players.  
They're unselfish and I don't think that's the key. That's one of the keys.
The other key is they're talented. These are talented basketball players that
are unselfish.  
  
Q. Can you talk about those different zones, the looks you gave them, how
many different zones you used and why that bothered them so much?  
COACH DONAHUE: Well, I think Wisconsin is such a deliberate team. They run a
swing offense, and I thought if we're going to do something a little different
-- we did a two-two-one full court. I think we started out a one-two-two
three-quarter court, back to man, and then midway through to first half, we
went with a one-three-one, and then we switched into man in the middle
possession. It's just another advantage I have, when kids are very
intelligent, they can change on the fly. I was able to play guys on the
defensive end that are very good at that and then when we got stoppages, get
the offensive guys back in the game, and that seemed to work well today.  
  
Q. Coach, you're the only team in the field that has actually already played
two No. 1s on the road in their place, two of the tougher places in the
country to play. Is that going to be beneficial from the standpoint of your
team understanding you definitely can compete in that circumstance?  
COACH DONAHUE: I don't think there's any question. I think those games have
already benefitted us greatly. The Kansas environment was a big step for us.
That was a huge game. I thought that was a great effort by our guys. I really
felt good after that game, even though we lost, and in some ways -- I was not
happy we lost, but I thought it would be great motivation to get through our
league, and if we got this opportunity to play these type of teams that we
would be ready.  
Now in the NCAA tournament, you get a neutral side, you get great officials.
You just really get an opportunity to play your game against teams in a real
honest, clean environment, which for a mid major against high majors is very
difficult.  
  
Q. Could you describe the moment afterwards going into the crowd and being
with your family? I don't know who the guy was that you hugged, I assume he
was the athletic director at Cornell?  
COACH DONAHUE: Yeah, that's Andy Noel, who stood by our program for the first
seven, eight years when we really didn't do much (tearing up) and had great
belief in what we were doing. It doesn't happen a lot in college basketball in
particular that someone sticks by a coach for this long, and I'm very
fortunate that I was able to reward him for all of his patience.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

Duke - 68  
California - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could please give us an opening statement about
tonight's game.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, we obviously played a very good basketball team as
advertised, as we expected. They're big, they're physical, they're a veteran
team that knows how to play.  
I thought that we kind of got off to a tough start with Pat getting his eye
split and Jorge getting a quick foul kind of set the tone, but I thought we
competed physically. We didn't back down. We were clearly undersized in a lot
of situations. Statistically you look and you're kind of wondering where the
difference is. They didn't shoot it very well from three. They out rebounded
us but not appreciably. We knew it was going to be a problem -- generally when
you play a team like that, my experience is the more time you have to try to
ready yourself for how they play gives you a better opportunity to do some
things.  
But we would have had to really, really play well, make all our shots. I
thought defensively we did a pretty good job, but again, give credit to Duke.
They're a great basketball team. But I feel like we can hold our heads high,
that we competed, just couldn't make it happen.  
  
Q. For either one of you, just talk about the difficulty that their size
posed for you guys?  
JAMAL BOYKIN: Well, we've played against teams with size and competed. They
just seemed to know us very well. It seems like the scouting report, they
executed it to the tee, so when you have that size and length and you're
executing the scouting report very well, it makes it difficult to play
against.  
  
Q. Jerome, what was more difficult for you in your struggle to get really
good open looks? Was it just Smith playing against you, or was it not being
able to get around the big guys up high when they came out?  
JEROME RANDLE: They had a pretty good scouting report. They just tried to take
the ball out of my hands as much as possible, you know, and just -- I feel
like we didn't really execute as a team well. You know, they just crowded me
coming off the ball screens. That was really it.  
  
Q. For either of you, has it sunk in that you've just completed your last
college game, and what was going through your head in the final moments when
you realized that it would be the final game?  
JAMAL BOYKIN: It definitely hasn't. To imagine that this is the last time
we'll put on a California uniform and play, it hasn't sunk in yet. But the one
thing about it, when you put so much work and effort into a program, you're
always a part of the program. So while we may no longer be players for
California, we'll always be a part of the family.  
And on top of that, this isn't the last time we'll play basketball. For the
seniors, we will continue to play basketball. We have a lot of time now to
reflect on it. It's been a great ride, and we just have to look for the
positives in the situation.  
  
Q. Same question for Jerome.  
JEROME RANDLE: Well, I mean, it hasn't hit me yet, but like Jamal said, this
is my last college game, so honestly, I'm really proud of this team. The
PAC-10 has taken a beating the whole year. For us to come here and really just
play hard against Louisville, everyone didn't think that we was going to win
that game, we was able to come in and, you know, play really hard against
Duke, I'm really proud of my team. It's obviously over right now, but I'm just
proud of the way we hustled and played hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you very much.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Zoubek's production today? He's obviously become
something more than just a body.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, a lot of what he got was on drop-offs from help. We
knew they would try to post Singler. We had match-up problems kind of across
the board.  
We weren't concerned about Zoubek individually on one-on-one moves, but when
you try to get help with Singler posting at 6'8", then they do a great job of
dropping off. They have a great awareness of where everybody is. He pushes a
lot. I mean, he barges you and he's a great position guy. He anticipates when
the ball is going to be shot, and he gets you early underneath the basket.
He's very strong.  
Most of what he got was drop-offs, just where we were trying to help on a
drive or stepping up and that type thing, and then they would drop it down and
he finished up. So it's nice to have that luxury. He plays 17 minutes a game
and generally is very, very physical in that time, and then they come off with
either of the Plumblees, which are pretty dog gone good. He can afford to be
physical and get done what he can do, depending on how the game is going to be
called, and he was very productive for them today.  
  
Q. Among the match-up problems you were talking about, the ones on Robertson
and Christopher in particular, they had a very hard time getting any kind of
open looks. Did you anticipate it would be that tough for them, or did Duke's
players play better against them than you thought they would?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: No, we knew how they were going to play. I mean, they were
well-prepared, where they would have gotten their scouting information or what
kind of effort they put in, that seems easy to figure. They just face guarded
Pat. They just stayed up on the high side and face guarded him totally. You
can do that a little bit easier if you've got size inside to protect the
basket, and we had a hard time getting looks for Pat. Obviously he didn't get
very many shots.  
As I said before, Duke forces you to put the ball on the floor, and we were --
the ball was in Jorge's hands and Theo's hands a lot because they were the two
guys that could get open and make some penetration. But they simply were not
going to let Pat catch the ball, and same thing with Jerome. So we had a
difficult time. And that's what's happened all year long; when those two guys
are not able to get shots or make points, we struggle a little bit because we
don't have five guys that can score numbers.  
I thought Jamal rushed his shots a little bit. Jamal had a lot of looks.
Obviously this was a huge game for Jamal in his mind in playing against his
former school, and he missed some shots that he normally would make. So we
weren't able to make up for lack of clean shot opportunities from Jerome and
Pat.  
  
Q. Were you at all surprised that Duke shot so poorly from the three-point
line but yet was still able to control the game?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, they pretty much had their way inside, I would say, in
terms of finishing. They had a lot of mid-range stuff. We weren't able to do a
very good job with Nolan Smith, for example. He was very good one-on-one. That
turned out to be a tougher match-up than we thought. I thought we contested
threes pretty well. We tried to fire up on the on balls. We got in some foul
trouble trying to do that, we didn't get up cleanly. But I thought we did a
pretty good job of contesting threes, but it did leave us vulnerable inside
and they were able to get some second shot opportunities, and probably more
than anything they broke us down on the dribble and were able to get in the
paint and made some nice mid range shots. We fouled them a couple times from
three-point range that hurt us. I think we had three stops, down nine and
weren't able to convert any one of them. I think our major problem was
offensively. I don't think it was defensively.  
  
Q. Talk first of all just a little bit about what your overall impression of
the Duke team and maybe its potential, and secondly about your team and what
it accomplished this year and specifically the seniors and what they were able
to do.  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, I don't know what Duke's record is, it's 30 and 3 or
something, so obviously they're not a bad team. ACC is a great league, and to
go through the league like they did -- you look at their guys, and how many of
them are Top 20 type recruits. They've got three seniors, two juniors. They're
kids that have been in a proven system for four years that always emphasizes
the same things, so we know what they want to do, they know how they want to
do it. They only play seven or eight guys, but those guys are all very, very
highly recruited and quality players. So you start with that. They know how to
win.  
They've got one of the best coaches in the history of the game in Mike. They
have a tradition there that they expect to play into April. There's just a lot
of things that makes Duke very, very good and difficult to beat. They got a
No. 1 seed for a reason.  
So when you get an 8 seed, that's what you get. If you can win your first
game, which is supposedly an even game, then you're going to get the No. 1
seed, and they set it up that way. We're 3,000 miles away playing a No. 1 seed
that's a very good basketball team. We would have had to do everything well.
We didn't move the ball as well as we needed to. Part of it then being
physical, they bounce you around on your cuts.  
As for our team, I guess I would say to you, who would have imagined two years
ago that we would have won the PAC-10 conference, played into the second round
of the NCAA, won 24 games. We made just a tremendous amount of progress as a
group. We had a lot of issues that we had to face this year. We had kids get
hurt. We didn't have great depth. But yet I thought that they came together as
a group. They learned how to play together. They learned how to win games.  
That's all you can ask. I think if we played Duke ten times, they would
probably win more than we would. I think we can compete, but you know, you've
got a one-game situation to do that.  
I'm really proud of these kids. I think that they battled. We beat a good
Louisville team, beat them fairly -- I mean, it was a nice margin of victory.
It wasn't a fluke, and we came out and competed. We probably just were a
little bit overmatched in a lot of ways and there wasn't a whole lot we could
go. I thought Markhuri came in with his size and gave us a little bit of a
physical presence in there.  
  
Q. Talking about the seniors and maybe going beyond basketball, what's been
the most enjoyable part of coaching them for you over the past two years?  
COACH MONTGOMERY: Well, watching them grow as people. You know, I mean, the
job opened for a reason. There was issues that we had to deal with, and to
watch them grow personally, all five of our seniors are on track to graduate.
They are taking classes right now that if they do their work and pass, they're
going to graduate. And I think that's spectacular.  
You know, Cal is not an easy school, and they're in a position to do so. So I
think all of them in their own way is going to have an opportunity to play
someplace -- not all in the NBA, but someplace. They're quality kids, and you
know, it's just fun. It's a different type of group than I've probably ever
had, and it's fun to get to know kids like this and watch them develop
personally. They have a very strong feeling for one another, and that's good
to see.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

Cornell  87  
Wisconsin - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could give us an opening statement about the
game, then we'll take questions for your guys and then questions for you.  
COACH RYAN: Cornell did everything that they've been pretty much doing all
year. They found different ways to score on us, and it's tough when you shoot
52 percent in the first half and you're still down 12, and you've taken away
Foote, and three of the threes that they hit were off of offensive rebounds.
So in our half court defense, we thought we did some pretty good things.  
That's how good they are. They can beat you in so many different ways. So I
give a lot of credit to Steve and especially the development of that team with
all the seniors and the way they played off of one another. That was something
that once you got behind to them, it made it very, very difficult to get back,
and good teams will do that to you.  
  
Q. This is for any of the three of you guys. Now that you've gone against
them, can you talk about their offense? They obviously did this to Temple, as
well, who like you guys have a tremendous defense. Now that you've gone
through it, what was different from what you were maybe expecting?  
JASON BOHANNON: I mean, they shot the ball very well. They got us doing stuff
that wasn't necessarily characteristic of our defensive game plan, and when
they started doing that and hitting those type of shots, they got all their
confidence going. They certainly got their confidence going early from the
getgo, and it's tough to fight back from that, even when they are shooting a
high percentage and they're hitting those type of shots, it's tough.  
But you've got to give Cornell credit. They came out ready to play, and they
certainly showed it.  
  
Q. Jon, the seeds say Cornell is a 12 seed, but how good is that team?
You've played a lot of different teams from a lot of conferences.  
JON LEUER: We never pay attention to what seed they are. We knew they were a
great team by what they did this year. They're going to be a tough out for
anybody in the tournament because they can all shoot and they all play well
off of one another. We just have to give them credit. I mean, they just --
they beat us.  
  
Q. You were the only one that really seemed to have it going offensively.
How much pressure did you feel having to score and keep your team within
striking distance in this game?  
JON LEUER: I didn't feel any added pressure. I was just doing whatever I could
to help my team win. You know, we were -- I was just trying to take advantage
of any opportunity I could, and I knew we would have guys eventually step it
up, and they did, but Cornell just kept -- stuck to their game plan, and their
guys just executed in every phase of the game.  
  
Q. Trevon, you guys hang your hat on defense. How frustrating was that to
see a team put up 87 points on you like that?  
TREVON HUGHES: It was very frustrating, but they shot the ball well. We had
our hands in their faces on a couple of their jump shots, and their confidence
got going from that. It's hard to take away their confidence when they're
clicking on all cylinders, and like Jason said, it started from the tip. We
hang our hat on our defense, but we kind of got antsy, and when we're down,
it's kind of hard coming back from a good team.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday when you met with us, you said that come coaches had
sent you messages saying what a nightmare this team was to prepare for in one
day. Now that you've gone through it, what would be your assessment of what
the other coaches were telling you?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I'm not sure three or four days would have stopped what they
do, because they just do it well. And we could tell by timing. You can tell by
watching tape, a lot of times about cuts, reads and how guys are on the same
page. I said before we had to create some doubts. Maybe it was with our local
radio guys. We had to create some doubts with them early, and what we were
trying to do in one day, we said, okay, we'll take -- we'll limit Foote's
touches in the low post. When he did get in the second half, he didn't miss.  
We limited his touches. We were over on the screens on the threes. The threes
-- three of the four threes that they got, as I said -- so I'm answering your
question about preparation. So we're trying to force tough jumpers, which
we've done forever, and they hit some of those. But to get three threes off of
three offensive rebounds on throwbacks, on kick-outs, it does stick a dagger
in, and it's not that you go, oh, we have no chance now. Of course not.  
But what happened was they gained some confidence from that, and then you're
playing from behind. Good teams like this, experienced, you play from behind,
you cheat a little bit -- the last three, four lay-ups, obviously we were
trying to overplay in some passing lanes, and they're going to get lay-ups and
that's what we try to do to people when we have a lead.  
So the preparation was -- first of all, take away what they won with in the
last game, and our players saw some of the game. We watched tape against other
team. They were better than Kansas at Kansas. Our players knew that. Our
players respect opponents as much as anybody that I've ever been around. But
the idea is once they get it going, and then you try to counter some things,
they have better counters. Their counters forced us into some tough
situations, and then we're trying on the offensive end to get quicker shots,
so it speeds up.  
The number of points has never bothered me in this type of a game like against
Maryland when they started hitting all those shots our first year here, and
you've got to play quicker, you've got to try to get -- when we played North
Carolina, quick possessions, played quicker, we were scoring, and we were
keeping it tight. But when you get against a team like this and you get behind
like that, too many experienced players making reads off of any cheat that you
make.  
  
Q. The last question for Steve was about his exchange with his athletic
director at the end of the game, and he got pretty emotional and he said that
it was great that he stuck by him for seven or eight years until something
like this happened. Knowing your basketball background, can you appreciate
that kind of -- in our society now, it's win now, and can you talk about what
that moment must have been like for him?  
COACH RYAN: He had this team building, you could see it, and it's so special
in the NCAA. There are teams like this that come along every once in a while
-- I'm serious, every once in a while. Northern Iowa has that going right now.
And it doesn't matter what level, it doesn't matter level; it's scholarship
players getting a chance to play.  
You know, people having faith in people, that's a pretty good thing. I would
say that's a real good thing. And Steve is the kind of guy you would want to
have faith in because he knows what he's doing; it was a matter of getting
those guys, getting them to stay together, and they tasted the Ivy
championships, they wanted more. They wanted more. They stayed hungry, and
like I said, they stayed together. That's an example of it right now.  
The win at all cost stuff and some of the stuff that I see happening, I can't
even begin to get into that with you. But we're professionals; we get our joy,
we get our pleasure, we get our inner peace from working with these young men
every day, trying to make them better, trying to make them better people,
better players, better students, whatever it is. That's what we go home to and
get up in the morning and look in the mirror to every day.  
Other people will take their shots, will try to demean, humiliate, show their
petty jealousy, show pettiness, period. With teams like in the NCAA tournament
or during the year if you've had a rough year, I know all that stuff is out
there. That's human nature.  
But the fact that he stuck with Steve, he probably saw him working those guys
in practice. He probably had exit interviews with other players, probably
talked to people. Hey, Steve is demanding, he tries to get people to do things
a certain way, and it looks pretty smart now to stick with it, doesn't it? I
mean, you're saying like if he wasn't sticking with him? Was there a time that
he wasn't? There's no doubt, right?  
  
Q. No, he just got real emotional thinking about -- he felt real fortunate
that there were some bad times and he wouldn't be sitting here right now if it
didn't happen.  
COACH RYAN: That's a good thing. It is so hard to get into this thing and do
this and keep it going. The bad night happens to us, it's happened to some
other teams. I hope a bad night doesn't happen to anybody, but it has to,
because there's going to be how many more losses between now and the
championship game.  
But our guys earned the right to push this thing as hard as we could, just
didn't have enough push today.  
  
Q. Coach, about the disappointment right now, who was positive about this
year and what do you look forward to for next year?  
COACH RYAN: Well, that inner peace I was talking about is I saw guys get
better, I saw guys bond in the off-season. They worked at some things. Tough
schedule. They handled the tough schedule. They won a couple neutral games
against good teams. They won -- they beat a team like Duke that's here now,
and they did a lot of other good things to put themselves in position in the
Big Ten.  
I don't go there when it comes to anything else about what might have been or
what could have been. I just always look at the end at the picture and say,
this group did a lot of good things. But there's going to be a lot of
disappointment out there for a lot of good teams.  
  
Q. Based on the convincing nature of Cornell's two victories here in
Jacksonville, going forward, and particularly since they were against two very
good defensive teams, what type of team do you see giving them the most
trouble?  
COACH RYAN: Well, you know, it's like anything else. If you're longer
athletically on maybe some of the perimeter shooters, you saw our three guards
out there, it was tough to match up with a Wittman, but we tried. Our guys --
Jordan Taylor is a bulldog. He went after him. Then we went a little bigger
with Tim Jarmusz and Ryan Evans and tried to use some different people on
them. But they have so many weapons that a team is going to have to beat them,
is going to have to be a team that can get them a little deeper on their
shots, get them out of rhythm on their cuts. They're going to have to be, I
would think, a little bit better at eliminating second shots because they are
pretty aggressive, and Foote is pretty long, and that definitely showed in the
first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.
