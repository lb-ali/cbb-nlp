_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  53  
Stanford - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome up to the dais Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, as well as student-athletes Nneka Ogwumike and Kayla Pedersen.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I want to congratulate UConn on a national championship, and
a great second half. Their players really stepped up big. They were physical
the whole game, then they knocked down some shots in the second half.  
And then, secondly, I'd like to compliment Stanford, our team, and the players
up here, Nneka and Kayla, who really battled for us. We just -- we came up
short. We did not score as we needed to score.  
But I'm really proud of them. And I thought that they really worked very hard
for our team. Not just tonight, but all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, you guys said yesterday you couldn't let them go on a run, and
that's what they started the second half with. Could you talk about this for a
few minutes?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Going into halftime, we all told everybody that we know
they're going to make their run. You know, we have to keep playing our
lockdown defense. 12 points in the first half was extremely helpful for us.
But we weren't able to capitalize and come back from that.  
And I think we kept fighting, kept fighting, but things weren't falling. And
we got a little bit extended on defense more so than we should have. They
started rebounding a little bit better. And, I don't know, we needed to make
our own run, and we didn't really do that.  
  
Q. Nneka, could you just talk about the second half? It seemed like they
really locked down on you and tried to do whatever they could to take you out
of it.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, yeah, they were sagging in. And it was as if every
time I went into the block and tried to make a move, there was always someone
there waiting for me. They were sagging off our other posts and there was a
lot of help-side. It wasn't really easy to score. And usually I would get
passes off of them helping up. And I was able to finish when my teammate would
pass it to me when they helped off the weak side.  
But it was definitely congested. But in the second half we were definitely
stagnant in the -- I wouldn't say the first ten minutes, we didn't score for a
while, and they were scoring. I think we played pretty good defense. We just
couldn't respond on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Both you girls, the first half they could throw it in the ocean. You all
weren't a heck of a lot better. Was it just the dome, the spaciousness, the
stage? What do you think was going on?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: No, I don't think it was the dome. I don't think it was the
floor. I think both teams were just playing very good defense. Taking away
everybody's strengths. Both teams stuck to their game plan in the first half.
But, I mean, we were taking good shots. They just didn't fall.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, in the first half, I think it was just -- we played
exceptionally good defense in the first half. I think that was great. We held
them to 12 points.  
I mean, I don't know how it was for them, but I just don't think we were
concentrating enough on our shots. I know I wasn't. I could have made a lot of
shots in the first half. But it was just kind of -- I think we were either
over- or underfocusing. It was one of the two.  
And it was causing us to miss shots that we make every day.  
  
Q. Nneka, Maya Moore had as much trouble as everyone else on her team in the
first half, but then she was the catalyst in the second half. Did you fear it
was just a matter of time before she got off?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I wasn't fearing anything. I was trying my hardest on
defense. My coaches told me I did a good job defensively the first half. The
second half I was getting screened more.  
And they were screening each other more. So it caused a lot of kind of
franticness because we were switching. And so I think that's kind of how she
kind of got off.  
But I can't say that I was fearing that she was going to get going. The goal
is to stop her from get going. And I think we did a pretty good job of that in
the first half.  
  
Q. Nneka, just a little bit more on Maya Moore. Did she do anything that you
hadn't expected? You had seen a tape of her for quite a while now. Can you
comment about what it was like to play against her and just how good she
really was?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, this is the third time that I've guarded her. She
didn't do -- I wouldn't say she did anything different. She's a good player.
She works hard on trying to get open and works hard on hitting down her shots.  
And, I mean, she's a hard person to guard. I had a hard time guarding her all
three times. I tried my best each time. I think I did a little bit better
today.  
But I wouldn't say that she did anything different.  
  
Q. I have two questions. One is with respect to your other post, Jayne
Appel. She appeared to be visibly in pain for good portions of the game. Could
you talk at all about how that was for her, if you know? The second is: You
seem to be playing a little bit further from the hoop than is often the case.
Was that something they were doing to you on defense, or was that part of your
game strategy?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: With regard to Jayne, honestly, I didn't see what had
happened. I saw she was in pain, but that's the extent of my knowledge about
that. It's always tough to go down in a game as big as this. But honestly, I
mean, I know right now she's probably hurting more from the loss than whatever
injury it is or even if it is an injury.  
And me being away from the basket today, I think we didn't want to -- I didn't
want -- Tara told us she didn't want us to congest the paint any more than it
was. We tried our best to spread things out. I mean, that's pretty much the
extent of that.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk a little bit about Jayne's struggle tonight? The
0-for-12 was kind of a big number sticking out on that box score, but how did
that impact what you guys do offensively?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I mean, I think Jayne gave it her all. She's probably upset
about that. But, I mean, she's the force of our team. We're not going to stop
going to her. She kept battling through.  
One of the great things about her is she's very unselfish. If she's not
scoring, she's going to dish out the ball to other players that are wide open,
because Jayne demands attention.  
So, I mean, no, I'm just very proud of her for fighting through all the pain.
She never let any of us know what was going on, because she didn't want that
on her mind. So I'm just very proud of her today.  
  
Q. Both players, could you talk about what was the mood and the thinking at
halftime? You've only given up 12 points but you're only up by 8?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I'd say we were focused. We weren't all high from being up,
because we were up at halftime in December and we know what happened after
that.  
But we were just very focused, and just kept telling each other, 20 more
minutes and keep doing what we're doing. But unfortunately that didn't happen.  
  
Q. Nneka or Kayla, whoever wants to answer, sort of in the same vein, after
halftime, you know, you guys missed some easy shots. So probably wish you'd
been up a little bit more. You knew UConn was going to make a run, because
they always do. Still, when they made their run, at the end you guys didn't
give up. And I'm wondering if you're going to be able to take anything from
the way you were resilient at the very end of the game into the rest of your
careers?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, absolutely. You learn from every game. We knew that
they were going to come out on a run, because we kind of locked them down
defensively in the first half. But at the same time, like you said, we could
have made easier shots that could have created a larger lead.  
I think what we learned most about this game is how poised we stayed, and also
how hard we want to continue to work to be able to get to where we want to go.  
  
Q. Does this hurt a little bit more because you realize if you had played
better tonight, it was there for the taking?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Definitely. Yeah, I think our whole team is hurting right now
to be that close. You know, to be winning at halftime and to make our run at
the very end. It hurts to lose. But, I mean, quite frankly, I'm just angry. I
don't want to be that LSU team that never wins a national championship. So I
think that's what the players that are returning are thinking right now. And I
know Nneka and I were talking, we're just so ready to go.  
And for the players that aren't returning, I mean, I'm just so proud of them
and this whole entire team. This is probably my favorite team that I've played
on all three years, and I'm glad I'm losing with them.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: And I think that's why it hurts the most, too, also,
because I've only been here for two years, and this team -- I mean, it's more
special than any team I've ever been on, AAU, high school, middle school,
anything. I think that's why it hurts the most, because we wanted to win it
with this group of people. But life moves on. You keep working.  
  
Q. Nneka, can you talk about UConn's defense? What did they do in the second
half that maybe they weren't doing in the first?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think they just kind of amped it up like they did when we
played them December 23rd. They weren't -- I wouldn't say -- they kind of
pressed us a little bit more. They were trying to pressure us, and also sag
in.  
And so they were leaving people, and they were flying out on some people. And
the people that they were leaving, for example, me, I mean, I could have hit
some shots, and, quite frankly, that's all I'm thinking about right now, just
going back and improving.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about the first half versus the second half, the
difference between the two and the struggles you guys just had trying to
score?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't know that it was an extreme difference. I think we
wasted a lot of opportunities in both halves. And I think that it's -- Jayne
being healthy and just playing a regular game, in all four years, you could
correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never seen her go O-fer.  
She had some really nice shots early. I thought people were rushing shots. I
think she wanted to play well. Very badly. She's playing against Tina Charles
since she was 11 years old.  
And she really battled. And she was in a lot of pain. And just kept going at
it. But the ball was not dropping for her. So without getting any low block
scoring from Jayne, and I think that -- I thought they did a good job.  
But you have to know that Nneka coming off of 38 points, this was -- it was
very physical. And, you know, Nneka just -- is going to have to really learn
from this. And we needed to have some kind of go-to playing. And we didn't
have that.  
I thought Kayla stepped up for us. We had some inopportune turnovers. They did
go on that big run. Defensively, I thought we worked very hard and did a great
job in the first half. I can't even imagine them only scoring 12 points. That
is really just -- it was just an incredible job defensively and focused.  
But offensively, we -- besides Kayla, basically we didn't have anyone show up
that was making shots for us or -- it was a struggle.  
But I guess our defense was awesome. And I thought, you know, you look at
statistically, the field goals attempted, pretty much the same. 3s are pretty
much the same. They got a lot more free throws than we did.  
Just offensive boards. We worked hard to keep them off the offensive boards.
They're similar, although maybe not -- they blocked more shots than we did.
But our fouling, I mean, that's not -- some of it I think was at the end also
fouling, wanted to try to get the ball.  
I think someone already said it was there for the taking.  
  
Q. I think it was yesterday, one of the days, you said that you thought
realistically they may have to have an off game for you all to win. Well, you
know, your defense had something to do with that. But they also had that off
game. Yet you weren't able to win the game. How frustrating and disappointing
is that? You got what you wanted, but still weren't able to get over the
top.  
COACH VANDERVEER: It's very disappointing. And it's very frustrating. I think
what's the hardest is Jayne having such a great career at Stanford and I just
-- I'm really sad for her to go out on this kind of game when last year, even
though we lost, last year she had 25.  
She just was not able to push off her ankle, and her foot's bothering her. And
I'm more sad for her than anything else.  
But as other people said, it just -- you know, Connecticut is -- they're
beating these people by 30 and 40 points. And we had a chance. And I just feel
like we wasted some opportunities.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your strategy against Maya and what worked in the
first half and what wasn't working in the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, in the second half I don't think we switched quick
enough on her. We were really looking to switch on her. And Tina started
setting more screens on her and harder screens. And for Nneka, especially, I
think she usually probably plays against a post player. They have four
perimeter players. She sometimes plays against perimeter players.  
But I thought our team -- you know, Maya Moore was the difference, you know?
If she's on our team, we win. She really stepped up and made big plays for
them.  
Tina Charles made a couple of plays down the stretch. But, really, she's a
great player and she made big plays.  
We weren't doing anything differently in the second half, but we weren't doing
things as well in the second half. I think the fact that we couldn't score
just -- it discourages you, too.  
  
Q. Why exactly did you take Rosalyn out and why did she play so little?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think Ros for us does a great job if she is what
I call a lockdown defender. And in this game we were switching a lot. And it
was harder for her to maybe to get that concept and help more.  
And the way they were playing Ros, they were off of her. They were sagging in
off of her. And I didn't feel like she was recognizing when she was open and
what shots to take.  
And I thought in the beginning of the game she was dribbling too much. Of
course, no one really came in and hit perimeter shots any more than she did.
But we needed perimeter shooting.  
And I thought -- I mean, JJ hit one. But she was like, what, 1-for-9. Kayla
was hitting for us. Jeanette was hitting a little bit. We needed that kind of
third person. And I kind of tried to look at it -- I also thought Mel helped
us run our offense a little bit.  
  
Q. This is your third consecutive Final Four. But this finish was not like
the last two that we saw. I wonder if you could just reflect a little bit
about it. I know it's really tough because you lost again. But this was so
much different than the Tennessee and then Connecticut last year.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, these are -- I really feel like our team came
in playing with confidence, and just we have more pieces. But at the same
time, just you can feel sometimes so close and at the same time feel so far
away.  
We just -- I think we really had a great year. Our coaches and players worked
very hard. And I'm not -- I'm not saying -- I'm very proud of what we've
accomplished. But when you -- we did come much closer. I think we really
learned a lot from that Tennessee game. And we learned that it was going to be
very physical.  
What you see all year is not what you see in the championship game. And our
team was ready for that. And it was very physical. And we have to be more
physical. Last year against Connecticut we were outplayed and we got down
early. But we didn't take advantage of opportunities, from my estimation.  
I mean, whether it was really some inopportune turnovers, really point-blank
shots, not getting to the free throw line, we never got out in transition. And
just some people that, you know, this is -- there was more in this game than
what maybe some people understood.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that first-half defense and just what was it that went
right, other than I guess everything?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think we switched well. We were out on people. We
didn't leave people wide open for shots. And we protected the baskets and
didn't give them second shots for the most part. That was our game plan. I
thought we came in and executed it very well. And to hold Connecticut to 53
points, you know, maybe they didn't shoot well.  
But some of that is related to people playing good defense and not giving them
a lot of second shots. Unfortunately, we sent them to the free-throw line too
many times.  
But our inability to score really hurt us.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit more about what your game plan was coming
into the game and what parts of it succeeded, what parts didn't?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think defensively we played -- we had -- we were
switching on their perimeter people. We wanted to box out. We wanted to get
back and not let them get easy run-outs. We wanted to take care of the ball.
Offensively, we wanted to go inside to Nneka. We wanted to go inside to Jayne.
And then that would open up things for our perimeter people.  
Kayla, I thought, had a great game. She knocked down perimeter shots. Jeanette
hit some perimeter shots for us. Jeanette getting into foul trouble hurt us.  
But besides that, we turned it over, and we didn't get the production we need
from our post player, Nneka and Jayne. That's what our game is: Go inside. And
when that -- when we struggle with that, we struggled.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Some of that was not by design. She had to battle in there
and be more aggressive against Maya Moore. And Maya Moore is a terrific
player. She's probably got, I don't know, 10 or 15 pounds on Nneka, and it was
really battling for position.  
That wasn't, you know -- that wasn't by design. But Nneka is a young player.
And she will learn from this and watch it and say, hey, this is what I need to
be doing.  
  
Q. I realized you just walked off the court, but I wonder if -- does tonight
tell us that the gap between you and them and maybe them and some other top
teams has narrowed a little bit?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I wish I was in the second press conference and then I could
say yes. But maybe they had a bad night. We were in the game and then we just
-- we didn't sustain what we needed to for 40 minutes. I don't think there's
-- I mean, for us we have played competitively with them for the most part I
think every time. And now they'll be coming out to Stanford. And that will be
a good thing for our team, I think.  
Let's see about it. I guess I'll leave that -- they've gone two straight
seasons undefeated. I think they deserve a tremendous amount of credit. And
let's take care -- we have to -- we can't talk about it. We have to beat them
to close the gap.  
  
Q. I know this stings, but is there still a positive here in terms of
maintaining Stanford's position and going forward with the team you have for
the next year or so?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Definitely. You know, for years and years and years, the
only matchup that people wanted to see was Tennessee and Connecticut. And I
think that we have -- I think we're establishing a great East Coast/West Coast
rivalry, Stanford and UConn.  
As you heard the young players that are returning, we came into the game and
we're very disappointed we didn't win a national championship and that we
didn't win the game. But to be in three Final Fours, two national championship
games in three years, you've got to knock on the door.  
And, I mean, I just know -- just listening, as an example, to Mike Krzyzewski,
they won four national championships. Been in the championship game eight
times. This is one, two -- we've won two out of four times. So we need to work
hard and get back.  
And we need this to be motivating and inspiring for our team. And we need it
to be extremely painful. The fact that it is painful and we're not just saying
we're happy to be here is a good thing for us at Stanford.  
  
Q. I hate to end on this note, but offensively, starting with the Xavier
game, and then these last three games, you had a big game from Nneka against
Oklahoma and you needed it, because offensively everybody else didn't have a
great night. This was not a great night. I have to ask, what happened to the
offense the last three games, in your mind?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think a lot of it, you know, we have -- we've gotten
here with the great play of Jayne. And again she has battled. But she is hurt.
And we needed her in there defensively, just with her size and her rebounding,
and she did a great job rebounding for us. But offensively she really
struggled.  
On top of that, then we did have good shooting and good perimeter scoring from
Kayla and Jeanette tonight. But in the Xavier game and in the Oklahoma game,
we really struggled with our perimeter shooting.  
I mean, you can have maybe a bad night, but I think it's clear, to me anyways,
what we need our team doing. And I think that this will only motivate people
more to understand, you know, we need people in the gym, improving our
perimeter shooting, and there are a lot of things we can do and take -- take a
lot of positives from this experience with our team.  
So I'm disappointed. I know our team is hurting. But I feel very encouraged
with how hard people played and all the great things that will come out of
this for our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  53  
Stanford - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: For our final press conference of the Final Four, I'm pleased
to introduce Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma, as well as student-athletes
Tina Charles, Maya Moore and Kalana Greene.  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's hard to put it all into words and in perspective. Just
the feeling of helplessness we felt in the first half and going into our
locker room at halftime and not knowing what we had left in us and what they
were thinking, and to come out in the second half and make some of the plays
that we made and have Maya make some of the shots that she made. It was a real
testament to these kids and how strong they are and how tough they are and how
resilient they are.  
I'm really thrilled for them. And I'm really thrilled to be their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our three student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, can you talk about the first half and the mood at halftime, what
you guys were thinking? Coach said he didn't know what you were thinking. What
were you thinking?  
MAYA MOORE: As far as our motivation, I mean, we knew what we had to do. It
was a new half. We had to just keep playing hard and executing what we didn't
execute in the first half. Sometimes it's just that simple. You just have to
focus in on the little things that we've been working on all year and things
start clicking.  
And we knew we weren't going to finish the game the way we started. And once
we just kind of locked in on setting up our screens, rebounding, guarding the
3-point line a little better, and our defense was outstanding in the second
half. And that's what really sparked it. Tina Charles in the lane, blocking
shots left and right, and we never looked back from there.  
  
Q. For all of you, could you just talk about the journey from day one and
the things you had to deal with to accomplish this, another perfect season?  
KALANA GREENE: I think the journey started in Tampa, when we lost to Stanford.
And that was definitely like the trigger right there. We just wanted to come
back and win a national championship. We were so close. And I think we knew
what we had to do to get it.  
And our motivation last year was to -- this year was to show everyone we had a
lot of doubts at the guard position, what could we do without Renee
Montgomery, and Tiffany and Caroline came in this year and did whatever we had
to do to win.  
And it's been great. It's just fun, and we're undefeated.  
TINA CHARLES: I'll just go for what she said.  
  
Q. Maya, could you talk about what Stanford was doing to you defensively in
the first half and what changed in the second half? And, also, did you feel
pressure, personally, that you needed to kind of take over things in the
second half?  
MAYA MOORE: I thought Stanford did a great job in the first half just being
physical, trying to jam up our cuts, not letting us kind of move where we
wanted to. And it forced us to have to work harder off the ball to get open
and just being tougher with the basketball.  
The second half, you can't really have any fear, any doubts. We all recognized
that we weren't ourselves and we just had to leave it in the locker room, and
that's what we did, and come out and be in the attack mode.  
After we started executing our offense a little better and got our flow back,
we started looking like ourselves again.  
But I'm absolutely always trying to be on the attack, and that's what our team
was in the second half.  
  
Q. Maya, in that second half, it seemed like when you got your groove back
was when you rose up and knocked down that 3-pointer that put the team ahead,
to stay, as it turned out. I notice that you had this look of determination
that you were going to knock that shot down no matter what. When it left your
hands and you saw it go down, did you feel like, okay, we're on a roll now?  
MAYA MOORE: That was a big momentum pusher. I remember just coming off of a
screen from the opposite side. And I think it was you that kicked it out to
me. And there was a defender right in my face, running to contest it. And I
just didn't think about it; I just rose up and shot it and it went in and
everybody had a little bounce to them.  
I think when Kalana got that and one, too, was a big spark for us. Those
3-point plays sparked our line. And that's why we're champions. We rise to the
occasion. And we love big-time games and big-time shots.  
  
Q. Tina, Kalana, you pretty much only have about 24 hours to celebrate this
before you get on with the next part of your life. Going to be in New York
getting ready to be drafted by the WNBA. How do you both feel about that quick
transition, and are you ready to move on?  
TINA CHARLES: I haven't even thought about it. I'm sitting here fighting back
tears because I'm going to miss this team and miss Coach. I'm grateful for
everything he's done for me. I'm going to miss just everything about this
program. Rosemary Ragle and the rehab I had with her, my shoulder, just all
the little things that I'm just sitting here thinking about. That's far off my
mind.  
KALANA GREENE: Just going to celebrate as long as I can. That's it.  
  
Q. Maya, this wasn't the typical UConn win, but you won 78 in a row, back-
to-back undefeated seasons, two straight national championships. What are your
emotions right now? What are you feeling?  
MAYA MOORE: Kind of an awkward stage right now, because you go through the
whole season always working for something, always working for something, and
you finally get it and it's like: What now?  
So I know all of us are just drained, I think, emotionally from the high and
low of just that game alone. But there's a huge sense of satisfaction and
knowing that we went out the way we wanted to and the way we did it, I think,
and the way we believed and trusted in what Coach was telling us. And we
bought into it. And it worked.  
So we're just on cloud nine right now, and I don't see myself going to sleep
anytime soon.  
  
Q. Tina, Jayne went O-fer. Could you sense that she was struggling
physically a little bit?  
TINA CHARLES: Yeah, you know, just seeing the way her coach was subbing her in
and out with No. 44. I know she was giving everything she had out there. I
know this is her last go-around, both our last game. So we both gave our all
out there. But we just came out and we fought harder.  
  
Q. Maya, what's life going to be like without the women sitting next to you
from the left to the right?  
MAYA MOORE: It's going to be sad. I mean, I'm going to miss them. They have, I
think, been the most improved players, just seeing Tina's growth from freshman
year to now, and Kalana's growth from last year to now. They're leaders for
our team, and we're going to absolutely miss that.  
But I'm just going to take everything that they've taught me and everything
that they've been -- they've been an example for me and I won't let them down
and I'll take how hard they work and how they approach their senior year and
I'm going to do the same next year.  
But I'm always going to be in contact with them. We're family forever. And I
don't think we'll ever forget this night.  
  
Q. Tina and Kalana, every kid that goes to college basketball dreams of
senior year, celebrating on the court a national championship. Could you put
into words what that's like, knowing your last game and then you're national
champions and you're leaving UConn as a national champion?  
TINA CHARLES: I think you have to experience it to know the feeling. I could
say a bunch of words, but I think the feeling, you have to really experience
it.  
And I think that's the best thing about this whole thing because we were able
to experience this two times and just the hard work that we put into it and
just the support we had from just everybody from the fans, from our student
body back at school, just everything, I think this is for everybody and how
special it is.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
KALANA GREENE: I just remember last year remembering how I felt. It was like I
gotta get back here again. And I think that's what every senior wants, is to
go out with a bang. And we did.  
  
Q. Kalana and Tina, wanted to get your thoughts on winning the final 78
games of your career, two national championships, now walking away. What kind
of legacy do you think you're leaving behind?  
TINA CHARLES: I think we definitely set the stakes high. Coach did it. He set
the stakes high for the people coming into Connecticut, because I know when I
came in, we didn't win for a year, for like a long time. So the guys coming in
now, the guys who is here next year, Maya, Tiffany, Caroline, they just gotta
keep winning, because that's what Connecticut does.  
  
Q. Maybe for Tina, if you could just reflect on the supreme satisfaction
that you're feeling right now just because the fact that so many people maybe
coronated you as champions well before this night, but tonight you guys showed
what you had in terms of battling back, not only tonight but battling against
Baylor as well. Is that where you derive your sense of satisfaction walking
away? Not just from having won 78 in a row, but winning the 78th in the way
that you did?  
TINA CHARLES: Definitely. I think that's where we give our praises to our
practice players and just how hard they always came out to practice and came
out against us. There will be times when we'll be down and we fought through
it. Coach wouldn't let us get off the court until we overcame that.  
I think that's why we're able to do that when Baylor cut the lead down to 3
and when we're coming out of halftime and being down by 8.  
So I think that's just the best satisfaction. And I know our practice players
are just really happy for us, especially.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the first half, I was wondering, did you wonder whether either team
was going to be able to get to 20 points? I've never seen a half like that. I
wonder if you have.  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, no, I've never seen anything like it. Ever. There was a
point in time where it looked like we may never score again. And that's what I
felt like. I remember turning around one time and just staring at the bench
and looking at the other coaches and just shaking my head, and this feeling of
we're not going to score any more points.  
And I looked at the scoreboard, and I realized they were in the same situation
we were in. And here I thought defensively we weren't playing well. We had to
turn up the defense. Turn up the defense.  
And it's 20 to 12 and didn't feel so bad. As bad as we played, it wasn't as
bad as it could have been. And there was hope. There was hope for us. I didn't
know what kind of hope. But there was hope.  
  
Q. I know this might be too early for you to reflect upon this, but now that
you have won seven of these and you've done it four times with an undefeated
team, with what this team accomplished, as I said to Tina, winning 78 in a
row, but 78th, is it supremely gratifying for you as a coach? And is this the
greatest team, the championship team, you've had? Does it supplant the 2002
team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know what to think of that. I don't know where I would
put it in the context of who is better or who is not. I think looking back now
at what we've done, if you make me look back at what we've done, I'm almost
incredulous that it actually happened, because I can't imagine having done it.  
It's almost like it never happened. You know, it's something that's there, and
I know we did it. And I know it's in the record books. But I am so astounded
that it's happened. When you make comments like that, you know, four
undefeated teams, it's just too hard to comprehend. You know, it really is. It
really, really is.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Maya's game tonight. You've seen her do a lot of
things, but did you get a sense from her at halftime that she was ready to
take over? And what were they doing to contain her in the first half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I was worried all year long that what exactly happened
in the first half was going to happen. And I would always say to people, you
know, we come out there and we don't make any shots, we're going to lose. And
we kept scoring 90 points. 90 points. And it's like, well, that's never going
to happen. So all of a sudden when nobody can make a shot, then all of a
sudden we have kids on the team who didn't want to shoot.  
And Stanford knows that. And they're going to guard Maya really hard. And
they're daring everybody else to make shots. And we felt, I think, the
defensive pressure that Stanford put on us. And I think for the first time all
season, I think we felt the game pressure and the Final Four pressure and the
national championship pressure.  
That's the only thing -- that's the only way I can explain it, what happened.
Stanford's defense was great. And we finally felt that pressure that comes
from doing what we've been doing and being where we are. And to be honest with
you, for Caroline to make those shots she made, that's just an incredible
toughness on that kid's part, because she hasn't made a shot since Brian was a
senator (laughter).  
  
Q. Well played.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's why he came to say hi to us. He said: I remember you
making a shot when I was senator.  
  
Q. Maya, did you feel like she was capable of going off?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure. Maya operates on two levels: one
where she's in a complete zone and everything she touches goes in and you
can't keep her from scoring, then Maya gets in another zone where she wants to
win so bad or she wants to get it done so bad that she almost is her own worst
enemy.  
And that's, I think, one of the things that was happening in the first half.
And I didn't know if we could get her out of it. That's why I said we need
some other people to make some plays, to let Maya know, hey, I'm not out here
by myself. And in the second half she was a little more patient. Moved a
little bit better without the ball and just made some incredibly difficult
shots.  
And that's why she's a special player, I think.  
  
Q. Did you think that Stanford's offense struggled as Jayne struggled?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, they're difficult to guard offensively. And we were
determined not to double team Jayne and let Tina play against her one-on-one.
Because it seemed like every time we did do anything that resembled a double
team or helped, they were able to get off a couple of shots.  
We knew we had an impossible matchup with Nneka and Jayne. Jayne we felt like
Tina could handle. I just didn't think we had a matchup for Nneka. But we were
able to move Tina over and we took our chances. And Tina was just incredible
defensively.  
But, remember, I think I said yesterday that the first team to 50 wins, right?
Who knew, right? Who knew.  
  
Q. In the second half, did you guys do anything drastically different
defensively?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, because we scored we were able to kind of set our
defense a little bit better and apply the pressure where we wanted to apply
it. And when you're not scoring and you're constantly running back, you're
thinking about we didn't score, oh, my God, we didn't score again. We didn't
score again. That weighs on your mind and then you make mistake defensively.  
So because we were able to score points, we ran back with a clear head and we
were organized. Put a little more pressure on the ball. Took away a lot of the
outside shots, which is basically what we tried to do.  
They didn't make as many outside shots until the end. Then I thought that they
were going to win anyway, they were just going to keep making shots, make you
bank one, and I was ready to kill myself.  
  
Q. That six-minute stretch, the stretch at the start of the second half that
Maya had, you've coached a lot of really good players, including Diana and
whoever. Did you ever see one like that where she's hitting everything
everywhere?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Diana was the only one that resembled that at all. And I've
seen her do it -- it is what great players do. And they do it at the most
pressure-packed times. And that's what makes them who they are. That's what
makes them great. Maya is a great scorer. And you get that reputation by
scoring points under pressure. And she certainly did that.  
  
Q. When is the last time that you looked at the Wooden book you've been
carrying around? And I ask this tongue in cheek, but is there a chapter about
what to do when your team shoots 15 percent in the first half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Geez, no. That's funny. I should have never mentioned that.
But I happened to have that book in my briefcase because I went on a trip in
September and I just have it in there. There's interesting scenarios in that
book of how to attack certain things, and his philosophy on attacking a
certain kind of defense or a certain kind of pressure.  
But there's absolutely no chapters and no pages on here's how you can win a
game if you shoot 15 percent in the first half (laughter). Maybe because this
team's never shot 15 percent in the first half. So I should write that
chapter.  
  
Q. Now that you're free of the tunnel vision of one game at a time, will
there be moments now that you'll have a chance to ponder what 78 in a row
means and will there be a moment or two where you idly think of how close you
are to 88 and UCLA?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'll probably think about the 78 and how it became a reality.
And I'll just stare up into space like I always do and say I can't believe it.
There's so many things that could go wrong along the way, and it's just
unexplainable that that many things could go that right for 78 straight games
and you would win.  
But I don't think about 88. I don't think about any of that. I don't ever
think about down the road, if we do this, this will happen.  
I'm not looking at it as a goal. I'm not looking at it as something that I
want to accomplish. If we're fortunate and it ever happens, I'll be astounded
again like I am right now.  
But I don't -- I would like to win another national championship next year,
and I'll probably say the same thing I said before this year's team: I don't
care if we have no losses or ten losses. I don't care. That's probably how I'm
going to be thinking.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Tina Charles's four years at UConn?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's all been said by a lot of people and by Tina
herself, about how much she's grown and how much she's changed and how much
she's elevated her game and how many different things she does well now,
relative to before.  
And as a person, she's a better person. She's grown up. She's a lot more
mature now than she was then. And as you would expect someone to be after four
years in college.  
And Tina's Tina. Tina didn't want to sit up here today right now and talk
about the game and the championship or the streak or any of those things. Tina
just wants to sit in the locker room right now and kind of hold on to that
moment and that feeling for another four years. She's not prepared to leave.  
  
Q. You mentioned you won't be thinking about 88. But last year, after your
win, people speculated about Maya maybe getting three in a row. There will be
expectations on her next year. Could you talk about that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, that just comes with the territory, you know? Maya is
unbelievable in what she can do and how she can do it. I think Maya's greatest
challenge next year is going to be that for the first time in her college
career she will be the older leader and not have a lot of help, and that's
going to really take its toll on Maya next year. I've told her that. We've
talked about it. And that's my job to get her ready for it.  
But, you know, people are going to expect us to win a national championship
because we've got Maya Moore. And I would say: Good. So do I.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously the 12 points the first half was part of the game plan,
but, apart from that, can you talk about what was your game plan coming in;
what ways you succeeded in executing that and which ways you didn't?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I felt coming in we were going to have a real hard time
stopping them from scoring. And I thought it was going to be difficult for
them to try to stop every one of us. I didn't count on what happened in that
first half.  
I didn't think we'd be able to hold them to 20. And I never imagined that we
would get 12. The way we guarded them is exactly the way I wanted to guard
them. We played defense exactly the way I wanted to play it. You hold a team
to 20 points, you're doing something special.  
So that was the game plan going in. I didn't have any problem with the
defense. The offensive game plan is the same as it's always been. And we kind
of strayed away from it too quickly.  
Tina didn't touch the ball. We didn't attack them at all. We just stood around
on the perimeter. There was very little movement. And in the second half, all
that changed. Our defense stayed solid. We got Tina a couple more touches in
the lane, and got better movement. And as a result, more people touched the
ball.  
And then because of that, we were able to feel comfortable. We never felt
comfortable in that first half. Never. It wasn't until I think maybe when Maya
made that 3 to put us up that there was a certain comfort level; that, hey, we
can come down and score now on three or four possessions in a row.  
I think one time we got it to, what, 15? The lead was 15, I think. 16. 16. And
I thought, okay, now we're comfortable. Then I look up and it's like six. It's
not supposed to be easy, right?  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: It is my pleasure to welcome to the podium Connecticut head
coach Geno Auriemma, as well as student-athletes Kalana Greene, Caroline Doty,
Tiffany Hayes Tina Charles, and Maya Moore.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Hard to imagine that we're back here now 364 days from last
season. It seems like just yesterday that we were playing and winning a
national championship. And what's gone into coming back here has been so
incredible and so amazing, what these particular kids have been through and
what we've done and how we've done it.  
I think it's right and it's just that we're playing tomorrow night. No one's
guaranteed to win tomorrow night. Stanford doesn't deserve to win, Coach
Auriemma and his players and Connecticut don't deserve to win, but I think
both teams deserve to be playing tomorrow night.  
I know I speak for everybody else that we're pretty excited about playing
tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kalana, your experience playing Stanford for the first time, what do you
guys get from that experience and what do you apply tomorrow night?  
KALANA GREENE: I think the first time we played Stanford we knew it was going
to be tough. And you have a lot of weapons. I think it's going to be the same
thing tomorrow night. We just have to grind it out and fight hard and pay
attention to the scouting report and do everything we've been doing the entire
year to try to get the win.  
  
Q. Yesterday was a pretty physical and intense game. I want to know how your
bodies are today. Do you feel more tired than normal? Business as usual? Or
did yesterday take a little bit more out of you than normal?  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, it was definitely a physical game, as it should be. And I
think both teams came out of it feeling like they exerted a lot of energy. But
I think one of the benefits of our schedule this season is we had a lot of --
a couple of Saturday-Monday games. So I think our bodies know how to react,
and we know how to kind of take care of ourselves in that quick turnaround and
take the necessary treatments we need. So that won't be an excuse tomorrow.  
TINA CHARLES: I would just say I think that's just the best part of this whole
thing; that at the end of the year you have to see which team is just going to
fight through everything, fight through all of the excuses as to why maybe we
couldn't play hard.  
But I think at the end of the day, when it all comes together, either team,
whoever wins the national championship, I think that's why you get happy,
because you fought through all the little things.  
  
Q. Caroline and Kalana, I think the two teams shot something like 4 for 32
from 3s yesterday. And your first games, not good outside shooting. Is there a
reason for that? And how big a part do you think the perimeter scoring is
going to play tomorrow?  
KALANA GREENE: I think with our team we don't really rely on just outside
shooting or rely just on the inside game. I think we have a good balance.  
So when we're not hitting a lot of outside shots -- I mean, it's nice to hit
them but when we're not hitting them, we find other ways, whether it's in
transition or forcing turnovers and Tina working down low.  
So I think for us we always find a way to score, even if we're shooting well
or not.  
CAROLINE DOTY: I agree with Kalana. Shots aren't going to fall. You're going
to have nights where shots aren't going to fall, and we're going to rely on
our defense and transition game and trying to work the ball around and trying
to get baskets different ways. We've been working on our shots. Putting up
plenty of baskets the last couple of days. We feel confident with it. It will
come.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Caroline, it was a rough shooting night yesterday, I think 1
for 14 combined. Can you talk about rebounding from that and what's it going
to take to make sure you have more contributions in the championship game?  
CAROLINE DOTY: You can't dwell on it. You just gotta know -- you know what
shots are open and when to take them, and if you think about it, then you're
never going to get out of that little slump. But it's a new game, new day, and
we're going to keep shooting and taking what the defense gives us.  
  
Q. Tina, two years ago you guys played Stanford early in the season in the
tournament, then they came back and beat you in the semifinals in that second
game of the season. You guys are in a bit of the same spot this year. What is
the difference this year in this situation in your mind?  
TINA CHARLES: Different players. Players improved. I know me personally, I
improved my style of play. I'm not the same player that I was two years ago.
We got new faces. Everybody's on the same page. And we all have one goal.  
  
Q. Maya, Tina, you've all had opportunities to play with the Stanford
players on international teams for a few years. When you're in that
environment as teammates, do you ever think about the days when you're going
to have to play them for school in terms of not showing off too much or giving
them an inside look as to what you can do or what you like to do? Do you ever
think about that? I mean, when you're with Nneka or with Jayne about showing
them too much about what your skill level is or what your strengths are?  
TINA CHARLES: I think that's the best part, because then you get to see if you
can stop that. I take pride in if I'm able to block one of Jayne's shots or if
I'm able to rotate right on defense and just try to stop their move. And I
think that's the best part of seeing what they can do, because you're able to
see what you are made of on the defensive side.  
MAYA MOORE: I don't change my game at all. We all put aside our college
differences for a little while when we're playing together. And you're just
competing. You're not thinking about the college season, necessarily. We're
always competitive and stuff like that. But I don't think we hold back, if
that's what you're asking.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk a little bit about the matchup with Jayne Appel and
how that will be different than your matchup with Brittney Griner. What
exactly are you going to have to do against Jayne in this game?  
TINA CHARLES: Just I know it's going to be a battle, just physically on both
of our ends. Just having my hands up on defense. Just trying to stop her from
going to the middle. She can use both of her hands real well. Just those
intangibles that a post player has.  
  
Q. Maya, I wonder if you could tell me, when you look at Nneka, watch her
play, what you see, describe her as a basketball player?  
MAYA MOORE: She's very aggressive. I think she's playing with a lot of
confidence right now. She can do a lot of things on the basketball court. She
knows what she's good at. She knows her strengths and she goes to them. Very
athletic. She can rebound. She can score for them. She runs the floor. And is
very active.  
I think she -- if she puts her mind to it, it is absolutely a leader for that
team, just as far as what she can physically do on the basketball court.  
  
Q. Maya and Tina, have you had a chance to think about what's before you,
the history you may be about to make going back to back undefeated national
champions?  
TINA CHARLES: No, I don't think that will come into play, only if everything
goes well. Right now we're focusing in on Stanford and what we have to do to
win a national championship, all those little things will come afterwards.  
MAYA MOORE: That's not something we're focusing on right now. If you get too
ahead of yourself or start taking your eyes off what's right in front of us,
that's when you get beat.  
So right now we're looking forward to tomorrow and preparing for that and
going through our daily routine and keeping our same schedule and going out
and having fun tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kalana and Tina, you guys knew this day was coming, obviously. You're
seniors and this is going to be it. But I'm wondering what you both think
about doing everything for the last time -- last practice, last shoot-around,
last game -- what tomorrow's going to be like for you knowing that one way or
another you move on in life after tomorrow?  
KALANA GREENE: We're in the position that every senior that plays college
basketball wants to be in. We tried our best to get ourselves in this position
and in the right way, and I think it's up to our team to get the win for us
tomorrow.  
But I think we're just going to try to focus everyone up because these are the
last couple of moments as a team. And we're enjoying it. I know I am. I'm
pretty sure Tina is, and, like I said, this is the position we wanted to be in
ever since last year.  
  
Q. Maya, I know the coaching staff's really good at breaking down tape and
making you guys look like you lost the game by 50 points after you played
them. What did you guys -- after you watched the Stanford tape from before,
assuming you have, what did you take from that game; what do you guys look to
improve on?  
MAYA MOORE: I know we didn't come out the way we wanted to in that first half.
Just not really on the same page. We're one of those teams, one of the
positive things we can take from it is we're always looking for that next run.
And we always have to have confidence that another run is coming, that's what
we ended up doing in the first half of that game. So we're definitely going to
study it some more.  
But always be confident, I think, in knowing that our team is about to be on
another run.  
  
Q. Maya, maybe a follow-up on that. Yesterday when Baylor pulled within 3,
we saw how you responded to that. Coach Auriemma remarked yesterday how it was
good for everyone to see that you guys responded in that way. When you were
down at the half against Stanford and you're sitting in that locker room,
could you take us back and what did you see in your teammates' eyes that made
you believe that the next run was coming?  
MAYA MOORE: You know, we weren't satisfied at all with how we were playing. We
knew we hadn't played our best basketball at all. So I don't think there was
ever a doubt in our minds that we could win. It was just a matter of putting
it together and really locking in and focusing on the things that we needed to
do at the time to get it back.  
So it's kind of unfortunate that people on the outside don't get to sometimes
watch our practices, because we're put in those tough situations all the time
by Coach Auriemma where we have to fight back and battle. By the time the
game's come, we feel super confident and really prepared to combat anything
that the other team throws at us.  
  
Q. Kalana, do you have a favorite Geno story? And after five years, you've
seen him now for five years, what do you think it is about him that has made
him a coach that has won six and now potentially seven national
championships?  
KALANA GREENE: He's never complacent. He's never satisfied. He's a competitor.
A lot of people may pat us on the back and say that was good, and he looks at
us and says that's not good enough. He's always looking for the perfect game.  
And he knows it's impossible to become perfect. But every day he strives
towards that. So seeing that every day and everybody thinks you look at the
big picture but he looks at all the small things that make the big picture.
And that's what I think makes him so successful in his profession.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, if you go back to '95, it didn't seem like you and Tara had the
warmest relationship then; there were different things that happened and
Nykesha Sales' remark and everything. But over the years she's spoken very
appreciatively about the way you coach, your style; you've said the same
thing. Could you talk about the evolution of your relationship and also the
fact she was an Olympic coach, you're going to be doing that. Is that also
another way you guys have -- I don't want to necessarily say bonded, but
another thing you can relate about together?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, it's just a matter of people getting older and,
you know, a lot of water passes under the bridge, I guess they say.  
And I think Tara VanDerveer was in somewhat of a difficult situation coaching
the Olympic team. The comment about Nykesha Sales was our first really -- I
mean, the first big-time All-American other than Rebecca. And at the time
Stanford was getting three, four, five All-Americans every year.  
That was neither here nor there. But the Olympic thing, I think, was difficult
because so much of the attention was focused on Rebecca Lobo and national
media and not necessarily on the Olympic team. It wasn't Rebecca's fault and
it wasn't Tara VanDerveer's fault. It was just more people in America in 1995
knew who Rebecca Lobo was instead of Teresa Edwards, let's say, or Jennifer
Azzi or Dawn Staley, because Rebecca came along at a different time and a
different era.  
I think Rebecca paid a price for it. And she shouldn't have had to pay that
price, because it wasn't her fault. But that's over and done with. And I've
always had tremendous respect for Tara as a coach. I really didn't know her
that well as a person, but we spent a lot of time talking over the years. And
it's kind of one of the reasons why this series that we had with them is going
to be a good series for both of us.  
She doesn't shy away from challenges, and neither do I. And I think we each
have a healthy respect for each other as coaches and I think as people.  
And I think she respects how we do our job and the kind of kids we recruit and
the way we run our program. And I certainly feel the same way about them.
They're in some ways a reflection of her, and my team's a reflection of me,
and we all live happily ever after.  
  
Q. Is there one aspect of this matchup based on the first game in December
from your standpoint that you feel is absolutely necessary for you guys to
win, for it to happen? Was it matchup or one aspect of the game? If there is
one, what would it be?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You've got two really, really good offensive teams out there.
Two teams that are not necessarily one-dimensional. And when you have that,
something's gotta give.  
If both teams are able to offensively do whatever they like to do and how they
like to do it and are successful at it, you know, it's a 90-to-87 game, one
way or the other. But I don't know that that's going to happen.  
So whichever team, I think, can defensively force the other team to be
uncomfortable, the way I like to say it, I think that would be, to me, the
biggest matchup.  
I don't think we can guard them and shut them down completely. And I don't
think they can guard us and shut us down completely. So something has to
emerge from the offensive end tomorrow, and I would venture to say, you know,
it's going to be difficult for both teams to find a way to stop the other team
from scoring points.  
  
Q. I understand that after the first Stanford game you pulled Nneka aside
and complimented her on just how much she had improved. Could you expound on
that a little bit after last night and where she is right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I really appreciate and I really admire kids who take it
seriously, they take the responsibility of being a college athlete seriously.
I watched her play as a freshman. And then I saw her on film as a sophomore
before we played them in December. And I just thought it was a completely
different player.  
And I admire that, because that means she took her scholarship seriously. She
took the responsibility that was put on her seriously to get better and get
better and get better, and a lot of kids don't do that. They don't. They just
take it for granted or they just expect that it's going to happen without
their having to work at it.  
And I just love everything about the kid, who she is, how she conducts
herself, how she competes. I can't say enough about her, really.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about how Maya kind of symbolizes your ability to
recruit the South and the importance of recruiting the South?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We haven't had a lot of players from down that way. It's only
been in the last couple of years that we've had a lot of success. Maya and
Tiffany are probably the two more prominent players from down that way.  
I think when you have a certain kind of kid who isn't confined by family
situations or just fear of leaving home and they want to be exposed to the
highest level, you know, you have a chance with those kids.  
I would say Tiffany and Maya were probably two of the easier recruiting
efforts that we had to actually put in, because I think they knew what they
wanted. So it wasn't almost like we went down there and convinced them or
cajoled them to come to Connecticut. I think both of them understood this is
where I want to be. This is where I need to be to satisfy my own self and my
curiosity and how I want to be challenged.  
It's not easy down there -- down here. Out this way it's impossible. Forget
it. There's no way you're getting a kid from down here to go to Connecticut.
It's easier for me to get a Russian kid, which I have (laughter).  
But, yeah, the right kids, they'll go anywhere if it's the right situation.
And we've been fortunate with those two, no question.  
  
Q. We heard Kalana talk a little bit about your strong suits as a coach. And
I guess it's your drive in getting these kids to focus on those little things.
Now that you're on the threshold of a perfect season in history, does
perfection become a moving target still, or will you be satisfied with that
perfect season, even if there's some imperfections in how you won the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, this whole -- I think sometimes the whole perfect
thing gets bandied around and it means different things to different people,
you know?  
The only thing I've ever tried to impress upon my players is there's a certain
amount of perfection in your effort. The perfection, I don't think, lies in
what the outcome is. There's a certain effort that requires a certain amount
of perfection; that you're looking for the perfect way to consistently have
that effort.  
That at the end of 40 minutes, if your effort was unwavering and your
commitment during that game or during that practice was unwavering and you
never ever took a step back, lost your concentration or just decided I don't
feel like it or for whatever reason didn't have that same commitment to every
possession, I don't care about the outcome, and I think sometimes that gets
lost.  
I said this last night. We ran a couple of plays for Maya. She absolutely
executed those things perfectly. Whether the shot went in or not, there's no
complaining about that, because there's no way you can control that. But I can
control how she uses that screen, how she sets that screen, how she makes that
cut. That's what I'm talking about in chasing that perfection thing.  
Once she gets the ball in her hands, if it goes in, it goes in. If it doesn't
go in, it doesn't go in. Like the 3 she air-balled. She did everything right
and it was an air ball. So you can't worry about what happened after you do
everything right.  
So I don't want people to think that tomorrow the only thing that's acceptable
is absolutely no mistakes, absolutely a perfect game, we shoot 60 percent from
the floor and we hold them to 40 points and we win 90 to 40. That's not my
definition of things. I want our effort tomorrow to be perfect.  
  
Q. I think I remember correctly, you took blame for the Stanford first half
thing, running the wrong defense. Can you talk about the defensive effort? You
said before how offense -- everyone loves a 90-87 game, but realistically
that's not going to happen. And you guys have been shutting everyone down.
What is the difference in the defense you guys have in the last five games?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It comes down to matchups, too. Stanford's a difficult matchup
for us. I think any team -- and we're a difficult matchup for most people. I
think any team that has some versatility in their offense and can get you from
a couple different spots on the floor, it's hard.  
You can't defend everything. Defending Baylor is one thing because you know
what their strengths are, what their weaknesses are, and you can kind of play
the percentages.  
But when you're playing a team like Stanford, there's less weaknesses that you
can attack on your own defense. So it makes the challenge a little greater.
The first game, what I was alluding to was -- Maya didn't answer the question.
I forget who asked Maya about the first game and Stanford. That's why I was
telling Kalana, I said: Do you ever think she would say, Well, we were up 19
to 9 and then I was a dumb-ass and got my second foul and I had to sit and
then they tied it up, so I'm going to try not to get my second foul in the
first seven minutes of the game?  
But Maya is not going to say that. But the other four guys knew that's what
happened.  
So a lot of it is your defense is dictated by who you have on the floor. So if
we've got the right guys on the floor, and we're not in foul trouble, we can
play a certain kind of defense. We can get out and pressure more, change
defenses more and take more chances.  
But all of a sudden we were limited in that game so we had to play a certain
kind of defense that wasn't conducive for us. In the second half, we could
come out and play the way we wanted to play and defend the way we wanted to
defend and it changed the game.  
We could do the exact same thing tomorrow and it wouldn't work. But that day
it did. Tomorrow it might be something completely different. Tomorrow the
defense we played in the first half, which didn't work, might work great.  
That's the beauty of every game. That's the beauty of every game. You go out
there and this is what we're going to do. And they pick it apart. You go, all
right, time to change.  
That's why I get the big bucks, man (laughter). I said that 100 times.  
  
Q. Along that line, Tara is known as a pretty meticulous scout. How well
prepared do you expect them to be for your team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, it's Stanford. They probably study all the time
(laughter). They're great at reading books and figuring stuff out, and that's
one of their strengths, I think. It's one of Tara's great strengths is they
are disciplined. They are meticulous. They do execute. They're precise in what
they do. No question about that.  
And I would think that after having played us now -- this is the third year in
a row in the Final Four and third year in a row -- second out of three years
that we played in the regular season, I think. I lose track sometimes.  
And they've seen us at our best and they've seen us at our worst. They've seen
us at full strength in St. Thomas where we blew them out and they've seen us
missing two starters in the Final Four. So I don't think there's any scenario
that they're not going to be prepared for come tomorrow night.  
When did they play, Monday or Tuesday last week?  
  
Q. Monday.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Another team that has an extra day of rest (laughter).  
  
Q. For the first time in a long time it seems, to borrow a fighter's
analogy, you guys got punched back against the ropes last night. I mean, you
talk all season long about this team's determination, their resolve. But to
see it actually when it had to have happened, when they had to come back and
punch themselves off the ropes and come back and take over, how gratifying was
that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, extremely. We know we had that in us, but you don't know
until you have to show it. One of the quirks of the NCAA tournament, the way
it played out, there's nothing you can do about this. Baylor played Monday
night. We played Tuesday night. They go home and they've got an hour bus ride
and we have to fly four hours here with one day less to prepare and we're
playing, and that's just a quirk. It's just the way it happened.  
And then we get two guys in foul trouble. We're zigging and zagging. And I
think all those things give you a chance to prove something to yourself that
you maybe don't have an opportunity to prove.  
And that's why I think last night, in the locker room, there was a different
look on the kids' faces. They were like, yeah, that's that was really good
because it was a tough week and it was a tough game and they were tough
circumstances.  
When you're a competitor, those are the kind of situations you love to find
yourself in. Because you're tested under fire a lot of times. And we haven't
been under fire enough. And yesterday was good. Yesterday was really good.  
  
Q. Coach, easy question and then maybe a little tougher one. Tara said
before that she hopes the series continues past the Palo Alto game next year.
You've got two California kids coming in as freshmen. I'm wondering what your
thoughts are about that. Secondly, you always tell us how you feel about
things. You're always very honest and you usually say them in a manner that's
very direct and entertaining. I'm wondering if you ever worry about how your
words are perceived nationally by the other coaches that hear you speak?
Especially the sound bites on ESPN. I'm talking about yesterday what you said
to Mark about the competition and, you know, if you were 38-0 again next March
that you were going to leave the game. Do you think you make more enemies by
saying things like that, or are you even concerned about that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I don't think why -- why would I make an enemy out of
somebody if I said that I think there are teams out there good enough to beat
us. I would think that's a sign of respect for the other teams; that they're
really good and I would expect us to lose because we're playing really good
teams.  
I've always been one to think, you know, you need to just get up in the
morning and think about your own team, what do you have to do to make
yourselves better, how can I prepare my team better, how can I recruit better,
how can I coach better, organize my staff better and all that.  
If you're spending five minutes, five seconds worrying about what Geno
Auriemma says, then you lost already. I mean, that's the way I look at it. I
say things that I think are meant to -- I never disrespect the other coaches
or the other teams. And never have and never will.  
And there's a lot of people out there that, for whatever reason, worry too
much about what other people say. I've never been one to worry about it. I
laugh at it. I think it's pretty funny. I kind of look forward to it.  
And people rile me up thinking that I'm going to say something and do
something that's going to be crazy. And they don't realize that I'm not like
that anymore. I'm gentle and kind and lovable (laughter).  
But they keep bringing me stuff. Somebody brought something into the locker
room last night before the game; that Kim said that she hoped Brittney would
dunk on Tina and that I would lose my mind on the sidelines.  
So the kids all read it and -- because you have to understand something: I'm
not like an Internet guy. I don't read blogs or chat rooms. So I don't know
what's going on in the real world. I've said this before: If it's not in the
newspaper or not on ESPN, I don't know that it existed, to be honest with you,
because I don't do that kind of stuff.  
I don't know what people are saying or thinking or any of that. I know
nothing. I'm Sergeant Schultz. And I know absolutely nothing when it comes to
that kind of stuff.  
So when people bring me this stuff, I'm just -- I get a kick out of it. I
laugh. And my players get a kick out of it. They think it's pretty funny.  
Kim made a comment about Georgetown was the second-best team in the Big East
and they would finish like eighth in the Big 12 or something. And our kids get
a kick out of that, because we beat the second-place team in the Big 12 by 40.  
  
Q. Are you ignoring my question about Stanford?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We're going to play Stanford just like everybody else. As long
as Tara wants to play, we'll play them. We'll play. We'll play all the good
teams as long as they want to play us. We've never taken a phone call from a
really good program and said no. And that will never happen. Anybody that
wants to play us, as long as we can get a date, we're playing you.  
  
Q. You and Tara are about the same age. She talked about growing up, no high
school team for girls and she'd go to the Y and play against guys and stuff.
Your situation was different. You came in at age eight from Italy. What was
your introduction to basketball? Did you know anything about it when you got
here? And wasn't there a story when you were in high school you were signing
your own report card so you could keep playing or something like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Come on, you're making me sound like a dummy. Just because I
took advantage of the fact my parents can't read and write, come on. You're
supposed to figure that stuff out when you're a kid, aren't you? I showed them
my report cards. I told them they were really good (laughter). I said A means
awful. C means really cool. I took advantage of the situation.  
My mother told me that I used to walk a couple miles when I was a kid in
Italy, four, five years old, to this playground. There were a lot of
servicemen in Italy. They had a basketball court set up. I would go watch
basketball games. She said I was just fascinated by it.  
So maybe it was just always in there, you know? And when I came to this
country, the first thing I fell in love with was baseball. I had never seen a
baseball game. I was just fascinated by it and played it every single day of
my life if I could, still would play today if I could.  
But had to do something in the wintertime. And I got cut all the time until I
got to high school and some reason or another I made the team, I played,
enjoyed it. And just kind of always had an eye for it, you know? Like I saw
it.  
Like my daughter's an actress. You can't teach that. It's in you. Or a
musician. It's in you. You can read all the books you want, read all the
manuals you want, go to all the clinics you want, but if it's not in you, if
it's not a part of who you are, it's just hard to be good at it. It's really
hard to be good at it.  
My daughter's music teacher got mad at me one time because I wasn't making my
daughter play the piano with notes. I said: If you don't start reading notes,
I'm going to stop taking you to piano lessons. And she closed her eyes and she
said: Dad, watch. She played this one tune and she said: That's talent.  
What the hell am I going to say to that (laughter)?  
  
Q. Throughout this whole 77 games, whatever, it's always been about the
goal, not the streak, the championship. Has that been something that's been
hard for you to get across to them? Have they been able to do it on their own?
And is some of the talk about the streak kind of helped them focus on the goal
and not the streak?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I heard -- it was funny. I heard Kalana Greene answer that
question one time. And I thought she gave the best answer of anybody that's
been asked that question. And I think her answer was something to the effect:
You know, when I sign a letter of intent to come to Connecticut, I didn't come
to win 70 in a row. I came to win national championships.  
So that kind of mentality is where our team is, and it's always been about
what do we have to do to win the regular season championship in the Big East
or the tournament championship, or win the first round. It's never been
discussed at all, the numbers.  
I talked about it one time, to be honest with you. After we got to 70 or 71, I
said, hey, what you guys have done has been really, really good. It's
something you all should be really proud of. But those 71 don't mean anything
unless we win six in a row in a couple of weeks.  
So we haven't talked about it. I don't know if they talk about it among
themselves. I don't know what they're doing. I don't know how they do it. But
whatever they're doing, I hope they keep doing it.  
  
Q. You know Jayne Appel's game pretty well. What do you see as far as the
ankle and how it's impacted her in the last few weeks?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think at this time of the year, now, this weekend, I don't
think there's anything that's going to keep you from playing and playing as
well as you can. Everybody's hurt at this time of the year. Everybody's sore.
There's something going on in everybody's body.  
When Jayne's 100 percent, I don't think there's anybody who works as hard as
she does. I shouldn't say -- who works harder than she does. I think her
ability to score with both hands and she's a terrific passer and she runs the
floor great.  
I do think it's going to be crucial, that matchup between her and Tina, like
it always is. I don't think her -- whatever limits she may have ankle-wise, I
don't think they're going to be an issue tomorrow night. But that might be one
reason why Nneka's just exploded, you know? Maybe she's getting more
opportunities because of that.  
  
Q. Two-part question. Eleven Final Four, I believe eight different cities.
Your favorite, for whatever reasons why? And, secondly, like tough love with
your children, you've always gotten the most out of your players. And Tina was
someone who came here with loads of talent, but you could see early on that
she needed to be challenged. And you've certainly gotten the most out of her.
How are you able to do that with your players?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Some players you can't. I mean, I've tried that same thing
with other players and just didn't get anywhere with it. I think all the
credit goes to Tina and how hard she's been willing to work, and never backed
down and has always come back for more, above and beyond anything that you
would think a person would want to do.  
She's a pleaser. And kids who want to please, who want to do well, who have
certain goals, they're going to take whatever you throw at them and come back
and come back. They just have to learn how to. It's not that they don't want
to. They just have to learn how to.  
And that's been Tina's biggest strength. I think she wants to. She just needed
to learn how to do it and keep doing it the same way.  
There's some kids, they say it, but they don't really want to. With those kids
you can't get anywhere. You try and you try and you try, but you don't get
anywhere with them.  
  
Q. And favorite Final Four site?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Favorite Final Four site. Minneapolis. Philadelphia. San
Antonio. St. Louis. New Orleans. Atlanta.  
Philadelphia was my finest, because it was home. All my friends, my family,
everybody was there. That was 1.  
This is 1-A. This is a great town. I wish they could have it here every year.
I really do. I think the fans have the best experience here. I think the teams
have the best experience here.  
The people here do a phenomenal job of hosting the event. I don't think
anybody in the coaching community or in the same community would be
disappointed if San Antonio had the Final Four every single year. I just wish
our hotel bar would stay open later. Somebody call them.  
  
Q. During this run you've had you've played the same teams numerous teams:
Notre Dame, teams in the Big East, Louisville three times. It seems every time
you play a team the second time or third time, you make it a worst beating on
them and you beat them by more. Is there something to that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's putting me in a bad spot right now. I think it comes
down to the players and the matchup and what it is. And Louisville and
Connecticut is just a bad matchup last year for Louisville.  
There are some advantages and some disadvantages for playing somebody twice on
both sides. Don't get me wrong. On both sides. They're playing us, and they
know they lost and it got away from them badly in the second half. They know
they played us and they were up at halftime and pretty much could do what they
wanted. And the same goes for us.  
We know we played great in the second half. And hopefully we can do that
again. We also know that we couldn't stop them in the first half.  
So we learned some things about each other that can help us and also worry us
tremendously. That's why I kind of like playing teams for the very first time.
Like yesterday's game. They didn't know that much about us. And we didn't know
much about them. I like that matchup a lot better than playing somebody for
the second time or the third time.  
  
Q. This Stanford-UConn rivalry has been a little strange because one team
seems to dominate the other. This game is down to the wire with the national
championship on the line with two best teams in the country. What would that
mean, you think, in the big picture? There's been a lot of talk about you're
good or bad for the game. What would that mean for this game to have -- the
game between the two best teams in the country?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's the hope of everybody every NCAA game. I think
everybody that turns on the television, everybody that's at an event in the
NCAA tournament, I think that's their secret wish; that somebody makes a shot
as time's running out. Somebody drives the length of the court, like Jeanette
Pohlen did, and makes a layup and you win and you go to the Final Four.  
I think that's every kid's dream and every coach's dream, or nightmare if
you're on the other end. And every fan loves that kind of an ending. It's what
makes sports so exciting.  
We haven't made it very exciting, I guess. Our players were saying, man, our
fans were really quiet. Did you hear that Baylor crowd? They were really loud.
It wasn't just Baylor. All the Stanford people were jumping up and down hoping
that Baylor would win.  
So it's what everybody wants. And I think it would be pretty neat to be in
that kind of a game, as a coach, as a player, for the fans. I bet you that was
a pretty highly viewed game last night. I don't know the numbers. I don't know
any statistics. But I bet a lot of people tuned into that game last night.  
And when Baylor cut it to 3, they were pretty excited about it. So I think
that's what people want. And hopefully they'll get that. Not (laughter).  
  
Q. You're 6-and-0 in this game.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Like that means anything.  
  
Q. I think there's only one other coach in the history of sports who can say
that he or she has never lost this game in at least that many tries, right?
John Wooden. I think that's it. The kids come and go. You stay. And you always
play well in this game. Why?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, my president and my AD are here; you ought to tell
them that and explain to them exactly what you just said to me. I would like
that.  
And I wish I could give you an answer for that other than I always, always
thought that whenever we made it to this game we were the best team.  
There was never a time when we played in this game that we were the underdog.
Now, we may have been. I don't know. But I always thought we were the best
team; that if we could get to this game that we were the best team because we
would have proved it along the way.  
And then it was my job to just make sure we played like the best team. I have
never been in this game -- well, maybe just in Philadelphia -- I think
Philadelphia was the only time. I don't think I've ever coached a game in this
game -- a team in this game where we didn't have the best player in if
country, except maybe Philadelphia.  
So that's a lot -- go ahead. You're thinking. Go ahead.  
  
Q. Who would have been the best player in 2000?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I said other than Philadelphia. Other than Philadelphia, that
might have been the only time when we didn't have the Player of the Year on
our team.  
  
Q. I'm saying who was it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I know it wasn't Sue or Swin or any of those
guys. Catchings, maybe. I don't know. But that may have been the only time.  
So as much as I would love to say it's because of me, I've always brought with
me the best player, the best team. And that, believe me, is 90 percent of the
whole thing. You know?  
Most of the time that's what you need. You can't fool anybody in the final
game. There's no trickery going on tomorrow. There's no secret stuff. There's
no great strategy that's going to win tomorrow's game. Tomorrow's game is
going to be won by the best players.  
I've always thought that. I've always, always thought that. You can have a
great system of play. You can have a great style of play, and our style of
play and our system and our culture is pretty much designed to get us to the
Sweet 16.  
I would like to think that year in and year out, the way we operate can get us
to Sweet 16 and we've done that on a regular basis. But from that point on,
there's going to be a player, or two if you're fortunate, that's going to
decide in those two games and the next two games that we're going to win.  
And I've always been fortunate to have that.  
  
Q. Why do you think you saw basketball so well? Was it having grown up
watching and knowing soccer, or --  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's a big part of it. That's a big part. The next
pass, the next pass, the next pass. That's why our team passes the ball so
much, maybe. I've always been fascinated by the pass.  
And I think growing up as a kid, that's what soccer is. I love recruiting
soccer players. Kids who played soccer in high school are really good
basketball players. Because they see that the goal that that guy's going to
have comes from the pass I'm going to make to you.  
And very few kids see that. Very few kids see that. I loved the Edmonton
Oilers when they played hockey. How could you not love that? I'm just
fascinated by the pass. I don't know why. I just think it's so cool.  
And you just don't see it very often anymore. And Stanford's a very good
passing team. I hate playing against teams that are good passing teams. I love
teams that don't pass the ball. I love playing against them (laughter). You're
not doing anything; you just have to stand there and let them self-destruct.  
But teams that really pass the ball well, man, they're hard to play against.
Really hard to play against. I love recruiting players that love to pass.
There's very few players that play for me if you're not a good passer. And I
think that explains a lot of why we have good teams year after year after
year. There's tremendous value in our program put on passing the ball.  
  
Q. Tomorrow is Jayne Appel's last game in a Stanford jersey, speaking of
passing. You recruited her. What do you think her legacy is when she leaves?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Certainly her legacy will be enhanced a thousand percent if
they win tomorrow night. Because every kid would love to see themselves as
national champions. And there's nothing greater than winning the last game of
your college career and riding off into the sunset, winning a national
championship.  
But short of that, I think what she's done for Stanford is put them -- not
single-handedly, don't get me wrong, because I think they're a big enough
program -- but I think she's helped put them back into the limelight where I
think they had not been there for a couple of years.  
I think when she came in with that group that she's in there with right now,
and Candice Wiggins, who left, I think they put Stanford back into that
national championship picture. And that's something to be proud of and to
always take with you.  
I knew when I was recruiting her out of high school she was going to be a
great center, great basketball player, because, again, skilled with both hands
and terrific passer, competitor. Tough kid.  
They're the kind of kids that leave college feeling pretty satisfied. Pretty
fulfilled. And I think tomorrow night, if they were to win, would be the
ultimate for her. And I'm not saying she needs that, but I think that would
pretty much put it over the edge.  
  
Q. Do you see similarities in the two back courts? They aren't necessarily
the first, second, even third options, but when they need to, they seem to
have the ability, the tough-as-nails, gritty-type player that can make the
plays on both ends of the court. And do you see your back court and Stanford
in the same realm?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's a couple of differences. This is Caroline's first NCAA
tournament. You know? I don't think they have anybody in their back court that
this is their first NCAA tournament. This is their third national championship
game in a row.  
Two out of three, right? So their back court is a little more experienced than
ours. Our kids are young. And I think the other big difference is their guards
don't fall down. Tiffany falls down every possession (laughter).  
So they have a huge advantage, because their kids stay on their feet. They
don't shoot as many air balls as my guys do. They don't foul as much as my
guys do. They're pretty solid in the back court.  
But whichever back court makes the most shots tomorrow could be the difference
in the game. I agree with that 100 percent.  
Caroline's like: You gotta put yesterday behind us; we're going forward. When
I came into pregame today -- I mean breakfast this morning, she was like this,
head down on the table, half asleep, half -- probably all those bricks running
around in her head. Because she's a competitor, you know?  
And that's why I don't feel bad about tomorrow. Caroline and Tiffany are going
to make shots tomorrow. Put it in the book. They're going to make shots
tomorrow. Or they're going to fall down trying or foul out. One or the other.  
You know what, good players don't foul out. You don't want a player that fouls
out or plays with four fouls. That's how you can tell a really good player. So
next time you're watching a game in there, just think, you know what, that
guy's a really good player. Why? They don't foul. They don't foul.  
Because when you foul, you have to sit on the bench. How can you be a good
player if you're sitting on the bench with fouls? Good players don't foul.  
Maya is a different breed. Maya swears she doesn't foul, so that probably
helps her. She doesn't know why she's on the bench. You have two fouls. No, I
don't. That wasn't me. It says it right up there on the board, Maya. No. 23,
two fouls. Good players don't foul.  
  
Q. I maybe stirring up a hornet's nest, but I'll try anyway. You go back to
'93 with Swoopes and you could almost make the argument from that point
forward that by and large the team that's won the championship each year from
then forward has had the best player. What does that say? I mean, you couldn't
say that in the men's game. I don't think anybody would argue that Butler,
Duke, West Virginia or Michigan State has the best player in that Final Four.
What do you think it says about this game and when does that change?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Never. It's not supposed to change. The best players are
supposed to win a national championship. And the best team is supposed to have
the best players.  
Now, the reason why it doesn't happen on the men's side is because the best
player is a freshman and then he leaves. So he's not ready to win a national
championship, a lot of times. So Duke, Butler don't need the best player. The
best player is John Wall, everybody says. But he's not experienced enough,
mature enough to win a national championship. So he's out of the tournament
and the two best teams are playing for the national championship.  
And that's the way it is in women's basketball, generally. The two best teams
are generally left standing and they happen to have the best players. That's
why they're the best teams.  
So we probably wouldn't be here this year if we had the same rule as the guys
have that you can leave. Because Maya and Tina would be gone. So in women's
basketball, the one cool thing about it is you're always going to see the best
teams playing in the Final Four. Because we always have the best players.  
Is that going to change? It might. It's happened before. And it will happen
again. If you said that Oklahoma was going to be in the Final Four, nobody
would have believed that at the beginning of the season. So it's going to
happen probably more often.  
But it will never be like the guys where you're going to get four teams that
don't have a First Team All-American coming to the Final Four. That's not
going to happen. But on the guys, that's going to happen every year. Because
as soon as a guy's really good, out. Carmelo Anthony. One of those things.  
That's why it's hard on the men's side in some ways. But in other ways, it may
not be that hard, because you're not always playing against the best teams.
You know, people talk about there's upsets along the way. Yeah, which means
that now if you're a really good team you're not playing another really good
team. You're playing somebody that upset the really good team. And so you've
got a lot of that. Women's basketball, you're going to have to beat the best
teams generally all the time to get where you're going.  
It's just a different dynamic, different dynamic. But I would be surprised if
Baylor and Brittney Griner, for instance, aren't in the Final Four the next
three years. She's probably going to be the best player. If we're here again
next year, it's because Maya was the best player in the country again.  
I just don't see that changing until, if ever, they change the rule, which I
don't think they ever will. Nor should they. If Tina or Maya play in the WNBA
from sophomore year on, I think the game of basketball, women's basketball
wouldn't be as good. I think it's good right now because the best players stay
for four years. And I think the guys' game is good because they leave. It
might not make a lot of sense, but it does make a lot of sense.  
  
Q. Just maybe to follow up on that. You've been heard to say I guess on the
"Outside Lines" report that one time it came out earlier -- I saw it in Dayton
-- you were talking about how maybe your career would be somehow fulfilled if
you went on the men's side and did what you're doing now. Do you look at that
in terms of a different challenge if you were to ever consider that? And there
are a lot of men's jobs open right now. And it's been reported that the Nets
are going to offer Mike Krzyzewski 15 to 12 mill, and you've said that --   
COACH AURIEMMA: Is that a year or total?  
  
Q. A year.  
COACH AURIEMMA: A year. That opens up the Duke job, huh?  
  
Q. There's also the Boston College job. Mike DiMauro wants you to consider
that one, too.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.  
  
Q. Your thoughts, though?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We win 30 games every year and I'm going to go someplace where
I'm going to get killed.  
  
Q. A challenge?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it's a challenge. I'm 56. I like the challenge that I
have right now.  
I said this to somebody else: I think in every person there's always this
thought of what about that. I mean, if you're a high school coach -- I know
some great high school coaches on the men's side and the women's side who are
struggling with that decision: Should I stay where I am because I'm really,
really good but I really want to take a shot at a college assistant's job and
maybe get a college job, men's or women's? And I know a ton of college coaches
on the men's side, especially, that would just give their right arm to coach
in the NBA.  
It's just -- you know, there's always that other thing that seems like people
want to try to experience. And I probably had that in me for the longest time.
Like anybody else would. Like anybody else would. I just have one huge
advantage over everybody else. I never had to make that decision because
nobody ever asked me.  
So I don't know what I would have done years ago if that opportunity ever came
along when I was young. So I've given a lot to this game on the women's side.
This game has given me more than I probably have ever given it. And I'm not
looking for any change or any other challenge than the challenge that I have
in front of me right now.  
Unless Mike called me and said he would give me 2 million a year to be his
assistant with the Nets because that's the greatest job in the history of
sports, being an assistant NBA coach. I may have the best job in all of
sports. But I'll tell you what, you gotta be pretty hard to find a better job,
an assistant in the NBA to a great guy.  
You get up. You go to practice. You're working with the best players. Watching
film. Doing individual work. Go to the game. Trying to figure out how to beat
these guys that are great. Game's over. No media. No press conference. Nobody
asking you why you suck.  
Go out to dinner. Nice glass of wine, go home and do it again the next day.
Come on, that's like dying and going to heaven.  
  
Q. If he calls and says come to the Nets?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Two million (laughter).  
Not taking it for any less. You hear that, Mike? Two million.  
  
Q. For all who were here, not watching ESPN yesterday, what did you say to
that guy about leaving, and was it a joke they didn't get? Or what happened
there?  
COACH AURIEMMA: What guy?  
  
Q. What John asked you about a while ago, said you would leave or something
if you were undefeated next year and they didn't get the joke?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, I didn't say that. I didn't say that. People keep wanting
me to talk about next season. Man, if you win tomorrow and you're only ten
away from ADA, you know, I said: You're out of your mind. Really out of your
mind.  
That's when I made the comment that we play eight out of our 11 nonconference
games before January 1st, and they were all at one time in the top 15 in the
country this year.  
And if we can get through that kind of schedule with five freshmen, it's not
going to happen. It's not. If it does happen, I'll quit right there on the
spot. February 1st. I'll walk away. I said this -- I can't do this anymore.
Sorry.  
  
Q. I was going to follow him up and say so we tell Blazejowski that next
year when New York is open you've got no interest in coaching the Liberty in
New York --  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, 2 million minimum. I'm not leaving from Connecticut for
anything less than 2 million, plus a car, a driver, a house. Not moving. My
own personal publicist. Otherwise I'm staying right where I am.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer,
as well as student-athletes Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, Jeanette Pohlen, Kayla
Pedersen, Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Jayne Appel.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're thrilled to be playing in the championship game, and I
feel that our team is -- we will be ready. Our team is confident and at this
point I think having played the very tough schedule that we played it will
really pay off for us. So we'll have a productive day today. Our team has been
very focused and get ready for great game tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I'd like to hear a couple of your favorite Tara stories, dealing with her
coaching intensity, coaching skill, whatever. Anybody who has a couple
favorite stories, I'd love to hear them.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it may not come off at first, but how fun she is in
practice. We joke around with her all the time. I think my favorite thing to
get on her about is her Diet Coke. It's like my mother's coffee in the morning
to her. But we love her for it, so...  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Even though I've only been here a few years I've had a
terrific experience with Tara. She kind of highlighted one in practice the
other day when we were practicing. It was our last practice at Maples and she
had one of my favorite quotes. She said -- she said it to Kayla, I think. She
said, Kayla, sometimes you're the dog and sometimes you're the hydrant
(laughter).  
And so I forgot about that one, but she definitely -- she's really great.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I remember her telling me one time -- Jayne and I were
both missing layups, but kind of to each other, she's like, It's all right;
keep playing Ping-Pong off the backboard. Implying she didn't want us to make
the layup. So that was pretty funny.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I think one thing about Tara is she'll be the first one to
joke on you in front of everybody. So it's like, you know, some of it is kind
of true and stuff, but she keeps joking on you to kind of get her point across
so that you're even more embarrassed about something.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Tara is also kind of a jack-of-all-trades. You always kind of
randomly hear about Tara being somewhere or advocating for something. Two
examples would be you may not know she was actually in Cosmopolitan magazine
in an article and she was giving love advice (laughter) for how to catch that
male or female athlete of your choice.  
And another thing, Tara has been in another magazine as top -- what was it?
Best dressed coach? Does anybody remember exactly what it was? She was on
Forbes List for best dressed professionals or something. She made it
(laughter). It might have been the New York Times, she said.  
  
Q. For any of the players, this is where you wanted to be. Here we are the
day before the national championship game. I asked Tara last night, if you
think the last couple of games have been a little bit hairy, now that you're
here, can you guys just relax and play now that you've gotten to where you
wanted to go?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, this is what we've been talking about all year.
This is what we've been working for. And I would have to say it's definitely
kind of just a little bit of weight lifted off of our shoulders, knowing that
we've played as many games as we could possibly play.  
And now it's just to leave everything out, everything that we've worked for in
the season, just to leave it all out tomorrow night, and I'm really excited
that we made it this far, especially with the team that I'm on this year. I
don't think it could have been any better.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I think there's not as much pressure anymore to get to
the national championship game. And we're all really excited to be able to
play one more game and go as far as we can in the tournament. That was our
ultimate goal. We didn't want to end our season early. We didn't want to end
our season early with a loss. So it's exciting to be able to get another shot
at UConn. And like Nneka said, put it all out there.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask each of you, or whoever wants to tackle this, what ways
are you different or better as a team than you were when the last time you
played Connecticut? Is it better press, better defense? In what ways are you
different than the last time you faced Connecticut?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think we're playing more consistently throughout each half.
I think that we now understand how to attack pressure, and the value of every
possession now. We don't want any empty possessions. We want to capitalize on
everything that they do. And I think we're more fresh. So I think we're just
kind of rejuvenated and just ready to go.  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think at this point of the season it's not only the
players that are better equipped to handle UConn, but our coaches as well. I
think scouting at that point, there were so few games coming into it, UConn
hadn't really sculpted their idea. They had question marks, too, and both of
us were coming into it undefeated. I think now, after watching other people
play, we can figure out what will make us successful.  
  
Q. Jayne?  
JAYNE APPEL: I kind of agree with both of them. I think it really will help us
having only played one game in the past week and not three. I also think that
it will be different in the sense we've really learned. We watched our worst
moments in basketball. That's what we focused on. We watched our highlights
after the game, then after that we pick apart everything we did wrong from
physically to mentally.  
And that goes from player 1 to player 15. So I think that as a team as a whole
we've just really learned from our mistakes and hopefully we'll be able to
continue to improve on them in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, kind of building on that last question. Tara
mentioned about how confident the team feels now. How much of is that based on
the fact that you played Connecticut in December and played them very
competitively and you have that body of work taking into this game tomorrow?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Are you talking about confidence in tomorrow?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, I mean, it's always good to be able to play a team
before you play them just to know their tendencies and what they like to do. I
wouldn't say that -- I mean, I guess statistically and scout-wise speaking, we
are confident in the fact that we've played them. But I think most of our
confidence comes from what we've learned over the course of the game since
then, whether it be on or off the court.  
We've definitely been put into several different -- I think we've been put
into almost every situation possible in a game. And I'm glad that we have that
experience. And when it comes to crunch time, we really know what to do.  
But I think the confidence right now lies within us. And kind of the dynamics
of us as teammates kind of as a sisterhood together, that's kind of lighting
the fire and pushing everybody to their limit.  
  
Q. I'd like to address this to Jeanette and Ros. None of the teams shot the
3-point well last night. I think it's 16 percent for all four teams. I wonder,
could you all talk about the dome, the impact, the different way it looks, was
it maybe the situation? And how big do you think 3-point shooting might be in
the matchup tomorrow night? Connecticut didn't shoot the 3 well either. Both
the 3-point shooting and perimeter scoring for both teams tomorrow?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I actually didn't even consider the dome as a factor. I
actually felt in shoot-around that all the guards were shooting pretty well.  
Personally -- I get this from my mom; I'm a little weird and superstitious
sometimes, the weird stuff -- sometimes I think there's a certain number of
made 3s out there and if you used them all last night they wouldn't happen
tomorrow. So we didn't use them. So I feel like maybe they'll all be put to
use tomorrow. And I feel like for a lot of our teammates 3s are contagious. I
know for me, and I'm not sure about Jeanette, but you hit one and it really
opens up the basket.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah. And I don't really think any four of the teams that
played last night are exactly known for 3-point shooting. Most of the teams
have somebody inside or somebody that can drive and are really looking to get
the ball inside, and so I think that's one of the reasons why we came out on
top as far as the win, and UConn as well, because even if we're having a bad
shooting night, we can really score inside and dominate.  
  
Q. Jayne, you said you go over the things that you've done poorly in a game.
With that in mind, Connecticut's the only game you lost this year; how much
have you reviewed that game, referenced it, when trying to figure out things
you shouldn't do as a team the rest of the season? Have you watched the tape
again since December? And if all of you can talk about that, that would be
great.  
JAYNE APPEL: We watched it this morning I think for the first time kind of
since the game really cut up and focusing on them, and so I think we've kind
of -- although we haven't looked ahead, we've been working ahead. So I think
we'll be ready to come out and compete tomorrow night and really capitalize on
what we kind of had lapses in the last game with them.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we saw a certain number of plays, in specifically the
second half, where we kind of just assumed they were going to make some of the
layups or didn't box out and not gave up on the play but weren't fully into
the play.  
And they capitalized on a lot of those missed layups. They were right there
for the offensive rebounds, and there were a few loose balls that they got. So
those are all things that we can fix. And that's where it comes down to
effort, and we know that we can really show that we can make a better effort.  
  
Q. It's been described as Connecticut's dominated for two years. They have
that long streak. It's been described as UConn and everybody else. You have a
history with them. You're the last team that have beaten them. How bad are you
itchin' to play them again?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I was talking with family friends and someone actually
said to me, you know, when the game got close between Baylor and UConn, I kind
of wanted to see UConn win because I wanted you guys to face them and have the
chance to avenge that loss and also say that if you did win, it was against
what people are calling now maybe one of the most dominant UConn teams ever.  
And I think it's fitting and exciting that we're going to see them again. And
I really don't know what else to say besides that. Like I'm ready to go out.
Whoever ended up winning, I'm ready to see.  
  
Q. Nneka, could you talk about what Ros was referring to, that moment when
Baylor got within 3. Did you learn something about Connecticut and the way
they responded? Because it seemed like it was the first time in this
tournament they had been challenged. And could you also speak to the impact
that Maya Moore had. She described your game having watched it as having been
a terrific impact, but can you just comment on that?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, I mean, first of all, Maya Moore is a phenomenal
player and athlete. And I was grateful that she complimented me. The least I
can do is compliment her. She's a huge asset for their team.  
But in regards to how UConn responded to I guess the closeness of the game,
when Baylor got them, I think it was within 3, I mean, they stayed composed
and they took care of the ball and kind of reflected how we handled
yesterday's game even.  
I think when good teams get into situations like that, they know not to panic.
And, quite frankly, I think that's something that we both kind of shared with
UConn. And I think they handled themselves very well. They didn't panic. They
didn't start throwing the ball away.  
But I'd also have to give credit to Baylor for giving them somewhat of a game
in the beginning of the second half. Baylor is a talented team and everyone is
going to want to play you their hardest. Oklahoma showed us that yesterday.
And so kudos to those teams as well.  
  
Q. Jayne, how well do you know Tina Charles? Can you sort of assess the
matchup tomorrow? And what do you see as her strengths?  
JAYNE APPEL: I know her very well. She's one of my great basketball friends.
And I think that competing against her from the age of 11 on, you know, I
think one of her greatest strengths is running from rim to rim. She really
likes to do her work early and get you in as deep as she can inside the key. I
think those are some of the greatest things about her game.  
  
Q. Nneka, a lot of focus tomorrow night, obviously, is going to be on the
matchup between you and Maya. Could you address that and what you expect of it
in light of the performances you both had in the national semifinals?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Like I said, Maya is a good player. We both have really
good teams. I think it's going to be a matchup not just individually but
collectively, just the disparity between teamwork and working hard and going
after each possession.  
I think it's going to be a battle that's going to show the fight to the finish
between everybody. And, I mean, Connecticut doesn't just have Maya Moore; they
have Tina Charles, they have Kalana Greene, Caroline Doty, Tiffany Hayes.  
And then we don't just have one player; we have all these people up here, and
then some on the bench as well. And I think it's going to be really great
matchup. I'm really excited.  
  
Q. Ros, this is for you. In your estimation, what is it going to take to win
tomorrow night?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think it always starts for us with a great scouting
game plan. I think that we are going to need a traditionally good game, like
that we always expect from our big three. Maybe an exceptionally good game.  
I think that our guards are going to have to do their part. We can't turn the
ball over. We have to box out. And we have to get back in transition,
especially on Maya, because she's really running hard in transition. And stay
with it, try to avoid their big runs and help each other out.  
  
Q. Two years ago you guys lost to UConn early in the season in a tournament
and you came back and beat them in the semifinals. Does this dynamic feel
familiar at all for you?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think, you know, even in the Pac-10 it's hard to play a team
twice in the year for both teams. You know their tendencies, you know what
they traditionally come out and do against you.  
But I think we're excited. We've been in this position before of playing for
national championship. We've been in the position of going home before a
national championship.  
So I think we're just going to take all of the energy, bundle it up into our
game plan, and come out and just try to compete for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, when you watched the film this morning, what was more instructive:
The 15-2 run that you guys went on in the first half or the 30-to-6 run they
went on in the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I've watched the game several times. And, you know, I
think that for us, obviously, we want to know that we can make the run when
we're down; that we're capable of beating a team in 20 minutes.  
At the same time, the second half, the game got away from us. And I think it's
just really important for our team to see how it got away from us.  
So I would say that we've probably focused more on how it got away from us
this morning, just to say: Look at the things we could have done. Look at the
things we need to do. Look at the things we're capable of doing.  
We didn't do those in December. We have to do those in April.  
  
Q. What didn't you do?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that, first of all, for our team, and as you
can hear kind of these players talk about it, they really do well when there's
a very clear plan for them, and then people follow a plan.  
It really is very helpful for us to have played Connecticut and see our
matchups, see how people guard different people, what they do against us.  
And so for our team, a clear plan -- and I don't know that we had a clear
plan. And part of it was the fact that we had played a lot of big games
leading up to Connecticut.  
And this is tough, too, when we only have one day. We like it when we have
like maybe three or four days and we can go over things, and we spend a lot of
time watching video almost ad nauseam. Our team is like -- we joke about it.
I'll be like: Does anybody want to watch video? And they've seen enough.  
A lot of the mistakes we made were how we played screens. A lot of the things,
just our help side. Our not boxing out. Quite honestly, we were not aggressive
enough. And I think that part of it could be the fact that we weren't as
energetic as we needed to be.  
We were a little tired. And also at this point I think we had more bodies. We
can play Joslyn. She was just coming off a stress fracture.  
So being more energetic, being more aggressive, and learning from the mistakes
that we made, I think, will be key.  
  
Q. Obviously both teams are filled with some very talented players. But a
little unique situation in that each side has one who has the ability to take
over a game, as they showed last night. Could you talk about that dynamic of
having Nneka and Maya with that type of player on the floor?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Nneka had a great game last night, and she is really
stepping up for us. Maya Moore is just -- she's a tough guard for anyone in
that she's so big, so strong. And she shot the ball probably the best of any
shooter last night, all four teams combined.  
She's the best player in the game right now in the college game, and she's
better than a lot of the professionals, too.  
But we can't have it be a one-on-one match. It can't be Maya Moore versus one
person for us. We have to really help on her. And not only do they have her,
but they have the second best player in Tina Charles. And obviously both of
them did a lot of damage last night. And we just have to really work hard to
limit their damage, and then maximize the strengths that we have. We're going
to need Jayne to give us more. Kayla to give us more.  
We can't expect Nneka to carry us with another 40-point game.  
  
Q. You played them when they came along in '95, you've played them various
times in their development --  
COACH VANDERVEER: You didn't have to bring that up, Mel.  
  
Q. I'm not talking about the wins or losses; just playing them. Talk about
their development over the years, what they do better now than maybe they did
back then, maybe they did something a little better then that they don't do
now?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You all are very familiar with Geno, his program, and this
particular team. Geno does a great job. He's a superb teacher of the game. He
has a vision for how his team will play. And they play that way or they don't
play.  
They are very talented players, individually, but collectively they're more
formidable, because they play so well together. And they're very physical. I
think that what I've seen with them is that their defense has really improved.
I mean, they've always been just a beautiful offensive kind of machine to
watch, how they pass and screen, and they're one of the best passing teams, I
mean, just traditionally.  
And they're an excellent shooting team. But their defense is what's working
for them now. They create a lot of turnovers. Like we turned it over like 17
times against them last time we played. They are extremely athletic and fast.
And you can't -- you can't shoot yourself in the foot with them.  
You've got to really value the possession of the ball. You can't give them
second shots. You've got to limit the good looks that they get. And even if
you're right there on them, they still can make shots.  
  
Q. You've got inside players, and you go there first offensively, but do you
have to knock down shots from the outside tomorrow night to win?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Last time we played them, we didn't shoot extremely well. We
were like 5-for-13. But JJ and Kayla and Jeanette all made 3s. I don't think
we can expect to win if we're bricklayers.  
But, you know what, they didn't shoot that well the first time we played them.
They were 3-for-20 from 3. And last night I don't think they shot that well. I
don't know what they shot from the perimeter last night. But everyone just
seemed to struggle.  
But we have really good shooters on our team. And if people focus on inside
with Jayne or with Nneka, that will be a time people are going to have to read
the defense and knock down perimeter shots.  
  
Q. You've done something probably no other coach has done: You won two
championships in three years. You win an Olympic gold medal. And then some of
your teams struggle or weren't as successful as the other teams. Now all of a
sudden you're back, third straight year in the Final Four. Psychologically,
what was that like? What was it like to win two championships, a gold medal,
and see this Connecticut phenomenon sort of blossom, and then you're able to
come back and beat that phenomenon and play them again?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, well, I think a lot of it has to do with the
players that you have. Recruiting great players and having, for us -- if you
look at maybe different years, for us we could tie it to -- we could look at
not just the coach and the program, but who our dean of admissions is. We can
look at kind of just the injuries that we've had. And it was very hard.  
It wasn't like that we were horrible. But once you get used to the cream, it's
hard to be down in that skim milk. It was really -- we wondered if we could
really ever get back. And I think we knocked down the door three times in a
row with Elite Eight. So we kind of said we're there.  
And then I think really the person that -- key players like Maya Moore for
Connecticut or Tina Charles for them, because they had a little bit of a lull,
by their standards, but we really got back on track with Candice and Jayne.
Candice Wiggins, you know, really just has a passion and she was just such a
charismatic player for us, and Jayne, the inside presence.  
Then along comes Nneka, and obviously Kayla and just having the players. And
then once you're knocking on the door, then you expect this. Our team expected
to come to the Final Four and expected to be in this game. And now we need our
team to expect to win.  
  
Q. Along those lines, to segue out of what you just said, I think among
casual fans, there's probably this inevitability that Connecticut's already
been crowned and you're going to -- you're playing for the Cinderella role
tomorrow. How do you respond to that as far as what the casual fan sees? And
also is there a motivation in your locker room because they've already been
crowned in a lot of people's minds?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I mean, sometimes I think that like with our team,
we just try to take it one step at a time. And our kids, one day I think they
had heard something on television or read something. They said, yeah, it's the
NCAA tournament, the Connecticut Invitational. They were kind of just like a
little -- just kind of talking about that.  
I said, hey, so let's get invited. And let's get here and let's just take it
one step at a time. And Connecticut has earned their -- the accolades that
they get. I mean, to go 77 games, that's incredible. That's just -- I think
that's tremendous.  
But what I try to do -- even during the year people will say: How about you
and Connecticut? And I'm like: We're not there yet. But now we can talk about
it. And our team has earned kind of the opportunity to talk about playing
Connecticut. And we are playing them.  
We did not play that well the first time around. We did well in the first
half. We went into Hartford, which I think is a tough place to play. We were
up at halftime. And then the game got away from us.  
And our team needs to -- we need to say, hey, we have to have the confidence
to know for one half we can win. We have to put two halves together.  
Whatever everyone thinks out there, you know, just like I think everyone had
maybe crowned the Patriots as NFL champions. Well, the Giants won.  
So we just have to come out and play. We have to play a lot better than
actually we're playing right now, and we might need Connecticut to have a
little off night.  
  
Q. The other big matchup tomorrow is going to be Jayne Appel against Tina
Charles. How concerned are you that Jayne is not in top condition at this
point, and that she's still a little gimpy from her ankle and has been for a
month?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right.  
  
Q. And a follow-up, if I may. How would you like this game to be officiated?
Would you prefer that the refs let a little of the physicality go? Or would
you like it called very tightly?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Let me start with the officiating. Of course, which I have
no control over. I think they should call it the way they've been calling it
all year. They make a point of emphasis not to allow rough post play. And last
night I thought Jayne was -- I just thought it was a very physical game.  
I just think if you have people going to the basket and people impede their
progress or they're bumping them and pushing them and it's -- I don't think
it's good for the women's game. And I've always felt that way. I don't want it
really tight. I don't want ticky-tack trials. I think people are coming to
watch the best players, and we want them to play.  
But I don't think it should be a wrestling match or we shouldn't be looking at
like an NFL offensive linemen drill.  
The other question about Jayne is she's an absolute warrior. She is in pain.
She does not practice. She feels that her wind is good getting up and down,
but she is clearly not the All-American player that was playing that way for
us a month ago.  
And all we can ask her to do is to battle in there and do the very best that
she can, which I feel like she is. But I want her to get deep in and score and
make really good decisions about her passing. She rebounded well last night. I
thought she ran pretty well for us.  
But there's a couple times where she just is off balance and not finishing the
way I've seen her for four years. She's really key for our team's success. And
I think the fact that this is her last game and this is a person that she's
played against since she was 11 years old, I think you'll see Jayne give it
her all, what she's capable of.  
But her ankle is holding her back. She won't tell you that, but I can see it.  
  
Q. I want to get back to the film of the first game. You mentioned a while
ago that you had watched it several times. Does it get to the point with
Connecticut, because of the possibility down the road of playing them in the
Final Four, where it becomes sort of like something you carry around with you
and just pop it in the machine, when you have an hour, hour and a half to
kill?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Not necessarily. I kind of feel like I have it a little
memorized. I've watched it early when we went back. I mean, I can go through
and clip it so I have clips of it. Looking at like the stat sheet.  
But you kind of have to get away from that, when you have December. We can't
keep bringing that to our team. It's about -- for us it's about our journey.
For us it's about getting better.  
And I'm thankful that we scheduled Connecticut and Tennessee and Duke, because
I feel like -- and Gonzaga -- all these teams in different ways have helped us
get better.  
And Connecticut has helped us get better. But for our team, it's -- sometimes
we just want to show them and say here's what has given us problems. Here's
what we need to do better. Here's -- to play at the elite level, this is what
you have to be able to do.  
But I don't think it's healthy for us or for our team to constantly be putting
it in their face. I mean, I think it's tedious watching some of the games and
listening to some of the announcers just go on about how Connecticut never
takes a play off. I mean, they're kids. They're college students, like our
college students, and no one plays a perfect game.  
And that's what for our team is that we want to learn from the mistakes we
made, but also recognize, you know, you went into Hartford and you were up at
halftime. You did a lot of good things but not enough good things.  
  
Q. A lot is made in basketball about the relationship between the coach and
a point guard. They're often said they're an extension of the coach on the
floor. Conversely, could you talk about the relationship between the coach and
a post player, center? And to sort of follow that up, is it more difficult to
get maximum out of post players than perhaps perimeter players?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think sometimes it's just different
personalities and different people click. What I try to do is -- as an example
with Jayne. Jayne is the closest probably on our staff -- she gets along well
with all of our coaches, but closest to Amy. Amy works with Jayne and really
is Jayne's kind of confidante.  
But I might be -- I speak with Jayne before every game. We step outside of the
locker room and I just remind Jayne how much I enjoy coaching her and what a
tremendous talent she is and how much she means to our team. And I just remind
her to stay out of foul trouble. But I feel like it's more -- it's not
positional, but more just personality.  
I thought you were going to ask me about Jeanette. I'm just getting to know
Jeanette. But if there's someone on the team -- I feel like I have -- maybe I
can just relate to Nneka really well. We're the oldest. We're the oldest of
four girls. So some of it is just based maybe on family or personality,
recruiting who you get to know. Not positional, in my mind.  
  
Q. You were talking about your scheduling and I guess I'd like to know if
you and Geno have had any discussions even preliminarily about extending your
regular season series beyond next year's game in Palo Alto. And do you think
it would be good for women's basketball if you and Connecticut played every
year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I know that we have. I think Neal Eskin does the scheduling,
and we are working on that. And I hope that we are able to continue it.  
I think it's really good for us. I don't know if it's good for women's
basketball. But I think you have the East Coast/West Coast, and Geno does just
a great job with their team and program. They have outstanding fans.  
And I know that it will be a big game when Connecticut comes to Stanford next
year.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about your early days in basketball. Where exactly
did you grow up in Upstate New York? And I read a story in the Mercury News
last week that your father didn't want you to play basketball and you said:
Algebra won't get me anywhere, either.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right.  
  
Q. I read another story that you would bow out in your Delta '88 to go watch
Immaculata play?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That's true.  
I grew up in Schenectady, New York, since I was from five to 15. At the time I
was growing up there wasn't basketball for girls. I would go out and play with
the boys. I grew up in a really nice like 80 home kind of neighborhood where
all the dads worked at General Electric outside of Schenectady. And it was a
Leave It to Beaver kind of childhood.  
I would go out to play, but as I got older the boys then didn't want girls
playing, so then I liked to have the best basketball; if they wanted to use
that ball, then I got to play. And I played all the time. If the boys weren't
there, I would just shoot by myself. And by the time I got to be about -- I
know my parents were just like -- they were both teachers. They would say:
Come in and do your algebra homework, study, because basketball is not going
to take you anywhere.  
So I would send them postcards like from Russia, you know, P.S.: Basketball is
what's paying my way over here.  
But as a young child, it was very hard, actually, because of not having teams
that I decided when my parents moved -- we moved to Niagara Falls, New York --
I was done with basketball. In fact, I'm kind of stubborn.  
I moved as a sophomore in high school. I hated where we moved. I hated leaving
my school. I was kind of bratty as a 15-year-old. Maybe an adolescent. So we
moved in November. My parents finally broke down. I never had a hoop of my
own. And they were getting me a hoop for Christmas. And I was like: I'm done
with basketball. I'll never shoot on that hoop.  
My dad put it up and other kids played on it, but I didn't play on it. I
decided to try out for cheerleading. It was a love/hate relationship with
basketball. Because I loved it, but there were no opportunities to play.  
So I just started watching. I watched Calvin Murphy at Niagara and St.
Bonaventure had Bob Lanier. And I watched it and studied it in my own little
way. I went to Indiana and -- I started at Albany because I went back to where
I had gone to high school, and then I just said basketball is no fun here.  
I jumped center, leading scorer, leading rebounder leading turnover. So I got
friends and drove out watched the tournament and I said I want to play in kind
of the big time of AIW basketball and went to Indiana and had a great
experience there.  
  
Q. So you didn't play on a high school --  
COACH VANDERVEER: Never. No, never played high school. My college season was a
seven-game regular season schedule. I sprained my ankle, missed half the
season. But I had great friends -- and I played -- I would go to the gym --
like I studied and went to class, and then I would go to the gym all
afternoon. We practiced after the boys, which was at 7:00 at night. So that
was -- I would go watch Bobby Knight's practice for like three hours.  
  
Q. How important is it for you guys to get off to a big start or a good
start tomorrow night? When you played them last year in the semis they kind of
blitzed you from the start, whereas in December you had a great first half
--  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that was really key for us. I like when we get out
to a good start in any game. We have started well with the exception of, I
would say, maybe our Arizona State game at home and our Arizona game.  
I think this team -- we've got to stay in contact with them. We're not like a
super athletic pressing, trapping, okay, we can get down and we can come back
from whatever, being down 15 or something.  
So we did get down nine and we did come back. We rallied. But I think we have
to come out and each possession, I mean, has to be a heavyweight fight. You
gotta stay up. You can't get on the mat.  
  
Q. Take a little detour, Tara. Geno is going to be the Olympic coach. The
first time since '96 on your turn that a collegiate coach is running the
Olympic team. If you look at histories, Pat, K, and you, in your own programs,
if you're looking at time lines, you all had dips around the same time you
were coaching the Olympians. Are there things he needs to be on guard against,
on guard for in terms of his own program as he moves in that direction in the
next couple of years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, he'll do a great job with the Olympic team. I think it
is maybe a little bit different. For me I had to take the whole year off, so
my situation was maybe different than anyone's.  
I don't know that it's anything that you just -- you get -- you just get so
tired. Like for me I just was -- you just don't have the same amount of
energy. So I think it's having people around you who will do a lot of the
stuff for you that -- I mean, you just need other people working a lot harder
around you, because you just get worn down.  
I was just so physically tired and emotionally drained from the experience.
And I just didn't realize it until even in the middle of the year and I just
didn't have the same kind of bounce to my step and enthusiasm that you need to
have to work with collegiate student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tara, you were asked about how important it is to get off to an early
start. I'm kind of wondering, from looking at it from the other end of the
game, you had a couple of games where things got really tense for you down the
stretch with Xavier, and obviously last night as well. Do you wonder what the
same emotions might be for Connecticut; they've been behind in only like 38
minutes this year. Do you wonder what it might be like? Obviously you want to
put them in that situation, but do you wonder what it would be like for them
to finally be in a real tense game down the stretch?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, obviously we'd like to put them in that situation.
We'd like it to not even be that tense. We like to have that 10-, 15-,
18-point lead. But obviously look at what happened last night.  
I think for us -- Connecticut even last night was a little test for them.
They're human. They shoot air balls like we shoot air balls. They miss free
throws or they miss shots or they miss box-outs, and for our team I think it's
just going to come down to us being really physical, us not backing down,
making -- people making shots. Making sure we don't give them easy shots. Make
it hard for them.  
And I'm sure they're going to try to do the same thing to us, not letting
people be in their comfort zone. But I think that they have -- they've won
before. Even though maybe the games haven't been that close, I know they do
drills in practice. They play against guys and played down 10 and come back
and things like that.  
I just think that we have to focus on what we do and we have to do it really,
really well. And just see how -- we have to battle. And I just hope that we
come out and do that.  
  
Q. Reflecting back on '96, as it turned out it was a very important moment
for the growth of women's sports. And you won the gold medal, softball won the
gold medal. Soccer won the gold medal. Maybe one of the most celebrative
moments for women sports at that point. Could you talk about how that sort of
maybe changed the game for women and the way they were perceived in many
ways?  
COACH VANDERVEER: One of the things I think was that brought to my attention,
I mean, this was kind of funny was Sheryl Swoopes as an example, when Sheryl
Swoopes was first on the team, we trained for a year, she could bench-press 40
pounds.  
It was by the end of the year, I mean, it was more. I can't tell you exactly
what it was. But Lisa Leslie said to me: I'm proud of my muscles. You saw
women with strong arms and physical in a very positive way. And they were
proud of -- Lisa was excited to be fit and strong.  
Some of the training was intense for a year. I think it was -- it was really a
little bit of the foundation for the profession of women's basketball. And
seeing women not only as collegiate athletes but as professional athletes, and
for me it was just a tremendous year working with really dedicated and
committed women athletes and traveling the world.  
And I think it was a big statement, not just by our sport, but by the other
female athletes at the Atlanta Olympics.  
  
Q. Last night UConn had for one of the rare times during their streak, the
role players -- not Maya and Tina -- have an off night; I think they combined
for 15 points, the rest of the team. Does that help you guys get confidence
that that blueprint may work; that if they get in foul trouble and they're not
shooting well they can be in a little bit of trouble? Or is it, okay, they
have this off night finally and the odds of that happening two days in a row
or two games in a row is not too high for them?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, the numbers, I think, would show that Connecticut -- I
mean, Connecticut's best players are Maya Moore and Tina Charles and they
stepped up for them. And what do they score? Like 56 or 58 of their 70 points.  
You know, so they didn't need the other players. But I think that the key
players for their team are Maya Moore, Tina Charles, maybe Kalana Greene being
in there. But the other kids are great players. Hayes. Caroline Doty. They can
have a night off and their team can still be really successful.  
You have to, people say, pick your poison. They have a lot of weapons. And I
don't know that that gives me any comfort to say, well, okay, let's count on
that. I mean, they're all very, very capable of players. So maybe they buy
into Ros's mother theory: They're going to get a certain number of 3s and they
just didn't happen. So that could be bad news for us.  
  
Q. That seven-game season, was that Albany or Indiana?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It might have been nine games at Indiana. Seven or nine, I
can't remember which it was.  
  
Q. Which place did you sprain your ankle?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Indiana.  
  
Q. And when you played outside, were you playing at a playground in
Schenectady?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No. Driveways. I didn't have a playground. Families had
their house and a hoop on the garage. And my next-door neighbor had one, and
sometimes they'd park the car there so that I knew that wasn't available so
I'd go to the other one. Then there was another one that had a nice half court
that was out in a little bit of a field. So I kind of took over that one.  
  
Q. Do you remember Riley? Was he a big --  
COACH VANDERVEER: He was a little older than me. He went to a different high
school. But, yes, boys basketball was big in the Schenectady area.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  70  
Baylor - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey as well
as student-athletes Brittney Griner and Morghan Medlock.  
Let's take questions.  
  
Q. Morghan, a couple of sequences the first half when you guys didn't seem
to be able to get shots to fall, and then in the second half, when you got the
lead, got them down to 3, and then they took off from there, can you talk
about what happened in those two instances?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I just think that's where their experience kicked in. We got
lost on a couple of defensive plays, and Maya Moore, being the great player
that she is, she did what she does best, and that's take over.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you just talk about how tough it was to go against Tina
Charles with her kind of experience and just how good a player she is?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, it was definitely a battle in the post. I just feel
like she did what she needed to do for her team, and being her experience. And
I just hope to just be back.  
  
Q. Morghan, can you talk about having to go up against both Tina and Maya
and how difficult it was to try to stop one and not both of them?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: It was really difficult. You can look at film on a team all
you want, but until you get on the floor with them and actually get up and
down the floor with them, jump with them, bang with them a little bit, you
never know how good players are. And just getting up with the two of them,
they're pretty good.  
  
Q. Brittney, when you guys do get it to 3, UConn calls a timeout. The bench
is going crazy. I mean, how much did you feel like the game was there for the
taking?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was definitely there for us to take. We just -- just
mistakes and let it slip through our fingers. It was right there. But I feel
like we never stopped playing to our ability and we kept trying to get that,
to get it down.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about the matchup against Charles, how that's
helped you become a better basketball player?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, good thing they let us play tonight. Just learning from
her. Just how patient she is and just how her team plays off of her and just
-- she's All-American. What can I say?  
  
Q. Morghan, once you guys got it to 3 there, the rest of the game you all
really struggled to score. Did you guys kind of hit the wall there? Or what
was the reason the rest of the game where you guys just had trouble getting
shots and getting them in the basket?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I don't know. I think it might have just been the game of
basketball. The shots weren't falling. And they made a run. And I think
basketball is a game of runs. Tonight's game was a game of runs mixed in with
a little bit of inexperience. That's what happened, the experience and them
going on the run when we cut it to 3.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about what Tina did specifically? Did she try to
body you away from your comfort zone? Were they continuing to try to slap the
ball out of your hands, things like that? Could you tell us exactly what she
did to try to frustrate you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: She just did what normally every other post does. She's
physical. She tries to get me off the block. She was a lot better than most
other posts. And I wouldn't say I got frustrated or upset. I felt it was just
a battle. And she had more experience than I did.  
  
Q. Brittney, just wanted to ask you, I saw that Coach Auriemma stopped to
make it a point to tell you something at the end. Can you share what he said
to you? And what it meant to you to hear that from him?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, he just told me that I was a good player and just
keep going. And it means a lot for the other coaches to just tell you that
you're a good player and just to keep working hard.  
  
Q. Brittney, you broke the NCAA record for blocks in a season this year as a
freshman, also the NCAA tournament record for blocks. Can you talk about how
it feels to accomplish that in your first collegiate year? And also what areas
of your game you hope to work on and improve on over the summer?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Ball handling would probably be one. Just getting stronger
with my lower body and stop relying on my height would definitely be something
I'm going to get in the gym soon and start working on. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Morghan, you sort of watched these freshmen grow up, including the one
sitting next to you, who has had such a phenomenal freshman year. Could you
kind of put in perspective what the freshmen have meant to this program and
what you think that's going to mean for Baylor basketball for the next few
years?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I think one statement I can just bluntly make about that is
without those five we wouldn't have been here, period. And they have a bright
future ahead of them, and all I can say is the teams just better watch out
because what they did their first year is huge. No freshmen do that, unless
you're talking about a Maya Moore or Tina Charles. But collectively I think
they did a great job. And they're only going to get better.  
They have three years left. And it's just going to be amazing to watch them
grow and grow and turn into the players that UConn has and things like that
their junior and senior years.  
  
Q. Morghan, kind of following up on that. Obviously I know the loss is
disappointing. But even in the wake of that, do you still have a sense of
appreciation over what you guys were able to do this year?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Definitely. I'm disappointed we lost and sad because it was
my last game and all that stuff.  
But I couldn't be more proud of this basketball team with the injuries and
some things, not playing well in conference and just all the stuff that we had
going. We weren't even expected to be here.  
I'm just really proud we beat the odds and we got here, and I'm proud that we
didn't quit tonight and we gave UConn everything we had. They just were more
experienced and you can't teach that overnight.  
But I think next year, when these kids are back in the Final Four, which they
will be, I think they'll know what to do in situations and stuff like that,
because they'll be more experienced than your average sophomores.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, you guys were halfway through the first half. I think you had eight
turnovers and three field goals. You were down 25 to 8 and you turn it around.
What happened to get back in the game and get within 3 there in the second
half?  
COACH MULKEY: Hustle plays. I thought hustle plays. And Griner got some more
touches. And they're freshmen out there and they were desperately trying to
keep the game close.  
  
Q. Kim, you guys went 1-for-7 from 3-point range in the one game with about
1:15 to go. How much would a couple early on maybe loosened up that zone that
blanketed Griner all night?  
COACH MULKEY: I didn't think they blanketed her all night, really. I don't
think they had to. I think she got the ball a lot in one-on-one situations,
and they came some.  
But we got good looks. And, sure, if you hit some of those early, it might not
have -- we might not have been down double figures at halftime.  
But we had good looks. I thought there were several things that were different
in the game. First of all, their two All-Americans scored all but 15 of their
points. And that's a junior and a senior for Connecticut that we had freshmen
guarding. Griner was guarding Tina Charles all night and Shanay Washington and
Nae-Nae Hayden and Jordan Madden took their shots at Maya Moore.  
Therein lies the difference in the game. And because of the experience our
freshman got guarding those great players, I can only think in the future
they're going to be really excited to have an opportunity to get back here.  
  
Q. Where does that performance from Maya Moore rank with you in terms of a
player playing a big game among the biggest stages?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, she's just -- she's National Player of the Year, isn't
she? That's what they do. National Players of the Year, they don't get
rattled. They get big offensive and timely rebounds. And she did. In fact, she
was part of the reason it went from a 3-point game when we cut it to 11, I
think she got some long rebounds there and some free throws, and that's why
she's the National Player of the Year. She's just a great, great player.  
And then when you have her on the perimeter and you add a Tina Charles in the
post and both of them had double-doubles on this stage, there's a reason for
it.  
They've been here before. They've experienced it. They've taken everybody's
best shot, 78 games or however many games they've won, and they just don't get
rattled.  
I've had players score more points against us in our conference. But she's
special.  
  
Q. Kim, I saw you get excited, M.J. get excited when you all cut it to 3 and
they called the timeout. Maybe you were already believing, but do you think
the team was believing at that point?  
COACH MULKEY: Believing?  
  
Q. That you could do it.  
COACH MULKEY: I think they believed before they tipped off they could do it. I
don't think I coach any kids that think they can't do it. I mean, they were
trying out there. They played hard. They just got beat by two All-Americans.  
  
Q. Are you telling them in the timeouts at that point, hey, we've got to
expect a run back from UConn?  
COACH MULKEY: I probably -- you're talking about when we cut it to 3? I wasn't
probably telling them that. I was probably saying: Now you see you can play
with them. It was probably something motivating like that, that, hey,
everybody in this arena is cheering for you to win and you can play with them,
and just trying to motivate them.  
I thought when you're playing as hard as they were playing and as hard as we
were playing, I just thought that fatigue set in with both teams. And he
didn't sub and doesn't play a whole lot of players. And if you look at my
stats, I didn't sub a whole lot either.  
And so you had some women out there that were really, really playing hard.  
  
Q. Kim, has the regular season game with UConn been officially set for next
year? The reason I ask, I was wondering whether you would get them before they
would get that 88-game winning tying --  
COACH MULKEY: It has been set. I couldn't tell you the date. And then they
come back to Waco the following year. We go there Maya Moore's senior year.
They come back after she's gone.  
  
Q. You don't know whether it's like November, December?  
COACH MULKEY: I honestly do not.  
  
Q. Can you give us an idea what Brittney talked about what she thinks she
wants to work on? Can you talk about what you think she'll work on next year?
But also the rest of your freshmen, they made so much progress, what are some
of the things you think you'll see them progress on next season?  
COACH MULKEY: As I always do at the end of the year, you sit down with players
and you talk about their individual strengths and weaknesses. With Brittney
Griner it will be continue to get her stronger and get her in the weight room,
make she understands she has to play with her entire body. I think she gets
bumped off the block a lot. That comes with maturity. That comes with more
weight training.  
And she progressed a great deal through the course of her freshman year. And
she will continue to get better.  
I'd like to see her become a better offensive rebounder. I'd like to see her
go in there and get a little more. And, yet, at the same time I've got to be
fair. There may be a reason why she is not a better offensive rebounder, and
it probably has to do with people all over.  
I could break them all down. Nae-Nae Hayden and Shanay and Nae-Nae, I'll sit
down -- I mean, Jordan Madden. I'll sit down with those kids as well and break
down what I want them to work on over the summer and what we'll work on
individually, and it could be anything from taking the ball off the dribble,
jump shots, perimeter shooting, but the progress those young ladies made is
big.  
But you haven't seen the best of them yet.  
  
Q. What did you have to say to Melissa and Brittney as they were subbed out
of the game?  
COACH MULKEY: Melissa Jones is hardest on herself. I told her: Take a look in
this building and look around. You have another year. You're not a senior. And
I think -- well, I know I did. I said: Thank God when you go to bed tonight
that you were able to experience this and that your injury was healed.  
Who was the other one you asked me about?  
  
Q. Brittney.  
COACH MULKEY: I told Brittney: I know a lot of four-time All-Americans that
didn't make it to a Final Four until their senior year. You brought your team
here as a freshman. Build on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Stanford  73  
Oklahoma - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale and Danielle Robinson
and Amanda Thompson.  
COACH COALE: I first want to congratulate Coach VanDerveer and Stanford. I
thought they played extremely well and they have a terrific basketball team,
and I wish them the best.  
We did not have an answer for Nneka all night long. And it just took us too
long to get going. They scored 21 in the first half and 45 in the second.  
It was too little too late, and still with two minutes to go I thought we had
a chance to win the game, and we did. I'm unbelievably proud of these kids. I
cannot express what a joy it has been to coach them, how refreshing it has
been and their willingness to learn, their drive, their belief, their faith,
how they are with one another.  
It's been everything that's good about college basketball, and I feel blessed
to have been their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amanda, could you talk a little bit about how difficult an assignment it
was to guard Nneka in this game and what were you trying to do?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She's very athletic. You know, she's making everything and
really aggressive down low. And we couldn't really doubler because they had
another 6'5" girl over there. With me in foul trouble I couldn't guard her how
I wanted to. She was just incredible all night. And she's a great player.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the difference between your team offensively in the
first half and in the second half?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We let our offense affect our defense. I mean, our -- yeah,
offense affect our defense. And so we know we weren't converting on that end,
so we struggled a little bit on the defensive end and then we would come down
and not convert again.  
We were just stagnant. We had no rhythm. Everybody was just standing, waiting
for somebody else to do it. They sagged a little bit, and that kind of socked
us up. I knew we'd fix it in the second half, but it just wasn't enough.  
  
Q. Danielle, the sagging, they didn't sag off Nyeshia. I think she only got
seven shots. Did they do anything special defensively to limit her shots?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I mean, they put their best defender, Rosalyn, on her. She
got some good looks. We all got some good looks. We just didn't knock shots
down when we needed to. I guess that's where we struggled in the first half.  
  
Q. You guys now have faced both Stanford and Connecticut. Assuming that
Connecticut moves forward out of its semifinal game, do you think there's
anything that Stanford could do to pull off the upset?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Stanford's a great team. They're both tremendously
athletic. They're both pretty big in size. I think it's going to be a great
matchup between the two of them.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: If they rebound like they rebounded tonight, I think it will
be a good matchup.  
  
Q. Danielle, like you said, it seemed like you guys got good looks, but did
you guys kind of have to take jumpers? Because you didn't have any room to
drive, it seemed like, because of their size. Was that one of -- Nyeshia
didn't get much going to the basket. Were you guys settling for jump shots?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I wouldn't say we were settling. We had open looks. When
you get wide-open looks, you have to knock them down.  
  
Q. Danielle, at the beginning of the game I think you started 0 and 9 from
the field. Particularly your jump shots seemed to be short. Was it something
they did? Was it the jitters, the big arena? What was it?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Wasn't getting under it. Leaning back a little too much.
And that's what made it short.  
  
Q. For both of you, in the replay of the game, in your mind, between missed
shots, offensive boards allowed, or the execution you were talking about,
Danielle, just what bothers you the most in the aftermath? What let it get
away?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Rebounding. We knew coming into the game that rebounding
was going to be the key. It seemed like we tipped it, we tipped it, and they
came up with it. Or we tipped it out of bounds and they had an extra
possession, new shot clock.  
Just wasn't securing the ball, and I guess a lack of focus.  
  
Q. 6:45 to go in the game; you guys were down 18 points. Was it just made
shots? What clicked that got you guys going? Because most people probably
thought that you were done.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: The game's not over until the clock says 00:00. And our whole
season has been about fighting. And we fought our way back to the game. And we
didn't want this to be our last one. And everybody just kind of linked
together and we found a way to come back.  
  
Q. Danielle, just continuing on that vein about the comeback, you were
really on fire at the end. Did you think at that point that you had them on
their heels and you were going to get it?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah. I mean, why play the game if you're not confident in
believing in your team regardless of the situation. I definitely think we made
that run. It's something we've been doing all year, like Amanda talked about,
come from behind. We knocked down some shots, and got a little momentum on our
side.  
You could tell that the momentum was on our side. They were a little bit
unsure. But we gave up a couple layups that kind of secured the win for them.  
  
Q. Amanda, one of three seniors on this Oklahoma club, talk about all you've
overcome this year, your experience at Oklahoma.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We've overcome a lot. I mean, we've been -- over time we've
lost players. We've done it all. We've brought it together. And Abi, she
didn't play for three years and had the best year of her life. Nyeshia, a year
ago wouldn't have took the shots that she took this year. She knocked down
some big ones here to bring us to the Final Four.  
We all just fought, man. I'm just proud of everybody. And where we've come,
nobody can take that away from us.  
  
Q. Danielle, everybody talked about the size-versus-speed matchup. Obviously
their size played a role. Do you think you failed to take advantage of your
speed advantage, and, if so, how did Stanford negate that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think we did in the first half, just because we're so
stagnant. They were scoring. So we had to take the ball out and not let -- off
of misses it's easier to get a quicker outlet. So I definitely think that
affected us a little bit.  
  
Q. For either one of you, the baseball pass, you talked about giving up a
couple layups, the one to Nneka seemed to be the one that kind of maybe was
the last one. Did she get away? What happened on that play?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, she screened Danielle's player and went backwards, and
that kind of played it forward so that whoever she was defending wouldn't get
the ball. And we just had a mishap and she got a wide-open layup. So, I mean,
it was either one of us. Can't really blame. She got the layup. Game over.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sherri, you opened by saying you didn't have an answer for Nneka. Is
there an answer for Nneka?  
COACH COALE: Well, someone closer to her size would help. She's just very
explosive and bouncy and does a great job of getting fouled, obviously, and
then converting free throws.  
She's just a tough matchup for a lot of people.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what coaching adjustments that you made late in the
game from the time that you were down by 17 to pulling back within two?  
COACH COALE: I don't really know that there were a lot of coaching adjustments
that had anything to do with that. Players made plays. We were doing what we'd
been trying to do the entire second half. And Danielle starts making jumpers
and everybody relaxes a little bit and gets lost in the game and quits
worrying so much about the score and just plays the possession that they're
in.  
And we did what we've done, what got us here. That's the tough part about it,
is if you go down, you want to go down playing your best. And the first half
wasn't anything like what we've shown in the last three weeks of the season.  
And what you saw in the final, you know, eight to ten minutes of the game was
a lot more like it.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. First of all, seemed like you were doing a
lot of switching defensive zone, man, half-court stuff to try to take them
out. And for the most part, other than Nneka, you seemed to do a pretty good
job with that. But also when the team starts off shooting like it did, is
there anything you can do as a coach, just have to kind of hope it ends?  
COACH COALE: You know, I really think -- we didn't guard them nearly as well
as we wanted to. There were several times we were chunking it up a little bit
to try to negate the size advantage in the paint, and three people would
remember what to do and one or two wouldn't.  
And they caught us a few times on some cover-downs in the first half. I felt
like the first maybe four defensive possessions of the game we really guarded
them. We did some good stuff. We made them uncomfortable, and we went down and
missed shots.  
We took bad shots. One passed and shot and nobody to rebound. Danielle was
exactly right: our poor offense began then to affect our defense. And in our
mind you're worried about the play that happened before, and you just can't do
that, especially not at this juncture of the season, especially against a team
as talented as Stanford.  
  
Q. What did you tell them at halftime when you're down 13 and shooting 25
percent? What did you tell the team?  
COACH COALE: We talked a lot about how we have to all be on the same page when
we change defenses; that everybody's got to communicate; that offensively
they're giving us jump shots and they're not guarding Jas. So, Jas, go ball
screen, and then who is going to help if they're not guarding you.  
Talked about D-Rob getting to the rim and taking and making the 10-foot jump
shot, and continuing to go at their post players, trying to get them in some
kind of foul trouble which we obviously were never able to do.  
Ended up by telling them that we were ahead by 12 last year to Louisville and
they got to play on Tuesday, so let's go do it.  
  
Q. Coach, was there a case of nerves in the beginning? Because the shots
were not even close for the most part.  
COACH COALE: I don't know. How do you ever know? I mean, they don't know. I
don't know. They definitely wanted to win, and we've been sagged on all year
long. That's not anything new. It wasn't some big shocker.  
We just made some bad decisions and found ourselves in a hole.  
  
Q. Sherri, you talk about the legacy of these seniors.  
COACH COALE: They will forever be the class that took us to back-to-back Final
Fours. And it's such a hard thing to do. If my number is right, I've heard
that there are only six schools to do that. That's a pretty special thing.  
And Stacey Dales and LaNeisha Caufield and Caton Hill will forever be the
class that took us to our first Final Four, and these guys will be the first
ever to take us back-to-back.  
But I think even more than that these seniors have restored everything that is
Oklahoma basketball. And I don't know if restore is the right word, but they
have grown and they've figured out over the course of their four years what it
means to play hard all the time, what it means to sell out and be a great
teammate, what it means to commit to the process of getting better.  
They figured that out over their career. And that's what we're trying to do.
And we're sad about this and we hate the fact that we're not going to play for
the national championship on Tuesday. But I'll tell you what, we've done some
special things. This class has much to be proud of.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about this third experience at a Final Four and as you look
ahead for this Sooner team and a top 10 recruiting class coming up for next
year.  
COACH COALE: Again, just very, very proud of these seniors and what they've
done and what this group accomplished amidst the adversity that we faced.  
The thing that it does is it removes a ceiling. It's kind of like the first
guy that runs a mile in four minutes and then all of a sudden everybody's
doing it. And for the kids within our program, these guys that will return
next year, this is what we do.  
I mean, Whitney Hand and Jasmine Hartman, this is all they know. You work and
you go to the Final Four. There's something that's contagious about that. And
they will quickly teach those five incoming freshmen what it means to work and
commit at Oklahoma, and we'll do our best to get back here on a regular basis.  
  
Q. Talking about Stanford's sagging defense, they certainly didn't sag off
Nyeshia. Could you talk about what they did to keep her shots limited?  
COACH COALE: They just followed her around. But you see Nyeshia got to the
free throw line 11 times. So she took advantage of that.  
We didn't shoot it quite as well from there as we would like. But they were
sagging off Jas, which people have done all year, and they were really backed
up under D and going under, and when they're committing to one guy like that,
the other guys have to make plays.  
We did a good job of trying to screen and get her open and got her the
basketball some. But she did a good job, too, as they followed her off of all
those, of putting it on the floor and trying to get to the rim.  
  
Q. You've coached some great players. You've coached against some great
players. What makes Nneka so special?  
COACH COALE: Her size and her explosiveness. I think she's just so bouncy.
She's really hard to keep off the glass. She's a fantastic rebounder, and a
great competitor. She plays hard all the time.  
  
Q. Did you have any sense of Jayne's health in terms of the ankle? What did
you see as far as how mobile Jayne was tonight?  
COACH COALE: She's not as mobile as she was earlier in the year, obviously.
But, you know, she's a competitor, too. And I saw her catching it on the block
and going really strong to the rim a number of times. I think it affects her a
little bit more in transition than it does in the half court.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2010

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Tina Charles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19732)

### [Maya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19726)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  70  
Baylor - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Pleased to welcome up here to the podium Connecticut head
coach Geno Auriemma, as well as student-athletes Tina Charles and Maya Moore.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Going into the game you're always trying to conjure up all
these different scenarios that may or may not come up that you're going to
have to deal with.  
And the one scenario that I didn't conjure up was our two starting guards
going 1 for 14. I didn't plan on that.  
And in spite of that, these two players up here were just absolutely amazing,
because they had to do it all by themselves pretty much. And I can't say
enough about them and especially in the second half what they did, when Baylor
cut it to whatever they cut it to. I forget what it was.  
  
Q. Three.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Closer than I thought. So we had a chance to respond, and we
haven't had a chance to do that very often this year. And I'm glad that
everybody got a chance to see that, what these players are capable of doing
when they're pushed, when they're asked.  
I'm really proud of them. Not an easy team to play against, for sure. But I'm
really, really proud of these two, and I'm proud of the whole team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, just talk about the lead that you and Tina took tonight in carrying
this team to the win?  
MAYA MOORE: I don't think it's anything different than what we always try to
do. We always come out every game trying to be aggressive. And you don't
really have to convince us to come out and be aggressive.  
And I felt I had a mismatch most of the game. I was just trying to be
aggressive. And once I listened to my teammates and set up my screens and used
them, we got even more opened up. And Tina just does a great job of coming in,
a confident leader who is going to attack anybody that she's matched up with.  
She made some big buckets for us. Gave us a lot of momentum and blocked some
shots and came through for us on the boards.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk about what was going on when they cut the lead to 3
and what happened after that when you guys were able to push out again?  
TINA CHARLES: I think the reason why we responded so well was because Coach
puts us in situations like that during practice. When we go to practice, even
though we have this streak going on and we're winning games, he still puts us
in game situations that could happen. And that happened tonight, and we all
just came together and we're like we're not going to lose. We want to go on to
Tuesday.  
And we just knew what was at stake. So because we always come out against our
practice players, we play hard and we're able to get the lead back. We knew we
could do it.  
  
Q. Maya or Tina, the first basket of the game was by Tiffany driving right
in on Griner. Was that by design? Did you want to set the tone right off the
bat, or is that just how the offense flowed?  
MAYA MOORE: That's just how the offense flowed. That got us all excited. It
shows the fearlessness of our team, of our underclassmen, and why we feel
confident in our underclassmen despite a poor shooting night. We know they're
going to bounce back with that same fearless mindset. I think it sparked,
really, the beginning of the game for us.  
  
Q. Maya, in the first game tonight you had a pretty phenomenal performance
by Nneka Ogwumike and then you came out and put on a show. Can you kind of
talk about you're going to have that matchup, you guys against Stanford again.
You're very familiar with them. Could you talk about that matchup and also
your thoughts on what Nneka did tonight?  
MAYA MOORE: She's an outstanding player. She works extremely hard. She has, I
think, developed faster than any sophomore in the country. And she has a lot
of confidence right now. She can do a lot. She uses her body well. And it's
going to be a tough battle.  
I absolutely have to come in on my assignments and just working hard. It's
going to be a battle. It's really not much more to be said about that. She's
going to come with it, and she knows what's at stake as well.  
  
Q. With Caroline and Tiffany in foul trouble tonight, you got 27 minutes out
of Kelly. Just talk about what she did for you guys tonight.  
TINA CHARLES: That's Kelly. When you look at the stat sheet, you don't see the
things she does. It really doesn't appear up there. But her giving us the
energy, the six assists, the rebounds, the four rebounds she gave us, she's
the boost off the bench, her and Lorin Dixon, especially.  
  
Q. Tina, you faced off against some of the best post players in the country,
certainly the NCAA, but also with U.S.A. Basketball. You could even say in the
world. Could you describe what it was like to match up with Brittney Griner
and just how you would evaluate her game?  
TINA CHARLES: It was definitely a battle, just physically. Just trying to push
her off the paint. Coach was definitely getting on me about the seven layups I
gave up and not forcing her to go to the middle. That's where my help was.
She's definitely going to be a great player coming out of college. You
definitely can see she wants to work hard. When her team comes around her and
tells her we need to post deeper, she responded and she'll try to get me
deeper in the lane.  
But she's going to be a great player.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk about Brittney's position and where you see her in
three years and how fast or quick she can develop into a superstar?  
TINA CHARLES: I think that's her decision just mentally what she wants to do
and how much of an impact she wants to have on -- with Baylor and just in the
country.  
Her development, I think, could be like how mine was, just being mental. I
don't think it's anything physical. Just how hard you want to be pushed and
how hard you want to be motivated and just what you want to do for yourself
personally.  
  
Q. Maya, when it was 41-38 after the timeout, what was your mindset at that
moment? What was going through your mind?  
MAYA MOORE: Just keep attacking. Keep playing. Staying confident with
everything that we've done the entire year. It's important for each individual
to really have good body language at that point.  
And I looked up as I was inbounding the ball at my four other teammates on the
floor, and all I saw was positive body language and just attitude in their
eyes. And I saw that and I said: Let's go. We picked it up, got a steal right
off the bat, and we never looked back.  
  
Q. Maya and Tina, is the next one the matchup that you guys wanted in your
hearts of hearts, No. 1 versus No. 2, now this will be the third consecutive
Final Four in which you'll run into Stanford?  
TINA CHARLES: The matchup doesn't matter to us. Whoever is going to be in the
way, that's who we're going to have to go up against. It's nothing personal or
anything like that. Whoever it was, we're just going to face a challenge and
go up against them and play hard and leave everything out on the court.  
MAYA MOORE: I agree. I personally just want to play the best. I want to be
challenged. I want to compete. And Stanford has proven themselves to be that
team.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma has talked about the diversity of your offense, how you
have worked so hard on that in your time. Can you talk about -- because
tonight I think that was a perfect example of you scored from all over in
every kind of different way. Could you talk about how much work you've put
into that?  
MAYA MOORE: Probably the biggest and hardest area for me this year has been in
the post. Coming out of high school you don't really have to have post moves
if you're taller and more athletic than everybody you face.  
And coming in as a freshman I absolutely worked -- even junior team in high
school I worked on my outside shot, my 3s. I just didn't get to do it a lot in
high school. So coming here, my 3-point shot I've been trying to keep
consistent.  
But he constantly challenges me. It's more of a mental thing, just to find
different ways to score. Don't settle for the outside jumper. Post up. When I
have mismatches, I'm looking more to post up. And Tina gave me a great pass in
the first half. And that's fun, when you can mix it up and score different
ways. That's what makes basketball fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Are you comfortable when the score gets uncomfortable, with your team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I really enjoyed coaching the game tonight. I
thought it was a lot of fun. We've played a lot of basketball this year. And,
you know, there haven't been a lot of opportunities where we've been
challenged and we've been pushed to that extent that we were tonight.  
And I kind of enjoy that. I do. I enjoy that. I get a kick out of it. Just
like Maya said, we like the challenge. We like the competitiveness of the
game. Makes you feel like you really accomplished something at the end of the
night. That's how we feel tonight. Like we really earned that win. We really
accomplished something.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think about the one-on-one battles between Tina
Charles and Brittney Griner tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I thought it went -- it went about the way I thought it would
go. Brittney was going to get X number of points and there's nothing you can
do about it. She's going to block some shots and there's nothing you can do
about it.  
I also knew Tina was going to get hers. Tina's a senior. She's been around a
little bit. She knows what she needs to do. And I think that might be the best
player Brittney's ever played against in her short college career. So I would
expect Tina to come out on top in that matchup, her being a senior.  
But as you saw during the course of the game, when Brittney Griner decides
she's going to score, there's not much anybody can do about it, including Tina
Charles.  
So that matchup went the way I thought it would go. And I also didn't think
they would have a good matchup for Maya Moore.  
  
Q. You said when Brittney decides she wants to score there's not much people
can do about it. Seems like that's kind of true for Maya too, especially with
the versatility. I guess if you could expand on some of the things she said
about how hard she has worked on being so versatile?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When Maya Moore was a freshman, she just caught it and shot
it. And she shot 3s and ran around the court, and that was the extent of the
game for her. And what we've been trying to work on with Maya is what happens
when those 3s don't show themselves and we can't get them, what are you going
to do?  
And I think she has put a lot of time in reading defenses and made a couple of
great cuts today and read a couple of great screens.  
And our kids are always quick to acknowledge her. We ran a couple of things
specifically for her after they got it to four or five or three whatever it
was. She made a couple of big buckets and the kids on the bench were yelling:
Great read, Maya. As soon as they saw Maya pop open they were commenting on
what a great read she made. I don't know that she would have been able to do
that a couple of years ago.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what it is being one step away from
your ultimate goal for the year of the national championship and winning two
consecutive undefeated seasons?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I just thought of that when you said it. Because I was
thinking today about wanting to play Tuesday night. I really want us to play
well against Baylor. I want us to win because I really want to play Tuesday
night.  
But until you just mentioned it, it didn't dawn on me that there was anything
else at stake other than winning the national championship. So you know the
feeling right now that I have and the team has is exactly the same feeling we
had last year after we won our semifinal game.  
This is what we came here to do. And the fact that we're playing a really,
really good team I think makes it even better. We're playing a team again for
the second time like we played Louisville last year for the third time. So
there's a lot of familiar feelings that are going to be going through us these
next 48 hours.  
But I did mention to the team at one point that if Louisville had cut it to 3
last year in the semifinal game, I wonder how we would have reacted knowing we
had lost the year before in the semifinal game. That's why when they cut it to
3 this year, they had been there before. They knew what to expect. They knew
what to do. And they did it.  
So going into Tuesday night there's a sense of confidence. They know what they
have to do. They know they can do it. They've done it before. And that's the
best you can hope for right now and then play the game.  
  
Q. Stanford didn't get to the final quite the same way you guys did. They
had two close games and lost two games, obviously. Does that matter come
Tuesday night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think so. I don't think so. No. Their game against
Xavier was something else, though. It's funny, Tara would be the first one to
tell you they're really, really fortunate to be here. But once you get here,
then you still have to take advantage of it.  
So they caught a break when that poor kid missed those two layups. But they
didn't have any aftereffects of that because they came here and they beat a
good Oklahoma team.  
Sometimes when you get a second life as a team, you tend to make the most of
it if you're a really good team. And I think they're a really good team.  
I don't think it hurts them or helps them Tuesday night, what's happened. And
I don't think it hurts or helps us what's happened, you know? I hope they're
as tired as we are tonight. I know my guys are tired.  
  
Q. Is this what you had in mind when you recruited Kelly?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Kelly Faris? Oh, yeah. She's great, isn't she? I told her at
one point late in the game, I said: That's really cool you could come here as
a freshman and play in your first Final Four and the semifinals and played as
well as you played. Get six assists and four rebounds and play great defense.  
She impacted the game tremendously without scoring. That's what I saw her
doing in high school all the time. The kid has never lost in the postseason.
High school or college now. She won four state championships and she's still
winning.  
It's something about that kid that's pretty special. And I'm just glad she
didn't go to Butler like all those other guys (laughter). I'm glad we got her.  
  
Q. First of all, tonight, were they doing anything that actually frustrated
your 3-point shooters or was it just the basketball gods? The second half of
that is looking ahead to Tuesday night, what do you feel you have to do to
defend the title, and is there anything you think that Stanford could do to
upset that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I have been saying all along that it's not preordained,
you know, that you still have to come out here and make shots. That's the key
to -- it's called basketball, as somebody told me one time. You've got to put
the ball in the basket, damn it.  
And what happens is we had a couple of games during this tournament where we
made 11 of them. I mean, everything we put up went in. And then you show up
tonight and, just like I thought, it's not easy to shoot the ball in these
environments.  
One, it's not easy to shoot the ball in the Final Four, because this isn't a
game in January in the middle of nowhere. You're playing in front of 25,000
people. You know every shot means more than it did two weeks ago or three
weeks ago or a month ago.  
So it's not easy to make shots as it is. Now you put them in a big dome. We
have absolutely nothing to look at that reminds you of anything back home or
on the road, and it's just hard to make shots in the Final Four.  
And, you know, we've got two young kids that didn't make shots. This is
Caroline's first Final Four. And she's very emotional kid and tried too hard,
probably. And Tiffany, Tiffany is -- she's only good when she's falling down.
And so if I can get her to shoot 3s while falling down, she'll make a couple
of them. She will. She only gets to the line and scores when she's falling
down or getting hit. So maybe somebody should punch her while she's shooting a
3, then she's got a chance.  
But shooting is shooting. We could come out Tuesday night and make 15 3s, but
if we shoot the way we shot tonight we'll be in trouble on Tuesday night,
because Stanford's a little bit different offensively than Baylor. They just
have a lot of offense.  
I don't know what they shot tonight. I didn't see the stat sheet on their
game, but they're a hard team to defend. They may be the hardest team to play
against in America. For us, anyway, because of all the offensive players they
have.  
  
Q. They shot 39 percent.  
COACH AURIEMMA: They shot 39 percent. Good, based on 2. What did we shoot? 41
percent. Good. Maybe the first team to 50 wins Tuesday. Why don't we do that?
I would like that. First team to 50 wins. Wait a minute. They went 1-for-15
from the 3-point line? See, they'll make 10 against us, I guarantee you. Mark
it down. They'll make 10. That's the way it works.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Stanford  73  
Oklahoma - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to welcome up to the podium Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer and student-athletes Jayne Appel, Kayla Pedersen and Nneka
Ogwumike.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I first want to compliment Oklahoma on a great season and
great job that Sherri Coale did with losing the Paris twins and Whitney Hand.
To be in this game I think it speaks really well to their team.  
And, you know, it was a battle and it was very physical. Obviously, I think,
Nneka had a great game, and Jayne and Kayla battled in there. It was very
physical. And I thought we did an excellent job really taking care of the
ball.  
But it was a little bit -- they made a great run. We stayed in there. But I
was hoping that we could just kind of keep that space, keep that 14-, 15-point
lead the whole way through.  
But I thought our team worked hard, and we're very excited to be playing
Tuesday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nneka, Sheryl Swoopes scored 47 points in the '93 championship game. And
other than her, you're now in second place in the Final Four among scorers.
Were you aware of that? Has anyone told you that yet? And what do you think
about being in that company?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I wasn't aware of it, actually. But it's great to be
considered one of the greatest. But I would have to say it's because of my
teammates. Without them, I wouldn't be getting passes. I wouldn't be getting
great screens from Kayla, passes from Jayne and all my guards.  
But it's great, but there's more left, so...  
  
Q. Nneka, did you have kolaches for breakfast?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: No.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that last play, the long pass that sealed the
deal?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: You know, it's one of several time-and-score situation
plays that we go over in practice. And we ran it. I admitted to Coach and
Kayla that I didn't think I would actually be open.  
But Kayla asked Tara if she's open should I throw it, and I was open. And I
thought it was an awesome play to run. It was definitely spur of the moment. A
great coaching decision. We executed it right and it worked.  
  
Q. Kayla and Jayne, from your vantage point, what does a 38-point night look
like from your angle?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Awesome.  
JAYNE APPEL: Do it every single time.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: We're so proud of her. She really hung with it, especially in
the first half. If we can get that out of her every game, we'll be happy with
that. She was a monster down low and really helped us today.  
JAYNE APPEL: I don't know if I can really add much to that. I think this is
Nneka every game. Hopefully we can get it on Tuesday.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Might I say, though, I learned from the best, because I
know no one forgets Jayne's 46-point game last year. So I think I learned from
the best and they helped me out.  
  
Q. For any of you that would like to answer, maybe two, but did last Monday
night's game, the way it was so tight, did that help when it got tight
tonight? Did that help keep the composure and breaking the press and then
sealing it?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, no one really wants close games. But it's different
-- it's different from preparing in practice for it and actually being in the
game and it happening. Because time is on the line. And everything is at
stake.  
And so I think Monday definitely gave us that experience. Disregarding Monday,
though, when games do get close, I think our team does an excellent job of
staying composed and poised. And so we did a really good job of that tonight.
And we just listened to the coaches.  
And we had confidence in ourselves which caused us to extend the lead when the
time expired.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, Jayne just pointed out to me that we were winning the
entire time, and I think that really helped. I mean, just knowing, guys, calm
down, we're still up, we're still winning the game, it's all going to be okay.  
So Jayne, like, saying that to us, she really helped us keep composure, and of
course I think the Xavier game did help.  
  
Q. I'm sorry, during the timeout Jayne --  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Jayne was always, Come on guys, like, You got it, you got it.
We're fine. Just calming everyone down and making sure that we're all on the
same page.  
  
Q. Nneka, how many family members? What kind of an entourage did you have
here? And did you ever imagine -- I know you have something left to do here,
your job is not done, but did you ever imagine that your Texas homecoming
would turn out like this?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Oh, absolutely. They never fail to mystify me. They're
really good at supporting me. I always get texts. Even when I'm in California,
I get texts, calls, e-mails. My high school coaches, my high school teachers,
all of my immediate family is here. And I'm really glad that Chiney also got
to sit down there with them. And the support is wonderful.  
And I'm not surprised at all how many people were there.  
  
Q. Were you surprised you had this kind of a game?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Oh, I mean --  
  
Q. For a Texas homecoming.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I just went out and played. I did whatever my team needed
me to do. Everyone was giving me advice. I always tell: All of my teammates on
the bench, they're always in my ear. They're always telling me good things to
do. And my coaches are always giving me advice and helping me throughout the
game.  
And on the court I feel so comfortable with my teammates, and that I think
helps in being successful in any way possible when we play.  
  
Q. You were winning the game the whole game. But they won the second half.
And I'd just like you to talk about what changes they made, what specifically
they did that brought them back so close into the picture, that close to the
game, and how did you respond to that?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think they hit some outside shots that weren't falling for them
in the first half. And they got some big rebounds on us. There was a series of
a couple of plays where I think that we kind of, you know -- didn't box out.
And I think they got some big boards on us.  
I think those three rebounds were big ones for us and was kind of the
difference in the second half.  
  
Q. Nneka, can you remember a bigger game you've had on this big a stage?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: For myself?  
  
Q. Yes.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, a lot of people come up to me about the Oregon game
at Oregon. But, I mean, I honestly don't -- it's always good to reminisce.
It's not really something I focus on.  
I think about what was the result of the game. And we were in the locker room
after the game, we were just getting pumped up and excited because we won.  
I mean, there will always be individual performances, but I think it's all
about the team.  
  
Q. When you went down near the end of the game, what happened there?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Jeanette made an awesome pass to me, and I think McFarland
-- is that her name? Yeah, McFarland, No. 53, was boxing me out before I came
down.  
And I honestly didn't know what was going on, but I kind of landed awkwardly.  
  
Q. What part of your body?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Just upon impact, pretty much my whole body. But I shook it
off and came back in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, when Sherri opened her comments she said they didn't have an answer
for Nneka and I asked her is there an answer for Nneka. I would ask you the
same thing: Is there an answer for Nneka?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought Nneka played really well. And she really got the
job done on the block for us. I think that she stepped up where maybe some --
like some shots for Jayne didn't go for her, some shots for other people on
the perimeter didn't go.  
But she battled, and what I was really excited about, this is a very physical
game and Nneka got in there and kind of stood her ground in a physical game. I
think it shows how much she's improved and how competitive she is.  
  
Q. Assuming, Coach, that Connecticut advances out of its semifinal tonight,
what will your team bring into that game that wasn't there when you met in
December, that wasn't there last year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think our team will bring confidence, knowing that we've
improved a lot, and I think our team will be excited; if that in fact is who
we play, they'll be excited about it.  
We know we need to play better and shoot the ball better, but I think tonight
against some very athletic and aggressive team we took care of the ball well.
We got the ball to a hot player on the court.  
We had some people missing some shots that really need to go for us in a
routine. But I think our team will be really excited and will want to have a
great game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what got Oklahoma back in the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think Jayne hit it. They had some shooters that knocked
down a 3. Amanda Thompson made two of them, I think, in the second half. How
many 3s did they make in the second half? They had four. Were all four in the
second half? I mean, they hit some shots.  
Roethlisberger hit one. And Thompson hit two. And then we were really working
inside, and Hartman hit one.  
But their 3-point shooting was about as bad as ours. Theirs was a little
better.  
  
Q. You said that you've seen Nneka mature in the way she handled herself in
this physical game. One of her high school teachers or coaches described her
as the kind of kid who would ask for permission before forgiveness, whereas
other kids would do it the other way. Is that a part of her that you think has
matured?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She's always been mature in that way. Her game has matured.
She's doing things less, I don't want to say mechanically, but she's
confident. She's in the flow. She knows what we're looking for. She's playing
with a lot of confidence.  
And like last year everything was new for her. She had to learn a whole new
set of plays and it took a while. But I think she finished really strong. She
played very well in the tournament. And then this year she came in after her
U.S.A. Basketball experience, her confidence being named Pac-10 player of the
year, being named All-American. She showed why she's All-American. And I
thought she had a great game.  
  
Q. Was a point of emphasis going into the game to take advantage of your
size and try to push them inside and did you kind of go to that more and more
as the game wore on? Did you try to exploit that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think there were a lot of things we wanted to do. First of
all, we worked as hard as we could to keep Danielle Robinson in front of us.
She's a great player. Local kid. I've known her since she was a little girl.
And she's a terrific athlete. And just a great player and congratulations to
Danielle for such an outstanding year.  
Stevenson is an excellent 3-point shooter. And Ros Gold-Onwude worked her tail
off to make sure she didn't get 3s.  
We were looking to help in off of their three players, and they brought in
some kids that hit some shots, doubling in. I think that they were more
physical than maybe I thought. I thought we had some times where we're going
in and going inside and they really bodied them a lot, but we ran on them.  
We got out and we ran, and I think it tired out especially their bigs, and a
real credit to Jayne who has not been conditioning on the court. She really
ran the floor really well. Made some great plays for us. Missed a couple
layups but was running really hard for us and was, I thought, a great
competitor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the baseball pass to Nneka at the end of the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I called that play (laughter).  
  
Q. That wasn't Amy?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That was me. I don't know. I just felt like we had the speed
advantage. And Kayla wouldn't throw unless she was wide open. And Nneka wasn't
going to shoot it unless she was wide open.  
You know, they were on a run and they were feeling some enthusiasm and some
momentum. So I think that kind of slammed the door.  
The other one Nneka had is the overhead pass to Jayne, was how did she get so
wide open? I have no idea. But you're not going to -- a team like Oklahoma got
down and to their credit they came back. But we've seen that from them all
year long. They've been battlers all year long.  
  
Q. My second question, without sounding like the wet blanket, your guards
were 4 for 18. Can you beat Connecticut with guards that shoot 4 for 18?  
COACH VANDERVEER: 4 for 18. That doesn't sound too good. I think I have
confidence in our guards. I have confidence in how Ros is playing and
Jeanette, and I think if we're playing Connecticut or Baylor, whoever it will
be, we're playing for a national championship. And these kids will -- I think
they'll really come out and play and relax and just knock them down.  
I have confidence -- I thought JJ took a good shot. Kayla is taking good
shots. Our team was taking good shots. We weren't taking bad shots. Joslyn is
a great shooter for us.  
Some of it is maybe just getting used to playing in this dome. Maybe -- they
didn't shoot that well either. I don't know how these guys are shooting out
here. But I have confidence in our perimeter shooting, and I'm excited to be
playing.  
I'm absolutely thrilled for this team to come this far. And I know that if we
get those looks, they will knock them down.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about just going through emotionally wrenching games
as you have?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, this is what makes the struggle, that makes it
fun. Honestly, I don't know. I mean, it makes it challenging. And it brings us
together. This is a team that has had to -- we've had to rally a little bit in
situations. And I really feel that our preseason schedule, our run right
through the Pac-10 has people very confident, has people very close. This is a
team that whatever happens on Tuesday night is all good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce up here at the podium Baylor head
coach Kim Mulkey and student-athletes Kelli Griffin, Melissa Jones, and
Morghan Medlock.  
COACH MULKEY: I don't usually have an opening statement, but I will today.
We're thrilled to be playing in the Final Four. We're especially thrilled it's
being held in our home state of Texas. And, again, I want to encourage any fan
in the area that's not bought a ticket to please do so.  
  
Q. M.J., you talked this week about the next 40 minutes, that's what you've
got to focus on. But as far as UConn and their team, obviously they don't have
many weaknesses. Is there one area that you guys know you have to focus on,
like just is it turnovers? What is it?  
MELISSA JONES: We have a very good basketball team obviously being No. 1 in
the nation. And there isn't a weakness on their team. Every single player is a
threat. The thing that Baylor needs to focus on is just making smart decisions
and not turning the ball over and falling into UConn's -- their game.  
  
Q. I don't know how to ask this except to ask it. How did the punch change
your team? Make you closer? Cause you to circle the wagons? Just talk about
how it changed your team.  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I don't know if it had much of a change. It was an incident
that happened that shouldn't have. We definitely tried to be there for
Brittney and just try to keep her head up, be there if she needed to talk
about it.  
But I don't really think it had a significant change to the team.  
MELISSA JONES: I think that it's helped all of us kind of grow from it,
especially Brittney. I think everyone in our lives at some point let our
emotions just get the best of us. It was just extremely out of character for
that to happen.  
However, when things get heated in a game, like now, she's the first one to
step up and say, hey, guys, let's calm it down, let's keep it cool and let's
just be Baylor. She's grown so much from it and it's progressed throughout the
rest of the team for us to do the same.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: It's definitely something we don't even talk about anymore.
We're just here to get two wins and bring home the trophy.  
  
Q. Kelli, can you talk about -- Kim said this is a Final Four in the state
of Texas. Your home state. Talk about the excitement of playing in this
state.  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I'm definitely excited. My family gets to come. They don't get
to come see me a lot. My mom does, but it's nice to have -- to be able to have
your family to come out and support when they don't get a chance to all the
time. And it's definitely nice to have all of our fans in driving distance to
San Antonio to be able to come out and support. And it's just a good feeling
to be back home.  
  
Q. How difficult was it for you to miss most of the Big 12 season, have to
sit there and watch? And I know it was Coach's plan to try to get you healthy
for this time and it's worked out very nicely. But what was it like? And
particularly what did you try to do to help the freshman that were out there
in your place to get better?  
MELISSA JONES: I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. My
injury, obviously it's something that's very frustrating to deal with, knowing
that the game you love you're not able to play.  
However, I felt like being on the sidelines helped put a different perspective
on how I saw things, and it was able to get a lot of the freshmen and younger
classmen to get some quality minutes. And they've grown so much ever since
that. And putting me on the sideline kind of helped me see things that I
haven't seen playing on the court before.  
And so, for me, to just kind of help my teammates out and telling them what I
saw just I think helped the team.  
  
Q. Morghan, what were some of your expectations for this year? And do you
feel like you've met them?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Well, actually we have a notebook that we get at the start of
every season in this program. And it actually says on the cover: Excuses are
expectations. So once we got that, one of my expectations, especially being a
senior, was to get to the Final Four. And I had that expectation last year.
And I knew it would happen coming into this program. I just didn't know when.
And I'm really glad it happened this year.  
  
Q. What are your feelings on playing UConn? Nervous or excited?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I think I'm more excited than nervous. It takes a lot to get me
nervous. And I'm excited to be in the Final Four no matter who is playing. But
it's definitely exciting to be able to play the No. 1 team in the country.  
MELISSA JONES: I think that this is something that you grow up wanting to do.
Ever since you were a little girl you want to play the best team. And
thankfully we've been blessed and in a position to do so.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I'm really excited to have a chance to be able to knock them
off, stop the winning streak that everyone's talking about. And I'm just
excited just to be in the Final Four in general.  
  
Q. Can you all talk about how Brittney's presence shapes and changes your
defense?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: It definitely has a huge impact on our defensive end. Some of
us use Brittney as an excuse when we get beat off the dribble, to have her
inside to block shots. But, I mean, like M.J. always says, we're just happy
she's on our side and not anyone else's.  
MELISSA JONES: I think when somebody talks about Baylor defense, the first
thing that comes out their mouth is Brittney Griner. And I think that's a very
solid statement in the fact that if she's not blocking a shot she's altering
it or she's altering a play that's set for an opposing team just because of
her big presence in the middle.  
So she helps out a lot.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: And to add to all that, I think it allows our perimeter
defense to extend out and pressure because they know we have a 6'8" kid who's
going to help you, like Kelli said, if we do get beat. It just allows us to
have more confidence and just to pressure opponents.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the UConn winning streak and how -- I mean, the
Oklahoma coach was making jokes about this being the UConn Invitational. What
do you guys talk about when you talk about UConn and how do you get yourself
in the right frame of mind?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: Well, we don't really talk about that win streak much. I think
it might have been mentioned in our locker room probably once, and I think
that was yesterday. We don't really look at that. We are just looking at the
next 40 minutes. We know that UConn is a great team and it's going to be tough
to beat them. But we don't really mention their win streak much.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago Brittney was known as the big girl who threw the punch.
And the last couple of weeks Brittney is known as the great basketball player
who just totally has dominated the game with 35 blocks, 14 in one game. Do you
think that in any way that she was inspired after her suspension to show what
she's all about, rather than any perceived notions some people may have had
because of the incident?  
MELISSA JONES: I think that Brittney Griner should be known as the great
player who has been dominating the NCAA tournament, and I feel like she's the
girl who is going to change the game altogether.  
And I think it's not really talked about -- her punch was extremely talked
about because it was so out of character. I think that's why it was blown up,
because it's not something, if you know Brittney Griner, that it would ever
even happen. So that shouldn't really be what is talked about her, because of
what she does for this game, what she does for women's basketball and not just
Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma was here just a little while ago. He said one of the
strengths of their team is if they have a 38-point lead and there's a loose
ball and somebody doesn't fall on it or there's a missed defensive assignment,
that everybody gets pissed; that they have that attack mentality all the time.
Do you think you guys have a little bit of that and do you have to play with
that to beat UConn?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I actually think we have a lot of that. We go into every game
and every scouting report with the mindset to attack whoever the opponent is.
If you're better than us, not better than us, or just the same, we always
think attack first. And, I don't know, I guess being the No. 1 team in the
country they should have that mindset also. But we're Baylor and we think the
same way.  
  
Q. M.J., and I know the open practices aren't the most intense, but this is
a very loose team. Does some of that come from the freshmen or is it just
coming from everybody on the team how relaxed you are and how much fun you're
having here?  
MELISSA JONES: I think it comes from everybody in the entire program, from the
freshmen to the coaching staff. Some of us are serious and want to get down to
business. But we have those who want to help relax us, and I think everything
goes hand in hand and has been working so far in the tournament.  
  
Q. How do you deal with all the pressure in practices?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I don't feel much pressure in practice. We just focus. We try
to listen to scouting reports and listen to the coaches and stay on task. So,
you know, you do that and pretty much practice will flow pretty good.  
MELISSA JONES: I think head coach, Coach Mulkey, does a good job of being
really intense and keeping us on our toes. Like they were talking about
earlier, if we don't run off a loose ball or if we're not putting out extra
effort to get a rebound, that's when we get in trouble for it. So we're always
trying to work our best in practice and everything.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I think our practices are fine. They're not long and drawn
out. They're two hours, two and a half hours, depending on which part of the
season we're in, and we just get right after. We're intense. We get right to
the point. We get in there, shoot, take care of our business.  
As long as we do that we stay on task in practice, there's never any pressure
the next day when you come to practice or during the basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, what effect do you think the punch had on your team and the way you
played and the way you coached?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think it's had an effect, other than I had to make a
disciplinary decision and suspend her and do other things and reprimand and
things and requirements that she has to abide by.  
But as far as play on the floor, I don't think it made us -- well, maybe the
effect was we lost the last game to Texas at home. That had a definite effect,
on her presence on the floor. But if you're talking about circling the wagons
and playing better, we were playing good before the suspension, and we
continued to play good after the suspension. So I guess the one game that she
missed affected our team for sure.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Morghan Medlock a little bit, what you've seen in her
since she's come into your program to where she is today and some of the
expectations you've had for her?  
COACH MULKEY: Morghan Medlock transferred. Before I take any transfers, I have
a pretty tough one-on-one with them and basically try to run them off and get
answers. Because, remember this, they transfer for a reason.  
And after having a one-on-one session with her, I was convinced that she
needed Baylor more than Baylor needed her. And for things that had happened to
her off the floor, and obviously after her mother's murder, I thought that we
were the best thing in Morghan's life other than her own family to help
console her and help her heal. And I still think that today.  
On the floor, Morghan went through a period when Melissa Jones was injured,
and she basically was not playing very good basketball. And I know she felt
it. I know being the only senior and the only -- one of only three that got
lots of minutes the year before, she wanted to do well.  
And I thought, consequently, she tried to do too much. And slowly but surely,
with the help of the coaches, she figured out, let the game come to her. Don't
try to do too much. And we're a very, very good basketball team when Morghan
Medlock quietly gets you a double-double. And I think she's done that quite
often in the latter part of the season.  
  
Q. I take it having a team with some younger players has tested you along
the way and drilled you. Could you talk about the mix and how I guess some
days you've wanted to kill them and some days you wanted to --  
COACH MULKEY: You're right on with that. Duke game is a classic example. You
really felt at the three-minute mark how are we even going to pull this out,
and within seconds you're going to win the ball game.  
And I think that that's been the case all year, especially with Melissa
Jones's injury. The silver lining to her injury is that we're in a Final Four
and I'm not afraid of those freshmen anymore. They're still going to make
mistakes, but I'm not afraid to put them in the game. They've had enough
experience on the floor, and you just hang in there with them.  
You take the good with the bad. They will make you look so bad on the
defensive end of the floor sometimes, and they'll go do something on the
defensive end of the floor that's just spectacular. And you can sneak one or
two in the lineup, but when you play as many as we do on the floor at the same
time, it scares you sometimes.  
  
Q. I understand on the bus ride down you guys watched a certain movie. It
was Miracle I believe. Was that -- whose choice was that and if you had
anything to do with it, was there a particular message behind watching that
movie?  
COACH MULKEY: It was three hours. And, sure, there's a message behind it.
We're the underdogs. The hockey team beating the Russians was big. I'd love to
tell you that that's going to motivate us, and, man, we're going to go out and
beat UConn, but, to tell you the truth, I think half the girls fell asleep.  
Hockey in Texas is not something they can relate to (laughter). But I didn't
want to listen to some of those movies that I've had to listen to all year.
And I thought, this is my three-hour bus ride, so put it on. Some of them
watched it. But some of them, they couldn't tell you if it was on. They had
their headsets on and probably fell asleep.  
  
Q. I take it you stayed awake and watched it.  
COACH MULKEY: I did watch it. I sure did. Yep.  
  
Q. You knew that having Brittney and this young group was going to make you
good eventually. But could you talk about it happening to this -- being this
good this soon?  
COACH MULKEY: I knew we were very talented. I said all year long, this team is
going to be special. But I didn't know when it would happen. And to have the
expectation of being in a Final Four, I don't think, would have been fair to
them. They were conscious of where the Final Four was and where we're located
and it sure would be convenient.  
But you can't put that type of pressure on a team and on a player that's just
being introduced to the college game.  
  
Q. You talked about the other day playing that underdog role. Obviously it's
pretty easy for this one to play that underdog card. But how inside your team
do you sell them on or believing that they can do this?  
COACH MULKEY: Maybe it's just my personality, Leon's personality. You know,
this ain't our first rodeo. Leon has been to 14 of these; I've been to 13 of
these. Geno, how many has he been to? 11?  
So we've been here, but these kids haven't been here. And they're excited, and
they need to enjoy it. And they need to go out there and relax and have fun
and dunk and shoot. That's not where our work is done.  
Our work is done before we ever come here. Our work is done when we leave here
and we go to that film room tonight and we go to that next hour practice.  
I don't have to spend my time coaching them because they're fearful. What I
have to spend my time doing is coaching them because they're still freshmen
and I know the mistakes that they're going to make against an experienced team
tomorrow.  
And so you teach them the game, the Xs and Os and the strengths and
weaknesses. You don't have to talk about a win streak. You don't have to talk
about the No. 1 team in the country, because you're so focused on the Xs and
Os part of it, and helping them develop into a better basketball player, which
will make us a better basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how well your team was playing at the end of the
regular season and into the playoffs. What were the factors that turned a very
good basketball team into the team that has come this far in the playoffs?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it's Melissa Jones's injury without question. She was
told not to play or I was told she couldn't play two days prior to the Big 12
beginning at Oklahoma State being our first game.  
And we had to quickly, on the fly, start playing kids that we didn't want to
play a lot of minutes. And that was the freshmen. And we would win a game,
we'd lose a game. We'd lose a disappointing game, then we would win a game.  
And I just think that we put enough wins together that they became more
confident. And then we got M.J. back, and that piece of our puzzle, that glue
that was missing, was back. And we're better because of it.  
  
Q. M.J. said that UConn has no weaknesses. Obviously Coach Brock, the rest
of the coaches, you guys have been looking at film trying to find something to
attack or expose or whatever. I guess the question is: Is there a balance
between what you can attack and still being yourself, what got you here?  
COACH MULKEY: I think so. UConn -- we can't compete with them on the offensive
end. They score at all positions. They score anytime they want to, transition,
half court.  
That's really not what we do, because we're still young. And we'll take bad
shots. We'll take unadvised shots. We have to be smarter on the offensive end
of the floor than they do.  
I think both defenses will play extremely hard and try to take away our
strengths. We'll try to take away their strengths, but I think the offensive
end of the floor we may just have to be a little more creative.  
  
Q. Not that you would tell us, are you going to sell them on the Rocky
angle, on you can make history, you can shock the world, be on the evening
news, anything like that?  
COACH MULKEY: No. See, I don't have to. I don't have to. They're aware of the
streak. They watch TV and they read the newspaper. Of course, they know things
before I do through computers and all that stuff.  
But I'm going to be me. And whatever I do to motivate them in that locker room
prior to the game will just be something that I think of at the last minute.
It really won't be anything that I have to plan. This is the Final Four. And
if I have to motivate them and use some kind of eat a worm or something, then
-- we're not going to win anyway if I have to do that.  
I think they're just at the Final Four. They're loose. They're young. They're
excited. They're talented.  
And who knows what you're going to see. Who knows.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2010

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Danielle Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18925)

### [Amanda Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19485)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale, as
well as student-athletes Danielle Robinson and Amanda Thompson.  
COACH COALE: Obviously we're excited to be here. Love the city of San Antonio
and the way they host the Final Four. Nobody in America does it better than
this city. Our kids have enjoyed being here, and now we're ready to compete.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle and Amanda, in Oklahoma Sherri Coale's a rock star. Can you talk
about how -- has any of that gone beyond the state borders, any of your
travels with her, have you had any experiences that can speak to her celebrity
status nationally?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Everywhere we go, Coach Coale is known. You just hear
people, we'll be walking, Oh, it's Coach Coale from Oklahoma. I mean any
particular incident, I can't recall. But I know she's pretty well known around
the nation.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think she's pretty high status, I mean, even out here. We
walked the River a little bit and it was only a couple of us and someone was
like, Is Sherri Coale with you? I said, No, she's probably in the room
somewhere.  
But she's pretty high. She's pretty high. Celeb.  
  
Q. Danielle, there were a couple of items in the media guide I was intrigued
by. One of them, as you could probably guess, is you have a notation: Not my
team, Stanford. And that was probably done quite a while ago. And, secondly,
if I may, the other item is if you were not playing for Oklahoma, you'd
probably be playing for Cal. How close were you to going to play for Cal?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Cal had been recruiting me before Coach Boyle had got
there. And I just really enjoyed my visits up there. And early on, I guess you
could say, Cal was at the top just because something important to me was being
close to home so my family could watch me play. And Cal is pretty close in
distance.  
And so I definitely took that into consideration when I was making my
decision.  
  
Q. What about Stanford?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I grew up watching them, you know, for many, many years.
And then as I took more and more visits and, you know -- I respect the program
a lot. Tara VanDerveer is a great coach. She has great players. But I just
didn't feel it was the right fit for me.  
  
Q. For both Amanda and Danielle. You guys have played the toughest schedule
in the country. During the season you played three teams that wound up being
No. 1 seeds and now you're playing a No. 1 seed in Stanford. How is that
schedule playing particularly tough nonconference games, how does that help
you get to where you are now?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I feel like it's helped us a lot. We faced all different kind
of teams, all different kind of styles. We've come from behind. We've had
leads. It's just given us opportunity to experience different kind of play.  
And a long time in the tournament, you know, you need that because when you're
scouting somebody, you can say, okay, we can compare that to a team we played
and it helps us go along and helps our game plan.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like she talked about, we see a variety of teams throughout
the whole season, especially in nonconference. It prepares us well for the Big
12 conference, and that prepares us for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Danielle, could you talk about playing against Jeanette Pohlen in the CIF
final in, what was it, 2007, and what you remember about her as a player and
also what -- if you've watched her develop over the years at Stanford and
obviously she's made headlines in the last week?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: You know, we played our senior year in the state
championship. She wasn't the point guard then as she is for Stanford now.  
She's a great player. I think she led her team for the whole season. I think
they only had one loss coming into Long Beach, if I recall that correctly. So
she was a great player, great leader.  
I got the chance to play her this past summer, learned a lot about her. She's
a great person. We've actually become pretty close friends, and we keep in
contact, especially since she's close to home in Palo Alto.  
So excited for where she's at. I was excited when she hit that shot last week.
And ready to play her, I guess.  
  
Q. Amanda, just to pick up on what you were saying earlier, what do you
think accounts for why Sherri is so popular? Is it just victory, or is it her
style or personality? What do you think it is?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think it's just the way she carries herself every day. I
know she pays attention to more the little things. She's all about tradition
and just doing the right thing.  
And people see that. And they feel that and they just gained a lot of respect
for her. And I gained a lot of respect for her for doing that. And it just
makes everybody else follow in her footsteps, and she just makes great players
and she plays great games and she's not afraid to challenge us. That's why
she's so popular around.  
So she's just a great person.  
  
Q. I wonder, your program has been involved with some memorable games with
Stanford in the past. Does the rivalry you have with that school still
resonate with newer players who don't have any experience? And also how much
would it mean to end that losing streak you have against Stanford that
stretches to four now?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I'm not really familiar with a couple. I just know the one
that's the most recent. I mean, it's a great rivalry for women's basketball. I
don't know how big it is. But I guess I could say it's somewhat of a personal
thing for me being from California.  
But we're just going to execute our game plan against a great Stanford team.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, like she said, I'm not familiar, but I've heard about
the games in the past, and it was against Oklahoma and I feel like I'm a part
of that family so I think it's going to be a rivalry however long it goes on.  
That's how we'll play the game, as if we just lost to Sanford last year.  
  
Q. For both of you, give me your thumbnail analysis of Stanford and what you
all have to do to beat them?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: They have really tall posts down there, and they just execute
very well. So we definitely have to take away their cadence and disrupt what
they do and outwork them and just play hard.  
I think everybody's going to be good at this time of the year, so we just to
do what we do well, to stop what they do well.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We have to speed them up, use our athleticism to our
advantage. We definitely have to block out against them. They're extremely
good on the boards, especially Kayla Pedersen. We know that we have an
advantage with our athleticism.  
  
Q. For both players, a lot of teams, when they get to this point, look back
at a turning point in the season. Outside of the Whitney Hand injury, there
doesn't seem like there was. Was this just a building process and a maturity
that you guys reached to get to this point, or what's your feeling on that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think one of our turning points was the loss against
Texas at home. We knew that for us it was unacceptable, and we had to make
changes. And we went into that locker room and that's what we did. And from
here on out we've been playing that better.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think we've had several turning points throughout this
year. You know, those are definitely one of the key ones.  
But I think that great basketball, it has a lot of changing points. In order
to be a great team you have to go up and down and go through struggles, and
when you overcome them, that's when you get to points like this, times in the
Final Four. You don't really look back on them; you just build on it and learn
from them and keep going.  
  
Q. We're obviously here for the Connecticut Invitational, but the fact that
a lot of people are going to perceive the fact, well, it's going to be
Stanford and Connecticut in the championship game and Stanford gets the chance
to end the streak and all that. Do you get a little incentive from the fact
that maybe people are just saying, hey, it's nice Oklahoma and, to a lesser
extent, Baylor is here, but they're just kind of standing in the way of the
Stanford-Connecticut game? Does that give you guys any motivation if that's
the case?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, you know, people say what they say. I mean, they have
their opinions. But I think it just puts us in a great position to change
history. UConn is going to be UConn. Every other team is going to be
themselves. Everybody's competing for a championship.  
So we know what we expect of ourselves, so we're going to play our game and
not worry about what everybody else is saying. We're just creating a bubble
and staying within that and having fun while we're doing it.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like Amanda said, we know what we're capable of. We don't
need the support of anybody beyond our Oklahoma circle, because we've been the
underdog all season and people didn't expect us to be here right now, and
we're here.  
  
Q. Amanda and Danielle, how do you and your teammates get along on and off
the court?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Well, we're like sisters. We're like family. I can say this
is probably the closest team since I've been here. We just have so much fun.
And, I mean, we're pretty much together I feel 20 hours a day out of the 24
hours, regardless if you see somebody on campus, stop to talk to them, or at
the gym or go to their house. We're like family.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I would have to agree. We're pretty close. And a lot of teams
it's hard to have fun and be honest at the same time and take constructive
criticism and encourage at the same time.  
I think that this team, we can do that and also have fun. You kind of learn
from each other and just enjoy every moment. I think I've enjoyed every moment
with these guys all year. And I'm just thankful that I have them as teammates.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about how last year's experience at the Final Four you
think will help you this time around?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, I feel like we got satisfied last year with just
getting here, and this year we kind of learned from that and know that we're
going to enjoy San Antonio, but we're here to do a job and we're here to get
to the next game. And hopefully we get that championship. And just never
taking our eyes off of it and just kind of live every game and play every game
like you're not going to have another one.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, last year we settled -- we got here, we went into
halftime with a 12-point lead. And we just came out flat. And we know how hard
it is to get here, especially back to back, so we're just going to go out
there and fight like we have for our whole season. We're just going to play
for each other and go out there and have fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara VanDerveer said earlier that her first Final Four -- I think she
said it was 1990. She wore a ribbon in solidarity with Oklahoma because they
were going to drop the program. Could you tell the story what it was like when
you got there: What was your office like, was it hard to recruit, what was
your salary? Probably wasn't great. What did you creatively do to build the
program and get people to come play and showing up to watch, too?  
COACH COALE: Okay, how long is this press conference? There's quite a story
there.  
When I came to Oklahoma, I have used the analogy before that it's like finding
a rusty old car out in the middle of the farm, and you think: I can do
something with this. The windows are cracked and I can fix them, the tires are
flat and I can fix them, and we can do a paint job. Okay, I can do this. And
then you open up the hood and there's no engine inside. It's a little bit
worse than you might have imagined.  
We had nothing. There was not one single player being recruited according to
the files. So I had never recruited a player before, so, okay. But I used my
network. And that's what it's all about. You know people who know people who
know people.  
And I signed Phylesha Whaley, because my college coach, I had a friend who was
Phylesha Whaley's high school -- who was a friend of Phylesha Whaley's high
school coach. I had never seen her play. I brought her in for a visit and
decided to sign her because she had great eyes and I thought she'd run through
a wall for me. She turned out to be unbelievable and holds all kinds of
records at Oklahoma now.  
And we went and found Stacey Dales in Canada and nobody had ever heard of her.
And I went and watched her in the first three passes she threw were off the
wall. And called my assistant coach: She's fabulous. I love her. I gotta have
her.  
It was just a series of really God being involved in leading us to the right
kids. I really do believe that. And knowing people and building step-by-step
and knowing that it doesn't -- if you want to build it to last, you don't do
it immediately. It takes some time.  
And we never took the Band-Aid approach. We went out and found great kids.
Character kids who believed in the way we wanted to play and believed in our
mission for building a championship program. And they came and they toiled and
Phylesha Whaley came and lived through 5-and-22 and 8-and-19 and got us to the
stinkin' Sweet 16 where we won the right to play Connecticut. Whoohoo.  
And a phenomenal group of kids who paid the price to build a foundation that
would last which allows us to be in this position today.  
So that's the Cliff Notes version.  
  
Q. While we're dealing with past history, obviously you guys had a very
simmering rivalry with Stanford in the past. Talking to the players, it sounds
like it's not quite as intense as it might have been maybe seven or eight
years ago. Is that fair to say? And could you talk about the rivalry that you
had with Tara in the past and how it's maybe evolved over the years?  
COACH COALE: You said we were 0 for our last 4? Is that right?  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH COALE: What's overall series? Because I have no idea.  
  
Q. Two and four, I think.  
COACH COALE: Okay. Obviously it's not a huge rivalry with me because I have no
idea what you're talking about exactly in terms of numbers.  
Here's the thing: The only time we meet Stanford is in the NCAA tournament.
And Tara and I have tried for years to schedule. We would love to have that
home-and-home matchup. We tried. When the twins got here we tried because of
Danielle. And because of their final schedule and our final schedule, it just
has not been feasible. We've not been able to make it work.  
So when you say rivalry, I guess maybe it is. But to me the only time we meet
is when we're in the Sweet 16 or Elite Eight or the Final Four and it's the
NCAA tournament.  
Of course we're going to meet quite often because we're both getting here. And
the numbers say that you will.  
I don't sense any special rivalry with Stanford over the years, especially
with these kids, because they haven't played them. So sorry to bust your story
(laughter).  
  
Q. I'm honored to interview a rock star.  
COACH COALE: I'm honored to be at the UConn Invitational (laughter).  
  
Q. As far as the scheduling, is it a fine line between scheduling too
difficult, particularly when you're going to be in the Big 12, you know,
during the conference season, when you schedule non-conference, do you worry
ever about, you know, burning your kids out or losing too many games and
affecting their confidence? And has this team been able to handle the
difficult schedule as well as maybe any you've had?  
COACH COALE: You know, I think that's maybe one of the blessings of once being
a high school coach and just jumping up to this. I didn't know you were
supposed to worry about stuff like that. I just wanted to play the really good
guys so I could figure out how far we had to go to become one of them.  
And it seemed to work for a while. It got us into the NCAA tournament. Got us
to the Sweet 16, and I thought this seems like a pretty good way to do it. Get
me every tough team you can. Find me the best in America. I want to play home-
and-home with them.  
I just always had enough confidence in our kids that regardless of the
tenacity involved in the Big 12, we were going to win enough games to get in
the tournament.  
And when we got in the tournament, we were going to be very well prepared to
succeed there. Our goal was never just to get there; it was to get to the
tournament and win. Even back when Phylesha Whaley and I were just dreaming
about it, it was get to the tournament and win.  
And I think that schedule has played a huge role in it. I know it's built this
team's confidence. Not a doubt in my mind.  
  
Q. You had the Paris twins. You have Danielle. Is there some sort of story
to how you've been so successful recruiting in the Bay Area?  
COACH COALE: I don't know that there's really any magic to it. Obviously when
you get kids like Courtney and Ashley, who are so renowned, not only within
the state of California but across the country, but when you get Cali kids --
I know when Geno got Diana, then that opened the door.  
More people are looking at your school because there's that connection there.
And I think that probably put us on the short list. I don't know that beyond
that there's any real magic, except that there are a lot of Cali kids who love
the way people support basketball at the University of Oklahoma.  
And I know for Danielle, when she got there and saw how big of a deal it is.
It's a really big deal in Norman, Oklahoma, to be on the women's basketball
team. It's a really big deal in Norman, Oklahoma, to go watch the women's
basketball team. I think for a lot of California kids that's very attractive.  
  
Q. Kind of picking up on that Connecticut Invitational theme --  
COACH COALE: Wendell started it.  
  
Q. I know. Thank you, Wendell. I think there's also a little bit of a
perception that this is not the sexy game that the other one is. This is kind
of like the other game. I just wondered what your thoughts on that were.  
COACH COALE: Well, we're playing. And as our team likes to say, we're still
here. I don't really know that it matters what type of circus revolves around
the game. And in some ways I think it's a blessing in disguise to be not part
of the circus.  
But one team is going to win that game. And either ourselves or Stanford are
going to be playing for the national championship on Tuesday. So it's a pretty
significant game, I would think.  
And I think there will be a lot of folks who feel the same way.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Abi? She spent a lot of time behind the
twins on the bench, and just kind of her progress this year and what the task
is in front of her playing Stanford?  
COACH COALE: I'm glad you asked about Abi, because I think she's a fantastic
story, because her story is refreshing. You know, kids these days play high
school ball and they're All-World on their high school team and they play
every minute and they think they're the end-all to the game of basketball.  
Then they go to college, and if you get five of them and you've got some
players left at all from the previous season, they're not all five going to
play all the time. And for a lot of kids that's really, really hard. There are
some who never get past it. They never get past the fact they don't start as a
freshman. Abi didn't start as a freshman or as a sophomore or junior. Not only
did she not start she hardly played. And she was willing to come to Oklahoma
and not wait -- I want people to understand this, Abi did not wait. Abi got
better from her freshman year to her sophomore year.  
It took a year to figure how to work the way we wanted her to work in
practice. From her sophomore and junior year she started to put the
intellectual pieces of it together, the why you go here and why you don't go
there and what the screening angle does and why we teach it, and it all
started to kind of make some sense to her.  
And then going into her junior year, she started to figure out how to really
compete and add all those things together. The missing piece was she wasn't in
physical condition enough to play any significant amount of time. Her junior
year, she could have played more had she physically been prepared, because all
the other pieces were there.  
And so she looked around and said, Courtney and Ashley aren't going to be here
next year, looked at her teammates and I look like I'm going to be the center.
Uh-oh, I better take care of my business. And she did.  
And look at what she's done. It's a fabulous story. And I think young athletes
everywhere should really pay attention to it, because that's the right way to
do it. She was in it for the long haul. She was in it for the stuff that
matters. If you ask her right now she wouldn't have had it any other way.  
People keep asking what are you going to do with Jayne? Jayne's a fantastic
player. I don't want to take anything away from Jayne Appel. She's may be the
greatest interior post passer we've seen in years, and obviously an incredibly
capable scorer in either direction.  
But Abi has played Cokie Reed from Texas, she's played Tina Charles from
Connecticut, she's played Brittney Griner three times. It's not like Abi has
been the biggest kid on the floor all the time.  
She gets this. She understands it, and she'll be ready for it.  
  
Q. You're the only coach here without a national title. What would winning
the national championship do for you, professionally and maybe, more
important, do for the program?  
COACH COALE: I'm younger than the others, so write that, please (laughter).
Just barely.  
Oh, it's why we do what we do. It's the grand prize. Obviously. I think our
returning to the Final Four this year put us in a different category. Put us
in a different league, nationally. But you don't really get to be a part of
that small circle until you get to cut down the nets here.  
And that's what awaits us. And before you can do that, you've got to get here.
So we did that part. But we've got some unfinished business.  
And I think it would catapult us even into maybe an even more elite circle.  
  
Q. You mentioned on the conference call Wednesday about the respect and the
friendship you've had with Geno Auriemma over the years. Could you take us
back to -- I think it was '96 when he first came to Norman to check out Stacy
Hansmeyer and the first time you met and how that friendship has built?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, it was the fall. It was snowing sideways. And Geno came in
the gym and he had on loafers with no socks. Seriously, aren't you from
Connecticut? It's winter and he's complaining about the weather and how cold
it is and he doesn't have a coat and he has his jacket lapels up. I said, Go
sit down. I've got to practice. That's kind of how it began.  
He appreciated the way our kids worked and appreciated the things that we were
teaching high school players. And told me that. There's just sort of been a
mutual respect there in terms of the game of basketball and how it ought to be
played and how it ought to be taught.  
And it's just evolved through the years.  
  
Q. Tara VanDerveer said that she thought that this might be been a really
fun year for you to coach because of the losses from last year, expectations
were lowered, and you just could go out there and do some stuff as a coach and
try and build. Was that the kind of season it was for you, work with some
unknown parts to get it this far?  
COACH COALE: It really has been a fun year, but really made it fun has been
the willingness of these kids to learn and adapt and transform themselves.  
You know, coming into the year, we thought we would play in a certain way. And
we were moving toward that when Whitney got hurt. And it had to be adjusted a
little bit at that time.  
And from that point forward, everything from everybody's role changing a
little bit when Whitney went down to making changes in the lineup. Jasmine
moving into the starting lineup after Carlee had been starting. Playing
different guys, guarding post guys, moving guys around on the floor, changing
defenses, whatever kind of manipulation we needed to have in order to be
successful, these guys are all about it.  
And I think you can ask any coach anywhere. One of the best things in the
world is to be able to call a timeout and say, okay, we're going to do this.
And it's something they've never done before and you draw it up and tell them
to do it and they go out and do it exactly like that, it doesn't matter if
you're coaching junior high or in the NBA, that's a pretty cool thing.  
And these guys are receptive in that way. So it's been really, really fun. We
get to tinker and try things out and they don't always work. The things we
draw up or the ideas we have don't always work, but our kids always dive in
head first to try, and that's what makes it fun.  
  
Q. Seems like a size versus speed matchup. Do you see it that way? And will
this boil down to who can take advantage of the mismatch the best?  
COACH COALE: That's a simple way to look at it. And I think most games
ultimately do boil down to that. For us, we've had an ability all year, it
seems, to play the way we need to play in order to win, whether it's half
court or full court, or patient on offense or scoring quickly.  
We can do it a lot of different ways. Not necessarily real pretty whatever way
we do it, but we found a way to be effective. So hopefully we'll be able to
use our speed to our advantage.  
  
Q. Stanford has been in only a couple of close games all year and were very
fortunate to escape the last one. You've been in plenty of them. Does this
give you kind of an advantage if this game is close?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I think it does, just because our kids believe we're going to
win. Does that mean I necessarily want it close at the end? I'll take 12 or 15
points if we can get them.  
Our guys, when we went to overtime with Notre Dame, when I went to the huddle
before the overtime, I knew we were fine. Our guys just believed they're going
to win. And, again, that's a reflection of that schedule we played all year.  
  
Q. You probably play that 2002 Connecticut team better than anybody. You
gave them fits there in the second half of the championship game. This year
you were ahead of Connecticut in the second half. Geno says that that 2002
team could beat this year's team 9 out of 10, but obviously they're doing
something right. Are they doing anything that we haven't seen before in
women's basketball, or what is singular about what Connecticut's doing right
now? And I ask that with all the respect I know you could beat them Tuesday
night if you played them.  
COACH COALE: Thank you. I agree with him, I think the 2002 team was better.
They were deeper. They had really a superstar at every position on the floor.
When you look at what those kids have gone on to do in the WNBA, it's obvious.  
I don't know, though, that there's been a more dominant center than Tina
Charles and the way she's played this year. She is so consistently
predictable. You just know what you're going to get.  
With that 2002 team you might get Aisha, you might get Swin, you might get
Tamika. You never really knew and what combination thereof. They know what
they're getting from Tina Charles. They go right to her. And sometimes it's
that focus, I think, on knowing where those baskets are going to come from
that maybe makes them great in a different sort of way, if that answers your
question.  
  
Q. Considering what you all have been through this year, what you've
overcome, where does this team rank, regardless of what happens in the next
couple of days? Where does this team rank on your satisfaction meter and the
other really good teams you've had?  
COACH COALE: I don't ever rank teams. I love them all. It's like asking me
which one of my kids are my favorite. I love them all for different reasons,
and this team definitely has a special fiber. And because of the way they're
wound up with each other, they're going to have similar relationships
throughout their lives like the 2002 group.  
That group, they get together every year whether they go on a trip or meet up
somewhere, they just -- they talk all the time. This group will be like that.
And some are a little bit more so than others. This one just happens to be --
maybe part of it is because of the small number. We don't have a lot of folks
on our roster.  
Two, when you do things together, you have a tendency to become pretty wound
up.  
  
Q. Coach, if you're familiar with the '82, '83 and '84 men's tournaments --
I know I'm going back a ways -- could you make a case that the Olajuwon family
is due some good fortune in a Final Four?  
COACH COALE: I was so deeply embedded in my incredible basketball career at
the Oklahoma Christian College that I don't remember -- no, I do remember what
was happening. And, yeah, maybe some magic in there.  
  
Q. What kind of motivation do you receive after being in the Final Four
twice before and not having being able to win yet?  
COACH COALE: Oh, good question from the juniors. Well, it's like being invited
to this incredible feast. They just set the table and the food looks and
smells fabulous, and there's just dish after dish after dish after dish, and
you get to get in the room and you get to sit down, and then they take all
your utensils away. And so we're still hungry.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to introduce head coach Geno Auriemma and student-
athletes Tina Charles and Kalana Greene and Maya Moore.  
COACH AURIEMMA: We've been talking the last couple of days about being in the
Final Four and what a unique experience it is and how you have to really try
to get as much out of it as you can, the whole experience, not just sitting
around waiting for the games.  
A lot goes into the preparation part, because it's not easy with all the
things you're asked to do. But this group has been real good all year about
zeroing in on what's important and making sure that we stay on task.  
And now tomorrow we get a chance to play in the game that we've wanted to play
in since we got back to school last April. And we're just anxious to go. We
really are. And I know I speak for them and everybody else in our program.
We're anxious for tomorrow to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For any of the players, Coach just talked about zeroing in on what is
important. What is important right now for you guys?  
KALANA GREENE: I think what's important is getting the next win and doing the
things that we've done all season to get the win. I think when it's time to
have fun, we know how to do that. When it's time to get on the court and play
basketball, that's when our focus really turns on and try to get the next win.  
  
Q. Tina, just your thoughts on playing against Griner tomorrow night and
what kind of challenges she presents?  
TINA CHARLES: Coach has made it clear that it's not Tina Charles versus
Brittney Griner; it's UConn versus Baylor. All the challenges I'm going to
face we're going to face them together, if there are any challenges. Just
going to go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. Maya, can you just talk about this ride you've all been on, the winning
streak, and can you just talk a little bit why the team chemistry is so
good?  
MAYA MOORE: I think our program, just the way we do things, definitely gives
us an opportunity to have strong chemistry. We're always together. It's a
unique set of people, I think, first of all. You have to have a good group
that like to be around each other and like to be in the gym.  
And really have the same interests. And most of us do. We live together. We
always look out for each other. Anytime we go anywhere, we're always going in
groups, going out together.  
And we have an unselfish group. You know, if you watch us play it's so clear
we don't care who scores. It's all the same. We all get just as excited if
Jacquie Fernandes is hitting a 3 or Caroline Doty is hitting a 3. It's just a
unique group and our coaches do a great job of setting the atmosphere.  
  
Q. Tina, obviously you don't have somebody on your team who is 6'8 ". What
can you as a team do to simulate Brittney? Do you use brooms in practice, for
example, or do you use 6'8" guys? What can you do to prepare in that
fashion?  
TINA CHARLES: Just mentally go out there and play hard. We're not going to
change anything that we do, offensively. We're going to -- Coach is going to
give us a game plan and go out there and do it the best we can. We're not
going to change anything we're going to do. We're not going to use brooms or
anything.  
  
Q. Tina, just wanted you to reflect a little bit about the matchup you had
as a freshman when you played Sylvia Fowles and what impression did that make
upon you, and do you see any similarities in this matchup? I know you've said
it's not me against Brittney. But so many of us here making into that, because
we see that matchup in the post. But do you see any similarities, she being an
up-and-coming center, you being regarded as one of the best in the country,
and back then Sylvia being the best and you being the up-and-coming center?  
TINA CHARLES: You know, I guess like how everybody thought for me, there's a
lot of growth left for her. Definitely going to be -- when she's leaving
college, going to be one of the great centers to come out of college.  
Like I said, a lot of growth. You can just see. Every time I see her play,
she's improving on something. Whether it's a different move where she has the
ball, whether it's her intensity level, just how she gets energy when she's
blocking shots, just little things like that. So definitely there's always
room for growth when you're a freshman.  
  
Q. What about the impression of Sylvia, the matchup, what impression does
that make?  
TINA CHARLES: Definitely was a challenge, something that I wanted to see
myself when I became a senior, wanted to become one of the dominating seniors
to leave school.  
  
Q. Maya, obviously you guys being the defending champs and the winning
streak puts a target on your back pretty much every time you go out there.
Coach talked about the anxiousness that you guys are feeling to play. I mean,
do you guys get motivated for going up against the best teams in the
country?  
MAYA MOORE: Absolutely. That's what March is. That's what the Final Four is.
That's what UConn basketball is. We're a competitive group and that's why
we've been able to maintain the success we've had, because our coaches and the
players around me are very competitive.  
And anytime you can get a matchup with a competitive team who has talent, who
has worked hard, who has shocked a lot of people in coming as far as they
have, and they're on a roll right now, we would have it no other way. That's
when basketball is fun. If it's competitive, high pressure, everybody's
watching, that's what you love.  
So after practice now I was ready to go. I was asking our assistant coach,
Chris Dailey, if we could play right now because I was ready to go. We're
definitely excited and anxious to play.  
  
Q. Early this morning the Oklahoma players talked about Coach Sherri Coale
as a celebrity and certainly around Oklahoma. This is for any of the players,
do you think of Geno as a celebrity?  
TINA CHARLES: He's The Godfather (laughter).  
  
Q. Want to expand why you --  
TINA CHARLES: He's Italian (laughter).  
  
Q. Maya, Baylor has a lot of freshmen. You have been in this event as a
freshman, and I know you had a lot of preparation coming into that event. Is
it a little overwhelming as a freshman, everything you have to experience, and
can you reflect back on what it was like for you your first time at the Final
Four?  
MAYA MOORE: You're just excited and soaking in the experience. You're not
really -- I don't think you're really too stressed, unless you feel like your
team isn't ready. That's the only reason I would be stressed, if I didn't
think we were the best team out there.  
But you're really not doing a whole lot of thinking. I mean, as poorly as we
played at times my freshman year in that game, most of the time I wasn't doing
a whole lot of stressing or thinking; I was just going out there playing.  
It's a good thing when you come in you're fresh and you don't have anything to
compare it to, you're just going out and playing. It can be an advantage. But
if you don't have upperclassmen that ultimately take the responsibility for
the team, you can get in trouble.  
So I just feel real good with where we are, just the experience I've had from
freshman year until now. I feel like I have and the seniors next to me have
taken a lot of responsibility for our team and we feel really confident.  
  
Q. Kalana, with your third time back in three years, I assume the entire
team is pretty comfortable with the logistics that surround being at a Final
Four. Coach was talking about the way you guys get pulled around different
places and everything. You pretty much know what the deal is by now. Does that
help you get ready for the game that you've already had to deal with all the
off-the-court stuff that you have to do?  
KALANA GREENE: I think we know what to expect. I think the first year we came
here, Tampa, you know, we were excited. But then there's like a lot of things
going on and you're like, oh, my God, I'm ready to play. You're kind of
overanxious.  
Now I think we expect everything that's happening, and I think our time
management, we know when we're not doing a lot of the off-the-court stuff we
need to relax and get ready for the game. Especially after this afternoon.
We're going to take a lot of time to just relax and get out. Get our mind off
of basketball and get our mind off of being in the gym all day and clear our
heads before we come in tomorrow to work.  
  
Q. Maya, I wanted to get a chance to ask you when it happened, but were you
surprised when you won the Wade Trophy this year?  
MAYA MOORE: Anytime you get an award that's based on someone else and their
opinion of you, you can never really be sure. But it's an honor to be
respected in that way.  
And I'm just glad that it's happening the way it is, just as far as how far
our season is going. And to have my teammate up there with me, Tina, and the
rest of my teammates over in the corner cheering and acting goofy for us and
excited is what makes it really worthwhile.  
So it's an honor, but that's not why I came here. I came here to play tomorrow
and take care of business.  
  
Q. Maya, you guys have been playing unreal defense all season long. It seems
somehow you turned it up a notch in the tournament. I think you
(indiscernible) 40 points a game and shattered almost every NCAA record for
defensively. What have you guys done differently the last four games to sort
of get even better defensively for an unreal defensive effort all season?  
MAYA MOORE: At this point it's not a whole lot of physical changes or
improvements. It's all in your mind. It's all focused, knowing your scouting
report. Just really studying your opponent and knowing what you need to do.
Trying to make the other team not necessarily steal the ball every time but
make them uncomfortable, disrupt their flow, and just continue with that
aggressive attack mentality.  
And we pick it up in March and in April. That's what we do at Connecticut.
It's the best time of the year. It's our favorite time of the year to play,
and we just come with everything we have, and we're just using that momentum
from each game, pick up the defensive intensity.  
  
Q. To follow up with that, March and April, you yourself have turned your
game up. Your numbers are a video game, like shooting 70 percent from 3-point
land and 64 percent from the field. Do you turn your game up in March and
April as well?  
MAYA MOORE: I always try to play my hardest every game. And something about
the tournament, I guess it just gets me excited. But I'm just playing free
right now. I'm not trying to do a whole lot of, like I've said before, not
doing a whole lot of thinking, not trying to improve or work on my game per
se, but I'm just going with my strengths.  
I'm comfortable out there and my teammates are doing a great job of setting
screens for me and finding me in transition and playing great defense, which
gives us more opportunity to play offense. And I'm just really comfortable
right now.  
  
Q. Maybe two of you can answer. How has the complexion of this team changed
without Renee running the offense?  
TINA CHARLES: It changed a lot. There's things that Renee can do that just
can't be replaced. Just the way she'll just penetrate in the lane and able to
dish that off or how she just always wanted to come down the court and be in
transition all the time. That's what Lorin Dixon is doing for us right now.  
But I think it was a great challenge for Tiffany Hayes and Caroline to come
out of their shell and just do something they probably didn't think they could
do. I think that's one of the best things about playing for Coach.  
He'll take you all year-round and make you feel like you can do something
else. Make you do things that you need to work on, that can help you in the
long run. But it's not about having a two point guards; it's just about
getting the job done. And so far that's what Caroline and Tiffany has done for
us.  
  
Q. Maya, you've been dominating teams by 30, 40 points all season. How
concerned are you that if you get into a close game, that things won't go your
way? Specifically, where Stanford has been in the same boat all season, except
for the loss to you, and then they wound up being in a close game and had a
real hard time. How concerned are you with that?  
MAYA MOORE: I'm not concerned. It's the same mentality and attack mindset that
we have during the game is what I believe will carry us over in a close game.
It's the fact that we will never stop attacking. We'll never stop playing
hard. And so if another team decides to do the same, we're confident that
we'll be able to be the winner in the end, because we go hard every game,
regardless of the score.  
That's why you see us diving on loose balls when we have a 30-point lead,
because we're playing in that attack mentality, with that attack mentality for
40 minutes. Because we play that way we have confidence if it comes down to
it, we'll still be in that same mindset, if it comes down to the wire.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, one of the things that I've noticed throughout covering you is
that no matter what kind of challenge Connecticut has, who their individual
players are, Connecticut always seems to just focus on what it has to do to be
successful as opposed to what the other team does. Is this another example of
that philosophy with Griner coming up tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, I think every game involves two things: There's
things that you know you're going to have to do to neutralize some things that
they do, and you know that there's certain strengths that you have that you
have to try to take advantage of.  
And I think as a coach you have to make that distinction between how much of
our focus is going to be on what they do and how we treat them and how much of
our focus is going to be on what we do and who we are and how we're going to
approach things. I think you have to do a little bit of both. I don't think it
can be all one or the other.  
But I would say tomorrow's not going to be that much different than all of our
other preparations in that the majority of our preparation is what we're going
to do, how we're going to do it, and knowing that they're going to react a
certain way and we're going to have to go to plan B, when that time comes. And
maybe plan C.  
Some games you get a plan A and it just stays there and you don't have to
worry about anything.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier was talking with Coach Coale about the first time she met
you. She talked about how you came into this little barn of a gym in October
with no socks, coat pulled up around your neck. Can you talk about that day
and how your friendship has blossomed over these last 15 years?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I just wanted to fit in with the locals (laughter). At least I
had shoes. I mean, you know? I remember my first impressions were, wow, this
is like really good. This is not like your typical high school practice. I
coached high school. I know what a good practice looks like. I know what bad
ones look like. And I'm watching them practice and go through some drills.  
I thought this is really good. This is a really good program. She really knows
what she's doing with these kids. And they're fortunate to have somebody like
that, who is passionate about the game and knows how to teach it. Knows what
she wants to teach and knows how to teach it. Not a lot of people do.  
And that was my initial reaction to Sherri, and our friendship kind of grew
from there, probably because of our shared love of the game and the way we
play the game, and I think there's a lot of similarities between the way they
play and the way we play.  
And kind of flattering a little bit that they're using Danielle Robinson the
exact same way we used Renee Montgomery last year. And we talked about that a
lot in the offseason.  
And I'm glad they're having a lot of success. I knew it would happen. I just
didn't know to what extent. That's been the best coaching job I think she's
ever done, given who graduated and Whitney Hand getting hurt, it's pretty
remarkable that they're here. I'm not surprised.  
  
Q. Your players talk about attacking for 40 minutes. It's hard to get -- I
mean, a lot of teams talk about it, it's hard to get players to do that. Is
that something in the players individually, or is this -- have you had a team
like this before in that sense? And is it because of them personally?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I have had teams like this before. I don't think you win -- I
don't think you go through a season and win as many games as we've won in the
past and win national championships unless you can have that kind of
mentality.  
Sometimes it's a little more subtle, and sometimes it's really overt. I mean,
this team -- it's evident what they're doing, and there's no subtlety about
it. It stems from the expectation level and who they are as people. I could
have the same expectations, which I've had of other players and other teams
and not have this result.  
So it all stems from the individuals. They have it in them, and it's our job
as coaches to get it out. They didn't have it in them, we wouldn't be doing
what we're doing.  
  
Q. I guess they called it having a little dog in you or something, they say
great players have maybe a mean streak or a little nastiness. Do these as a
team have that, and have you seen that before in the team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They don't have it. They don't have it. Again, they don't have
what Shea Ralph had or what Diana Taurasi had or Swin Cash.  
  
Q. As a group?  
COACH AURIEMMA: As a group they have it. But as individuals they do not.
They're more a collection of parts that make a great whole. Some of the other
teams I've had, there were individuals on there that were -- like they don't
have what Renee had. But they get the same things done. They just do it in a
different way.  
  
Q. Last weekend with Tina Charles as a player for you, and I would ask you
to reflect on that relationship from where you started and where you ended
up?  
COACH AURIEMMA: A lot has been said about that. I did think about that, too,
as a matter of fact. Last weekend I thought about it, that this is the last
week. The last week of practice. Maybe the last two games.  
And I do think back to freshman year and how quickly things changed, that in
practice I thought, wow, this kid's going to be something special. In the
first two exhibition games, I was like, wow, we haven't had anybody like her
in a long time. This kid is an offensive rebounding machine.  
It didn't dawn on me until the third or fourth game that all the offensive
rebounds were her missed shots. And that's when the problem started, because
she was patting herself on her back for all of the offensive rebounds and I
was bitching about every missed layup.  
So it fell apart quickly that freshman year. But from then on I think the
expectations that she has for herself are so much higher than they were back
then. She's so much more mature. She's someone that now you don't have to
necessarily kind of badger all the time. You can just point some things out to
her, whereas before you would point something out, it would go in one ear and
out the other because she couldn't understand why you were saying what you
were saying or why you were doing what you're doing.  
And she's such a nice kid that you couldn't even get her mad. You just shook
your head and said, man, it's really hard to get mad at this kid because she's
such a nice kid.  
And she wants to please me so bad that it was really hard for me to go to
practice and say, You're the worst player I've ever coached in my life. I know
you love me, but I hate you as a player. And I think you're a great kid and I
think you're sweet and a good student, and I wish I could take you home, but,
man, I hate the way you play basketball.  
It was a constant back and forth like that until all of a sudden it dawned on
her, you know, I think Coach is right; I don't necessarily like myself as a
basketball player as much as I could.  
And now I think she understands. But everybody has their own timetable, you
know. I'm just glad that hers didn't run out before she finished her
eligibility.  
  
Q. Heather Buck didn't practice today. Is there anything wrong with her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She's been sick for the last couple of days. Stomach problems.  
  
Q. And the question is: Knowing how you feel about Maya and Tina personally,
and you understand their nuances as players so well, next week, when you take
them on the court as the coach of the United States Basketball Team, how do
you separate those emotions when you have to make a determination where they
fit into this other big picture?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's very easy for me. I don't ever have a problem with
that. Whenever I coach my players outside of UConn, they have to prove to me
that they're better than everybody else. They get nothing from me. It's like
when I coach my son's AAU team, the first person that got benched, first
person that got thrown out of the gym was him.  
So when we show up for a national team, every little thing that Maya Moore and
Tina Charles does that I let somebody else get away with they're getting in
trouble for, and they know it. Because if they make the team and they're
starting and they're playing a lot of minutes, it's not going to be because
I'm their college coach, it's going to be because they earned it.  
So if we win Sunday and we're fortunate enough to play Tuesday and we win
Tuesday and they're all jumping up and down and hugging and kissing and loving
life when we get together next week, I hate 'em (laughter).  
  
Q. Geno, obviously people have asked you before about being a man coaching
women's basketball. And, I mean, it's obvious you can do that at this point. I
was wondering about is there like a secret to co-existing with them? Like we
know you can coach them, but like the other stuff? Do they ever gang up on
you, the kids and your wife and daughters and C.D. and Janelle and do you ever
feel outnumbered? Or is there a secret to co-existing with all of them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, wine helps (laughter). Helps tremendously. Feeling like
you're tremendously outnumbered and saying, yes, dear, no problem, and knowing
like what's important and what's not important to get upset about, what to
argue about, what not to argue about. I don't have a lot of rules with my
team. That's the problem.  
Most coaches get themselves in trouble. They try to micromanage these kids. We
have very few ironclad things that we believe in. Standards of how we are and
who we are and what we do. So they know I'm not after them all the time; that
when I get after them about something, it's really important to me. And it
becomes important to them.  
But I'm not yap, yap, yap, yap. You know, they do that among themselves.
That's what women do. That's what girls do, you know? And I let them do that
whenever they want.  
It's like stretching. We stretch. That's the biggest waste of time in the
history of sports. But we have to stretch. And I give them ten minutes to
stretch before practice so they can all sit around and talk about what movie
they saw, what pair of shoes they saw in some store or -- you know. And I stay
in my office until they're done and then I come out. It's nauseating.  
You let them do what they do because that's part of who they are. I let them
make decisions about all kinds of things. And they're really good about it. I
treat them like adults. I don't treat them like kids. I expect a lot from them
and they know what they're going to get from me, and there's no nonsense.  
And it's the same thing I am with my kids at home. I give them exactly what
they need. I give them everything I have. I give them everything I have, and
they know it. Everything I have is theirs. My house is their house. My
family's their family. And that's why it works for us, I think.  
  
Q. Your streak is incredible. But I'm trying to figure something out, and
maybe you can help a little bit. There are hundreds of thousands of girls,
maybe millions of girls, and women playing basketball in our country. And, as
you know, when UCLA men had their streak, they had 16 games that were in
single digits and they had two that were one-point games. You guys, of course
-- no team in the last two years has gotten within single digits of you. It's
great for you. I'm wondering how is that possible that there's not one team
that can get within single digits with all of these girls, with Title IX --
you know the rest. Thanks.  
COACH AURIEMMA: How is it possible? I don't know. I wish I could give you like
-- I wish I could give you a list, say, Here you go, here's the list, it's
because of this, this, and this.  
But, to be honest with you, everything I will put on the list you would say,
So? Don't other teams do that? So? Doesn't that team have that?  
It's something that I have a hard time explaining, because it doesn't make any
sense. It doesn't make any sense. But it's happening, again, and the cynic out
there will say, well, everybody else is really bad. But that's not true. Not
everybody can be bad. The UConn fans will say, well, that's just the way it
is. Connecticut is supposed to win every game.  
But somewhere in between there there's the players themselves, and a unique
group that just came together at the right time and the right place and it's
gotten bigger than any one of us individually now. It just kind of has a life
of its own and it just moves forward.  
We don't think about it. We don't talk about it. We play a game. They know.
And this could end tomorrow. Tomorrow we could lose by double digits.  
Everything that we've done right up to this point could all go wrong. But no
matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is, my players are
under the impression that it doesn't matter; we're going to win. And maybe not
every kid that plays college basketball says it doesn't matter, we're going to
win.  
I've seen teams, when they're winning, they know they're going to win and they
know they want to win. When they're losing, they accept losing. Okay. It's not
our day today. The hell with it, my bad, I'll get it tomorrow.  
And my guys refuse to accept that under any circumstances. They will not
accept it. If it happens, we'll have to deal with it. But they won't accept
playing poorly. They will not. They will not.  
And if we're up 30 and there's a loose ball and two of my guys don't dive on
it, the guys on the bench are pissed. If somebody dribbles by somebody and
somebody doesn't rotate over and the lead goes from 38 to 36, the guys on my
team are pissed, because that should not be happening. We worked too hard for
that to happen. But we're up 35, I don't care.  
And if they made a goal already that we're going to hold somebody to 50 points
and they get to 45, the intensity level goes up ten times, because they don't
want them to get to 50. Forget how many we have. So it's that kind of
mentality that somehow just becomes -- it's pervasive in our program.  
I don't know how it got there all of a sudden, and I don't know -- I can't
explain it. But it's there right now. It's there. And I'd venture to say that
the teams we play against know it's there. And tomorrow, you know, that kid
could just take her hand and just wipe all that away and 70-some games would
go right down the toilet.  
  
Q. The question is meant obviously as a compliment towards your program.
It's been mentioned by many people. Because of your dominance and the amount
of points you win by, some people have questioned whether UConn basketball is
somehow good for the game. Your response to that, because it's obviously
something that you've built up. But in the big picture, do you see this as
somehow negative for the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've been asked that question a lot, obviously. And I think --
I've worked really hard the last five or six years to not lash out at people
and get defensive and be my old self. And a lot of the guys that cover our
team aren't too happy about that. They like when I make smart-ass comments and
get myself in trouble and annoy everyone in America and let all those people
think that I'm an arrogant ass, say, See, I was right.  
But I've worked really hard to stay away from that stuff. So when I say this,
I don't want it to sound kind of rude or anything towards anybody, but most of
the people asking those questions are gender-biased. If this was a men's team,
no one would be asking that question.  
I don't remember anybody asking questions about, you know, when Tiger was
winning every major, is this good for golf? Can't anybody out there beat this
guy? No, they couldn't. He was too damn good. Well, everybody all of a sudden
had to get better. So you either get better or you just keep letting people
win.  
And if you just keep letting us win, then, you're right, it's bad for the
game. But I guarantee you, five years from now there will be a lot more good
teams in America than there are today because of what we're doing. Just like
after we won the whole thing in 1995, there are a lot more programs doing what
they're doing now than there were back then.  
Somebody's gotta stand up there and say, I'll be the bad guy. And right now
I'm the bad guy. I'm the guy that everybody loves to hate. We're the team that
everybody loves to beat. We're the Yankees, we're the Celtics, we're the
Montreal Canadiens, we're the Russian hockey team before 1980.  
But everything goes away at some point. Everything changes. And when the
change comes, it will be because somebody's paid attention to what we're doing
and said, you know what, that's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to knock
those guys off. And it could be this weekend. But it's going to happen. And I
would like to think that we're going to help it happen, and that's good for
the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer,
as well as student-athletes Jayne Appel, Nneka Ogwumike, and Jeanette Pohlen.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, we're very excited to be here. It's just a
thrill to be back, and our team is really appreciating the opportunity to
compete for the national championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jeanette, could you just talk about the last few days for you, because I
think it's probably been a little bit different than the few days before
that.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I would just say that the past few days it's just been
great with all the support and love that was shown for our team and not just
me but everybody else on our team. We had a great send-off rally before we
came here.  
And just been getting a lot of messages and people just very supportive of our
team and excited that we're here, too.  
  
Q. Jeanette, could you talk a little bit about Danielle Robinson. I know you
played against each other in high school. She's a Northern California girl.
Just your remembrances of her but also playing against her tomorrow night?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Well, her and I are pretty good friends. We became pretty
cool over the summer when we played together, too, and she's a great player.
One of the top point guards in the country. And she'll be a challenge for us.
And she's obviously one of the keys to their team, and just like she was in
high school when we played her.  
So in that respect it won't be too different. But her and I are really cool.
And it will be a fun game. It's cool to meet in the Final Four.  
  
Q. What did it take you three personally to get here to the Final Four?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it took a commitment to the team. The first thing is
putting the team first and having the right attitude throughout the entire
year and coming out every day and working hard.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: And, I mean, personally for me I think just kind of pushing
each other. We really expect a lot from each other. We hold each other to a
really high standard. So every day practicing and all the games that we played
in preparation to this part has really helped us.  
And I think we're doing a really good job of letting each other know what our
expectations are of each other.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I would ditto what they were both saying. A lot of
preparation and time and work went into how -- you know, us getting here. Our
coaching staff put so much time -- they watched so much film and got us
prepared for all the games we needed to win to get here. And we tried to stay
as focused as possible to make it here.  
  
Q. Jayne, could you talk about the team's mindset given how you guys got
here, and just kind of the -- Tara called it getting a second life. Just is
it, oh, wow, we've really got to button up and pay attention to some of the
things that were a problem, or is it -- do you feel, well, that's a bad game
and put it behind you? How do you deal with the way you got into the
tournament?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think, you know, if you make it by 40 points, you make it by
four seconds, either way you're still here at the Final Four. But we
definitely take things from that game and learn from them. We take the
opportunities that we have made smart plays in, and we didn't in that game,
and learned from them and hopefully apply them in the next game.  
And I think we build on that excitement that we gain from that game. We just
take the energy and kind of put it into our work and our effort that we're
going to put into the Oklahoma game. I think that's kind of the attitude our
team has had throughout this trip to the Final Four.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could just talk about the rivalry you guys have had
traditionally with Oklahoma throughout the years?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, I haven't really -- I haven't really played against
Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Anything about the previous games?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yes, actually we have. Tara and Ros and Amy, I think you
said, were the only ones that played Oklahoma -- was it in San Antonio? Yeah,
in San Antonio. We even practiced at the gym where they prepared and they told
us about how serious everyone was and how focused everyone was in preparing to
play Oklahoma.  
And when the game time came, everyone was ready, and everything went as they
had hoped. Everyone was focused and everyone did a really good job of knowing
what they were supposed to do. So she's kind of reminiscing on that and trying
to let us know how important this is in terms of preparing for, you know, this
level of play.  
And I thought that was really special that it was actually here at this same
place, playing Oklahoma again.  
JAYNE APPEL: I remember actually watching the last game with Oklahoma. I
remember how well Stanford looked like they had prepared for the game. I
remember watching Brooke Smith do particularly well in the last matchup
against them.  
  
Q. This question is for Jeanette. Have you been able to come down off of the
high from, you know, your game-winning shot and describe to me kind of some of
the feedback you've gotten from that?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I definitely think I've been able to come down, just
because, you know, after we had our day off, we were right in the getting into
all the Oklahoma stuff that we were preparing for.  
So it's still exciting to think about, but I think for the most part a lot of
us have moved on just because we have so much more to focus on to prepare for
our game.  
And, like I said, it's been nice having all the support and people saying
they're huge fans of our team, and I think it was great for women's basketball
as far as viewers. I feel like a lot of people were watching that game that
night. And, like I said, it's just been kind of crazy, and there were a lot of
big shots made to get to that point in the game as well.  
  
Q. Nneka, how much of a home game do you consider this, since you're in
Texas? And have you played here before? And, finally, is your whole family
going to be able to get out here?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I haven't played in the Alamodome, but it's definitely only
a few-hour drive from where I live. My whole town is going to be here, so I'm
really excited, my high school coach, my AU coach, and my sister's already
here for WBCA, so that's special as well.  
It definitely does feel like home. It was funny because when we landed I told
everyone no one in California knows what a kolache is, and so I told everyone
I'm going to buy them one.  
A kolache is like a pig in a blanket but people eat it for breakfast. So
they're all over the place. I mean, maybe it's just Houston. But I love
kolaches and I was asking where they were when I was in California and
everyone's like, what is that? Hopefully I'll buy everyone kolaches.  
It's real exciting. I have a lot of fans to come to support Stanford, and it's
just really nice being able to play here at home. And I'm really excited. And
so there's no place to win a national title than here at home. I really want
to make that happen.  
  
Q. Jayne, it's been about a month since you initially sprained your ankle.
Is it not getting better? Do you simply need rest? After the season is when
it's going to get better and right now you're just bucking it up?  
JAYNE APPEL: Yes. I think it's hard for any injury to fully heal when you're
playing on it. Even though I haven't been practicing. Going at the game tempo
and game impact on it, I think it just takes longer time.  
  
Q. Jayne, if I might follow up on that. You seem to have a little trouble in
the last game pushing off. Are you any better this week than you were in this
past game? Are you at like 85 percent or what?  
JAYNE APPEL: It's hard to put a percentile to it. I think it will be as well
as it will be for the game. I think my teammates, my coaches have been very
supportive of me trying to put me in positions where I can really help the
team. In the last game, since Phillips was such a big post presence inside,
kind of be the passer for Nneka.  
So it's kind of just coming out tomorrow and seeing how it feels. I don't
practice on it so I don't really know how it feels until game time.  
  
Q. Tara, you might not like this question because I know you don't want to
look ahead, but so much of our focus has been talking about what could happen
if you win, and if UConn wins and you get a chance to play them again. So with
total respect to the fact you have a game first, how much would each of you
like to get another crack at UConn? And, again, with that understanding that
you've got to play another team, but is that at all a part of -- looming maybe
even in the back of your mind somewhere?  
JAYNE APPEL: Not at all. I think we're more focused on what we're doing and
whoever we're competing against. We're going to come out with our best game
plan and try to play Stanford basketball.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Jayne couldn't have said it better. We get the question a
lot. And the answer never changes. Because I don't think our mindsets ever
change. We're always focused about us.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I agree with both of them. I have nothing new to add.  
  
Q. Nneka and Jayne, what are your impressions of Oklahoma when you watch
them on tape?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that their guards are tremendously quick. And that we
will really need to be focused and play a smart basketball game against them,
really come out and be able to execute our offense. I think that will be a big
thing for us.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I agree. Their guards are electrifying, and we have
to contain them. But also they have Abi Olajuwon and Amanda Thompson who are
also very talented players. Olajuwon is really good at finishing around the
basket and Amanda Thompson is very talented, has a very talented outside game.  
And just every game plan is the same: contain their players and play Stanford
basketball. So I think that's what we're going to do, just come out
aggressively.  
  
Q. For all three student-athletes, how does this compare with other Final
Four experiences?  
JAYNE APPEL: I don't think the Final Four experience ever really gets old.
It's always exciting to come back. You never know. You never know when you'll
come back, and you won't ever come back with the same teammates. It's very
exciting for us and we're excited that we get another chance to play.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: And Tara does a good job letting us know. Obviously we know
this, but she tells us there's no guarantees. It wasn't guaranteed that we
were coming here, obviously due to our last game. But I think we had enough
heart to pull it out, and there's no guarantee we're coming back.  
So we just have to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I
think that everyone's really invested in what they do. And everyone's really
focused.  
And we're also taking everything in. Everything is so exhilarating and really
exciting. Everything is so breathtaking. But at the same time, we can also
have fun if we win and play hard, so I think we're trying to make the most of
that experience.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: As a college player, it's a dream to come to the Final Four,
and you can get the opportunity to make it to a championship game. And, like
Jayne said, it doesn't get old. I'm still as excited this year as I was my
first time coming my freshman year.  
It's just a totally different experience than anything else that you'll
experience in college basketball. It's the biggest stage you could be on for
women's basketball. So it's very exciting.  
  
Q. Jeanette, is this Oklahoma back court the fastest, quickest you've faced
this year? And, secondly, in this big arena, is there any problem with depth
perception on shots?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: For your first question, we've played against some pretty
quick guards. I would say that Oklahoma's probably going to be up there. But
we've played against Duke. We've played against Tennessee and UConn, and
Oregon.  
Even in our league we had some pretty quick guards and have had to come up
against numerous different presses. And so I would say they're definitely up
there. But we've had some experience against some pretty quick guards.  
As far as depth perception, we will see how that goes once we go out there and
practice. Hopefully it won't be too much. I guess that's why we're going to
get out there and get a lot of shots up so we get used to the court and the
arena.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I read where you described these two teams as kind of regular teams.
Nothing -- not in a negative way but nothing really exotic. I think there's a
perception out there by some, at least, that this is kind of like the other
game, you know, it's not the sexy matchup that the other game is. I just
wondered what your thoughts were on that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, for me it's the big game. But, you know, one time we
were at the Final Four in 1990 and we had just beaten Virginia, actually. And
I went out to scout. And it was the first time I coached in a Final Four.  
And one of the fans, I heard the fan say, well, that was the JV game. Now is
the real game. So if we're the JV game, so be it. We're going to come out and
play the best JV game possible.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Ros's development? And from what I've read, that you
guys kind of butted heads earlier in her career. But things seem to have
worked out. If you could talk about that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Sure. Well, you know what, I think there's always different
players that, when they go to college, you know, they have a maturing --
they've got to mature.  
And Ros really had to go from that caterpillar to the butterfly, and she
really, during that caterpillar stage, she did give me a lot of gray hair and
we did butt heads, but she's not the only player who has kind of gone through
that process.  
So I was ready. And I really worked hard to kind of really communicate with
Ros, this is what we need you to do and this is how we need you to do it. And
sometimes just as, you know, young adolescent children, sometimes they want to
do it their way. That wasn't the way it was going to work for our team.  
And this year, I think there's just a light went on with Ros and actually with
our whole team. And it's like everyone said, all right, let's try it Tara's
way. And Ros this year has had a fabulous year in that she comes to practice
and she really, she works hard every day.  
She really competes. She stays after and works on her shot. She calls up one
of her friends, a guy who is very quick, and had him come to practice. She
thought she'd get ready to guard Danielle Robinson. Her quickest friend is
coming, she's doing zigzags before we even go to practice.  
So she really gets it. That's what's so rewarding about being a coach is to
see the growth and development of a young person. And we do tease about all
the stuff we've gone through with Ros. And we have so many Ros stories and
we're just like, you know, we'll be talking about her for years.  
  
Q. Sherri Coale is the only coach here without a national title on her
resume. Can you talk about what that does for a coach? You've won a couple.
What does that do for a coach? And is it still paying dividends even if it was
years ago?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Nothing against Sherri, but I hope she doesn't get it this
year (laughter).  
She's done a great job. When I referenced even that first Final Four in 1990,
I wore a ribbon in 1990 because Oklahoma was dropping their women's program.  
So we as coaches, if you go back and look at -- I can look at the shirt I was
wearing, it had a ribbon on it. And that was in solidarity for the Oklahoma
women's basketball program that they were dropping it. And thank goodness they
didn't because look at what she's done and look at what a great program they
have.  
Having won a couple national championships, I do think that sometimes you
might say to yourself, well, okay, if I did it before I can do it again.  
But, really, it's all about this year's team, this year's players. Just being
here and having a chance. So I don't know that it does help a coach one way or
another. But I don't know that it hurts.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Abi Olajuwon a little bit from the film you've looked
at. She waited a long time to get her chance to contribute to this team?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right. I saw Sherri Coale yesterday. First of all, what a
tremendous job Sherri has done this year with her team. To lose Courtney Paris
and Ashley Paris and to lose Whitney Hand, but in some ways some of those
teams are the most fun because there isn't the expectation. They have lost
some games, but they've battled back in big games. And Abi Olajuwon is a big
part of that. For someone -- I believe she lost 30 pounds. That's inspiring.  
That shows someone being committed, and she's a very nice player. She has
great footwork. I've watched Abi since she was a young player out in
California. And I think that's a great success story for her to -- someone
could say, well, I didn't play my freshman year much or my sophomore year or
junior year, heck with it, I'm just going to go through the motions my senior
year.  
And I think it's very inspiring that she did the work and she's led their team
and is basically the inside presence for them to be here. I need to know her
workout and eating routine (laughter).  
  
Q. Coaches at this point love to say it's all about matchups. Is there a
matchup that's of particular importance, you think, in your game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I guess I agree that it is a little bit about matchups. I
think we match up well, and if there was maybe a key one, I think it will come
down to our matchup with Danielle Robinson. And we don't have one person that
can guard Danielle Robinson. And if it wasn't that one, maybe it's Amanda
Thompson. Those two, I think, are going to be probably the pivotal players.  
But our team is -- you know, our team is really dedicated, I think, to doing
whatever it takes and we've had different leading scorers in different games.
So if we need Jayne, and hopefully she'll be able to play and play well for
us, you know, that could be a key matchup inside. Maybe it will be Ros with
Stevenson.  
One thing about both of our teams, we play about seven or eight people, and
there are no secrets. And there are -- I don't think we are exotic teams. We
don't have a Brittney Griner on our team. We don't have a Maya Moore on our
team. So I think we're both blue-collar teams, kind of just going at it, and
it's going to get done in the trenches.  
  
Q. Following up a little bit on the question of winning.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I hope I'm here talking about it.  
  
Q. Winning national championships, we hear a lot about Geno and Pat. Of
course you were the Olympic coach. You've got those titles from the past. How
bad do you want another one this year or anytime in the future?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I mean, coming into the Final Four, we took I
guess a 10-year hiatus. And being here is really special. And obviously to get
here is great. And then once you're here you always want to win it.  
And we're going to work as hard as we can to get it done. What Pat has done is
phenomenal. She's built an incredible program. What Geno has done is
extraordinary.  
But I think that at Stanford, with the academic institution that I represent,
I'm very proud of what our team has done and what our program has done. And do
we want to win a national championship? Yes, all these people would tell you
the same thing.  
Can we? It's to be seen.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys have had some intriguing matchups with Oklahoma in the
past. I wonder if you could talk about the rivalry that happened in the past.
And is too much made of that now considering this is a completely new group of
players who probably weren't -- they don't have any concept, really, hearing
what the girls had to say about it early on.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, like with Tennessee, we've played them every year.
Oklahoma, we went through a stretch where we played. We did have a home and
away series and we would end up playing them in the tournament. And there was
a little connection with some of the California kids, even like with, you
know, the Paris sisters being from the Bay Area.  
But we've had -- I think we've had a good rivalry with Oklahoma. And they
started out and got us down, and then we kind of came back at 'em. But they
have a great program and I think they're a great matchup for us. But we
haven't kept it going year in and year out like we have with other programs.  
  
Q. What kind of strategy do you advise your team to do for this upcoming
game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, our team, one of the things I think that our team has
to do is we have to really focus and concentrate. And we watch a lot of
videotape. We do a lot of individual kind of talk to people individually about
what we expect them to do in the games.  
We do a lot of preparation, walkthrough. And you have a week to get ready. And
one of the things we count on with our Stanford students is the fact that they
will really focus and remember and execute a game plan. So we're hoping for
that.  
  
Q. You're the last team to beat Connecticut. I think you're the only team
since then to even be ahead of them at halftime. So you know this team. You've
had success against this team. Where is that team -- I realize they haven't
won anything yet this year, but are they doing anything that's singular or
unique we haven't seen in women's basketball before or not? Sort of where do
they fit in historically, this team?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I don't know that -- they have great players. But I
think I just think Geno would -- they have great players. But there are a lot
of great players. So I think it's what -- I think it's the culture that he's
developed at Connecticut and that this is how you play basketball. This is in
terms of your conditioning and your passing. And he has a great program.  
And they really are -- they're on a roll. And they started out -- I think,
again, just like the great job that Sherri has done, I think Geno has done an
equally great job in that they lost Renee Montgomery and you have Doty and
Hayes stepping right in and they bring Dixon in.  
He knows the game. He teaches the game well. And they're on a phenomenal, I
think, extraordinary run. And to keep that focus and be able to do what
they're doing is outstanding.  
And we did -- I think what our team did was when we played there -- and I hope
that in two days we can have the conversation if in fact we win and they win.
But our team, if anything is different about this team this year is our team's
confidence, and that would come in handy.  
  
Q. You've talked a little bit about Stevenson and Robinson. Is Ros going to
start guarding -- start the game on Robinson and could you talk a little bit
more about those two guards for Oklahoma and what makes them great?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Ros will guard Robinson and Ros will guard Stevenson.
If cloning was in, we'd have two Ros's out there. But I'm not sure where we'll
start her or who she'll be on in the beginning of the game. Right now we're
debating it. But Jeanette is a very good defender for us, too.  
But Ros, she's going to have to play really well. And I think that she's
playing with a lot of confidence. She is kind of a lockdown defender. So I'm
not sure which one we'll have her guarding right now.  
Did I answer it all right for you?  
  
Q. Maybe a little bit more about the two Oklahoma guards.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Danielle Robinson is -- she is an absolute -- turns
into an afterburner's jet. She just goes from end to end as fast as anyone.
She has such incredible speed and quickness, and every time you look at her
she's smiling and laughing. She brings great energy to their team.  
And the two of them together just play so well together. Stevenson is a
recipient of a lot of her passes. Stevenson to me is more of a 3-point
shooter, pure shooter, where Robinson is more of a slasher. And I think for
our team, we just -- there's not one person on our team who can stop them; we
have to play team defense against them. We're going to have to have people
really focused on helping, not just one-on-one Ros against Robinson or
Jeanette against Robinson or Stevenson.  
So they're really fun to watch when you're a spectator but really tough to get
ready for as a coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
RICK NIXON: We're joined by Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. I'll ask
Coach VanDerveer for an opening statement, and then we'll go to questions.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thank you, Rick. And thank you very much for the very nice
compliments. We're very excited about coming to San Antonio.  
I feel that our team, you know, we had a very tough regional, and I want to
just compliment Xavier on a great regional championship game and our team was
really given a second life.  
And I know that our players and our staff are very appreciative of that and we
plan to make the absolute most of it.  
RICK NIXON: Questions.  
  
Q. You had a chance to play UConn earlier in the year, and you probably
didn't want to look too far ahead. But when you look at this tournament, when
you see the things UConn has done and the ways offensively and defensively you
try to control that team earlier on, what will Kim Mulkey and Baylor and what
will maybe potentially you have to do to change that tide from happening
again?  
COACH VANDERVEER: They're playing very well. And I think it's -- playing any
great team you have to kind of minimize their strength, and they have a lot of
strengths to minimize. So it's a tough job. I think Kim is a great coach. She
has an exceptional player and something different to prepare with Brittney
Griner. No one else in the country has that type of post presence defensively,
and so I think that there might be some adjustments that Connecticut will have
to make to go up against her.  
And also obviously there are other talented players. But for us we are focused
on Oklahoma and working as hard as we can so we'll be in that championship
game, regardless of the opponent.  
  
Q. How has that -- obviously with the last second the other night, how has
that rejuvenated and refocused the team? You mentioned it gave them a second
life, but are they excited now they have that opportunity?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It was a shock, honestly, coming back on the bus. We haven't
practiced. I haven't seen the team. We went back to school. So we'll practice
this afternoon. I know that it was a shock then, and waking up Tuesday morning
it was like, oh, my gosh, we're still playing, we're in the Final Four. It's
amazing.  
And we just -- I've felt bad and I know a lot of people felt bad for Xavier,
because they really had us on the ropes. But somehow we wiggled out. And we
definitely want to maximize our opportunity, and so I do think it has given us
really a second life.  
  
Q. Could you first expand a little bit about Necka's development in all
facets, both offense and defense? And then if could you address how different
a team Oklahoma is than Xavier. They don't have a lot of size and quickness.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, with Necka, I think the biggest thing is
Necka's confidence. I think she gained it through the season last year. She
finished very strong, playing very well for us in the NCAA tournament, and it
even built more doing so well for U.S.A. Basketball.  
Necka is a young player, she's really learning the game, and I think she's
really dedicated herself.  
What I noticed this year is she is so attentive and she's such a student of
the game. She's so focused that I just think that for her it's really paying
off. She's a very athletic player. She's working on expanding her game,
shooting 3-point shots.  
She is a total team player. She does whatever our team needs her to do,
whether it's rebound, scores on the block, defends. So all facets of our game
are maturing, and I just think we're really proud of how hard she works and
her improvement.  
And in preparing for Oklahoma, they are like us, I think, in that they're like
maybe -- I call them my regular team. You look at Kentucky, they're extreme in
what they do.  
You look at even Baylor with Griner, that's extreme. You know what I mean?
With Xavier, that's extreme, they're so big. For us and Oklahoma, we're kind
of regular teams. If anything, Oklahoma, you know they don't maybe have as
much size as we do but they have more back-court quickness.  
  
Q. Is it a good thing or just a product of how you guys have been that in
this NCAA tournament you've had a different leading scorer every night or
every game you've had?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I didn't know that. I think we have good balance. I think
that for us we're not all about Jayne and we're not all about Necka. We're not
all about Kayla. Jeanette has had a good game or Ros has had a good game.  
And I think in order for us to do what we really want to do and having a shot
at winning a national championship we'll need not just those five but I would
say maybe eight, nine, coming off, with the four coming off the bench.  
Joslyn Tinkle hit a big shot for us. J.J. Hones hit a big shot and Melanie
Murphy came off playing a good Pac-10 tournament. Hopefully she can step up
more in the NCAA. And Michelle Harrison, until she got really -- got knocked
in the head, she's been practicing really well. So those are the people we're
really counting on.  
  
Q. My question is, this is not something that's going to be surprising to
you, but I think a lot of people have considered this tournament more than
anything else a coronation for Connecticut. And I wonder as the No. 2 team in
the country, obviously as a team that's only lost one game, when you hear that
stuff, when you read that stuff, what's your reaction to that, when, at least
externally, outside of your program, people believe that this is not really a
competition but a coronation this year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, you know, Connecticut has -- obviously they've had a
great season. They've had a great run and they have great players. But we know
that it's getting the job done on that night.  
And I think sometimes, like when it's called the Connecticut Invitational, we
say, hey, we just want to get invited. And then we get there and let's play
well. And obviously for us right now our total focus is on Oklahoma. And what
we have to do is we just have to take care of -- it might be, you know -- I
don't know. I don't know what kind of preparation Connecticut does. I think
they have to prepare for whatever team came through there. I think they would
have to prepare for whether it's Duke or Baylor, too.  
I think we're all doing the same thing, just preparing for each game and
trying to get in the championship game.  
But they've made some just tremendous statements, a regional 40-point game,
and we win the regional with four seconds. So there's -- we're getting there
different ways. But we're all there. And we're very excited and I think for
us, you know, we want the opportunity to play in the championship game.  
  
Q. One thing that's interesting is sometimes when you have a -- lose a
really key player, how do the other players adjust to that? When you guys lost
Candice Wiggins and to make the Final Four without her, Oklahoma has done that
losing Courtney and Ashley Paris, could you talk about the challenge of coming
back after losing that dominant player and how sometimes other players step up
their games?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's true, in that for us Candice was -- Candice
was so dominant for our team. But I think she taught other people how to
compete and brought confidence to people like Jeanette and Ros and Jayne. And
when you go there, you're like, wow, this is awesome, we want to go back and
we want to even obviously do better. So you kind of get -- I think you see
teams that go multiple years.  
A lot of different -- if you look at kind of the records, Auburn went through
years in a row. You have teams that go back multiple years. LSU, they went
five times in a row. So I think that the teams they get used to playing at
that level. They get used to winning at that level. And they pass it on. And
Candice did get it going for us. We were knocking on the door before that, but
she got it going for us and other people have said fine, let's keep going.  
  
Q. Could you comment on how strong your defense has been really throughout
this whole year, and particularly the challenges of trying to slow someone
like a Danielle Robinson on the perimeter, how your guards will respond to
that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think our defense on the perimeter has started with
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. She always has been a really tough defender for us. But
she really takes it personally. And she really takes pride in her defense. And
she just -- we give her a kind of a job and if it's guarding Danielle
Robinson, we'll say here's some little tips, but she really she watches extra
video. She'll talk to me about, well, I'm not sure we should play that screen
that way.  
She's very intelligent. Like we played one player where when the player was
going right, we went over the screen. When she was going left, we went under
the screen. I mean, she really concentrates on her defense.  
After that, I think you've got players who, you know -- I call it Ros plays
kind of lockdown defense and other people are really great at taking charge.
Melanie Murphy. And Kayla Pedersen is a great defender at 6'4".  
Jayne and Necka, we play scouting report defense. I tell them this is what I
want you to do, and they work hard to do it. I think Jeanette works hard
defensively. Now we need people coming off the bench and giving us a little
bit more. Joslyn can help us more. J.J. plays excellent help side. She can
guard people and she's a very smart defender.  
  
Q. These teams are different, but you and Oklahoma, you guys have had
previous NCAA tournament meetings, most recently in 2006, Courtney's freshman
year. Could you talk about the style and philosophy you guys have had? Both of
you have had a lot of success.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, we haven't played for a while. Obviously, that was
the last time we played, and that was at The Alamodome actually. But we have
similar teams. And I think we approach the game kind of in similar ways, and
they have a go-to post player.  
They really -- they run a triangle. Maybe we run it different ways. But I
think we're similar, and just with playing them, I think there's a certain
comfort level for probably them and us. I mean, Danielle played on the same
team as Jayne Appel did, a summer team, East Bay Xplosion. They played against
-- Jeanette and Danielle played against each other for the state championship.  
So not just her but other people through USA Basketball. Abi Olajuwon from
Southern California. So there's a connection with our team and their team.  
  
Q. The fact that the Big 12 has got two of the Final Four teams in there,
and it's -- Nebraska obviously won the regular season undefeated and A &M won
the conference tournament title, and neither one of those teams are in San
Antonio, would that to you seem to suggest pretty good depth for the Big 12,
the fact that two teams that were kind of in the middle of the standings end
up in the Final Four?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think the Big 12 should be really commended and
complemented on their commitment to women's basketball.  
You don't have two teams in the Final Four or that many teams doing so well or
even that many teams invited unless you have a great commitment and it starts,
whether it's at the -- I think it starts probably at the conference level but
also at the individual university level, when you have what it seems to me is
that Big 12 teams value women's basketball.  
You have crowds. You do TV. You do promotion. I think the high salaries of
coaches are probably the averages in the Big 12. You probably have the
numbers. I don't have them at my fingertips. But there is a commitment and
just saying we value women's basketball.  
And I think it's a great statement, and I think it's something that I hope
that other conferences look at and say, hey, let's keep up with them. We don't
want to play second fiddle to the Big 12.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask if you could sort of assess the pluses and minuses of
playing a Final Four in a dome as you will this weekend as opposed to a
conventional arena, and if you sort of -- if there's any way to sort of
duplicate the experience before you get there or what you talk to your players
about in that circumstance.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Until you brought it up, I didn't think about it. We've
played there before. I'm going to say absolutely nothing. We're so excited to
be playing there. We're hoping that I'm sure it will be a great turnout. I
hope it will be a sellout. And it's just a great atmosphere.  
And just I think if you make a big deal about something, you'll find things
that confirm your hypothesis whether it's about shooting or defense or
whatever.  
But I'm just excited to be playing there and we're very excited to be going to
San Antonio.  
  
Q. Can you give me a couple things what Jayne Appel has meant to the
program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Jayne is -- we call her -- she drives a bus. Jayne is
the real deal. She's a competitor. She's a very skilled player. She's a great
passer from the center position. She scores. She rebounds. She runs the floor.
She defends. And I think she really loves playing for Stanford. And I think
she'll do a great job this weekend.  
And just you saying that just made me kind of well up thinking the fact I'm
only going to coach her for two more games. And I will miss her dearly. She's
my two-on-two basketball partner when we play in Arizona. Down there we play
two-on-two, and we're undefeated.  
  
Q. Wonder if I could ask you to expand a little more on Necka, but
specifically defense, because I think that's something she's also improved a
lot on, and just talk about how much she's grown and learned in her two
years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We play a majority of our defense is player-to-player
defense. And so we need her to -- I think she's gotten good experience. We
need her to play against, usually, the 4. Whether that's sometimes Maya Moore,
whether that's Gilbreath in our conference or any number of different post
players. Last year it was Ashley Walker. She's played against really top
players. Necka is a competitor.  
She is very intellectual. She really takes things. She focuses and says, all
right, make this player go this way. Take away their strengths. She works very
hard at the defensive end of the floor, and I think she has improved a lot. I
think you're right.  
  
Q. It popped into my head sitting here watching ESPN seems as the expansion
on the men's side to 96 teams is a fait accompli, would that be a wise thing
for the women's game? And, if not, when do you think we could see reasonably
see a 96-team tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You say you think it is a done deal?  
  
Q. Apparently Jim Delany from the Big Ten said -- used the words probable
and likely.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think if they do it on the men's side they should do it at
the same time on the women's side, just in the fact that opportunities to play
in the NCAA tournament are really special. And if that's what's -- I think so
many people are losing their jobs because they maybe don't go to the
tournament.  
Maybe that is motivating in a positive way for women's basketball too. If they
were to go next year, I would hope women's basketball would do the same thing.  
  
Q. Do you think there are 96 good teams -- I mean, if you had a tournament
to decide a champion, do you think there are 96 teams that would be worthy of
playing in it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I do. You know, if you look at -- I mean, there are a lot --
I think there are teams in our conference that could have played in it and
competed very well in it. Because of the number of automatic bids, you know,
we played some closer games in our conference than we did against some of the
early rounds.  
So I think it would be -- if that's the decision in some ways people might say
it waters the tournament down, or maybe it's not as special. But I think that
we have to be open to change. And then once it's there, I don't think it will
ever come back. How many rounds would that be?  
  
Q. Apparently at least two.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Any play-ins first?  
  
Q. The format I've heard on the men's side is actually -- no, it would be
one more round. The format I've heard is the top 32 teams get a bye into -- I
guess to the regular 64 format, then the other 64 play.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that actually would be good. I think that would be
good. I think that would be good, actually, for women's basketball. Where you
wouldn't have like a tier one, like we're a 1 or Connecticut was a 1 or
playing a 96. But I think that would actually help women's basketball a lot.
And once you explain to me how they were going to do it, I think that would be
really, really good for women's basketball.  
  
Q. In what regard? How so?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Just in that that's one of the biggest problems we have is
developing that group of teams, those 64 teams. And it's not clear necessarily
that there are teams that are left out, and it's almost like the development
of the middle class of basketball, you know?  
Those are the teams that we need having incentive for and we need improving
and those teams that are on the bubble. So I think it would give them more
incentive, and we need women in the gym and offseason improving and getting
that experience because it's so positive that I think it's a big carrot that
could be used for teams and help develop our game.  
Even more so, I think the men's side, they're already there, so they're trying
to figure out who really deserves it, but for us it would really help us
develop it.  
  
Q. I know this game is a couple of years ago, and obviously the rosters have
changed and in particular for your team, Candice Wiggins has now moved on to
the pro ranks, but is there anything that your program can draw on from the
fact that you guys are the last team to beat UConn before they went on this
long run? Does it weigh at all into anything we're about to see over the next
couple of days?  
COACH VANDERVEER: If a rematch materializes, I think it helps people's
confidence on our team to be able to -- to know that they have been on the
winning side against Maya Moore or against Tina Charles.  
Now, these are different teams. But I think that when you go into a game like
that, I think that that would be helpful.  
I also think the fact that we're playing them and they have a great team and a
great program helps us get better.  
  
Q. The way the game transpired the other night, do you think that was kind
of a karma payback for some of the close losses you had in the regional finals
with Tennessee, maybe, and LSU?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't believe in that. But I think that, you know,
sometimes -- sometimes you're lucky. And that might have just been one of
those situations, and we're very fortunate to survive that game.  
And, I mean, I think Xavier gave us all we could handle, and there were a lot
of things that went wrong in that game, but it was really nice to have
something go right.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll ask Coach Mulkey for opening remarks, then we'll take your
questions and answers.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm doing my best to sell tickets. Being in the state of Texas,
we certainly want the people from Texas to show up. And San Antonio is a great
city of entertainment, and we're excited to be there.  
We're young, and we are a team that has had ups and downs throughout the
course of the year, with injury and suspensions. But we have everybody back
and healthy. And we're just excited.  
RICK NIXON: Questions.  
  
Q. There's been so much press, particularly lately, on Brittney and what
people think she will be, and people sort of placing already some sort of
historical comparisons on her. Can you give me a sense of how the coaching
staff has managed expectations, in particular expectations that sort of are
being thrown around externally, outside of your program?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I'm not sure, unless you give me specifics of what
expectations you're referring to. If you're talking about the great player and
playing above the rim and all that, I can comment on that.  
  
Q. I think people are just -- in terms of people sort of saying that she's a
chance to be the best player of all time, people comparing her to sort of like
having Bill Russell-like impact. There's sort of the building of her
reputation, at least outside of your program, is really growing, in particular
over the last couple of weeks.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I would agree with all of that, because, guys, I've been
around this business since I was 14 years old. I've played international ball.
Olympic ball. A little bit of all of it.  
I've played with some of the greatest players ever. And against some of the
greatest players ever. I've played with big players. Uliana Simanova
(phonetic), the kid from China, all these great big players who are in Hall of
Fames, but I've never been around a player like Brittney Griner that plays
above the rim and can effortlessly dunk it with either hand. She can goaltend,
and I think that she can be the greatest ever.  
But the thing that I will tell you quickly about Brittney Griner is she's
never won a championship. The other night against Duke was the first time the
young lady's ever had an opportunity to cut a net down.  
She will tell you she came to Baylor not to become the greatest basketball
player ever, she came to help win a championship. Because there's no greater
feeling. While she understands with her size and her ability come much
recognition, welcomed recognition, much attention, but Brittney is the same
kid today that she was before she started the season, that she was in high
school.  
She's like a sponge. She wants to win. She wants to get better. She doesn't
want to disappoint people. And she's just got that hunger and that presence
about her that I'm not sure sometimes if she really realizes how much
attention she's garnering right now.  
I think she's just always been a kid that's tall and can do some other things
that other kids can't do, and she just comes to play.  
  
Q. In a couple of press conferences you've called her a sweet child. And I
wonder if you can give us a story or two that just sort of amplifies her
sweetness.  
COACH MULKEY: She's a hugger. She's a hugger. As athletes, sometimes we do the
high-fives and we do the handshakes and we do the chest-butting, but Brittney,
when you greet her and you meet her and she knows you, she just has a smile on
her face and she wraps these long arms all around you, and she's a hugger.  
And then when you talk to her it's yes, ma'am and no, ma'am, and then when you
watch her spend countless hours of her own time doing autographs with little
kids and putting them in her lap and holding them up. She doesn't have to do
those things.  
But she enjoys doing them. And she understands that, you know, that's what
mannerly people do. And she's not any different in that she has a competitive
fire about her. But her mannerisms don't fit her body. Her mannerisms, if you
watch her play, even just watching her play, she has like a little sweet
softness about how she runs down the floor.  
I watched her so many times in high school, just take those arms and just wrap
them around her teammates in a huddle. And so she has a gentle side to her
that I think people just don't really realize that don't know her. They see
this big body, and she's just really gentle.  
  
Q. When we were in Memphis, you said you'd worry about Connecticut tomorrow.
Well, tomorrow's coming closer. I'm sure you probably watched last night. Just
your impressions of what your task is going to be on Sunday night?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, actually I didn't watch the game because, as you well
know, my family comes first. And my daughter had a softball game at that time,
and I knew that I could watch that game later and tape it. And that's what I
did. So I didn't see it live. I went to my daughter's softball game.  
What can I tell you that 37 other teams haven't already told you? We are up
against, I guess you'd say -- what is it? -- David versus Goliath. And I have
so much respect for what Connecticut has done. And I don't think there's
anything but positive to be written about that program.  
And we understand the challenge. We understand that we're not supposed to win.
We understand 37 other teams haven't won. We understand the win streak. But we
still have to play. And so we'll go out there and do like those other teams
did and just play hard and do the best that we can.  
  
Q. Just in terms of just some nuts and bolts, when you look at that team,
you talked about how you've been around the game since you were 14, can you
put this team in some kind of context with its talent?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I listened to what Geno says because I don't pretend to
know his team like he does. But from what he's said, he said this is not his
most talented team. I know this: This particular team is pretty darn good. And
nobody else has been able to beat them. And they're just darn good.  
And you try to think, well, maybe we can do this against them, and then they
expose this. Or maybe we can play this defense against them, and then they
expose you here. They're good individually. They're great collectively. And
when you add a team that is number one in the country in field goal percentage
defense, that has my attention more than anything they do on the offensive
end.  
I think the story of them being number one in field goal percentage defense
and Baylor being number two in field goal percentage defense sends a strong
message to recruits across the country.  
While we're going to help you make All-American teams and get to Final Fours,
when you come to these two programs, you're going to have to guard people.  
  
Q. One thing -- and I don't know if you've seen enough of Connecticut, but
watching the game last night, some of the commentators were mentioning the
fact that -- they can be up 20, 30 points and they're playing like they're
down 10. And is that one of the things that maybe is more maybe in the fact
that they haven't been challenged in a game, but it doesn't really matter what
the score is, they just seem to play at a high level no matter what the score
is?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, that starts with your coaching staff. I'm sure Geno
doesn't allow them to look at the scoreboard. You go play. And when you're
good, you don't have to look at a scoreboard. You just go play.  
And I think a lot of it is the competitor in you. A lot of it is they
understand the attention that they have received because of the win streak.
And at this point in the season, it's not about the win streak. Those kids are
trying to win a national championship.  
  
Q. How difficult or will it be difficult for you to convince your players
that we can win this game?  
COACH MULKEY: No. You don't even -- you go into a film room at this stage and
you're breaking down individual tendencies of players and the team and then
you go in and say here's what we're going to try to do, here's what we're
going to do.  
You don't at this point of the season need to do a bunch of rah-rah stuff and
say you can do it, it's David versus Goliath. These are grown women in a lot
of respects in that they've played enough games to be beyond the motivational
talks.  
And you've got to be in that film room and you've got to study the strengths
and weaknesses of who you're guarding and what we're trying to do and then
just leave it on that floor, just leave everything you have on that floor, and
that's what we'll do.  
  
Q. One other thing, just obviously Oklahoma is there. Two Big 12 teams.
Again, what does that say about the Big 12 conference? I know it's all been
said before, but the fact that getting half the Final Four in San Antonio, how
big a deal and how special is that?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it's very special. For those of us coaches in the Big 12
you're always proud to see your conference do well, because while we recruit
against each other, and we compete against each other in the league, we're
still a conference that can sell the league.  
And I think that to have two from the same conference playing in San Antonio,
particularly that both schools and their fans are within driving distance of
San Antonio, I would hope that Oklahoma and Baylor would have the most fans
there and appreciate that we're hosting in a region or an area that they can
come see them.  
  
Q. First, could you talk about how Brittney -- it seems to me she blocks
shots in a very intelligent way. She's not trying to swat them into the third
row. She's trying to keep the ball in play, which is a smarter way to do it
and she gets you more possessions that way. If you could sort of talk about
that philosophy, how she blocks shots. And then also about how your other
freshmen in particular have grown and how they're able to play with her in
terms of really relying on that force inside but also how well their defense
has improved during the course of the season?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think any coach can teach a player of Brittney's length
and height to block shots. She does that naturally. And the amazing thing is
Brittney doesn't get in foul trouble very much from blocking shots.  
And she's able to time it. She doesn't leave the floor until she sees the
opportunity to just go up and get it. And then also she's able to defend
differently than most because when most mess up defensively, they're playing
catch up. Brittney can play catch up and still block a shot.  
So her blocked shot, the way she's blocking shots is really Brittney's just
athleticism and timing. I think that other players around her, when a shot is
blocked, have learned to don't stand still, because that's like a turnover. Go
get that blocked shot off the floor like a loose ball and let's go and
transition and try to make something happen.  
If I remember the second part of your question, you may have to remind me of
what you said, but if it was about the other freshmen around her. A lot of
their progress has to be attributed to Melissa Jones' injury. We didn't have
Melissa Jones for the Big 12 conference except for maybe one and a half of a
game, and they were thrown into the mix. Not by choice, but because they had
to play.  
And now at the end of the year with Melissa Jones back in the lineup, I don't
hesitate to play them.  
  
Q. You mentioned this isn't the time you do a lot of rah-rah speeches, this
is really a lot of X and Os and basic film work, but it still strikes me that
part of facing UConn is not to succumb to the, oh, wow it's UConn and they
can't be beaten. That's really kind of the essence of your personality. Could
you talk about how you impart some of that or if you do in the course of
preparation?  
COACH MULKEY: That may be the case with some programs, is just the name UConn
is intimidating before you ever hit the floor. I really want to give UConn
more credit than that. Just the fact that they're so dang talented and good is
what's beating people.  
I just -- having been a player myself and going through an era at Louisiana
Tech that was the UConn of the '80s, and you had Tennessee after that and Old
Dominion before that, the players I played against weren't intimidated by
Louisiana Tech any more than we were intimidated by other teams.  
I just think that there's -- it's just the fact that they're good. It's not
that that streak or UConn, the name, bothers you; they're just darn good.  
  
Q. I know you maybe touched on this a little bit already. But if I can ask
you to draw upon all your experience once again, have you ever been in a
tournament or seen a tournament where a team like UConn was so dominant and
was so favored to run away with this?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. Gosh, man, I feel like I'm old having gone through
so many eras of good basketball. I guess not, because they hold the record for
most consecutive wins, and nobody's really come close to them. I was looking
at their scores of the teams that have come closest to them. When you can do
that for that period of time, you're pretty dominant.  
And when you're winning and you're good and you know you're good, man, that
snowballs into making you feel like you're even greater than you are. But the
thing that you gotta remember, guys, I don't care how good UConn is, one day
they will lose, just like Louisiana Tech lost when we held that 50-something-
game win streak. Tennessee, all those teams. It's inevitable.  
But I know this: They have my utmost respect. And, gosh, we're up to a
monumental challenge, and I just hope that we can keep it close.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Morghan Medlock's journey to this point and
could you talk about the courage that she's shown since she's been with you?  
COACH MULKEY: Morghan Medlock came on a visit, wanted to transfer from USC.
And like I do with all transfers, I sit down and we have lengthy
conversations. And I basically try to scare them away, because with transfers
you must understand they're all transferring for a reason.  
And if you're going to come into this program, you must understand what's
tolerated and what's not tolerated. And after having that conversation with
Morghan Medlock and her honesty of why she wanted to come here, it convinced
me that this is where she needed to be. And then when her mother was murdered
last year, without question Morghan Medlock was where she needed to be.  
And she has matured so much off the floor, not just because she's older now,
but because she understands life, and she understands basketball is just a
very small part of it. And it's been fun to watch her finish her senior year
experiencing something that she never got to experience, and that's a Final
Four. And being the only senior, it has to be a little more special for her.  
  
Q. If I could take you in a different direction. A couple seconds ago you
sort of in passing talked about the winning streak that you had at Louisiana
Tech and you mentioned Old Dominion and Tennessee and programs like that. Do
you have a fear that the history of this sport is kind of getting lost?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I don't. Not any more than my great-grandchildren won't know
who Michael Jordan is. That's what life's all about. It's change. It's
different eras. You just move on. And those that grew up during the Louisiana
Tech era will talk about it for a long time. Those that were there in Old
Dominion, the Immaculata era will share that with generations.  
But I really don't. I just think that with time comes change, and it's just
Connecticut's time and it's their era.  
  
Q. Could you break down the matchup, what you expect to see between Brittney
and Tina Charles?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I really can't break it down because, honestly, I'm still
studying films. But I can probably before we play them. I've spent so much
time just looking at the team itself, to break that matchup down it would be
more generic of you're dealing with, what, two big girls that are presence in
the paint. They're both great defensively. They block a lot of shots. And I
would imagine it's going to be a battle down there and very physical.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the teleconference you don't expect to win this game.
What did you mean by that and why? You said you didn't expect to win this
game.  
COACH MULKEY: No, I didn't say we didn't expect it. I said why would the
expectations be any different than the other 37. Nobody expects us to win this
game. We're going to go in and we're going to fight and we're going to do the
best we can and do our work and do -- just play as hard as we can and see what
happens.  
But you can't go into a game with a defeatist attitude. Who would want to play
for a coach who had that kind of attitude?  
You go in, you present things to your team that you think will help you or
will help put you in a position to win. But, no, I don't have a defeatist
attitude.  
  
Q. UConn obviously in so many of their games, even against top opponents,
they seem to get on huge runs where not only do they take a huge lead but the
opponent seems to lose a little heart, a little belief that they can play with
these folks. Is that going to be a point of emphasis for you guys just to, A,
stay out of that sort of position but also just not to lose heart if things
start to go south?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I hope I can have some timeouts left and help them there.
I hope we can just keep using as many timeouts as we can. In fact, I'm going
to ask Geno before the game if I can have his five timeouts, and if he'll give
me those, then I'll take 'em.  
But I don't know, guys, that I'm going to talk about the negatives. See, to me
that's a negative. Talk about the positive. Talk about what we do well. Here's
what they do well. Here's what you gotta do, in our opinion, to slow them down
and try to keep it close, and who knows what will happen.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what attributes Brittney has that you think can
make her the best player ever? Other than the fact that she plays above the
rim better than anybody ever has, what other things does she do well on the
court?  
COACH MULKEY: This may be the best thing I could say: When you go into a film
room and you're scouting your opponent, we all go, here's what we have to do,
look at her on film. Man, she's an impact here. Brittney Griner alters your
thinking and sometimes makes you completely change your style of play.  
And that probably sends a message as to why a lot of people think that she
will be one of the greatest to ever play the game, because she takes away some
of, if not a lot of, most team's strength.  
I've seen post players shoot the 3 ball the whole night and not post because
that's their strategy of how to get Brittney away from the goal. And not many
times are coaches willing to change what they do so good on the offensive end
because of one player. But, yet, I think a lot of coaches do that.  
  
Q. One other question, what do you appreciate about the way UConn plays
defense? You obviously play great defense because you're No. 2 in the country.
What do you appreciate about how they play the game defensively?  
COACH MULKEY: I said it earlier. It's not written about enough. I think one of
the big stories needs to be that they are the number one team in the country
in field goal percentage defense and Baylor is the No. 2 team in the country.  
If I was just a fan and didn't know anything about Connecticut and didn't know
anything about Baylor and I saw that stat, a true basketball fan would say: I
like those two coaches because they make those kids play both ends of the
floor.  
  
Q. But is there anything in particular they do well defensively?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, they're active. They're very active. They're very big. You
know, they have great help side. They have a post in there that blocks shots.
They get in passing lanes. They create a lot of their offense from turnovers.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
RICK NIXON: We're joined by Oklahoma Sooners head coach Sherri Coale. We'll
start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH COALE: Thank you, Rick. I appreciate it. Our basketball team is
incredibly honored to have earned the right to participate in the Final Four
in San Antonio, and we are very much looking forward to it after the
hospitality that we experienced in San Antonio in 2002. We know what a
fantastic job the city does in welcoming the NCAA championship and we can't
wait to get there and compete.  
And just really, really proud of this bunch of kids and looking forward to the
opportunity.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you kind of big picture, obviously first time the Big 12
has managed to get two teams to the Final Four, and I know all the time you
coaches are always talking about how great the conference is, and obviously it
is. But from a national standpoint, does this really kind of help underline
the fact that particularly this year the Big 12 is really tough considering
that Nebraska won the regular season and A &M won the tournament but two other
teams are in the Final Four?  
COACH COALE: I think if there were any doubters out there as to the difficulty
of our league, they've been made believers by just what's happened. I don't
know how you can look at that and not realize the depth and parity within our
league.  
And I think what we face on a Wednesday/Saturday basis in the Big 12
conference is what enables two teams like Baylor and ourselves to fight
through the NCAA tournament and end up in the Final Four competition that we
face regularly prepares us.  
  
Q. Also wanted to ask you, we talked to Tara and Geno about this, but I
guess Jim Delany, the Big Ten commissioner, said he thinks it's probable that
the men's will expand to 96. That's something that's been talked about quite a
bit. Do you think if the men's tournament expands to 96, is there a reason for
the women's tournament to expand? Are there enough teams deserving to be in a
96-team women's field if it gets to that?  
COACH COALE: No, we're not ready for it.  
  
Q. Your team's been playing real well late in the season, had a good run
through the conference tournament. But, in any sense, are you surprised you
guys are here?  
COACH COALE: No, absolutely not. Love this bunch. They've believed from day
one. Nothing they do has surprised me ever, on a daily basis or in the process
of a game, putting games together.  
We were talking as a staff -- I'm not sure we lost two games in a row all
year. We just -- we had the Connecticut-Nebraska stretch there in our season,
but other than that we've played incredibly tough competition and been able to
rebound and turn ourselves around.  
So this group has a special resolve about them. So, no, no surprise here.  
  
Q. Stanford's a pretty familiar tournament opponent for you as a coach and
your staff, but does this Stanford team look like some of the other ones
you've played? Is this a familiar system?  
COACH COALE: Yes, they're big and skilled and smart and, I must add, very well
coached.  
  
Q. I ask this kind of in jest, but do you think you guys will make the Final
Four when Connecticut is not on an undefeated run coming into the Final Four
at the same time?  
COACH COALE: I probably owe you an answer about Stanford from last night. I
apologize about that. You know, I don't know. I don't know. Somebody's gotta
beat Connecticut, somebody has got to stop the madness at some point. And I
don't know if it really matters if they're undefeated or not. They seem to
always be in the Final Four and they seem to always find their way into the
championship game.  
I don't know what our tournament would do without them. Since I've been
coaching, I think they've been in it but one year maybe. Maybe two. One.  
I don't know. They're really good and they're playing really well right now.  
  
Q. I'm working on a story about Amanda Thompson. Strikes me that she has
this kind of -- you talked about her being an old soul and the heart of a
lion. Just talk about she's been through a lot in terms of the shoulder
problems and just how she's grown up at Oklahoma and the type of player she is
right now.  
COACH COALE: Well, Amanda will be the first to tell you there isn't anything
that happens on the basketball court that's really hard for her because of
just things she's had to experience and get through in her life. This is a
Bowl. This is a game. While things may be challenging, nothing's really hard.
And I think that is revealed in the way that she plays.  
She is as sincere of a kid as I've ever worked with, just incredibly
coachable, a sponge. Wants to learn, wants to work, wants to get better. Wants
to do the right thing. And where she has really grown I think is in her
ability to lead people. She came here. She wanted to do the right thing all
the time. But she didn't necessarily want to demand it of everybody around
her.  
She was of the mindset I'm going to take care of my business and what you do
is entirely up to you. And so sometimes teaching kids to learn how to demand
the same from the people around them as they demand from themselves is as
tough as anything. Kids fight that sometimes.  
A.T. didn't. It was hard for her. But she didn't fight it and she's become an
exceptional leader on our team.  
  
Q. Sherri, you had the opportunity to play Baylor three times a year, twice
during the regular season and once in the championship. What did you see out
of Brittney Griner? Could you give us a scouting report, what you expect?  
COACH COALE: As impactful as she is on the offensive end, it's the defensive
end where I think she makes the biggest difference.  
I think we can all put together some schemes to keep the ball away from
really, really talented post players. I shouldn't say keep the ball away, but
to minimize the touches of really talented post players, whether you sag or
you double or you go on a catch or you go on the bounce or you zone. There's a
million different things you can do.  
That doesn't mean you're going to keep her from scoring baskets. You can
minimize and maybe neutralize a little bit. On the defensive end it's a
conundrum, because she can stand in the middle of a lane and block your shock
outside the elbow. And I'm not exaggerating, there's no hyperbole there. It's
really, really hard to get to the basket.  
So at the end of the day to beat Baylor, you're going to have to make some
outside shots. And you're going to have to not turn the ball over and you're
going to have to not be impacted emotionally and mentally once you block
shots, because until you've been on the floor with it, it's a really, really
hard thing to handle. And the first time we played against them, it took us by
surprise.  
And, you know, you prepare for it. You watch film. You test out -- if you're
tall and you try to replicate it as best you can. And you just can't. And the
more we were on the floor with it, the better I think we got at dealing with
her defensive presence. But it's a different deal.  
  
Q. You had a chance to play UConn earlier in the season. Is there anything
you've seen from that team watching the film, heading into the Final Four,
lately that gives your team a better idea of what to do to try to defeat
them?  
COACH COALE: Again, I think there's no substitute for being on the floor with
your foe. There's maybe a mystique that can be dismantled. There's the
confidence that grows from being on the floor with an opponent. So I think
maybe experience is the best teacher there.  
  
Q. This Final Four is a homecoming for Lyndsey Cloman. Can you just talk
about how she's grown this season and the contributions that she's made to
your team?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, you know, Lyndsey is like most freshmen when they come into
college and they've played every minute of their high school careers and
they've been the go-to and the horse that their team has ridden.  
She doesn't get to play very much and it was difficult for her. I think like
most incoming freshmen, they have to adjust to a new role as well as a new
pace and an entirely different style of basketball. More knowledge than their
brain could take at a given time.  
It's like they're thirsty for a drink and you're spraying them with a water
hose. Lyndsey did a great job of learning how to be, first and foremost, an
excellent teammate. And then, secondly, but just as important, a learner every
day in practice. And she has continued over the last month, especially. She's
continued to learn and grow, and you start to see a buildup of some of that
attention paid and reps, experience throughout the year.  
She's making the most of the time with Abi and learning from her and pushing
her and being a great teammate with Abi. And I think Lyndsey really has a
chance to help us. I really like the way she's embraced her role over the last
month or the last six to eight weeks, I should say.  
  
Q. You talked about the San Antonio and the hospitality here. What makes
this -- specifically what makes this a great venue for the Final Four and do
you see San Antonio being in the mix for this event for years to come?  
COACH COALE: Boy, I hope so. And I'll tell you this: We were fortunate enough
to be in the Final Four in 2002. And I talked to some men's coaches after
that. And, you know, without fail, the men's coaches that I spoke to said the
best city in America to have the Final Four in is San Antonio.  
So I think we were a little bit spoiled, that being our only experience there,
we were a little bit spoiled, and I think it comes from a couple of things.
Number one, the weather is usually fantastic. And the atmosphere that
surrounds the Riverwalk. It's just festive and it presents opportunities for
the charm of the tournament to really grow.  
You know, you go up and down the Riverwalk and people are wearing their colors
and yelling "Boomer Sooner" and whatever the Huskies do. Do they bark?
Whatever. It's conducive to that thing that makes collegiate athletics so
special.  
And last but not least the hospitality, the people there. The city of San
Antonio loves basketball. You can tell. And everybody in the city -- here's
the most impressive thing. I've been to Final Fours not as a participant but
as a coach attending a convention and a championship all over the United
States. And you go in some cities and three-fourths of the people don't know
what's going on in their city.  
I didn't encounter one individual in San Antonio who said, Now why are you
here? Everybody would say, oh, you must be here for the women's championship.
That was a cool feeling.  
  
Q. My question is about Geno, someone who you know very well and have
coached against many times. In terms of looking historically among the coaches
in the women's game, where would you rank him at this point?  
COACH COALE: He's the best.  
  
Q. Absolute, he's the best?  
COACH COALE: I don't think there's any question.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH COALE: His consistency. The high bar that he sets and the demands that
he makes on his kids. Excellent recruiter. Recruits kids who can and will play
the way he wants to play. And that's the magic, in my opinion, of recruiting,
getting the kids that you want to coach who can play the way you think the
game ought to be played.  
And I think it's really, really hard to maintain the edge that his team's
maintained through all of the success that they've experienced, and I think
that's probably his gift at the end of it all.  
  
Q. First, you and Kim are more or less contemporaries, and I can't remember
when you started at your respective schools, but you've been there for a
similar length of time. Could you talk about how Kim has built the Baylor
program?  
COACH COALE: Again, she's recruited kids who can play the way she wants to
play. Her teams are very hard-nosed, very tough. She's had star after star. I
think of Sheila Lambert and Sophia Young. I think of Brittney Griner. I throw
Tisdale in that mix, too. I love that point guard. I thought she was
fantastic.  
Kim always seems to have a heady, tough point guard and been a superstar. She
built her teams that play in a similar way to the way that she played, tough
and smart and unrelenting.  
And I think she's done it by going after those kind of kids who flourish in
that environment.  
  
Q. I wonder if you would elaborate on your statement about the women's field
is not quite ready for 96 teams. Tara VanDerveer mentioned earlier a couple of
hours ago -- said she thought an expansion might sort of -- I want to make
sure I get it right -- either help the middle class of women's basketball or
establish one. If that makes sense.  
COACH COALE: Well, I have a very strong opinion about it. I don't think it's
good for the men's game. How could you -- why would you touch what just
happened in the men's tournament?  
I'm speechless to even respond to it. How could you ask for a better sporting
event than what's just occurred? And you look at our women's tournament and
we've had all kinds of close games and victories at the end and overtimes.
We're getting it. We're figuring it out.  
And I think anytime you expand that field, what you're doing is a couple of
things. Number one, watering down what happens. And, number two, you're sort
of defeating what you're trying to accomplish with parity in terms of
competitive games and earning the right to be in something special.  
And I'll tell you, I just feel very strongly that getting into the tournament
is something that you earn over the course of a season. And I don't think that
just everybody should get to go.  
You know, I'm about to go on the soapbox about my daughter's third place
soccer trophy in the garage. I won't go there. I'll spare you. But I just
think that getting an invitation to go means you have accomplished something.
And the wider and broader we make that field, maybe the less significant that
accomplishment.  
  
Q. Speaking of trophies, who is going to get possession of the homemade
trophy?  
COACH COALE: Oh, that one goes in the locker room. That one will stay in the
locker room until it disintegrates from old age.  
  
Q. Nyeshia last night, what kind of jet fuel was she on? The couple of
steals she had at mid-court -- I know the other team, Kentucky, was supposed
to be quick. I know she played really well in Kansas City, but she seemed,
last night, to just be going to another gear.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I would agree with you. And I have no idea why I didn't
feed her whatever I fed her earlier. I think she just -- she just realized
that she had an early drive to the basket and just short-armed a layup. And I
think she realized on that drive -- and we've had this conversation during
countless games throughout the year, you can get to the rim, you can get to
the rim. And she'll shake her head in agreement. But there's not really a buy-
in there, a belief.  
And when I told her at the timeout last night you can do that every time and
you will make that layup, I saw in her eyes that she understood that she could
do that.  
And it became a priority for her. And interesting, because her first year as a
freshman, the ball came out of her hand a different way every single time she
shot it. Her perimeter shooting touch was not very good. And that's probably
being kind.  
And so what she did was she got to the rim and she got to the rim and she got
to the rim, and then she worked on her shot and she became the 3-point shooter
that I couldn't convince to get to the rim.  
And so finally, over the course of this past year and a half, she's realized
how to put those two things together and how one can complement another. And
she just got in the gear last night. There were a couple of plays in the open
floor where she came up with a rebound or came up with a deflection, turned
into a steal, and dribbled past two Kentucky players who were running full
speed, without a ball. And these guys aren't slow.  
I mean, their team is very athletic. So maybe she's realized there is still
yet another gear and we'll see that a couple more times.  
  
Q. When she's improved her outside shot and the ability to get to the rim,
is this one of those things that just maybe right now in her career where
everything's kind of crystallized into saying, hey, I've kind of got -- I've
got the package here and I can sort of, you know, do whatever the defense
gives me?  
COACH COALE: Nyeshia is one of those cases where when we signed her at the
University of Oklahoma she was really raw. She was an athlete who had a very,
very limited skill package. And she has grown and progressed as much as any
kid I've ever had in our program.  
But I don't think she's playing as good of -- I don't think she's playing as
well as she's going to play at the next level. I think she's probably piqued
the interest of a lot of WNBA coaches. She's one of those where you can't
afford to not take a look at her, because if there's this other level up
there, it could be something really special.  
And I think she's given us some glimpse of that. And the thing about Nyeshia,
she's learned how to work at a really high level. And with all that
athleticism and that skill that she's developed, accompanied with the work
ethic, she can still do some things.  
  
Q. To talk a little bit more about Nyeshia, she seems to have grown from
this player that a couple of years ago really didn't want the ball in her
hands when the game was on the line to a player that's kind of carried you the
last two games. Could you talk about the heart of Nyeshia, what you've seen
her grown as a player this year, particularly?  
COACH COALE: Well, it's been a progression of four years, obviously. She had
to learn how to listen first, and then she had to learn how to do things that
are hard. And this is interesting in that it seems over the years the kids
that have been the toughest to teach in terms of effort, you can play so much
harder than you're playing right now. The kids that I've battled with over the
years end up in their senior years to be the kids that find this other
ethereal plane where they just get after it.  
I think of Laneisha Caufield. Everybody knows how hard Caufield played down
the stretch in her senior year. I fought her as hard as any kid I've ever
fought early on in her career, saying you can't take possessions off. You have
to play harder. Laura Andrews, another kid who just thought she was playing as
hard as she possibly could. And then when she figured out, hey, there's this
other gear, became just an unbelievably hard-nosed player for us in her senior
year. So Nyeshia's progression is not unlike those of the two players I just
explained.  
She figured out it hurts, it always hurts to go to that next level. But she's
not going to die, and the result of having gone there and performed there is
worth all the pain and then some. And now she loves it. She loves competing
like that.  
  
Q. Coming into the season everybody was saying no Courtney or Ashley Paris,
no chance at a Final Four. Then when Whitney gets hurt absolutely no chance at
a Final Four. Was there ever a time when anybody on this team thought that
that still couldn't be accomplished?  
COACH COALE: I really don't think so. I go back to the day after or the
afternoon immediately following the game when Whitney tore her knee up. And
when I called the team together, just the look in their eyes, I can't say they
looked at me with complete conviction that we're going to the Final Four, but
they looked at me believing that we could become special.  
They knew it would take a while. But they believed that the end result, if
everybody bought in and did what they were supposed to do and what was
expected of them, that we could become extraordinary.  
And I say that "if," because that was the thing. And they looked at each other
with an honesty and sincerity and kind of here's where you make the choice,
the line in the sand has been drawn, either we all buy in completely, 100
percent to taking care of our business and we be extraordinary, or we don't
and it's over.  
And it was that look of really just stripped down pure honesty -- I can't
think of a better way to describe it -- that made me know that we had a chance
to do something special.  
  
Q. Can we just -- your first impressions of a matchup with Stanford, and I
know this Final Four there's going to be a lot of focus on big players, Tina
and Brittney, certainly, and then Stanford's got its big players inside, but
what's your first impressions of a matchup?  
COACH COALE: Well, the first thing I think of when I think of Stanford is a
multitude of weapons. They never come in and just have one or two guys that
lead them in scoring. They always have balance. They always play well
together. They're very disciplined, very methodical about what they do, a very
rhythmic offense.  
So the charge, I think, is always to disrupt them in some way. And that's a
lot easier said than done.  
  
Q. With 4.4 seconds on the clock, would you go the length, would you call
timeout, what would you have done?  
COACH COALE: I'll tell you what, it depends on your personnel, it depends on
the situation, it depends on your opponent and what you've seen from them all
night long.  
We have plays that we practice all the time, length of the floor. We have, if
they let you get it in, dribble across half court, one dribble across half
court and pick it up call timeout. We have a quick hit from the sidelines. It
depends on what you have in your package and what your kids feel comfortable
with.  
I think the most important thing at that juncture in a game, whether it's 4.4
or 2.3 or 7, it doesn't really matter, but when you've got the ball with
seconds to go, most important thing is that your kids feel confident about
what you ask them to do.  
And if you go out there and you draw something that they've never done before
and they're the least bit confused or uncomfortable, you're not going to be
successful.  
So I think it's much more their confidence level and their comfort level than
the exact thing that you diagram to do.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
RICK NIXON: We're joined by Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma. We'll start
with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Wow, it's been kind of a whirlwind 48 hours, getting back last
night and spending a couple of minutes with some of the players here today and
going over the schedule coming up. No matter how many times you've been in
this, it never ceases to amaze me the intensity level that you try to squeeze
in in such a short period of time and how quickly it gets on top of you and
how quickly all of a sudden you've got to get to a place and get ready for a
game. And, yet, every coach in America hopes and prays for being in that
situation.  
I'm very fortunate, as is my staff and my players. We had an incredible run at
the regionals. And we're tired, I'm sure, from getting in late last night, but
we can't wait to get on the plane tomorrow and go to San Antonio and get ready
to play on Sunday night.  
So that's where I am, and I'm sure that's where Kim and Tara and Sherri are.  
RICK NIXON: Questions.  
  
Q. Just want to ask you about Brittney Griner. What do you think about her
as a player and her future?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I haven't had the chance to watch Brittney play an awful
lot, either at a distance or up close. You know, you tend to spend a lot more
time with teams that you know are on your schedule.  
But I was watching a couple of their games today, and from what I've seen
briefly and from what I've been able to put together, obviously there's no one
like her in the game today. I think she's on the tip of everyone's tongue when
it comes to conversations about what is one of the most exciting things that's
happening in the game of women's basketball.  
And I think she's improved tremendously from when I saw her in high school, in
just a short period of time. And I don't think there's been anyone that young
that's been able to impact games as much as she's had the ability to do,
especially in the NCAA tournament and the Big 12 tournament as well. And I
would like to think that her future is -- like maybe Yogi Berra would say, her
future is still ahead of her. She's only going to get better. She's only going
to get better. If she's this good now, it's scary how good she'll be when she
gets a little more experience and a little more mature.  
  
Q. Can you give us your perspective on your lengthy winning streak versus
national championships, and I guess it boils down if you had a choice between
an 88-game winning streak or national championships, if you could only have
one, which would it be?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's easy. I mean, national championships are what define, I
think, players and coaches. In the end, that's the prize that everyone that
coaches a team or plays on a team strives for.  
I think winning streaks are a byproduct of doing the things you feel like you
need to do to win the ultimate prize, which is the national championship. I
guarantee you, if we were fortunate enough to win a national championship, my
team would be celebrating a lot more than celebrating whatever streak happens
to be going on at that time.  
And I'm exactly the same way. I don't think anything can take the place of
winning a championship.  
  
Q. I've got a question for you about possibility of expanding the
tournament. Jim Delany was quoted today in the USA Today saying that expansion
on the men's side -- the words that were used were probable and likely. Do you
think that would be a good idea for the women's field to go to 96 at some
point soon?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, when you look at the rationale, like what's
the rationale for the men's team, for the men's tournament going to 96, is
there because there are 96 teams that are worthy of being in the tournament,
or does it make sense on some other level?  
I don't know. If you take the rationale are there 96 teams in America that
have proven over the course of a year that they should compete for the
national championship, I would say no.  
I haven't seen it. That doesn't mean that it's not going to happen or it
doesn't mean it should or it shouldn't. If you ask me in my personal opinion,
I have not seen that there are 96 teams that could compete for the national
championship in women's basketball.  
Maybe someday there will be. I just don't see it right now.  
  
Q. If I could follow that up, I asked Tara the same question about an hour
or so ago, and she felt that what a 96-team tournament could do would -- I'm
paraphrasing her; I hope I'm getting her words exactly right -- she said it
would help the middle class of women's basketball, those teams that are sort
of on the bubble, but it might help make the whole field better.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're talking about almost doubling the field. I mean, okay,
so actually by a third, I guess. But if you're asking me -- I think there's
two different questions here. If you're saying from a competitive standpoint,
does it make sense because you would improve the field, because there's that
many teams that are that good that are being left out, I would say no.  
If you're doing it for other reasons, you're trying to grow the game, you're
trying to make coaches feel like we've accomplished something, you're trying
to give kids that experience, you know, it's like going into a Bowl system.  
Do that many teams deserve to be in a Bowl game? Because they've had great
seasons. I don't know. If you're saying for the experience of the college
student-athlete, sure. I'm all for that. I'm all for that.  
I think it's the same thing that we do in the Big East tournament. We allow
all 16 teams to come to the Big East tournament, because I think it's the
right thing to do, from an experience standpoint, of kids experiencing the
tournament.  
But if you're asking me from a competitive standpoint, does it make the field
better, I would say no.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can just give us a breakdown, a sort of specific
breakdown how you handle the scouting for Baylor. Was there a coach assigned
to the previous game? Would you assign certain coaches to look at certain
things on each of their teams? Do you do everything as a staff? I mean,
obviously, without giving away trade secrets, how do you approach the scouting
of a Final Four opponent, in particular one that you haven't seen a lot of?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think when the brackets come out, you know that there's
potentially -- if you're going to play six games, you know you're looking at
what the matchups are, and these are the possible opponents. And at that point
in time, the coaching staff starts to divvy up who is going to take which
opponents.  
And then you go from there. So Shea Ralph had the main responsibility of
Florida State, and now Chris Dailey has Baylor, because that's the way it
played out. That doesn't mean that everybody else is doing nothing. That's
just kind of the way it plays out.  
The same thing will happen for the other two teams if we're fortunate enough
to win. Somebody's already involved in breaking down those two teams. So you
can't wait until the last minute. It's been ongoing.  
This is not the first time that our coaches have been looking at Baylor.
You're doing that even before the brackets come out, to a certain extent. As
the season started to wear down, late February, early March, our coaches are
starting to look at teams around the country we haven't seen a lot of and
starting to watch them play.  
Like, for instance, we had watched Nebraska play. Even though they got knocked
out. You know, we wanted to be at least a little bit involved with who they
are, because we have never played them, we had not seen them.  
So that's something that I think our staff has been doing all along, and I'm
sure everybody else is doing a similar thing, maybe not in the same way.  
  
Q. Just curious, just your opinion on what this great streak of your guys
has done for the game. Has it really helped draw interest and excitement for
the sport, and can you see where fans might also say they're winning by so
much, things are kind of predictable right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're with the Wall Street Journal?  
  
Q. I am.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Have you ever covered women's basketball before?  
  
Q. Certainly have.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's not a normal thing for the Wall Street Journal to do.  
  
Q. Yeah, but we do sports now.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm using it to illustrate there's a lot of different entities
right now that are asking questions about the game that didn't ordinarily ask
those questions, and the fact that the questions are being asked means that
there's a certain level of interest in that the game on Sunday coming up
between us and Baylor, I gotta believe there's a lot of people interested to
see who wins that game.  
And I gotta believe there's an awful lot of interest in who wins the
Stanford/Oklahoma game, because if we were to win, then they're going to get a
shot at knocking Connecticut off.  
So as the tournament has gone on, I think there's tremendous interest in what
we're doing, and I think it's all because of the streak or because of what
we've done. So I like to think of it that way. Obviously there's enough people
that think the other way, that for whatever reason we're pushing people away
from the game or we're not helping the game grow.  
That's not my job. That's not what I get paid for, to help grow the game of
women's basketball. I get paid, and my job is to make sure that my team is the
best that it possibly can be. All the other coaches in America, it's their
responsibility to do the best that they can with the team that they have. So
there's nothing I can do about it except go about doing what I'm doing.  
The rest will take care of itself. But I don't think anybody can say, if
they're being really objective, that, hey, being this good is bad. I guess
only in America could you make comments like that. And people are making those
comments and there's nothing I can do about it.  
  
Q. Number one, the 40-point win over Florida State, the great first half
against Temple, the really wide margins in the tournament, is this an accurate
barometer of how well your team is playing or something that should be
discounted? And, secondly, when was the first time that your staff took a look
at Baylor? How long ago was that and maybe how much do you think they've
changed since then?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that the scores in the tournament are the scores. I
don't think there's -- we don't sit there in the locker room and put a point
number on the board and say, you know, today I think we're going to win by 30
or today we're going to win by 40. The scores just happen to be the scores.  
  
Q. I guess my question was are they there because you're playing really well
right now as opposed to --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I could say we're playing really well. The alternative
is to say we just played four teams that suck, and that's not the case. So
we're playing at a really high level right now. And defensively we're playing
really well. We're making a lot of shots.  
And you put those two things together, and we have some experience. We've been
in the tournament. We've got kids that this will be their third Final Four.
We've got kids that won a national championship last year.  
Yeah, Caroline is struggling because this is her first tournament. Kelly
Faris, this is her first time through this. But most of the other guys,
they've been through this. So we're playing with some experience, some know-
how, and the scores are the scores.  
As far as Baylor, I mean, I saw them play earlier in the season, and it's not
easy when you're bringing somebody in like Brittney who has the ability to
just change everything that you're doing.  
You almost have to build your team in a completely different way than what
you're used to doing. So it's going to take some time. And I just -- I just
think they've changed tremendously since the beginning of the year. And
they're still changing. Somebody asked me, hey, Iowa State beat them by a lot,
you beat Iowa State by a lot, so I'm the first to infer that we're going to
beat Baylor by a lot; it doesn't work that way.  
They're a team that now, on any night that they play anybody, as they proved
in the Tennessee game, are capable of winning that game, and a lot of it has
to do with how much Brittney has grown as a person, as a player.  
  
Q. Maya said the other day one of the most difficult parts of the NCAA
tournament is trying to balance the incredible focus on basketball with a
sincere effort towards her academics. Could you talk about how pleased you are
with how your team has handled that as a whole?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it is hard. That's why it wears on kids. It doesn't wear
on you if you don't care about school. If you're just disinterested or just in
college to play basketball, it doesn't wear on you.  
But if you're a kid who takes their schoolwork seriously and you're a
conscientious kid that goes to class and puts the time in, now all of a sudden
you're on the road all the time, you're missing classes, you're under the gun,
then to get it done or when you get back or before you leave, I think it's an
incredible strain on student-athletes.  
I really admire and really appreciate how hard these kids have to work that
are in the NCAA tournament. All the teams. And I think that's a big part of
why college basketball is so special, because you've got kids trying to
balance both of those things.  
And if you tell everybody, hey, we didn't play well in the NCAA tournament,
but our kids, you know what, they managed to keep up their grade point
average, like anybody cares. It's all about winning.  
I think what's lost in all that is the incredible obligation that these kids
have and how they manage to balance it is pretty incredible. They should be
saluted for that.  
  
Q. After the 2002 season when you guys played Oklahoma, you made a comment
that they've been running on the video highlights of the NCAA tournament about
you thought Oklahoma was the next program to arrive on the national scene for
women's basketball. Having gotten to the second consecutive Final Four, what's
your thoughts on the OU program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's the same as -- my thoughts are the same as they were in
2002. You've got a good, young coach that came in there, tremendously excited
and motivated and willing to do it the right way, and a great administration
that supported her. And here they are.  
Ever since 2002 they've been a national player. They've been a program that
people talk about when it comes time to talk about the ten or so top programs
in the country. And I'm not surprised one bit with where they are right now
and what they're doing, and it won't surprise me if ten years from now they're
doing the exact same thing.  
It's further proof that you can grow the game. You've just got to hire the
right people, give them the resources, nurture them a little bit. Oklahoma's
got a great athletic director. They've got a great athletic department. And
they put the right people in place and they are where they are.  
If more schools decided that they wanted to do that because they had the
ability to do that, then we wouldn't be asking questions about is the game
going to grow, is it not going to grow, has it gotten better, has it not
gotten better.  
They're a perfect example of what can happen in a short period of time. And
I'm not the least bit surprised at where they are or what they're doing.  
  
Q. This is a perfect lead-in, because seems to me Baylor is the same way.
That's a program that was nothing in the national women's basketball scheme.
Came in, they've won a national championship. Going to a second Final Four.
What you said earlier this week or a few days ago about how important that
was, it was just a bottom line commitment thing, do you see Baylor as a
similar situation?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Absolutely. Absolutely. There's absolutely very little
difference in the Oklahoma situation and the Baylor situation in terms of
schools getting behind their program, hiring coaches that are committed to
winning and doing it right, and then giving them the tools that they need to
be successful.  
That's the formula for success. I think what I said might have been a little
bit misconstrued that everyone should aspire to be where Baylor and Oklahoma
is right now. That's not what I mean. If you're a school of limited resources
and limited facilities and whatever, you can't be where Baylor and Oklahoma
and Connecticut and Stanford are right now. But you certainly can be better
than where you are if you aspire to be.  
And at places like Oklahoma and Baylor, they aspire to be in the Final Four
and win national championships and compete at the highest level. And that's
why they're doing it.  
That's the model a lot of schools should be using to make their programs
better. Find the right coach, give them what they need. Nurture and grow in
your community, and you're going to wake up one day and be in the Final Four.
If you do that and after a couple of years you don't see any progress, get rid
of the coach or whoever is running your women's basketball program and start
over again.  
But to just sit there and have the status quo over and over and over again, I
don't think Oklahoma or Baylor would be where they are right now if they just
kept on doing business the way they were doing it before.  
So they're to be commended and be admired and be emulated.  
  
Q. You've been able to motivate this team even in games -- and they're
motivating themselves even in games where the opposition really just does not
match up. Is this sort of -- I don't want to say fun, but sort of an
exhilarating experience because there is so much attention on Griner and how
well she's played, and especially is that a challenge that it seems that your
players will most especially want to face?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think every player, every coach loves a challenge. I don't
know anybody that's in this field or competitive field that doesn't like
challenges. And my players are no different than anyone else.  
And what I've tried to teach them along the way is that the challenge isn't
Brittney Griner. The challenge wasn't Florida State or anyone else that we may
play in the future.  
The challenge is to play really, really well and to play at a really high
level. Now, when that's your challenge and you throw in now, okay, well,
here's the obstacle to that challenge, now obviously kids are like even more
motivated, even more alert and receptive to what you're saying coaching-wise.  
And my guess is that when that's in front of you, you have a tendency to play
better than you would otherwise. Believe me, that's what I'm counting on. I'm
counting on the fact that we're playing a really good team with a really good
coach and a unique player in the Final Four. And that in and of itself is
something that every great player would say, wow, that's the arena I want to
be in. That's why I came to Connecticut.  
  
Q. Earlier you made mention yourself that Brittney Griner is the type of
player who changes the way opposing offenses will play. And Kim Mulkey said
earlier on the phone call she noticed that quite a bit with the teams she
played, that other teams try to do different things because she's there. My
question is not so much necessarily what you guys will do differently, but how
do you resist the temptation to try to do something differently, given the
success you've had?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the problem that a team might have would be to go in
and revamp everything you're doing just to accommodate that one individual.
And I think what that does, then, is tells your team, listen, everything that
we've done up to this point is not good enough. Now we've got to do things
differently.  
And I think that's a bad message to send to your team. I think all along the
way, these last four or five months of practice, or in games, we've played a
certain way that includes whether we're going to play five guards, five big
guys, a team that walks it up the floor, a team that runs up and down, a team
that has a 5'8" center and a team that has a 6'8" center.  
So you hope along the way you're doing things in practice or you're working on
things that when you do have this opportunity in front of you, you can talk to
your kids about, hey, listen, remember when we did this? Well, this is how
we've got to do it now. Okay?  
You point out subtle changes, subtle things, and we do that for every game. We
did things a little bit differently for Florida State than we did for Temple.
But nothing that we hadn't done already before. So I understand what Kim is
saying. You can go look at a team out there and say this team is struggling
against us because that's not the way they normally play.  
I think a coach has to make some tough decisions there and you've got to be
careful the message that you're sending to your team.  
  
Q. You have Brittney, obviously a big factor in this, but Baylor has the No.
2 field goal percentage defense in the country, and it's something that your
program has had, obviously being No. 1, is not really talked about that much
this year is the defense. I know you take a lot of pride in the defense and
the players take a lot of pride in the defense. How different will that be to
play where it will probably be a little bit more of a defense-oriented game
this Sunday?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's what happens when you get to the Final Four. There's
not that many bad defensive teams left playing in the final weekend. The
reason you're playing in the final weekend is because you're good defensively
and you're good offensively and you're well balanced and you're well coached
and all those things.  
So we're going into this weekend knowing that the teams we're going to be
playing are really good on both ends of the floor. Yeah. Baylor is a heck of a
defensive team. 14 or 15 shots every night never make it to the rim. That's
pretty good defense, isn't it?  
So I remember when we had Carol Walters and Rebecca Lobo. We were blocking
that many shots every night. It's incredible the kind of defensive numbers you
can put up when you're doing that.  
So points are going to be at a premium this weekend, for all four teams. It's
not going to be easy to score a lot of points, and the team that does make
shots and the team that does score is probably the team that wins.  
And because we score so many points, you're right, people don't talk about our
defense that much, which is fine. You know? Because I'd rather them try to
figure out how to stop us than how to score on us.  
  
Q. I want to ask you: How much do you let your team celebrate or acknowledge
what they've accomplished? And is there ever a point where you tell your team
that, you know something, you're arguably the best team in the history of
women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never said that. I've never said that they're the best
team in the history of college basketball, women's basketball. And I have to
make sure I mention women's basketball.  
Bob Huggins left me a nasty voice mail saying that I said at one time that we
were the best team in college basketball, men or women. I guess he was tired
of fighting with his team; he wants to fight with me now. So we had a big
laugh about that.  
So I always want to make sure, hey, I never said my team was the best team in
the history of college women's basketball. I still don't say that to them. And
if they say that to themselves, I have no control over that.  
I let them celebrate every day. Every day is a celebration with my team. They
celebrate how good they are, they celebrate how hard they play, they celebrate
how much they enjoy each other and playing the game the way they love playing
it. They celebrated last night. They celebrated the Temple win. They
celebrated winning the Big East championship.  
You know, I talked to them in the locker room before the Iowa State game. I
said no matter how many times you've been in this locker room, no matter how
many times you've been in the NCAA tournament or how many times you've been in
the regionals, don't ever take it for granted and make sure you appreciate
just how hard it is to get here, no matter who you are.  
We're not here sitting here looking at the streak and looking at how many
games we win and pretending that none of it matters except the next thing.
Now, it's not like that at all.  
We're celebrating everything every day. And maybe that's why we are able to
keep doing it, because we're not obsessed with what's next. I want them to
celebrate, because it's going to end. It's going to end Sunday or it's going
to end Tuesday. It's going to end.  
And for my seniors it's going to end right after Tuesday, because they're
leaving. They're not playing any more games at Connecticut. I want there to be
a lot of celebrating on a regular basis.  
  
Q. Obviously this game is Baylor against UConn, but I think a lot of the
attention is going to be focused in the paint with Brittney and Tina. How do
you look at that matchup? And has Tina ever played, faced a shotblocker like
that before?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, when Tina was a freshman and a sophomore, she
played against Sylvia Fowles who is as good as any center who played in
college basketball in all the years that I've been coaching. And Tina really
struggled against Sylvia and Tina outplayed Sylvia and won against Sylvia.  
So Tina's been on both ends of it where Sylvia totally dominated Tina and Tina
beat Sylvia and won the game. How is this going to be? You know, it's like the
stock market. When people ask you to buy from a stock broker, past performance
is no guarantee of future success. Whatever happened in the past happened. And
just because you play great against Sylvia doesn't mean that you're going to
play great this time, but if you struggled doesn't mean you're going to
struggle.  
It's its own matchup. Brittney poses different problems than Sylvia did and
Tina poses certain issues for Brittney that no one else has that she's played
against this year.  
But the game isn't going to hinge on Brittney Griner and Tina Charles. A game
generally never does hinge on one matchup between two people, as intriguing as
it may be. Both of them could play great and their team lose. Both could play
lousy and their team win. I prefer to make it Connecticut versus Baylor and
the matchup is the matchup, and hopefully they'll both play great.  
  
Q. How do you prepare for a shotblocker like that who has controlled the
paint? And even from a team's standpoint, that's, I think, where you get a lot
of your points.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, again, you have two choices. You can either stop going
in there and get away from everything that you've done all year long, or keep
doing what you've been doing all year long.  
And we're going to keep doing what we've been doing all year long. And if I
didn't do that, my players would lose respect for me. We're going to play the
way we play. I'm sure they're going to play the way they play. They're going
to have to find an answer for us and we're going to have to find an answer for
them, whatever that is.  
  
Q. A lot has been made of comparing teams and everything. But don't you
think it's kind of unfair to compare this team to others that you had because
this one is not done yet, this one is one national championship, they're on
this long winning streak, but it's not done. So is it hard to -- unfair to
compare this team to some of your other teams?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I agree with you 100 percent on that. That's why I never
do it. But I'm pressed on it all the time, obviously.  
But when it's all said and done, whatever happens this weekend, good, bad,
whatever, down the road we'll look back and try to put this team in its proper
perspective. That time will come. It's not here yet. And whoever wants to put
this team in its proper perspective can do it at that point in time. But until
then it's not worth it. It's not worth that discussion.  
But that's rational people like you and I thinking that way.  
  
Q. I'm kind of following up on what Michelle was asking you about, but
watching the game last night, the ESPN announcers were talking about how even
when you guys were up 20, 30 points that your players were playing like you
were down 10. And do you guys -- are they coached to say, look, we're just
going to play the game, we're not really playing the opponent, we're not
playing the scoreboard, we're going to try to play a perfect game, maybe try
to box out every time, try to contest every pass, and just kind of play the
game and not really worry about everything else, and if you give complete
effort everything will work out? Is that kind of some of the philosophy?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's the whole philosophy, actually. It never ceases to
amaze me, to be honest with you, why people are amazed at what these kids are
doing in terms of effort. I thought that's why you go to practice. I thought
you go to practice so that you can work on what you want to get better at. I
don't ever remember going to practice and saying, listen, guys, stay in your
stance, move your feet, get through screens, contest shots, but when we get up
20, don't do any of that.  
You imagine the absurdity of that? You know?  
  
Q. I mean, it's a tough thing to do, it's kind of like, well, I think it was
in a league of its own -- A League of Their Own where a guy said the heart is
what makes it great. It's like that's what -- it's hard to do that kind of
stuff.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, it is. Yes, it is. And if every kid -- if every kid
playing college basketball today just put it upon themselves and said, look,
I'm going to compete as hard as I can every possession, you know, I'm not
saying you would win more. And if this makes any sense, but you lose a hell of
a lot less. It would take somebody to have to beat you. And instead teams go
out there, they half-ass it and they lose and they can't understand why they
lost.  
And the only thing I've tried to do is tell my guys, listen, just compete on
every possession, at everything. And that's the way I was brought up. I was
brought up that way, and I've tried to get my teams to do that in all the
years that I've been coaching. And if people can't get their players to do
that, then either you got the wrong players or you shouldn't be coaching.  
Because that's what we do. That's what we do. We try to get them to do that.
We're not always successful. But, man, you can't just say wow I can't believe
you guys are diving on loose balls when you're up 25.  
Well, then tell them to stop. I'll tell them to stop. Listen, you're making
everybody else look bad around the country that doesn't do that. So when we
get up 30 stop diving on loose balls. I mean, it's just -- you're absolutely
right. I hear it all the time.  
And that's another reason that I think in spite of the winning streak and all
that, you gotta admire these kids for how hard they play, for how hard they
compete, how much honor, how much respect they bring to the game. That's
something to be admired. It's not something you think is bad for the game. No.
It's bad for those kids that don't want to play like that.  
But maybe it's good that it will make them say, hey, look, Kelly Faris doesn't
look that much different to me, I can do what she does. Lorin Dixon doesn't
look that much bigger than me, I can do what she does.  
So maybe five or six kids, watching those kids play saying, hey, I want to
play like that. And all of a sudden that's a good thing.  
  
Q. When did Bob Huggins make that call to you? And has there been anybody
during the tournament who you've heard from that is just in basketball circles
that was surprising, that sort of just called you out of the blue, either to
compliment your team or again to leave angry message for you about something
you said?  
COACH AURIEMMA: He wasn't being angry, he was just being Huggins. He
threatened to bring his team up here and play us on our home court so he could
prove to us that they were better.  
  
Q. That's this year he's talking about?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, this is this year. Again, because people are going to
want to make us out to be something we're not. And apparently somebody did say
or it came across like I said we were the best team in college basketball.
Which is absurd.  
  
Q. Has anyone -- have you heard from anyone that you're not particularly
close with that surprised you in terms of taking an interest in your team, a
coach reaching out or anything?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I get that and it surprises me from different walks of
life, not just in coaching. It surprises me sometimes who's paying attention.  
  
Q. Anyone stand out?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I haven't gotten anything that says -- other than -- a lot of
this stuff that I get from my friends, they accuse me of having the best job
in the world; that I don't have to coach real hard; that I got the easiest job
in America; that I should just play golf all year-round and just show up for
games.  
So they see what we do and they just, I think, marvel at the numbers and they
think, man, this guy's got the greatest situation in the world. And they're
absolutely right. I do. But I haven't gotten anything from anybody that's just
flat out come out and say, hey, what you guys are doing is lousy for the game
or any of that stuff. I don't get any of that.  
I'll tell you, one of our biggest fans is Bill Belichick. He's one of our
biggest fans. He makes sure he lets us know all the time that he thinks we're
great.  
  
Q. He'll call you up out of the blue and say how's it going?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'll hear from him telling me you guys are unbelievable, you
continue to raise the bar, you guys are amazing.  
I think people in this that have done great things, they appreciate how hard
it is to do. They really do. They appreciate how hard it is for kids to play
this hard all the time and compete and try to get it right all the time,
without looking -- I challenge anybody to say that we're out there and we're
arrogant and we're cocky and we disrespect the game, our opponents, anything
like that.  
So to see it being done the way it's being done by these particular players is
just -- I think anybody who appreciates that kind of stuff is really taken by
it. Really taken by it.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  88  
Kentucky - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined at the table by the Kentucky Wildcats' head
coach, Matthew Mitchell, and his two student athletes. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I want to congratulate Oklahoma. What a fantastic
performance they had tonight. As a coach, I was totally impressed with how
they came out, with a lot of tenacity and fought back from an early deficit
and really got control of the game.  
We were beaten by a very, very good basketball team and a very good basketball
program that we have tremendous respect for, and we wish them well as they
head to San Antonio.  
  
Q. Victoria, did you feel like you guys maybe didn't have quite as much
energy tonight as you had in the first game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think there was a definitely change from how we had played
in previous game. We know we didn't play our best, but I thought we came out
in the beginning and definitely gave our effort and energy. And just at the
end we just weren't ourselves, and I think we kind of got into a better
offense, missing shots, let it get to us and we just weren't the same
defensive team that we usually have been.  
  
Q. Amber, when Oklahoma switched to a zone, how did that affect what you all
were doing?  
AMBER SMITH: We just got real passive, and we didn't attack the gaps, so we
hurt ourselves in the zone.  
  
Q. Victoria, Nebraska got down early obviously and they didn't let that
necessarily -- or at least you guys got on Nebraska early and were able to
hold them down, but did Oklahoma's experience being in this situation, do you
think that played a factor in the game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Um, I'm not sure. I mean, I don't know what they were
thinking, but we weren't worried about what they were going to do. The whole
time we were thinking about what we were going to do as a team. Obviously they
are a good team and they've been here before, so that might have been a factor
for them, but that wasn't our mentality to think about their experience.  
  
Q. Amber, could you discuss their guards? They were maybe quicker than some
guards that you guys have faced before, and they seemed to get some points
driving to the basket the way you guys usually do.  
AMBER SMITH: Yeah, I mean, but we've played guards that quick, so I mean, it
was just we weren't focused in fundamentally on defense. We didn't get to the
right position in defense, so that was our fault. We just turned the ball over
too much.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just the season and what it's meant and kind of will
you remember this feeling for next season?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It's definitely been a great, amazing season that we've had,
the work that we've put in since last season in the summer and the preseason,
and the mentality that Coach has gotten us into to represent Kentucky as a
school and as a state, people have definitely come out to support us more.
People are looking at us like we are -- that's Kentucky, okay, that's a
defensive team. They definitely recognize us more.  
All I can say is that it definitely hurts that we lost, but we're definitely
going to cherish this moment, this season, this team because we started
something new, and the people coming next year are definitely going to have a
lot to fill because especially with the two that we're losing, Amani and Lyd,
what they've been through and all the injuries that they've been through,
they've battled a lot, and they've definitely helped us out this year with
their leadership and their hustle and everything the whole entire season. I'm
proud of them and I'm proud of my teammates where we've gone so far and just
cherish this moment forever.  
  
Q. Amber, you guys got off to such a fast start and it looked like Oklahoma
couldn't hit anything, and then all of a sudden it just seemed to switch as
quickly. Were you guys shocked by how quickly Oklahoma got back into the
game?  
AMBER SMITH: We weren't shocked. I mean, we know we are a good team and we
knew they were going to make their run and we just had to make a run back and
we didn't do that. We stopped playing how we were defensively. We came out of
the gate great playing defensively and then we stopped doing that and that's
how they got their lead, so I wasn't shocked.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. We'll take questions
now for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, from your perspective, you guys got off to such a great start;
what happened?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I thought that Oklahoma just really absorbed that
initial blow with, you know, an attitude of coming back swinging. When you
have veteran guards that are as good as those kids are, they just kept going.
We just missed a few rotations there in transition where they were able to get
it deep and kick it back out and made some shots. I just thought they kept
their composure.  
And then when they went to the zone, we did a really poor job there of
attacking that. It kind of got us out of attack mentality. So there's 100
things happening in the game and we'll go back and watch the film and see what
we could have done better, but that's my initial impression, that they were
able to keep their composure.  
  
Q. Against that zone, just how effective were Robinson and Stevenson out in
front of that with their hands?  
COACH MITCHELL: It was good. They were very effective. I didn't think that the
offense -- we had 45 percent shooting at halftime and 39 points, and we had
nine offensive boards and made a couple threes and making our free throws, so
I thought that they were very aggressive at the top, and so they definitely
made some plays up there, but I was more concerned about our defense at
halftime.  
  
Q. I know you said all season you don't want to talk about what you've
accomplished this season until the season is over. Now that it is over, can
you take some solace in the fact that you've really done a lot of things that
Kentucky has never done before as a program?  
COACH MITCHELL: I don't think there's any question that when we reflect back
on this season, everyone involved will know that this was a special basketball
team. You know, it's not even about not going to the Final Four tonight; it's
about being in that locker room with a bunch of kids that just absolutely
pushed it to the limit.  
I told them back there that I wouldn't trade places with Coach Coale at all. I
congratulate Oklahoma. I'm real, real proud of Kentucky.  
  
Q. Going forward, do you feel like you need to get a little longer, keep the
athleticism but get a little longer on your roster?  
COACH MITCHELL: Oh, sure, absolutely. You know, where we were at this stage,
we just needed to get the right kind of people in the program, and that's from
staff members to players to support staff. You need the right kind of people,
the people that are dedicated to honesty, hard work, discipline, things that
we talk about. And so now as you move forward, you certainly look for tall,
long, athletic people that like honesty, hard work and discipline, and so
there's no question that we are addressing that right now in recruiting. We
would like to keep this style of play if we possibly can. I think it's a fun
way to play, and I think it's exciting.  
And I think there's some players out there that will be the right kind of
people, and that's what we need to be looking for. So I'm confident that we're
doing that. We get a lot of good response from people. I think people are
excited about the direction. So we will be working hard to get that done.  
  
Q. Could you discuss their quickness a little bit? She was talking about
their guards in the top of the zone, but they were scoring points off
turnovers. They were doing a lot of things that you guys do to other teams.
Talk about what they were able to do.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I just thought that Stevenson probably played -- I
haven't seen her play that well, and that's a compliment to her to be able to
sense the moment and raise her level. She was really quick. And Robinson is a
terrific guard, and so I just thought those two kids really controlled the
game.  
They are outstanding, veteran guards that just weren't going to be denied
tonight. I just thought that we were -- we would have had to really, really be
in tune tonight with what we needed to do and for whatever reason -- one
reason is because Oklahoma is awfully good. Another is we just weren't as
sharp as we'd been all year. We've been sharp a bunch of times. You know,
we've been sharp a bunch of times, and I just leave here sad for the kids
tonight, but what a tremendous effort by a group of people to come together
and become their best.  
  
Q. I noticed you huddled the kids on the floor before you left. Could you
talk about just what you said or what you told them there?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. I really feel like this team was committed, and as a
coach that's what you just pray you can get. We got a lot of commitment from
those folks wearing blue up there in the stands, and they've been with us all
the way through an undefeated season at home, through an incredible March
through the SEC tournament and the NCAA Tournament, and they've been there for
us. And I just wanted the players to recognize that's part of why it's so
special to be here and why we're so fortunate that Dr. Todd and Mr. Barnhart
have been good enough to let us all be here and put on that jersey.  
So I wanted them to just walk out with their head held high. They've had a
great, great run, and then acknowledge those good people that spent money and
effort to come out here and support them. So that's what we talked about.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-parter. The first one is do you think that next season
you'll be picked to finish 11th in the SEC, and with everything you have
coming back, you have to be looking at next season already and kind of feeling
good.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, the first part, you just never know what people are
going to do, so I don't have any idea. I would suspect that we probably won't
be picked.  
But here's the trick now. This is an important thing, that we do not take this
team for granted. And one thing that I was able to -- that I've been able to
learn that's been very valuable is that tradition is important and tradition
is great, but really the focus needs to be every year is a new year. Every
year is a new team. We're losing two seniors, I'm telling you now, that we're
going to try to replace with a sophomore that needs to get better and we're
going to try to replace with some freshmen. You can't take it for granted that
it's just going to keep rolling along.  
So the challenge for the next team is they won't fly under the radar. They'll
never have that again unless there's some type of dip, you know, and people
aren't expecting it from year to year. But the hope is and the plan is that
this won't happen again.  
So now they've got to approach it with just white hot intensity as we ramp up
to get ready for the next one. So I will never, ever go into next season
taking what happened this season and just thinking it's going to happen.
That's going to take -- this team worked so hard day after day after day.
People thought they were going to be a bad team; they didn't listen. People
thought we wouldn't get to the SEC tournament championship game. No one
probably thought we'd get to the Sweet 16. Certainly no one thought we were
going to get to the Elite 8.  
So this team has accomplished a lot, and so for next season, whatever good we
can take, whatever momentum builds, whatever standard has been set, I think
that's how you use this season getting ready for the next, because these kids
aren't robots; they're human beings. They have to go out and go through it and
do all the work.  
We will go in with tremendous optimism but knowing that we have to stay true
to what our principles are.  
  
Q. Victoria played the way that Victoria always plays, but you kind of
needed another person to step up, and that's happened almost every game this
season. What did you feel like happened with the other scorers this time?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it just -- Sunday night you go 8 for 16 from the three-
point line. You get down to this point and teams are really good and they have
ability. You just don't have an opportunity to work through a bad night. It's
-- I thought we were trying. I thought that -- there's so much on the line.
People react differently in this setting. I thought A'dia got a little
frustrated, and that's because she cares. That's because she wanted to
continue to play with this team, so you don't fault her for that. You try to
learn from that and move forward. We just missed some shots that we've been
making.  
I don't think it was a product of us not trying. I thought the kids were
playing hard. We wish we'd played better, but we clearly needed somebody to
step up and be that complement to Victoria. She had a whale of a game.  
  
Q. You touched on them briefly, but can you talk about what Amani and Lydia
have meant as seniors to this team?  
COACH MITCHELL: I appreciate you asking that, because those two players have
overcome so many points in their career here at Kentucky where they wouldn't
be here tonight, so that's a wonderful thing for them. We wouldn't be here
tonight without those two.  
What we as the coaches at Kentucky are trying to do, we're trying to be
honestly competitive and win games, but we believe that our mission is to help
these kids become better people and get them prepared as they leave, and I'm
really, really proud of Amani and Lydia because it hasn't always been hard --
it hasn't always been easy for them, and they've made some changes just as
people. So I'm really, really excited for them in their future because they
are -- they have worked themselves in a position to be successful people, and
they use basketball as a tool to get them there.  
So I'm really, really grateful to those two. You couldn't write enough nice
things about those two kids and how proud of them I am. They will always be a
part of this program.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Good luck on next
season and congratulations on a great year.  
COACH MITCHELL: I want to thank everybody here in Kansas City. We were treated
extremely well, and thanks to everyone who helped us out here.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  88  
Kentucky - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by victorious Oklahoma, Coach Sherri Coale and
the student athletes. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH COALE: First of all, I would like to congratulate Kentucky for being in
the Elite 8 and performing the way they did. Early on their pressure defense
gave us all kinds of trouble, and later when we counter-punched, I thought
their youth and inexperience showed a little bit. But the job Matthew has done
with that team in the short amount of time with that program, getting to the
Elite 8, they'll be back, I couldn't be more impressed. He and his staff, the
way they handled themselves and the way the kids handled themselves tonight,
they were just a terrific opponent and really just appreciate the way they
competed.  
My kids, they just win. They just win. Grit, intestinal fortitude, never
doubt. They just believe, and we talk about the eyes and the look you need to
have in your eyes when you compete for championships. Even when we were dismal
in the first five minutes, the look in the huddle was one of belief. They felt
like they belonged here and believed in their ability to get the job done, and
what a tremendous legacy already, and it's not over yet, but for these three
seniors to guide their teams to back-to-back Final Fours. That puts us in a
different league. That's a different deal. Those three kids will forever be
known as the first to do that, and I love that for them because they're
special.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, it seemed tonight the game was almost like a mirror of your
season. There was some early adversity you fought through and then you blew
through at the end. What do you think it is about this team that's allowed you
guys to do that?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I think just throughout the season we had to fight, and
after every loss that we had, we learned from it, and it was different every
time. You know, all the tough games that we've won, it just showed, and it
played a big prior in tonight's game when we were down early.  
Like Coach said, we knew the game wasn't over. There was a lot of time on that
clock. We may have had wowed or whatever, I don't know what was wrong with us
in that first four minutes, but we turned it around and we played Oklahoma
basketball.  
  
Q. Danielle, I thought when you guys went to zone, that changed things up a
little bit. Talk about that and how that changed the tone for you all.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We knew coming in that we were going to have to use our
zone a little bit. A lot of teams hadn't seen zone a lot this year, so we knew
we could use that to our advantage, and I think that's the best zone we've
played all season. So definitely happy that it worked.  
  
Q. Amanda, it seemed to me like there was just a look on your face after
that early start that was like, you probably wouldn't want to say what you
were thinking inside. You just looked furious, and it looked like there was
this huge burst of energy. You pulled down a couple of rebounds. Can you talk
about what was going through your mind and how you think maybe that was sort
of the jump start for you guys?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: You know, when we first started and after I got that first
turnover, I was like, Oh, my goodness, this is one of those kind of games.
Then we got down maybe 10 or 12, and I was like, We're not about to have this.
So the ball came off, I got a little energy, got a rebound and came down, got
a little jump shot, just kind of released that pressure a little bit. Once we
got those shots, they really kind of backed up for that little span or
interval. Everybody kind of fed off that, and we took that lead and didn't
give it back.  
  
Q. For Amanda and Danielle, everybody says goals never change, always keep
your eye on the prize, all that stuff. But back in November when Whitney went
down and you didn't know what was going to happen, how much was this a
legitimate dream that you could still do this?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We never took our eyes off the prize no matter what happened,
who left, who got injured. We knew we could still fight. We just knew we had
to double everything we did on the court, and everybody took responsibility
for that, and it showed today.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like she talked about, we never took our brains and our
minds off of going back to the Final Four. We felt that if we did, we would be
settling. We'd make an excuse for something that's really uncontrollable.  
You know, Whitney is not gone, she's still a captain. She's still at practice
every day. She's just not playing. So we knew that we still had a special
leader on our team, and she's definitely helped us out throughout the whole
season.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, just about a week after you played UConn, you were at K State,
had a really tough start, I think you were down by 21 with maybe 16 minutes
left in that game and came back. I don't want to say that was any kind of
turning point, but that could have been a game where you guys might have
easily lost, just the resilience in this game and how that reflects what this
team has been like this season?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Like I said, this team just never gives up. We had a rough
start, and it just lasted way longer than four minutes. Halftime we were still
-- before halftime we got some baskets and got stops, but we were still
clawing, and at halftime we just looked at each other and said, Hey, either
we're going to fight or this season is just going to rest up on this. So we
just turned it around and decided that we didn't want to be what everyone said
that we were going to be. We wanted to be more, and that's what we did. We
changed it around.  
  
Q. Danielle, what was said in the huddle? You guys were down 10 points. You
have a time-out. You were settling for jump shots up to that point. What was
said about driving to the basket?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We just knew that we just needed to settle down. We were
sped up a little bit, but we've been there before. So like A.T. talked about,
we just needed to calm down, chill out a little bit, and that's exactly what
we did.  
THE MODERATOR: The NCAA has announced that Oklahoma Stanford will play Game 1
at 6:00 p.m. Central Time on Sunday and Baylor-UConn is at 8:30.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about it seemed like Carlee really gave you guys a
lift when she came in. Talk about sometimes we just think of her as a shooter,
but it seemed like she did a whole lot else this evening.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, Carlee is a real versatile player, especially on the
defensive end. She's long. She rebounded for us. Before she checked in, I
mean, in the first half, I asked her, Are you ready? And she said, Yep, and I
knew from then on that she was going to be great tonight.  
  
Q. Amanda, after the game Sherri said that on that first time-out when you
guys were really struggling, she said something like y'all ready to just get
back on the bus, and you sort of said, no, Coach -- you sort of settled her
down to some degree. She didn't say that, but that was my impression. Is that
correct, and were you startled at what she said?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I wasn't startled. You know, when she says those kind of
things, it's not really -- it's kind of like a blow to the chest, like we're
not doing what we're supposed to. So I kind of told her, Just tell us what we
need to do and we got it. She listened to me and she told us what we needed to
do, and from that point on we made our run.  
We had to play defense and we had to make baskets, you know, and from then on
we went into that zone. Our two guards up top, they got touches, they got
steals and we got back-to-back fast breaks. It was just amazing. They play
awesome the whole game, and Kentucky was really -- they played really well,
but we fought back, and we played together, and it paid off.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season and a great win
tonight. Good luck in San Antonio.  
  
Q. Sherri, I hate to give you absolutely no time to think about this, but
Stanford coming up next, can you talk a little bit about -- you said in the
Big 12 tournament, you said one of the strengths of this team is you can be a
different type of team depending on your opponent, you have that versatility.
Obviously, Stanford is a way, way different team than Kentucky. Can you talk
about that match-up?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think Stanford's offense is obviously an offense that is
rhythmic, and you've got to break the rhythm. You can't let them get the ball
where they want to get the ball. They're incredibly different than Kentucky,
night and day. We do that in the Big 12. We play Texas A & M and then we go
and play Iowa State. So we're accustomed to that.  
I can talk for a long time about Stanford because I've seen them play several
and I know what they do and I know Tara and I know how she teaches them, but
with all due respect, I'd just like to talk about us for a while.  
  
Q. Talk about Nyeshia, what an NCAA Tournament she's having.  
COACH COALE: She was fantastic. I think she finally figured out that she's
fast with the ball in her hand. You know, you tell her all the time and it
sounds so trite, but she is a three-point shooter and she's a fantastic three-
point shooter, but she has a great first step. And she got to the rim the
first time, and you could just see the light in her eyes that she'd figured it
out and she continued to attack the rim and that was really the difference.
That's when we began to blow it open.  
  
Q. You briefly touched on the legacy of these seniors. Can you expand a
little bit more?  
COACH COALE: Yeah. I just -- I think it's special when kids can lead a program
to back-to-back Final Fours, and for each of these three kids, we talked about
it along the way throughout this tournament, their personal growth
individually as people, as basketball players and then their collective growth
as leaders of a basketball team has just been a phenomenal thing to witness.
This could not have happened to three more deserving kids than the three we
have here. They're just so humble and they're so together and so fun to coach
and it's been a very rewarding year that's not over yet.  
  
Q. I think it was with those three you had in mind when you said, This puts
us in a different league. But expand on that a little bit, too, back-to-back
Final Fours and what it means.  
COACH COALE: Well, I think if you look over the last decade, there are folks
who are always there. Connecticut is always there. Tennessee is almost always
there. And then you have those other two spots, and Stanford is there quite a
bit, and then you have a new kid.  
You look back in 2002 and it was Tennessee and Connecticut and Duke, who had
been making the push, and then we were the new kid. And then last year you had
Stanford and Connecticut and Louisville was the new kid, and we got back -- so
back-to-back years, I can't say that it puts us in a Tennessee and Connecticut
league because we haven't won it yet. But you can't win it if you don't keep
going. I just think it separates us a little bit, and a very special moment
for our program.  
  
Q. Weird game, there's one lead change. They got ahead, you caught up and
took the lead and they never caught back up. Could you see that once you got
ahead the momentum had shifted and you were pretty comfortable at that point
with the result?  
COACH COALE: I felt like the momentum had definitely shifted, but I don't know
that I was comfortable until somewhere around the eight-minute mark, and even
then Danielle gets her foul until we made that little run.  
But they were young, and you could sort of see the indecision coming in when
we changed to the zone early on and turned them into passers instead of
drivers. I felt like if we could just continue to score that we were going to
be in great shape. But I don't know that I got comfortable for a long time.  
  
Q. With two teams from the Big 12 in the Final Four, what's it say about the
Big 12 conference?  
COACH COALE: What we've been saying all year; it prepares you. It prepares you
for postseason play. I think it speaks volumes about the Big 12. Folks are
starting to catch on, and they're talking about it being the toughest
conference in the country, obviously the most well-attended conference in the
country, and for us and Baylor to both be playing there, I think the proof is
in the pudding.  
  
Q. You're going back to San Antonio where you played Connecticut for the
National Championship. Talk a little bit about that.  
COACH COALE: A little bit surreal, actually. For it to be in the same city,
for it to be this team, you know, that group from 2002 -- the first time you
go to the Final Four, it's an amazing, amazing moment, an amazing, amazing
experience, and then the next time you're supposed to. From then on out,
you're supposed to.  
That 2002 team had this special spunk about them. I don't think at the start
of the year anybody thought we'd be a Final Four team. I thought we were
pretty good, but I don't know that anybody thought we could break in and go to
the Final Four. Not only did we go there, then we competed in the championship
game.  
That group of kids just were a remarkable group of young women, who they've
gone on to become and what they've gone on to do. All those kids have been
texting this week while we're here and sent flowers to my room and texting
each other and getting everybody together and telling our kids we'll be
waiting on the River Walk, we'll hold a boat for you, come see us.  
As a coach, God, it doesn't get any better than that. It just doesn't get any
better than that.  
  
Q. I forgot to ask the players this, but what was that silly basket with the
eggs and stuff?  
COACH COALE: It's not a basket, it's a trophy. I know it turned out to look a
little like a birthday cake, but it's not, it's a trophy. Today was a long
day. Playing a late game is tough, and you don't want to take the kids out and
about. They just played an overtime game 48 hours ago. But you also don't want
them sleeping all day. So we just found a way to occupy their time and bought
a whole bunch of stuff and just junk and said, Make a trophy. That trophy
we're going to -- and our deal has been go to Kansas City and get a trophy,
and we didn't do it in the Big 12 tournament.  
That's one of the reasons -- everybody asked us after the selection show when
I said, This is perfect, everybody thought I was talking about my bracket. No,
I'm talking about we get to go back to Kansas City and get the trophy. It had
been our theme and it didn't work out and, okay, we still get to go. I told
our guys you're going to get the trophy, but then we've got to put that out in
the legacy court and do all that stuff with it at the Lloyd Noble Center.  
These seniors need something really special, something that stays in our
locker room that says they created a legacy all their own, so let's build our
own deal, and they did, and every piece of it means something.  
One of the reasons these kids have been so fun to coach, you can throw
anything out there and they'll embrace it and they'll be all about it. They
just dive in head first. We had to break them away from it. It's time to go to
shoot around, quit building the trophy, and they just had to finish it and get
it exactly right and then they carried this stinking thing around with them
everywhere. I mean, they're so proud of it. They just embrace opportunities. I
think that's one of the reasons they play so well when the game is on the
line.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, again, congratulations on a big win. Best of luck in the
Final Four.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Kentucky Wildcats, Coach
Matthew Mitchell and his student athletes. Coach, your thoughts about last
night?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, last night was an awfully good game for us. I thought
Nebraska was an outstanding basketball team. Going into the game, and I
thought nothing less of them after the game, just thought they were terrific
and knew we would have to play extremely well to beat them. And it just makes
me real happy for these players that they were able to play as well as they
played last night when the -- you know, with the magnitude of the game.  
So it was just a terrific performance by our players. They've worked so hard
this year all year long to get themselves in this position, and I'm just
awfully fortunate to be coaching them.  
  
Q. For Victoria, obviously you guys weren't picked to finish very high even
in your own league this season. But when did you begin to get a sense that
this was a team that could really do some damage?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think really like towards the middle of the beginning of
the season. It was preseason before the SEC Conference and we were playing
really well together. Our defense was really getting after it and as a team
you could see the collective energy that we had and everybody wanted to be out
there playing basketball, and it just went on from there.  
  
Q. I guess Amani, can you talk about being the senior, just how you've seen
this team develop and what it means to you to be able to go to an Elite 8 as a
senior at Kentucky?  
AMANI FRANKLIN: It means so much. My first three years here, we went to three
straight WNITs. We knew coming into the season that everybody was dedicated to
come into the gym and put the work in needed to be where we're at in this
position right now. So it means so much to us right now.  
  
Q. Maybe Keyla, you can answer this, or Amber, if you want to answer, too,
just talk about the fact that you guys played such strong defense. I mean, the
pressure that you put on Nebraska, they talked about that was something they
really didn't experience at all this year, and if both of you could maybe talk
about that and how that's been such a big part of what you've seen.  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: Right. We worked really hard this whole season already since
that's a main part in our practice and our defense. So I think that's helped
us a great deal this whole trip to the NCAA Tournament, and I think it will
continue to be a success for us in the future.  
AMBER SMITH: We knew Nebraska hadn't faced really any pressure, and so we knew
that was going to be effective in the game. I mean, that's our game plan is to
play hard defensively, get after people with intent. It's been working for us
this for, so just going to stay with it and work hard on it.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if the defense has progressively gotten better, like if you
guys, maybe the two of you again could talk a little bit further about that,
if you thought you were really good at one point, it just keeps getting better
and better. Do you feel that way sometimes?  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: I think as we continue to play together and we just continue to
practice more aggressively in practice, that it's continued to get better.  
AMBER SMITH: Yeah, I agree. I mean, we just worked so hard, and so I think
it'll never fail us as long as we work hard, and I think it has got better and
I think it will get better.  
  
Q. Victoria, have you guys played a perfect defensive game yet? Or do you
think that you guys could still potentially get better on defense?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I don't think we have played a perfectly complete defensive
game. I know we have our moments where everybody is on one tilt and everybody
is moving and rotating on defense. But every now and then we just have a
couple times where we'll slip up and get penetration or just different little
things. But we definitely have a lot more room to grow and just things to get
better at.  
  
Q. For Amber or Keyla, obviously the pressure has been really successful,
especially last night. But talk about the challenge of playing up against
Danielle Robinson, one of the quickest and best point guards in the country.  
AMBER SMITH: I look at it as an opportunity, and I mean, we're just going to
play her like we have been playing everybody else, and we're going to pressure
her. We're going to pressure the whole team. I mean, it's a great opportunity,
and we're going to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Victoria, can you talk about the emotions and feelings about being one
step away from being into the Final Four?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think we're all on an emotional high right now. Everybody
is really excited. Just ready to continue what we're doing, and we know that
we're not done yet. I know we just left the Sweet 16 going into the Elite 8,
and Coach is just saying, okay, enjoy the win, but we have another win to get
to and we've got more to come. So don't settle for anything.  
  
Q. Victoria, we're talking a lot about your defense that people have talked
about all season with you, but you guys shot I think 50 percent last night and
had a very good offensive performance, too. Can you talk about why -- it
seemed like you got shots you wanted all night and you hit them. What do you
think worked so well for your offense last night?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think we were really patient in our offense. We just used
what we had to our abilities with driving to the basket and just kicking to
the shooters. I think that was just one thing that got us real -- especially
defense got us points but also we were just real patient and not rushing
things on offense and letting it come to us.  
  
Q. Just curious with the short turnaround obviously, what you know about
Oklahoma and what your game plan is as you head into that game, another Big 12
team, and what you've learned about them in the last few hours.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Well, we don't know much right now. That's why we're coming
to practice today and getting prepared. You know, I know Coach had laid out a
good game plan for us, and we're just going to just stick with whatever he has
to throw out for us and play our game like we've been playing all season.  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think we're just going to continue to play Kentucky
basketball, continue to play defense, pressure, and hopefully like last game
we can knock down shots and make it a good game because Oklahoma is a good
team, so I think it's going to be a good game.  
  
Q. For Keyla and A'dia, your three-point shooting, I think you're hitting 45
percent in the NCAA tournament so far as a team. What light has come on, or is
it just that they're focusing so much on Vic inside that maybe it's opened up
some stuff for you guys?  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: Our point guards and people on the wings, they've been able to
get us the ball and find us when we're open. And also Vic, when they double-
team on her, it allows us to get open shots. Just being in the tournament
atmosphere I think it's given our team just another motivation to knock down
open shots and stuff.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yes, a lot of times we were fortunate to get wide open,
especially on deep penetration and things like that, we was able to get open
and knock down some shots, and I think that's really helping our team out
right now.  
  
Q. A'dia, sometimes it still seems like when you're open for threes, you
hesitate just slightly before you shoot it almost every time. Is that because
you want to drive it inside or -- what are they telling you about three-point
shooting? Are they telling you to take those shots?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, they say take it if I'm open but also be aggressive and
attack the basket, so I try and do both. Sometimes I'm a little hesitating,
but if they leave me open, I will take it.  
  
Q. A'dia, I think if I read this right, your dad had told you a lot about
the history of Kentucky basketball and what basketball has meant to that
state. But obviously women hadn't got as much attention, and that was one
thing you wanted to come to Kentucky to change that culture. Can you talk
about what it means in your first year to go someplace that Kentucky has never
gone before in women's basketball?  
A'DIA MATHIES: It means a whole lot, especially to be able to do with these
girls because we love each other a whole lot. Just changing the program around
and head it in the right direction and making Kentucky basketball more than
just the men's, making it the women's, too. So it means a lot to me.  
  
Q. For Amber and Amani, how much I guess public response have you gotten in
the last few days? I mean, Tweeting and Facebook, how many texts have you
gotten? Kind of talk about the craziness surrounding all this.  
AMBER SMITH: Okay. When I checked my Facebook last night, I had like 90
notifications. So many people just congratulating me. We're just happy that we
have so much support from back home or whatnot, so it's just been crazy the
last few weeks or so.  
AMANI FRANKLIN: Yeah, it's been awesome. Checked Facebook and Twitter, and
everybody is just showing us a lot of support from back home. It's just great
to hear people who usually don't watch us are now watching us since the guys
are out. (Laughter).  
I mean, everybody is kind of watching us, so I mean, that's great for Kentucky
women's basketball. But Keyla, she had 99 messages after the game, I had about
50, so I came in second place.  
AMBER SMITH: I had 14.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I had seven.  
A'DIA MATHIES: I was somewhere between 30 -- I was in the 30s.  
  
Q. Amani, Coach was saying last night about how you guys had to commit to
this really intense conditioning to be able to play the way you were, and last
night at the end of the game you guys were still playing as hard as you were
at the beginning. Can you just talk about that mindset to be in that good of
condition to be able to play the style that you have?  
AMANI FRANKLIN: Oh, yeah, definitely. I want to thank Coach Tracy, giving her
a shout-out. She just had us committed during the off-season to come in and
work hard. Those 20 and 20s that we ran really paid off and suicides and the
list goes on. We just committed, especially, like you said, to play this type
of defensive pressure that we have, we really have to be committed to being in
great shape, and that's just helped us along the way.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll let you go back to your
locker room. We'll take the first question for Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, what about the development of Victoria, and the fact that she
played high school ball in Tennessee that's so competitive, do you think that
helped her be prepared for college, and then how she's advanced since she's
been in your program.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I think Victoria played in a very good high school
program, and she played in a very good -- with a very good club in the summer
that competed at the highest level nationally. So I think she was very
familiar with basketball at as high as the level can get in the summer and in
high school, and I think her parents really did a great job of giving her
opportunities to compete.  
You know, she was a national -- she was an All-American in high school in
track, and track is a very competitive sport. You have to get yourself
mentally prepared to run a race or compete in an event. So she showed up
really equipped to compete at this level.  
And while her game was not by any means complete when she got to us, she was
able right away to get in defensively and function at a high level, and she
just has so much desire on the defensive end of the floor to make plays.  
She did arrive probably equipped better than most freshmen to compete at this
level.  
  
Q. The players kind of touched on it a little bit, but obviously as
mentioned with the men being out, is this an opportunity for you guys to kind
of gain a little bit more spotlight as far as people who may have not either
gone to a game or really seen a lot of the women play? Is this an opportunity
maybe to get a little bit of light shown on your program and to have some new
people show some interest?  
COACH MITCHELL: I guess it is. We're not thinking about that a whole lot. But
certainly there's a lot of passion for Kentucky sports for all of our teams,
and everybody knows how passionate people are about our men's program. But
we've had tremendous support over the years, and this year was really special
for us.  
Anybody that is able to watch these players play I think is given an
opportunity to see something special, and so I'm really happy if we have an
opportunity to show this team to the country, and I'm really happy for these
players if they get any recognition from this because they have absolutely
worked themselves into a position to be special, and I'm awfully proud of
them.  
  
Q. I kind of asked the players about the frenzy in the last couple weeks of
just playing on national TV and they were comparing numbers. How many friend
requests do you have? Have you even had a chance to check it and maybe just
your text messages and that kind of thing?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I'll tell you where I am on that. I had to ask Vic what
a notification is. I have a Facebook page, but I haven't been on it in a
while. I certainly haven't checked it here.  
You know, I have my phone. I have a lot of texts. It's hard to get through all
those, so I haven't read any papers or anything. We're just so busy with the
opponent. Nebraska had plenty to keep us busy there, and Oklahoma is really
tough. So I'm not locked in on that part of it right now.  
  
Q. Given your impressions of Oklahoma, I'm sure you know a little bit more
than your players do at this point.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. Oklahoma is a team that, first of all, I have admired
for a long, long time, that program. Coach Coale is right there at the top of
coaches in this profession that I really, really respect. And I don't know her
well, but I have watched her teams over the years, and especially as an
assistant coach, just watched the way they conducted themselves, the way that
they play for each other, and it's real evident to me that it means something
to those kids to play for Oklahoma.  
And that's what I always said when I became a head coach; I wanted our players
to understand how special it is to play at Kentucky and to have that kind of
passion and pull for each other.  
So we approach this game with an unbelievable respect for our opponent, just
probably can't say enough good things about their program. Now, this
particular team I have watched some throughout the season on and off when I
have a little downtime and watching other teams play. They're one of the teams
I like to watch just because of what I just mentioned, my respect for Coach
Coale.  
And I think they are as equipped to handle what we do as anybody that we've
played up to this point, and what I mean by that, they are a team that
actually executes the backdoor pass, and they can make plays -- a lot of
people can come into a game and say, okay, Kentucky is going to pressure,
we'll put this backdoor play in, and they can't do it all game long.  
So what I'm real concerned about is Oklahoma actually is equipped to do that.
They've done that. Whenever I watch them, they're going to have some backdoor
plays every single game, so that tells you they have worked on this, and it's
part of what they do.  
So that's a huge concern for me with Oklahoma, just their ability to execute
in the half court. So it's going to be a mental game for us now. We're going
to have to commit more than ever to our defensive fundamentals to be able to
stay in a stance and guard the kids on the wings and some of their isolation
plays. It's going to be really, really tough, and they are an unbelievable
opponent to be getting ready for right now.  
  
Q. Oklahoma mentioned that you guys remind them a little bit of A & M, Texas
A & M, as far as the pressure and stuff like that. When you look at them on
tape or you see them, is there any team or opponent you face that comes to
mind?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, that's one of the questions I always ask the coach
that's scouting the game, who do they remind you of, and they have pieces of a
lot of teams in our league. They're a little unique. You know, Robinson sort
of reminds me of a little taller version of our point guard, Amber Smith. I
think this is going to be a terrific match-up.  
One thing that we try to do is push it in transition, and I think that our
point guard, Amber, does a really good job of getting the defense to shift in
transition, what we call slashing the floor, slicing the floor, and I think
Robinson does a great job of that. She's really, really tough.  
Obviously they have some size that we don't have. That's going to be tough for
us. But they're just a really good team, play hard, play for each other.
That's why I respect them so much. They're not exactly like really anybody in
our league. They just have pieces of a lot of things, and they're awfully,
awfully good.  
  
Q. You're mentioning that Oklahoma is well equipped for your defense. Well,
if neither team can, as they say, impose their will on the other, it sounds
like it could be a stalemate in that situation, where does this game get
won?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, no, I think that for us what we still have to try to do,
what we're going to do, so we need to try to impose our will, and Oklahoma
needs to do the same.  
I think it'll be won for us on the defensive end, and we will have to do a
good job. I think rebounding is at a premium right now. I think when teams get
real even, like last night with Nebraska, I thought we did a little bit better
job of 50/50 balls and hustling just a little bit more, and that's not being
disrespectful to Nebraska. I just think that's where the games come down to,
because you start looking -- it's amazing. You get to this round and you start
looking at the stats and they start becoming pretty similar and that's because
the teams are good at this point in time.  
So I think it'll be about the intangibles here on this game. Robinson plays a
bunch of minutes. Amber plays a bunch of minutes. Vic plays a bunch of
minutes. Their kids -- we're playing about the same number of kids is what I'm
trying to say. I think it's going to be a lot about effort and who can execute
and who could knock down a shot or two. That will be probably how it comes and
shakes out there.  
  
Q. Could you discuss the progression of your defense over the course of the
season, and then kind of the same question I asked the players, have you seen
a perfect defensive game, and what can they still do to get better?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we play in such a tough league and such great
competition and we've played such great competition in this tournament, that's
awful hard to do to play a perfect game. I think that we have -- that we are
closing in on near perfect effort, you know, and that's really the goal is
perfect effort. It's difficult to have perfect execution. It's just impossible
because teams are so good.  
But the thing that -- the reason we have progressed and we're in the position
we are now is because they never grew weary of the fundamentals, and that's
why they have my respect and my admiration is that we put them through I'm
talking about late, late in the season, we're still doing 30 minutes of
defensive fundamental footwork every day, and it's the same drills every day.  
It would be very easy for them to complain and to moan and groan or to just
kind of get through a drill, and there's just so few times I ever had to stop
and say, Look, this is not the kind of effort we're looking for. I'm talking
about very, very few times over a long, hard season. We're talking about over
120 practices. It's tough.  
So the reason last night we went in with so much confidence, we talked about
real simple things. It was our fundamentals. It was closing out. It was
putting pressure on the ball. It was denying passing lanes. It was fronting
the post. The compliments -- I had some friends of mine that are coaches that
aren't playing right now, and they came in for the game, and the compliments I
received were, Wow, you front the post, you deny the passing lanes, you put
pressure on the ball.  
The reason they have progressed and the reason they'll have a chance to win
tomorrow night, I don't know that we can, but we'll have a chance is because
they've been willing to work so hard.  
  
Q. Keyla started the last eight games. What precipitated that change, and
how impressed have you been with her play since then?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we had an injury with Carly Morrow. She's dealing with a
fatigue issue that we're trying to figure out exactly what's going on there.
So she was -- her minutes had to drop because she couldn't go. She would get
winded very easily.  
And so as her condition progressed to a point to where we needed to make a
change in the line-up, so there were some candidates for that job, and Keyla
got it because she had worked really, really hard at the defense. Here's
something I want to tell you about Keyla Snowden. About 13, 14 games ago, we
were at -- it may not be that long, but we were at Vanderbilt here in the last
couple months, and she didn't get off the bench, and I didn't put her in the
game because I didn't have any confidence that she would defend.  
She started coming in for extra work, and basically just made up her mind that
she was going to be committed, and it's really remarkable -- it's a remarkable
thing, an example for the rest of our players, that if you just change your
mindset, you can go from literally not getting in a game to, as you all are
witnessing, being a significant player on college women's basketball's biggest
stage.  
I'm really proud of her because she was getting it in practice. It was not a
lot of warm and fuzzies in practice for her. It was tough every day for her to
come in because I knew she had the ability. I knew she could do it. So she's
been a real difference for us in this tournament, just her range is so deep,
you have to respect that, and if you don't, she's going to burn you.  
But I always knew she could shoot, but it was the defense that turned it
around for her, and she's been terrific for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned the tradition with Oklahoma and the fact they've been here
before. They know the drill coming to the NCAA Tournament. Your team does not.
Is that something you can maybe use as a real advantage, that maybe coming
into a situation they don't really know, they'll just go out there and play?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I think that's all how you approach it, and the thing
that this team has done a great job of all year long and why I'm optimistic
that we'll be able to handle this is they have not gotten caught up in
different things.  
And this has been a year, I've said this before, we've come to a lot of points
in the season where we could have gotten a sense of arrival, of stop and smell
the roses, feel like things were great. There were a lot of big moments in the
year. And they have resisted the urge to do that. They have continued to punch
through and work, and so this will be -- everybody is aware of what's on the
line. It's a big, big moment. There's no doubt about it. I think it's silly to
say it's just another game. It's not.  
But what we will try to do is get all of those things -- how happy we would be
to win, how sad we would be to lose, get all the consequences of the game off
our mind and just focus on what we need to do, and this team has shown me they
have that ability, and so I suspect they're probably going to be able to do
that one more time.  
  
Q. You touched a little bit about rebounding, but talk about facing Amanda
Thompson, Abi Olajuwon. Thompson is averaging over ten rebounds a game and Abi
is playing the best she's ever played here lately.  
COACH MITCHELL: It's going to be tough. It's going to be one of the big keys
to the game to who can just fight and battle, and we're at a big disadvantage
there, huge disadvantage in size. We will have to have five players committed
to scrapping and working, and we call it action-oriented rebounding, action
words, grab, pull, snatch, dive, whatever you can do. We talk to them about
those words before games because we just can't get into a jumping match or
think we're just going to jump up and get rebounds. We really have to fight on
the boards.  
Thompson and Olajuwon are imposing figures. They are tough, tough rebounders.
I keep going into those games and saying how in the world are we going to do
it, and somehow they've figured out a way to do it.  
But this will be a huge test for us on the boards and will be a big part of
the game. We'll have to compete with them hard.  
  
Q. Just to follow that up, talk a bit about defending Olajuwon in the post.
She had a double-double last night and is really playing well offensively.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, our whole philosophy there, and everybody knows by this
time that we don't have a lot of height. We've talked about it all year. Our
philosophy is pretty simple. We try to start playing post defense 35 feet from
the basket, so we're going to try to get you to catch it where -- if you want
to catch it at the three-point line, we're going to try to get you to catch it
outside the NBA line. And if you want to catch it at the elbow, we're going to
try to get you 10 feet from there.  
So the post defense starts for us on the perimeter. So we need to pressure so
much that our philosophy is if you can't see her, you can't throw it in there.
So there's more -- there are going to be times when we just can't keep it from
getting in there, and those are just tough situations. You then just have to
fight as hard as you can, kind of hope she misses, box out, get the rebound,
limit those opportunities for her, but really the goal with her is just to
keep it out of her hands. And that's not a secret. That's what we've done.  
We have a lot of big post players in the SEC, and so we've had varying degrees
of success with big players. This will be as big a test as we've had. She's a
really, really good player and has worked herself -- you can tell she's been
dedicated to getting better. It'll be tough. She's a good player.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you very much. Congratulations again. We'll
see you tomorrow.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about last night's game?  
COACH COALE: Again, very, very proud of our kids. I thought we made the plays
down the stretch obviously, showed a lot of grit and determination, very, very
proud to be playing in the Elite 8 and to have the opportunity that we'll have
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I guess we'll start with you, Danielle. Kentucky really, I mean, they
used their speed and quickness so well last night, and having seen Nebraska,
were you surprised how well they were able to use that to beat Nebraska and
what are going to be sort of the keys to addressing that tomorrow night?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Well, Kentucky has been doing that all year. They've been
the underdog, and I mean, that's extra motivation for them. And so they
definitely used their speed and athleticism to their advantage with whoever
their opponent is, and just getting out in passing lanes and running in
transition is what they like to do. We know we have to value every possession
and not turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Danielle, it was 20 years ago this week that your school decided to drop
women's basketball. As you know, they reinstated it. What do you think that
would mean? I mean, what has the experience meant to you and your teammates
and your friends, playing women's basketball at Oklahoma? How do you think it
benefits young women?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Well, it's definitely a blessing and a great opportunity
that we've all received to go and play -- come and play at the University of
Oklahoma. You can just tell how special the program is and how much it's been
through by the stories that you hear from Coach Coale about when they weren't
really supported, and now we have one of the top five attendances in the
nation. It's just a special privilege to be able to play for such amazing
coaches and be supported like we do in the state of Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about, it's sort of interesting that you guys sort
of all this season have been thinking you have yourselves as the underdog
because of what you lost, but Kentucky will try to say, Hey, we're more the
underdog. We haven't ever been in this position before. Talk about just what
that sort of means in terms of the mentality going into this game. You guys in
a lot of ways have to feel like the favorites because you've had this
experience before?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, we definitely come in with a lot of experience,
especially previous season, Final Four appearance. So we have to use that to
our advantage. And we have three special seniors that we don't want to lose
yet, so we're going to do all that we can to spend as much time as we can with
them.  
  
Q. Amanda, Kentucky is sort of a newcomer to the big stage in women's
basketball. How much do you know about Kentucky just in general? Were you able
to watch them much? Do you know anything about them other than what you've
learned in the last six, eight hours?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I watched them a little bit when they played Michigan State,
and I saw a little bit of their fight and fire and how they got out and ran in
transition. You know, saw a lot of film today.  
They're just a team that plays hard. I mean, they're scrappy. They're going to
find a way to get in people and to get baskets. We're just going to have to
keep our composure and use our basketball IQ to outwork them and outsmart
them.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk a little bit about Victoria Dunlap and who she
reminds you of from the Big 12?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: All of them are pretty athletic. They work hard, and you
know, they're fast. We've got quickness, too, so I mean, it'll be a great
match-up. The game will be fun.  
  
Q. For Nyeshia, you talked a little bit last night about how you thought
about the maturity that you had learned in the last two years really helped
you last night as far as being aggressive and taking those shots. What do you
think last night's win did for, I guess, this team going forward?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: It just showed our toughness and like our will and how well
we play for each other and how much we'll fight. It just showed that we've
been there before and that if we ever get in a dog fight like that, we won't
back down.  
  
Q. Abi, talk a little bit about how the preparation for playing Kentucky
would have been different had you played Nebraska, a team you know very well,
against a team that OU has never played in the history of the program?  
ABI OLAJUWON: Well, obviously the familiarity is something that we came in.
When we played Notre Dame, that was something -- we had played them before. We
knew what they did and didn't do and now we have to base everything off film
and what we've seen in the NCAA Tournament.  
I think that they're a very fast team as you can tell, and Victoria Dunlap,
you don't become SEC Player of the Year just by doing nothing. So she's an
amazing player, and I feel like at the end of the day we played in the Big 12,
and it's the No. 1 and hardest conference for a reason and we played day in
and day out different kinds of teams that are very versatile. It kind of
reminded me a little bit about Texas A & M, how fast they are and especially
how scrappy they are. So I feel like even though they are a different team
that we've never played before, the dynamics of them are a lot like Texas A &
M.  
  
Q. This is for both Amanda and Abi. One of the things Connie Yori said she
thought really hurt Nebraska very badly last night was they got out-rebounded,
and they got out-rebounded by a smaller team. You know, they have Dunlap and
basically four guards, so they were out-rebounded by quickness. What can you
do, I guess, asserting your size to make sure you win the rebounding edge?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, I think we just have to be aggressive. We have to be
strong on the boards and make sure they don't -- if we're putting a body on
them, they can't really out-quick us. If we're aware of what's going on at all
times, I think we won't have that problem.  
ABI OLAJUWON: One thing Coach Coale tells us a lot, and I guess it showed
yesterday when Kentucky played Nebraska, rebounding is all about will and
determination. So it doesn't really matter the size. If you want the ball bad
enough, you're going to get it, and I feel like they took a lot of long shots,
and long shots rebound long.  
But our guards do a great job of getting the shots that go over our heads and
pushing the ball, and I feel like that's going to be to our advantage, not
only the post players rebounding. That will help us.  
  
Q. Abi, you had a big game against UALR and Sherri mentioned you were the
best player in practice a day or two later and then you have this huge game
last night. The player you were ten days ago versus the player you are now, do
you feel like you're in a different place that quickly?  
ABI OLAJUWON: I guess it could be the urgency. Every game could be my last and
when you think of it that way and your back is against the wall, you're going
to do anything and everything to make sure that it isn't until it's the last
game and you're okay with it being the last one. But you don't want your
season to end and you do everything in your power to make sure that that
doesn't happen, and I guess just the urgency.  
  
Q. Jasmine, can you talk a little bit about your defense over the last month
and a half?  
JASMINE HARTMAN: I just think it's just being tough and going out there and
playing hard and just trying to stick to the best player and also just --
really just watching film on them.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, after making a shot and having a game like you did last night,
is it easier to go to sleep or harder to go to sleep?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: It's easier to go to sleep, just to know that we finished
out tough and our teammates -- everyone contributed, and it wasn't -- people
like to blame and point fingers at the end when it comes down to one shot, so
yeah, I think it's a lot easier to go to bed at night.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about how well this team has played in close games
this year and the belief that this team appears to have that they're going to
win every game down the stretch when it's tight?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I don't know, it's just our heart and our passion for winning
games. I mean, we've been in situations all year where we've either been close
or in overtime, and when you've had that kind of experience, you learn what to
do and what not to do, and I feel like we've learned that over the year.  
You know, we just stick together. We don't play as individuals, we play as a
whole, and when you have a group of people that do that, I mean, that's how
you become successful at the end.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you guys had 21 assists last night. Talk about how well this
team is sharing the ball.  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yes, very well, and typically to me, honestly, I think we
share a lot all the times. Last night we just happened to knock down shots,
and it's a big difference when you're going in -- our guards and everything,
we fed Abi, you know, we just basically turned out big, and it was like, okay,
we're going to finish this out and get the W. So we just found it deep within
and knocked down shots.  
  
Q. Amanda and Nyeshia, about Abi, if you're willing, as she sits next to
you, the last ten days, just what you've seen from her and where she's -- just
where she is now.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She has been unbelievable over the past couple days, couple
games. You can see it in her eyes how much she wants to win. You know, it just
shows what she's done over the year and in the off-season has been paying off.
I just want nothing but the best for her, so as long as she keeps doing what
she's doing, I'm fine with it.  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: As far as me, Abi has done great things throughout the
season, but I could just go back to what she says. Now I think she gets it.
She sees a sense of urgency, and she knows that we need her every time. She's
been great. You can look back every time as a team we've been successful and
won. I think there's just a sense of urgency for her.  
  
Q. Danielle, do you enjoy going against an opponent that really goes against
your strength? Kentucky is a team that's going to attack, put a lot of
pressure on you guys, bringing the ball up the court. That's your bread and
butter, what you specialize in doing. Do you sort of enjoy that because you're
confident in your ability to do that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Oh, yeah. We're definitely confident in everything that we
do. They pressure us, but it's nothing that we haven't seen coming into this
game. The best thing is you can attack it and exploit it, and that's something
we have to do for 40 minutes tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you return to your locker room, and
we'll now take questions for Coach Coale.  
  
Q. I know you've addressed this a lot, but I think for outsiders who may
just sort of be tuning in to see what Abi has done when she waited for three
years. You talked to the Big 12 tournament about how these kids got better
every day even though people didn't know it. What about the character that
that takes to sort of wait your turn and wait as long as she did.  
COACH COALE: Well, I think that there are very few young players anywhere
today who are even okay with sitting as a freshman. I mean, kids today come in
and they want to immediately play for 35 minutes, and they think that that's
-- that they're entitled to that because they got a scholarship. That's the
mindset.  
Abi was so different from that and so refreshing. It wasn't as if she said,
Oh, I'm okay to come and sit on the bench for three years. She said, I want to
come and get better. When I play, I play. When I can help you, I help you, and
I just want to get better.  
Why else would she choose to come to Oklahoma and play behind Courtney? And
Courtney deserves a lot of credit for Abi's development, as well, going
against her every day in practice and being unrelenting. Courtney and Abi had
known one another for years, and trust me, every day in practice, Courtney was
never nice to Abi, and that was probably the best thing she could ever do to
her to make her better.  
Abi is just one of those great stories, never complained, never whined, never
felt like she was getting the raw end of the deal. She just came to work and
got better every day, and then when it came time for her to have her
opportunity, she just took full advantage of it.  
Last night was just -- good story. That's the way that's supposed to happen.  
  
Q. Sherri, going back to Doug's question about 20 years ago, can you take us
back to what you thought? You were a Norman High in March of 1990. Can you
take us back to what went through your mind when you heard that news and just
sort of reflect on how far it's come in 20 years and what you can even achieve
tomorrow night?  
COACH COALE: Well, of course I was a student at Norman High. You left that
wide open.  
Yeah, I was teaching senior English at Norman High School, and I remember
vividly, I went into the teacher's lounge to get my attendance records out of
the mailboxes where we all go, and a couple of the guys who teach upper level
courses at Norman High who were just sports junkies stuck their heads around
the corner and said, Did you just hear what happened? I said, No, what just
happened? They said OU just dropped their women's basketball program. I said,
No, they didn't. They said, Yes, they did. It was just on the radio. I said,
Is everything on the radio true? No, promise, it's really happening, it's
really happening. I said, They can't. They said, They did. I said, They can't.  
I walked out the door and went back to the north gym and wrote my practice
plan for the day. That's really all I thought about it at the time. There was
this little thing called Title IX that wasn't going to let it stick for very
long. So I watched on TV and watched the players and I felt horrible for the
players who were losing their opportunity to compete. Watched nationally at
the coaches' convention as coaches en masse just rallied around and said,
Don't let this happen at one of the major institutions in our country. Don't
let it happen, and they didn't, and the program was reinstated.  
It was a tough period and obviously a tough mark on our program, but you know,
sometimes what you do after the dark day is the most important thing. I will
never forget when we went to the Final Four in 2002, and it was in San Antonio
ironically, just a fantastic place for the Final Four. People are everywhere
around the river walk, and that's where I met Kay Yow. She brought a red
ribbon to me, and she said, You don't know me, but my name is Kay Yow. I said,
Yes, I do know you. She said, What a moment, what a moment for this sport that
this program was dropped and here you are in 2002 at the Final Four. That
should be a message to everyone who has a women's basketball program, that you
can do anything you want to do, and that was my first encounter with the
legend Kay Yow. I walked around the river walk and saw a lot of folks wearing
red ribbons on the lapel of their shirt, wearing ribbons to say look what can
happen.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, would you agree that the events of that week, I
think it took a week for them to reinstate the women's program, was a catalyst
for the success that followed, at least the interest -- it seemed like a lot
of people back then became aware of women's basketball at Oklahoma and kind of
agreed, well, okay, maybe we should give it more support and more of our
attention? Do you think that in the long run looking back it helped the
program?  
COACH COALE: Honest answer, no. When I took over in '96 we averaged about 200
people per game. They hadn't decided yet that it was important. They decided
it was important that somebody should have a program but not that they should
do anything about it.  
For whatever reason, we were able to generate a little bit of excitement and
bring in some players, and when we got the exposure to the right people, it
began to grow and grow and grow. And I really think maybe that's something
that's really unique about Oklahoma. Once we got the product in front of
people -- you've got to give them some reason to come, whether you're giving
tickets away or you're having a carnival or whatever it might be, get them in
there. I knew if we got them in there that Oklahoma people would love our
product. I knew that they would fall in love with our effort and the way that
we competed for each other and everything that we stood for, but we had to get
them there.  
It was kind of like the old Herbal Essence -- I'm really going to date myself
now -- where they told two friends and they told two friends and so on and so
on and so on. That's how we built it. That's what happened. We were able to do
that because we had some phenomenal kids who were just willing to lay it on
the line and let people fall in love with them, and that's what happened.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've been asked this a million times, but for those of us not
as familiar with your program, you have a lot of familiar names to a lot of
sports fans in Olajuwon and Roethlisberger and you had the Parises. Is there
somebody about your program where there's a comfort level with either the
siblings or with the parents of these players?  
COACH COALE: No, I don't coach the siblings nor the players' parents. It's
just mere coincidence. I found Carlee Roethlisberger doing a coaching clinic
in Ohio, and after the clinic person after person after person came through
and said, Hey, have you seen this kid at Findlay. I said, Where's Findlay? I'm
in Ohio. I have no idea; not where we go to recruit quite often. After about
the sixth person said it, I was like, Who is the person at Findlay? Who is
this kid and why is she not going somewhere? And the next person in line was
Carlee's high school coach, and she said, Actually, she plays for me and her
name is Carlee Roethlisberger. And I said, Okay. Carlee what? And she said,
Roethlisberger and shook her head like this. That was the extent of our
conversation. It never even went any further. I said, Okay. Sent T.K. up to
watch her and we loved her. She's a great kid and fell in love with her work
ethic and her ability and signed her.  
Same thing down the stretch. I had recruited Courtney and Ashley for a long
time before I figured out who Bubba Paris was. So it's about the kids.  
  
Q. I asked the players this about their belief that they're going to win
close games. When you're in the huddle and you're looking them in the eyes, do
you get a comfort level there with what they believe they can do?  
COACH COALE: These guys have great eyes. They're full of faith and belief and
commitment, and they lock in on me in huddles. They listen. They buy into
everything. They buy into one another. They buy into our coaching staff. I
always tell my point guards that point guards arrive at the gym with their
teammates with their best performance in their eyes. This is a team that
player for player does that.  
Danielle shows up seeing Amanda's best game in her eyes, but I think Abi shows
up seeing Nyeshia's best game in her eyes, and it's just passed along one to
the other, and I think that's something special that keeps us playing.  
  
Q. Your famous manifesto that you wrote before you got the OU job, I know
all about it except what's in it. I'm not asking for everything that's in it,
but did you have any kind of vision for what you could achieve, and is this
something close to it, Final Four with Stacey Dale, the Final Four with
Courtney Paris, on the verge of another one if you win tomorrow night without
either one of those, I mean, just consistent top-level success?  
COACH COALE: Well, you would be sorely disappointed if you saw the contents.
You know, what is that, the rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
I mean, it was an outline of my vision of how I could get from where we were
to where I wanted to be, and is this what I envisioned? Absolutely.
Absolutely. Just didn't have a timeline on anything. I felt like we could
become one of the elite women's basketball programs in the country. I didn't
see any reason why not.  
For one of the same reasons I loved the Norman High School job when I took it
barely out of college was, you know what, they win football championships all
the time. They win volleyball championships all the time. There got to be
athletes walking around the school. We've got to be able to win. It's a
culture of success. You go to the University of Oklahoma, it's a culture of
success.  
Shoot, I walk around campus and go to head coaches' round tables and I'm like
12th on the list in terms of success and we're about to go to the Final Four
again. You walk in last year after the Final Four and a couple people won
national championships, and you're like, Oh, we went to the Final Four.  
That's what happens. It's a culture of success, so why could we not be
successful? There was a reason. So of course there was a vision and the
infamous manifesto was simply how I figured out that I wanted the job and
thought I could do the job. It was more a message to myself than anyone else.
It was a process.  
  
Q. Danielle I think said that Kentucky, they've seen pressure before, that
it's nothing they haven't seen, but Nebraska and Michigan State, they've all
said that's pressure like we've never seen. Do you think they know what
they're in for just based on what you've seen the last few hours?  
COACH COALE: Well, I think we have a pretty good guess because we play in the
Big 12 south. If anything can prepare you for that, it is that. We've played
Texas A & M three times. We've played Baylor three times. We've learned some
things about ourselves over the course of that. And I agree if you have not
been on the floor with that, watching film doesn't do it justice. Sitting
court side doesn't really do it justice. You have to be out there on the floor
with it.  
I do think they're a little different from A & M. They're not as long as
rangy. They may be faster, though, if that's even humanly possible. But I
think the way that they play, the relentless waves, that's very much like
Texas A & M, and that's probably the greatest comparison, even more than the
athleticism is just the unrelenting defense, and it never changes. It never
lets up, regardless of what's going on, score, time, et cetera. So I think
we're probably just about as prepared as anybody could be.  
  
Q. It seems like this offense is really in the best rhythm it's been in all
season, and obviously that will come into play as you're facing Kentucky's
defense.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think rhythmic offense is often as a result of trust, and
the more you play together and the more you buy into one another, the higher
your level of trust, and thus the improved performance.  
I made a great point that's often taken for granted. Someone asked about the
assist total, and you can ask our guys when I come in the locker room after a
game that's one of the first things I point to, that's what I talk about at
halftime. She simply said, We made a lot of baskets. It's awful hard to get
very many assists if you're not making baskets. There have been games this
year where we've shared the ball, but when the ball doesn't go in, you don't
get an assist for it. I think that's what makes those numbers so pretty from
last night. We did make baskets.  
But I do think our rhythm is good. I think we're sharing it, and I think that
begins with Danielle Robinson. She has just got to play at the right pace and
she's got to handle the tempo, and I'm personally very happy for her that she
has been on the floor with Texas A & M three times because she has allowed it
to speed her up in the past, and I think she's figured out how to prevent
that, and I think she'll be a key obviously tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How have you changed as a coach, not psychological, not dealing with
personality and that kind of stuff, but just strategy and in-game stuff? Are
you a lot better than you used to be, or was that always easy? How do you
think you've progressed just X's and O's wise?  
COACH COALE: I'm sorry. I just keep thinking about this tee shirt I have that
says, "The older I get, the better I was." I don't know why. I just can't get
that one out of my mind.  
I don't know. I think the development of my staff as much as anything, the
amount of faith and trust I have in them and the way we are together. I
probably spend a lot more time focusing on offense now, and Chad Thrailkill I
say is in charge of our defense, but we rotate assignments every year and he
is in charge of our defense. He and Jan often talk at time-outs about changing
coverages or swapping match-ups or whatever, how we're guarding ball screens.
They're kind of figuring that out while I'm thinking about what we want to do
on offense next, and I think that balance and that faith that we have, how we
all work together, that's helped me, I think, improve and grow and make better
decisions.  
Hopefully I'm getting better. Hopefully I'm better right now than I was last
year. That's kind of the idea just like a player. You want to keep getting
better and better. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be as good as Tom Izzo. I'm going
to work real hard overnight to see if I can be.  
  
Q. That triangle thing you guys do, is that relatively new or is that
something you've been doing for several years?  
COACH COALE: Triangle thing?  
  
Q. I don't know anything about it, but everybody is saying they're running a
triangle offense.  
COACH COALE: That's hysterical. Yes, Tex Winter actually invented that, and
the Chicago Bulls made it famous, and when we run it, it doesn't look very
much like that at all, but we try real hard.  
We call it cornering -- there are a lot of different names for it, but we call
it cornering. We use it on sidelines. We use it for set situations. We've used
it for entire games. I think against Kansas we ran it the entire game.  
It's just something, it's a way for us to get some action that we can be
successful with, and there are different pieces of that. But it can be a
beautiful offense. Nobody runs it better than Stanford right now in the
women's college game, and I think the key for it all is to have a great
passing post guy, and obviously Stanford has those, and when we put Amanda
Thompson in there, she's pretty good at it, too. And Abi is not bad at it at
all, either. She's thrown her fair share of backdoor passes.  
But it's a beautiful way to play, and it's really a lot less scripted -- I
guess you could run it in a very scripted manner if you wanted to, but it's
got a lot of reads and requires a high level of basketball IQ to really run
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow
evening.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Nebraska - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Your comments about tonight's game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Very proud of our team. I thought they did everything asked of
them tonight. We just wanted to play with a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of
energy, a lot of effort. It's been our formula for success all season. We were
up against a tremendous basketball team tonight, so really proud of our
players, and we will be working hard to try to advance on.  
  
Q. This is for A'dia. Could you just talk about the team's perimeter
shooting? It seemed like with your three-pointers you got a lot of uncontested
shots.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Fortunately we got left open a couple times, and we knocked
down some shots. I'm just glad that they was falling to be able to give us
momentum to be able to pull away in the game.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, just what this means to you guys, the fact that you
got a big win over a top seed in this tournament and now you're moving on to
the Elite 8, what that means to you.  
AMBER SMITH: It means a lot, and we're definitely not satisfied, but we're
going to enjoy this win tonight. Nebraska was a tough team, and obviously
they're No. 1, but we didn't come here looking at seeds. We just came here
just ready to play, and I thought we did tonight.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, it does mean a lot to us, just to know that they're a 1
seed and we can compete with the best in the country. It just gives us a lot
of confidence knowing that we're still hungry and trying to take it even
further.  
  
Q. A'dia, how important was your team quickness tonight?  
A'DIA MATHIES: It was very important, especially every game. We tried to push
the tempo and tried to just feed every team we play up. That's part of
Kentucky basketball, and I think we did a good job of that tonight.  
  
Q. Amber, how difficult was it in the first half when you guys were playing
so well to have to fight through all the foul trouble?  
AMBER SMITH: It was very tough. You know, we just had to stop just reaching
and play fundamental defense. That's what Coach preached us at halftime is
don't play with our hands, move our feet. So I think we adjusted in the second
half and we did better.  
  
Q. A'dia, what changed for you in the second half? I think you had four
points in the first half. What changed for you? What opened up for you, I
guess?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Personally they left me open a couple times. I was able to
knock down some shots and get more confidence and get some momentum, and as I
kept shooting they just kept falling. I think that helped me out tonight, and
it helped our team out.  
  
Q. Amber, what went through your mind when they cut it to seven? Was there
any panic? What went on in the huddle? What did you guys do?  
AMBER SMITH: Coach just told us to calm down and stay focused and take care of
the ball and just be ready to shoot free throws and be ready to make them. So
he just told us to run our stuff because we've practiced it every day, going
through that type of situation. He just told us to focus and take care of the
ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a big game. We'll see you tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously last week you guys had the "home court advantage." What
was the atmosphere like out there and was that difficult at all for you guys
to fight through?  
COACH MITCHELL: It was very difficult at times when Nebraska could get some
momentum, and I was so impressed with our players in that atmosphere because
it was tough. It was loud. I thought the Nebraska fans did a great job of
trying to give their team energy. And I thought we made some pretty tough
plays to answer some big shots that they made when the crowd was really trying
to get behind them. So very impressed with their support that Nebraska
received from their fans, and it was a tough atmosphere to play in.  
  
Q. Can you just, I guess, how important was the way you started the second
half? You kind of created a cushion. It was big enough to hold on.  
COACH MITCHELL: It was a big key. We went into halftime, Nebraska went into
halftime on a 4-0 run, and I was really concerned coming out of halftime that
if we let them get going, it was going to be tough.  
So we talked a lot about the first four minutes. You know, you try to break it
up into four-minute segments. It's been successful for our team to sort of
narrow our focus at times, and so the first four minutes was critical, and I
was thrilled with that start. That was a tremendous start to the half and
allowed us to get control of the game. Really impressed with our players to be
able to do that at this point in the tournament.  
  
Q. Connie Yori talked about Kentucky's quickness advantage. Is that a common
occurrence against most teams, and how did you see that manifest itself
tonight?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I just -- first of all, you have to realize how hard
these players have worked to get into the physical condition required to play
this tempo. I just can't thank -- our athletic trainer does a great job, our
strength and conditioning coach does a great job, but these players have to
commit to what you're asking them to do. And we are pretty much all in right
now with that type of commitment.  
So you can't overstate the importance for our team. We are not tall. We don't
have a lot of size. We do have good, well-conditioned athletes, so that's our
whole method of playing. We have to play with quickness. We have to use the
speed to our advantage.  
And I think the way it manifested itself tonight is very deep there in the
second half, we were still quick inbounding the ball and running it back at
Nebraska, and you can't do that if you're not in shape. So I thought the pace
of the game was where we wanted it tonight, and it was a big advantage for us.  
  
Q. In what ways do you feel like your schedule, especially playing a
perennial power such as Tennessee, has helped prepare you for this tournament
and reach this point?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, our league is fantastic, and we had -- you see four
teams in our league advance to the round of 16. You know there's some really
quality teams and quality players. And so I think the Southeastern Conference
prepares you well for whatever you might see in this tournament.  
I think that's invaluable that you can kind of find out what your personality
is as a team and what works and what doesn't. I think the conference play
really allowed us to establish an identity, and it's been good to us.  
  
Q. When you got up by 16, 18 points, did your strategy change? The kids
really seemed to work the shot clock down like you wanted to, which was the
opposite of quickness.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, that's a tough situation to be in. At times you're
coaching some kids out there that are only human. They know what the score is.
We're trying to tell them to keep pushing. Then there's times when we're
telling them to be smart with the clock. You had to know that a team as good
as Nebraska with those players that we have so much respect for, you had to
know they were going to make a run.  
And so I was just hoping that we would remain aggressive. I thought we got a
little passive there when they made their run. We looked like we had not
practiced much press offense there, and those things happen. You just see
teams all the time in that situation. It happens. We'll work real hard to not
have it happen again, but I was real happy with the way the team played today.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what this means for the program? You guys keep
going further and further in kind of an unprecedented run this season.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we've had that question a few times, and it's not time
for us to attach meaning to or significance to this win. There will be time
for that.  
What we need to do is put our energy into whatever confidence we can gain from
tonight. We need to get that and take it into the next game.  
So there will be a time when we can look -- clearly this is a special group,
special team. I love this team. But it's not time for that right now. But when
the time comes, obviously this will be a significant victory.  
So really proud of our players tonight, thought they gave a tremendous effort,
and you can see they're one of the toughest teams in the country.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Amani Franklin's play? She didn't score a lot of
points, but she had some huge rebounds and big steals at all the right
times.  
COACH MITCHELL: So happy for Amani and Lydia both. I just think they are
playing with tremendous urgency. They are playing with tremendous purpose. If
you could see what I see as far as the growth both of those young women have
made as people and as players, it's really something that is special to me. So
happy I get another practice with those two. So happy we get another game to
play with those two, because they are huge for our team, and they're not
always huge statistically, but they both played with tremendous heart tonight
and tremendous focus, and they were both talking in the huddles about what we
needed to do. So it's a great thing to see those two playing the way they are,
and we are certainly a better basketball team because of the improvements that
they've been willing to make.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll see you tomorrow afternoon.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  77  
Notre Dame - 72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Muffet McGraw of Notre Dame. Your
thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Lindsay Schrader and Melissa Lechlitner played great.
They didn't want their season to end. I thought they did everything they could
do offensively to help us win the game. I thought they beat us from the three-
point line.  
I thought Stevenson, she really played well, five for eight from the three-
point line including the game winner. That was someone we were really, really
trying to guard and just lost her for a second on a number of occasions, and
that was the difference in the game. I thought they rebounded really well,
too. We didn't do a good job on the boards, and our bench, which has been our
strength all year long, just gave us nothing tonight.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about your night offensively?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: Well, if I was going to go down, I was going to go down
swinging. I always told myself that I had to attack the basket, and I sure did
tonight. I should have done that all year. I don't know why I was kind of
holding out. Yeah, I wanted to score. I didn't want to lose, and it just kind
of took over me. But I left it all out there.  
You know, people look around and see I'm not upset, but there's nothing else I
could have done. That's just the way you've got to do it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Oklahoma's inside game and the problems that Olajuwon
caused?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: Yeah, well, we were really, really focusing on Stevenson and
her three-point abilities. So that left her wide open sometimes in the post
area, and she's strong. She's a great player.  
  
Q. Melissa, what was it about the mid-range jumper that was working today? I
mean, when did you feel that comfortable with it and just stay with it?  
MELISSA LECHLITNER: Well, the screens that Lindsay and our post players were
setting were really opening a lot up for me. So right from the getgo, the very
beginning of the game, my first one fell and so I just kept attacking and
using their really good screens after that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about you guys were down I think six points with about two
and a half minutes, 2:40. Can you talk about how you guys regrouped and
attacked and put it into overtime?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: Yeah, we decided to rebound a little bit and get some
defensive stops, and we came down and had a couple of really good offensive
plays, and Skylar hit that big three and sent it into overtime. We just kind
of dug down a little bit.  
  
Q. Melissa, can you talk a little bit about the legacy of this senior
class?  
MELISSA LECHLITNER: Yeah, such a great four years we had here. You know, it's
been fun representing this University, and I wish we could have went a little
further.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Coach has already said that on a couple of occasions you guys
just lost track of Stevenson. Were you surprised that she attempted the three
in a tie game that late in that situation?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: No, I'm not surprised that she shot it. I got over there as
fast as I could, and she let it fly. She was hitting them all game. I guess
that was my fault. I should have been more conscious of where she was.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you return to your locker room.
We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what you had planned for the final 4.4 seconds
and how that all unveiled?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it was a play we've worked on quite a bit, but you know,
it obviously went awry. Schrader was going to throw it to Skylar for three,
but probably in hindsight should have just given it to Skylar right at half
court and let her dribble it down. She probably would have made it because
she's that kind of player. Yeah, it was obviously four seconds, you're going
with your late game play that you've worked on all year long. We didn't -- the
pass was a little off, and they defended it well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the comeback from six down with 2:40 left and talk
about Skylar's three-pointer?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, that was huge. We ran the same play that we got Barlow the
three for in the Syracuse game, and she responded well. She hadn't been
shooting that particularly well all game, but she has the kind of confidence
that I thought she could make it.  
Erica did a good job of screening for her to get her that last three. Lech did
a nice job getting inside the lane to get the three-point play. It was only
two possessions, we got back to back, three points for each, and were able to
get a stop in between, which was the real key for the whole run.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Jasmine Hartman's defense on Skylar
tonight?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought that Skylar got a lot of lay-ups in the first half
that didn't go in for her, and I think it probably frustrated her a little
bit. You know, and then we went into Schrader for a good deal of the time in
the second half. She was able to hit the three, got a couple in transition,
but I think we probably didn't get her the ball enough to really let her do
what she can do.  
  
Q. Just because of injuries and other situations, you guys have really been
kind of up against the 8 ball with size this year having to play such a heavy
guard lineup. Was this a game where that kind of caught up to you in some way
because of the way Olajuwon played and Amanda Thompson?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Olajuwon played really well, and I was disappointed in
our post that we didn't do a better job on her. We worked on some different
things. We were trying to double-team her, and she got some offensive rebound
putbacks and just some easy, easy baskets off of penetration when we didn't
drop in.  
I was really disappointed in the defense we did on her. She played very well,
and I mean, seven offensive rebounds. That's almost as many as our whole team
had. She did a great job hanging on that weak side block and waiting for her
opportunities and she used her size. I thought Erica Williamson might be able
to defend her a little bit better. I thought Becca could be a little more
quicker and Deb maybe could block a shot, but really we were 0 for 3 in
guarding her. She just really outplayed us.  
  
Q. From inside and outside tonight, was there one of those areas that was
more of a concern to you going into the game?  
COACH McGRAW: No. I think we were worried about both. We played about half
man, half zone. I thought they hit some shots on both. They got it inside a
little easier I thought against the man-to-man, but she hit a couple threes on
the man-to-man, as well. You know, we had a really good plan, I thought, going
in, and you know, we didn't get to the double-team as we had kind of worked
on, so that was a little disappointing that we weren't able to get down and
double her.  
  
Q. This was the second time you've played Oklahoma this year. Did you see in
any adjustments they made from the first time?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Olajuwon played a lot better. She just played better.
I thought Stevenson made more shots. Otherwise I thought we did a pretty good
job on Robinson. I thought Skylar's defense was really outstanding on
Robinson. I thought she kept her in check, did a great job on her.  
But their inside game I thought -- really just Olajuwon, I thought she really,
really played well. We did a decent job on Thompson. So I thought Olajuwon and
Stevenson both really stepped up for them.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could sort of just reflect on the season that Skylar has
had. It seems like she's been everything you could have wanted this season.  
COACH McGRAW: She really was. Right from the getgo, she was MVP of the
Paradise Jam. She's been our leading scorer all year long. She's been a close
second in assists, leads us in steals. She'll occasionally be the leading
rebounder if that's what we need her to do. She's our best on-the-ball
defender. She had a sensational year. She really wanted the ball late in the
game, and I was disappointed that we didn't get it to her a little bit more
because she's such a game player. She's so competitive. She just wants to win,
and just really -- she had a great year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Nebraska - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Nebraska Coach Connie Yori and her student
athletes. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH YORI: Well, I want to congratulate Kentucky. I thought they played
really well. They came out and got us on our heels, and we just couldn't get
back to who we were all season until the latter part of the game, and that's a
credit to them.  
You know, I've said, and these guys have heard this probably 1,000 times this
year, ever since we started our conditioning sessions, I said, Guys, if we can
rebound and we can compete on the boards, we can beat just about anybody. And
tonight was an example of us not competing on the boards and the loose balls
and the rebounds went their way and ultimately that was the difference in the
game. But congratulations to Kentucky.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what went wrong, I guess, from your perspective just as a whole
with the team tonight?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, you know, Coach said it. When we defensive rebound, we
can be a really good team and compete with some of the best teams, and we
struggled with that tonight. But you have to credit Kentucky; they knocked
down shots. They shot really well. I mean, kind of like Coach said, we were on
our heels and we never quite recovered from that. But I think how we lost the
game in the last final minutes credits a lot to our character. We never gave
up, we came back, we fought, and it was a bout till the end.  
  
Q. This is for any of you. What parallels do you see between the way this
team played tonight and when you played here a few weeks ago against Texas A &
M?   
KELSEY GRIFFIN: You know, both teams pressure. They're both pressure teams.
Both teams out-rebounded us, and we knew rebounding was going to be important
and taking care of the ball was going to be important in the game. It was good
what they did in the first half as far as what they were able to do convert
off of our turnovers and their steals, and that's what kind of gave them their
lead. Then for us not being able to defensive rebound like we needed to,
battles of possession is a huge thing in basketball and hard to win a lot of
games if you don't win the battle of possession.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about handling the ball against their pressure
defense and how it played out into what you thought it would be going into
this game?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Well, we knew that they were a pressure team, kind of just
to piggyback on what Kelsey and Coach had said, we were on our heels, and we
did a better job later in the game, but initially in the first 12 or 10
minutes, we didn't handle the pressure very well, so....  
  
Q. Cory, it seemed like especially in the second half late you started to
make a run, you started to put things together, but Kentucky just wouldn't let
you get back in it because they started hitting shots. What was your thoughts
on that?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: Well, you know, when we got down, our team never gives up,
and that's the great thing about watching us play is we're going to fight
until the very end whether we're winning the game, whether we're losing the
game, and we never were going to give up and just let Kentucky walk away with
a win, and I think that really shows the determination that we had. We didn't
get the job done, but we still stuck with it and kept in the game and gave
them all that we had until the end.  
  
Q. Cory, I know that this probably stings a lot, but do you have any idea
when it'll wear off and you'll have a second to think about what you guys
accomplished this year, because it was a pretty remarkable season. When do you
think about that?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: Well, it does really hurt right now, and I'm sure it'll hit
us all when we wake up tomorrow morning and don't go to the gym to practice.
But if you do look at our season, we ended up really -- it didn't end the way
we'd like to, but we still had a really good season and we accomplished many
different things for the Nebraska program and we ended up with a strong record
and we were Big 12 champs, so we did some really good things. If you look back
to our season, we still had a really successful season. It just didn't end the
way we wanted it to.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk about the impact of the early foul in the second
half and how that affected the way you were able to play when you came back
in?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, as of late I've been in foul trouble a lot, so I was
kind of used to it. But fouls happen. I have to be able to play through them.
You know, in hindsight probably should have taken the three instead of driving
it all the way, but I tried to stay aggressive. I don't think it really took
me a lot out of the game because I had two more fouls I could potentially get,
and we needed to stay aggressive in order to try to fight back into the game.
So I don't think it really affected how I played too much.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel that maybe there was a lack of energy or your legs
maybe weren't under you or is that not a fair assessment?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I can't speak for the rest of my team, but my legs were fine
for the game. I know -- I do know that all of my teammates wanted this game
and we were all fired up and wanted to play. We were excited to play. We love
playing with one another, so tonight was no different.  
  
Q. Kelsey, the way that you guys started, usually you guys start the second
half kind of surging ahead or at least seizing momentum a little bit. But what
happened there to start the second half because that's when they made their
run to kind of create some cushion?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I don't know. It was just kind of a fight throughout the whole
game. You know, every time it seemed like we could kind of get a little break,
they just hit a big shot or stole a ball. Like Coach said, taking care of the
ball and defensive rebounding was huge, and we weren't quite able to
capitalize on it as much as we needed to.  
  
Q. The seniors can touch on this, just where you're leaving things now in
your final game and where the program has come to in your years here.  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: You know, the thing that hurt so much about losing this game
isn't the game, it's the fact that I'm not going to get to go back and
practice with these underclassmen and the rest of my seniors.  
That being said, I think that we have helped Nebraska put Nebraska on the map,
and I'm so excited to see what the team is going to do next year. They're
bringing in some great freshmen. The freshmen this year got great exposure.
Everyone grew up a lot this year, and so I'm really excited to see where
Nebraska is going to go, and I know it's only going to get better from here on
out.  
Coach Yori is a great coach. She's obviously done great things with the
program, one of the hardest working people I know, and it's been an honor
playing for her, and I know there's only good things to come in the future for
Nebraska.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thanks for coming. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can just pick up where they left off on the senior class in
general. I know you spoke volumes about them all year, but at the end of the
season now.  
COACH YORI: These guys -- our senior class, I can go back as far as seven
years ago and say -- and I said this at that time, that this senior class,
which Kelsey was added to the senior class, but seven years ago when those
guys were sophomores in high school, I said, this will be the most important
class that we'll ever have.  
The recruiting part of it I could foresee ahead that it was going to be a big
class. It was going to be an important class to get us over the hump, and
obviously they've done a lot more than just get us over the hump. I mean, they
have taken us to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, won 32 games, absolutely
shattered the school record, won their -- were part of winning the first Big
12 championship in program history, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things,
but 30-game winning streak.  
These guys are -- I've been a head coach for 20 years, and this is absolutely
the most unselfish team that I've ever coached. They didn't care who got the
credit. They weren't about points, rebounds, stats, minutes. They were just
about being great teammates, working every day to get better, and there's
nothing more that you can ask for as a coach than having an opportunity to
work with the young women in our program who have that great character.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk about how tough this Kentucky team is
to defend because they're not particularly big, but they're so quick and they
have scoring throughout -- all over the court.  
COACH YORI: Right. Well, John Wooden always says that -- he used to say when
he coached, he'd say, if you have three players on your team that are quicker
than your opponent, you have a really good chance to win.  
And if you look at their lineup, they were either as quick or quicker at every
position than us, and that was the difference. They got every loose ball. They
chased down loose ball rebounds. They beat us to the ball. And the collection
of those plays added up to a win for them. They're a very quick team.  
It's not that we lacked quickness, but we weren't as quick as they were at
every position, and ultimately that was the difference.  
  
Q. You shot 60 percent in the first half and then the first six minutes
nothing went your way in the second half. I know that they asked the players
about that. Just your comments on the start to the second half.  
COACH YORI: Well, we didn't do the things we talked about at halftime. We
wanted to pound the ball inside. We didn't get the ball inside enough tonight.
And that's been our bread and butter all year, and we did not take advantage
of our size advantage on the low block. We just didn't get enough post
touches. And finally when we did you could see Cory score down there and
Kelsey, as well. We just didn't get an opportunity to get the ball inside
enough.  
They hurt us. Again, they got us on our heels, and I really felt like to start
both halves, I mean, their energy level was very good. You're always going to
play a little bit quicker to start the half because you're a little more
fresh, and I thought that's where the game was decided, at the beginning of
each of those two halves.  
  
Q. That quickness that you talk about, how much of that was something that
you fully anticipated coming into this, and what did you want to do other than
take advantage of your size to counteract that?  
COACH YORI: Well, that's the main thing. We needed to -- and we needed to
rebound, and we knew we had to chase down loose ball rebounds. We just weren't
quick to the ball.  
But there's no reason why we didn't get the ball inside more. That's
disappointing that we weren't able to do that. You know, we knew they were
quick. They're not a big team. We watched plenty of film. We knew they were
quick. We tried to simulate it. You do the best you can to simulate it but
hard to simulate.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Congratulations
on a great season.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  77  
Notre Dame - 72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Oklahoma, Coach Sherri
Coale and her student athletes. Coach, your thoughts about this evening's
game.  
COACH COALE: I could not be more proud of these kids, just a relentless, gutsy
effort. The way we've won a bunch of games this year. Just so proud of player
after player. I could talk about each one over and over.  
I thought Notre Dame was fantastic, as well. I think this was one of those
games that can really grow the sport of women's college basketball. It was a
clean game. One team would score, the other team would answer with a basket,
another basket. Just a high-quality basketball game. Notre Dame is a fantastic
team. I don't get speechless very often, but I can't think of anything better
to say other than I'm just really, really proud of this bunch of kids.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you said earlier in the week that if you got the chance at
another game winner like that, you were going to make it. Can you talk about
that play and what was going through your mind when you got the ball and the
shot clock about to go off?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yes. I mean, I played it back in my head before we played
Notre Dame tonight, about how much I ran from it in my sophomore year. I was
like, you know what, I'm not going to do this to my team, and I want to play
some more. So I just said, hey, when the clock is running down, if you're not
going to take it, who is, so I just jumped up and shot it.  
  
Q. Abi, Muffet McGraw was just saying she thought the biggest difference
between the time you guys met earlier this season and tonight's game was your
play. Can you talk about how much you looked to take it inside against their
post players and how much you took advantage of that?  
ABI OLAJUWON: I think that honestly just comes with experience. We played them
very early in the year before we even started our conference play. As you
could tell this year our conference was very hard, and having those games
every other day gives you great practice, and even going against scout, that
always helps a lot, and I just feel like I feel more familiar with being on
the court.  
Then it comes with -- we had no intention of going home tonight. I kept
saying, we have practice tomorrow. As much as in the past I'll go, oh, man,
there's practice. When you're saying -- you can't wait to practice. You would
give anything to practice. I knew Amanda and Nyeshia knew that we were ready
to stay.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about what was going through your mind that last
possession, last 30 seconds and the way the play developed, and just take us
through that whole sequence?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, they scored, of course, and the game was tied up, so
I'm like, all right, we've got to do something. Time is running out. And you
know, we've been in tight situations like this, but I felt like, well, my
role, even though I want them to go in always thinking when the ball is going
to go off, so the majority of the time I'm thinking, get the rebound, get the
rebound or just do anything so they won't get the ball and go down and score.  
So I mean, I knew we had it before Ny even got the ball. I knew she was going
to be open, and I was going to get the rebound. But I was so happy that she
made that shot. I mean, it was huge. It was huge. It was amazing. I'm proud of
her.  
Two years ago it was a whole different story, and it's -- when you do the
right thing, good things happen to good people, and she's a great person, and
I'm glad it happened to her.  
  
Q. Amanda, I wonder if you could sort of expound on what Abi has meant to
the team this year for somebody who had to play behind Courtney for three
years and everything she's done to be able to play as well as she has as a
senior?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I feel like she's committed herself to getting better. She
worked in the off-season and just put herself in a position to be successful
during the year. You know, every game she was just a step closer at getting
better, getting better, getting better. What a great time to be such a
dominant player. Her presence on the court is unbelievable. Our point
differentiation is positive when she's on the floor. It's just a whole
different game.  
She showed that today, being down there battling, and we're talking, and she
wants every possession. And when she has that attitude, we're going to be
successful, and I'm happy for her, too.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, can you talk about sometimes when the other team hits a big shot
to go into overtime they take the momentum. Can you talk about when you
huddled up there after Diggins hit the shot to tie it, what you guys were
talking about going into the overtime?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Basically that we've been in these situations way too many
times to just die and give up. Overtime battles, I mean, we've won throughout
the year, so we weren't nervous or anything about it. We just said, hey, we
get another five minutes, so here we go, so as soon as we started the tip,
just get the ball rolling.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you and Sherri a minute or so after the game hugged at mid-
court. Can you let us in on what was said between the two of you?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yeah, she said that -- basically she was just very proud of
me, and she was like -- what did you say? What did you say? She was like --
no. She said, "Are you mature or what? Are you mature or what?" And I'm like,
"I'm mature, Coach. I'm mature."  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you've had some games late season where you got really hot at
the end of the game and you did that tonight but you were hot early, as well.
Can you talk about why you think you got in the flow of the game so early and
throughout the game?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yeah, it basically shows when I really want the ball. Every
time I caught it, my feet were ready and my hands were ready and my mind was
ready to shoot. I never hesitated, and I think that's what made me knock down
baskets early.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, have a good evening. Questions for Coach Coale?  
  
Q. Sherri, looking back through all the scores this season, when Nyeshia
hits four or more three-pointers, you guys are 8 and 1 now. Can you talk a
little bit about her scoring?  
COACH COALE: Yeah. Obviously when you play a team that runs a lot of zone,
you're going to have to make some shots from the perimeter. I thought the fact
that she started out the game making a few really relaxed us and felt like we
could go back to her late in the game. I think they did kind of lose her a
bit. They concentrated obviously very hard on her after she hit an early one
but kind of got lost a little bit a couple times in the second half and we
didn't find her and felt at the end like we could.  
She's been that thing for us, that spark, and when we get those three-point
shots along with the penetration that we get from D. Rob and then the post
play we get from Abi, then we've been obviously pretty successful.  
  
Q. Just wondering when you play in the Big 12, very tough conference, that
meat-grinder schedule, how that might help you when you get to NCAA Tournament
times and games like this?  
COACH COALE: I think it makes you tough. I think it makes you physically and
mentally tough. We have had to play every possession all year long. We haven't
been good enough to take any off. We just can't win if we do that. These guys
have figured out how to concentrate, concentrate more on the possession than
the scoreboard, and I think that really was reflected tonight.  
Just I felt like we were in the middle of every play instead of paying
attention to the score and the time and all the things that go with all the
hoopla that comes with being at the Sweet 16. We just played basketball
possession.  
  
Q. I'm looking at Jasmine's line, and it's sort of okay just to look at it,
but she seemed like in the half court offense to be the one who was able to
find those open people and turn those into made baskets. Comment on what she
was able to do for you tonight.  
COACH COALE: Well, she does a really good job of attacking the gaps of the
zone, and she sees herself as a passer. And so obviously she's going to be
able to find guys at the block who are stealing out. Did a really good job, I
thought, deep in the shot clock a number of times, the ball in her hand deep
in the shot clock, and she was patient, patient enough, didn't panic. But the
thing Jas did all night was guard Skylar Diggins, honestly, and the two for
three from the three-point line was gravy.  
  
Q. Obviously the stakes were high in this game, but would you say this was
one of your better all-around games, the Sooners' better all-around games all
year?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I have trouble comparing games. I really do. I would probably
have to watch the film before I could tell you that, because in my mind right
now about all I can see is Nyeshia's three ball going in the basket, so you
might want to get back to me later on that one.  
  
Q. At the end of regulation you had the ball in a similar situation, about
30 seconds or so left, but they had three fouls to give, I think. Did you know
you were in trouble in terms of with that many, it would be tough to get a
decent shot in the last second?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, we knew they had fouls to give, and I thought Muffet did a
great job of strategizing the final seconds there. We were trying to get deep
enough to inbound it and have -- we didn't want just one second on the clock.
We thought if we could have three on the inbounds, we could catch it and shoot
it and maybe get a foul that way. But a little too much time clicked off the
clock there at the end. I was trying to call time-out, but I guess I wasn't
yelling loudly enough.  
  
Q. Sherri, for Abi to go 35 minutes tonight and play as well as she did, I
mean, I know you've been talking all year about how she committed for her
senior year, but this is probably a centerpiece game of that commitment.  
COACH COALE: You know, everything about this game I thought was kind of how
it's supposed to be for this senior group. Nyeshia and the similarities from
two years ago and the reflection of her growth.  
And then Abi over the course of a season; you know, she just deserved this
stage and she deserved that performance, and every time Notre Dame scored, Abi
was our answer. When we were grinding it out around the 10-minute mark, she
just was undaunted in the post. I loved her demeanor. I loved her focus. I
loved her rebounding. I just thought it was fantastic and so appropriate for
her.  
And I think a big part of her performance tonight came from how well she
played in the first and second rounds. It's that confidence that just
continues to build. I don't think she's anywhere near as good as she has a
chance to be at the next level.  
  
Q. Jasmine has had some really good defensive games. Can you rate this one
compared to some of those most recent games?  
COACH COALE: Well, based on the way Skylar has been playing of late, this
would have to be one of her top two or three. She's committed as a defender,
and she likes that. She relishes the opportunity to guard the opposing team's
best perimeter player. All night long basically she did exactly the right
thing.  
Right at the end she went under the old screen and gave Skylar the three and
she was fighting like crazy to get over it and Skylar made a great play. It
was a tough shot, people running at her. But aside from that, it was a pretty
flawless defensive performance on her.  
  
Q. Two-part question: One, did Nyeshia get your conversation pretty close to
straight? And second, at the risk of being corny, can you talk about just sort
of the cool aspect of the NCAA Tournament and what it can do for somebody like
Nyeshia redemption-wise?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, we won't get corny. This will be good. Yeah, the
conversation was pretty much that. I said, "My, how you have grown up. Are you
mature or what?" She was yelling right back in my ear, "I'm mature, Coach. I'm
mature." It was pretty funny. But I just told her how proud I was of her and
her growth, and it couldn't have happened to a better kid in a better
situation, and I just wanted her to soak it all in.  
As far as this stage and this tournament and what it can do for you, most of
the success in life is about being confident and about believing you can do
things, and the really superior part of athletics is that it can teach you
that if you let it. It teaches you that confidence is something you give
yourself. You earn it and then you give it to yourself and then you accept it,
and nobody else does that for you. And if you can learn that lesson through
collegiate athletics, you can be successful at anything you do.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much, and congratulations. We'll
see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Nebraska Huskers Coach,
Connie Yori. Coach, congratulations on a great season. Your comments, please.  
COACH YORI: Well, we're excited to be here. Obviously when we saw the pairings
come out and we were in the Kansas City Regional, we were very excited about
that. Obviously heading to Minneapolis was a good thing for our program in
terms of proximity to our state to get fans to get up there to watch us, and
then getting back here was obviously an important step for our program, and I
understand that we might have a few fans here tomorrow night and hopefully be
on.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH YORI: Our schedule for tomorrow? Is that what you're asking? Well, we're
going to sleep in a little bit, and those guys that need to go to church,
they'll have the option of doing that. And then we're going to be watching
some film throughout the day, and we've got a shoot-around in the afternoon.
So we're going to try to get three meals in in about a six-hour period. I'm
sure our players will enjoy that, especially some of them.  
It's a late game, and that's just the nature of this, and we happened to draw
the late game. It doesn't matter what time we're playing, we're going to play.
It will be a late night, and if we were to win, it's going to be a short
turnaround, but we'll deal with that if that happens to take place.  
  
Q. Have you noticed the similarities between your program this year and
Kentucky's? Both teams have the Conference Player of the Year, the Conference
Coach of the Year. Both teams made great strides from disappointing seasons
last year. It just goes on and on. You would think that would make for a good
match-up.  
COACH YORI: Yeah, there's no question a lot of parallels there. You can go
back a little further. My first year at Nebraska we were picked last in the
Big 12, and we met our expectations that year and actually finished 12th. And
Kentucky this year being picked 11th and being able to finish in second place
in the SEC is just a phenomenal coaching effort and player effort.  
I mean, these guys -- I mean, Kentucky is every bit as athletic as anyone in
the country, and coach has done a great job of getting those guys to play at a
high level, to play with a great passion and a great energy, and you know,
they definitely provide some issues, will provide some issues for us.  
But definitely some parallels there, two teams that got it turned around. But
you know, the thing about us is two years ago we felt like we were on track to
make something special happen in our program and then got hit by the injury
bug. Obviously last year we didn't have the season we wanted to, but at the
same time, you know, injuries are a part of the game.  
  
Q. Connie, beyond the track of the programs at Kentucky and Nebraska and the
similarities you mentioned, do you see any similarities in the way the teams
are built this year between Victoria Dunlap and Kelsey Griffin having some
similar roles in their teams and also the players on the perimeter?  
COACH YORI: Well, Kentucky basically plays four perimeters and Dunlap, and
Dunlap is as athletic a player as there is in the country. She is a phenomenal
athlete and scores in a variety of ways. They definitely provide a lot of
problems for us really on both ends.  
There are some similarities in that both of us do want to get up and down the
floor. I do think it's going to be a fast-paced game. I don't think -- whoever
is operating the shot clock tomorrow night, they could probably have the night
off, because I think it's going to be up and down. That's who we are, that's
who they are, and both of us will be picking up in the full court. They do a
little more in their full court defense than we do, but they're just
phenomenal athletes. They've got great athleticism across the board, great
quickness across the board.  
  
Q. You mentioned kind of earlier in the week maybe some of that pressure is
off a little bit because you got those first two wins in the tournament. Do
you feel like you're playing with house money a little bit this weekend, or is
it that much that the pressure is off?  
COACH YORI: Well, I guess we're going to find out. I feel like there's been a
little bit different level of comfort with our players the last couple days in
practice, and maybe that's partly me. But also I felt like we played a little
bit tight in the first two rounds. We've never been in this situation before,
and so I felt like there was some pressure to get back here to Kansas City.  
Now, obviously I think we've practiced really well the last two days, and I
think that we'll be ready to go, and I think we're well prepared, but it's
just going to come down to how our players are feeling and then it's going to
come down to execution.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on Kentucky and getting your team ready, but I'm
sure you noticed that Baylor won today, beat the No. 1 seed, Tennessee. I'm
just curious on your thoughts on how that makes the Big 12 look, what you
thought about that.  
COACH YORI: Well, we're the No. 1 RPI league in the country, have been the
last three years, Big 12 is the best league in the country top to bottom with
depth. Baylor lost to Missouri this year. Missouri finished 12th in the
league, and you just -- that's just the nature of our league. Everybody in our
league is very, very good. Baylor finishes 9 and 7 and think just knocked off
the No. 1 seed in the country, so what does that say? It says our league is
great. It says our league has tremendous depth. There's great coaching in our
league. There's great players in our league.  
  
Q. Is there any specific ways you can think of that the Big 12 prepares you
for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, lots of ways. I mean, competition level. We have seen night
in and night out the best competition in the country, and not to say -- take
light of any other league, but from top to bottom, as I said, I think our
league has really prepared us well for playing against just about anybody. And
style of play, I think we're going to see a little bit different style of play
tomorrow night than really anyone that we see in the Big 12. But I think UCLA
helped to prepare us for that a little bit.  
You know, our league, top to bottom, you're going to see a variety of
different defenses, a variety of different offenses. You're going to see just
about anything that you can imagine in basketball in our league, and that's
what also makes our league that much more interesting. I think the ability to
be versatile in the Big 12 I think is important. I think that's one of the
things that makes us -- has enabled us to make the run that we have during our
Big 12 season.  
  
Q. Speaking of UCLA, you guys came out pretty cold against UCLA. Can you
talk about what might have been a factor in that and how you guys plan to not
do that again?  
COACH YORI: Well, UCLA is good. They're a top 25 team. We were the only No. 1
seed that played a top 25 team in that round. They were the best -- a team
that should have been a little bit higher draw or had a little bit higher seed
based on what they had done. You know, bottom line is that they came out and
played with a lot of energy. We didn't handle the pressure early, but then we
settled down, we got poised, and we did a better job of handling it.  
  
Q. Kentucky does a great job of forcing turnovers. I think it's like 10
steals a game or something they're averaging. But coming off the game that
Lindsey Moore had, how important will she be to the game plan and just taking
care of the basketball in general?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, that's an understatement. They do a great job of stealing
the ball. They had 30 steals in their first two NCAA games, so again, you're
talking about a team that's just about as athletic as anybody in the country
and plays small ball and just really provides a lot of problems for you really
on both ends because of that.  
Lindsey has had a great freshman season, and she's played better and better
throughout the year and has really taken control of our team. You know, she's
going to have to do that tomorrow night, as well.  
But also you can't put all the onus on Lindsey. You've got to have other kids
handle the ball. Talking about versatility, we have four ball handlers on the
floor a good portion of the time. The fact that Kelsey has the ability to
handle the ball, Yvonne and 'Nique can both do that for us. Hopefully that
will help us tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Just curious, you mentioned you talked about Victoria Dunlap and what
type of athlete she is. What do you see between her and Kelsey Griffin, how
that match-up will play out tomorrow?  
COACH YORI: Well, I don't know what they're going to do in terms of match-ups
and whether they're going to use her to guard Kelsey or not. I haven't been in
their scouting report sessions. But I do know what we're doing to do, so
you're talking about two very athletic players.  
You're talking about two players that run the floor very well, get easy
baskets in transition in both cases. You're talking about two very good
rebounders. You're talking about two versatile players who can put the ball on
the floor who are both very good defenders. So there are a lot of parallels
there.  
  
Q. Do you think that as much problems as a pressure defense can have on an
offense, do you think it kind of plays into your style of play and that you
can score quickly and create mismatches?  
COACH YORI: Well, you've got to handle the pressure. You've got to handle that
first line of defense and then more so you've got to handle that second line
because I think they do a really good job not in just their first rotation or
first line of defense, but they do a pretty good job in the rotations, as
well. We're going to have to handle the pressure, and if we can do that,
that's what pressure does.  
If you can handle it -- there's a couple different ways you can look at it.
You can handle it and look to attack and try to get easy baskets or you can
handle it and set up your offense. We're going to have to be smart in, first
of all, handling it and then take our moments where we can be aggressive and
then also be smart if we need to pull it out.  
  
Q. A follow-up to the answer you had about Lindsey Moore a few minutes ago.
I know she's proven herself to you all year and you don't really consider her
a freshman 34 games in, but did she do anything in the first couple of rounds
with her poise and especially the way she handled the defense against -- the
UCLA defense that impressed you even more?  
COACH YORI: I watched Lindsey play a lot in high school. My assistants watched
her a ton in high school. We knew we were getting a very good point guard when
she came here to Nebraska. We knew the kind of poise that she showed. We know
the kind of competitor that she is. So what she did in the first two rounds
did not surprise me. I just think that's who she is. I think she's a very
competitive kid who may not make the right play every single time, but she
will learn from her mistakes and then try to correct them.  
  
Q. First game in Kansas City since the only loss of the year. Are you kind
of glad it's not over at Municipal and it's at Sprint?  
COACH YORI: Well, I'll just tell you what, our locker room is a lot nicer than
Municipal. We've got a 60-inch flat screen TV in our locker room right now, so
that's kind of sweet. No, we don't mind playing at Municipal, but obviously
this is a great facility. We're glad to be at the Sprint Center.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. We'll see you
tomorrow evening. We're now joined by our Nebraska Huskers student athletes,
Kelsey Griffin, Dominique Kelley and Cory Montgomery. We'll take our first
question for the floor.  
  
Q. Cory, have you noticed the similarities and the parallels between your
team and their team? You both have the Conference Coach of the Year, you both
have the Conference Player of the Year, both have under .500 disappointing
seasons last year and this year you're having the best season in program
history. That seems quite a coincidence, isn't it?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: It is. Someone actually pointed it out to me the other day
about all the similarities. There are a lot of similarities. They're a really
versatile team. They love to push the ball, play tough defense, and those are
some of the qualities we use in our game in our style of play. It's kind of
like playing yourself in a way for some of the things that they do, and you
know, they're a tough team and they're going to be a tough opponent.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about the challenges that your backcourt is going
to face against a lineup that a lot of times has four guards on the court and
just if you've seen anything similar to that through the season and what you
expect?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Yeah, well, we play in the Big 12 conference, so we're used
to the quickness and the get-up tempo. But they're definitely -- we've seen a
lot of similarities actually in the UCLA game in that they're going to get up,
throw a lot of defenses at us, they're going to pick the ball up in the
backcourt and just pressure us for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk a little bit about Victoria Dunlap and what kind of
problems she poses for you guys?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Definitely. Her athleticism, I know about being a little
undersized so that by no means can't -- that by no means means she won't be
able to score in the low block. She's very quick off the dribble, a versatile
player. So yeah, she's going to pose a lot of problems. But not only that, she
can also get up and defend, as well. She's definitely a focal point.  
  
Q. All the history that's been made this season, now you're 24 hours out.
Can you describe the anticipation?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Yeah, you know, it's great, but at the same time, it's more
than just a game. You know, we're enjoying hanging out. I don't know how long
I'm going to get to hang out with these girls on a day-to-day basis, and so
we're excited about the game. We're ready to play, but at the same time we're
going to make the most of this experience.  
  
Q. Kind of a question for all of you. Last time you guys were in Kansas
City, you lost. Do you have to exorcise a demon at all here or is it just good
to be so close to home?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, we don't really look at it as comparing then to now.
We're not even playing in the same building or the same court, you know, so --
I think it just depends on a game-to-game basis. We're going to come in and
we're still going to shoot with confidence and play our game of basketball and
we'll see what happens once game time comes. But we're not playing in the same
arena. We're not looking to the past. We're only focusing on the task at hand.  
  
Q. I know you always want to win, but there's been a couple weeks now and
you've had some other games now since the loss in the Big 12 tournament. Did
it relieve any pressure at all no longer being "undefeated"?   
CORY MONTGOMERY: I think it does. We didn't focus too much on the fact that we
were undefeated. Every opponent is going to give us their best. We have to
prepare and we have to be ready for that. We do have less pressure right now
that we feel, you know, we've gone to the Sweet 16 and we're showing that
we're a good team and we worked hard to get to where we're at. So we're going
to just keep going out and playing Nebraska basketball and keep playing as a
team and doing the things we've been doing all year long.  
  
Q. Dominique, Kentucky has been described as a high-pressure kind of a high-
octane team, but do you think that that type of style can play into the
strengths of your team and that you can score quickly and that you can take
advantage of mismatches and handle adversity?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Well, like Corey said, I think we see a lot of similarities
in our ballclub that they have, as well. I think it's going to just be more
about seeing who can take care of the ball, who can handle the pressure and
always a big focal point for us to rebounding. We feel like if we do those
things, then we'll put ourselves in a good position going into this game.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you speak to the suggestion that there's less pressure on you
guys now and how exactly that works? It seems like Sweet 16 would be a time
where pressure is kind of heightened?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Yeah, it's true, but the thing about this team is, you know,
after our wins and our losses, we've always gone back to the drawing board. We
know we've made mistakes, and this year has been about continual improvement
and making the most of the opportunities given. So where it may seem more
pressure has been added, we know we've prepared really hard and we've put the
time into the gym, not only in the weeks prior to this but even over the
summer, that you deserve to make the shots because you've worked hard to get
in the gym and make those shots.  
So for us, yeah, there may be pressure, but as far as making history for our
program and things like that, it's just all about the ride. We're just
enjoying the experience.  
  
Q. Kelsey, as it goes with most teams Kentucky is better at home than they
are on the road. Do you expect this to be kind of a home court advantage being
three hours from Lincoln?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I sure hope so. We have some awesome fans. I believe even
though it's a late night on Sunday, the Nebraska people are just crazy enough
to make it out and pack the gym. So I sure hope it feels like a home court
advantage. However, we're not -- we don't prepare for home games differently
than away games, so that doesn't change the game plan a whole lot. But I know
our fans are amazing, and I'm expecting there to be a lot out there on Sunday.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk a little bit about Lindsey Moore? Obviously she's
been great all year, but coming off the game she had in the last round, career
high in assists, and especially going up against a team like Kentucky who
turns the ball over, how important is it to have confidence in a young player
like that in how she'll do?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Yeah, Lindsey, if you didn't look at the roster, you wouldn't
expect her to be a freshman. She knows the game obviously really well. She's a
smart player. She knows how to play under pressure, doesn't seem to phase her.
I wish I had more years that I could play with her to be honest.  
I'm not expecting anything different or anything less than what she gave,
probably something more, if I know Lindsey at all, for our game against
Kentucky. I think it'll be a challenge. They bring a lot of pressure, but I
know she's more than willing to rise to the occasion.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you all very much. Congratulations on a
great season. Good luck tomorrow night.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to start with the University of Kentucky Wildcats,
Coach Matthew Mitchell. Congratulations on a great season. Your opening
comments.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you very much. We are excited to be in Kansas City,
really appreciate the hospitality that's been shown so far. It's been a great
experience up until now, and we are looking forward to getting out on the
floor and practicing today, have a very, very tough opponent in Nebraska. We
have a lot of respect for their team and how they play, so we have a tough
task tomorrow night. But we are looking forward to the challenge and think our
players are ready to get it going.  
  
Q. You had such a great leap forward this year from last year. Was there a
time this season when you began to realize that this could be a really special
year for you and the players?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it was a gradual thing that happened. It was not an
"aha" moment or something like that. I think that early on we found out that
we had a team that was willing to work extremely hard, and they were able to
sustain that over the course of the season.  
I think our game against Louisville was the first time where I felt like they
were able to execute a game plan, get themselves mentally, emotionally ready
to play. I was impressed by that. So that gave me some confidence in the team
going into conference play. And then we've just had some really good games in
the conference. I think the biggest time for us was a road trip. We beat LSU
on a Thursday night and Mississippi State on a Sunday, and when we did that,
probably solidified it with me that we could be pretty special.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 9:00 tip and the kind of things you'll have your
players do during the day tomorrow?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we're thrilled to be playing at 9:00 and happy about
that. We have a chance to play one of the best teams in the country, get into
the Elite 8. So whatever time they wanted to set the tip-off is fine with us.  
Tomorrow we will have our normal game day activity. They'll have a little bit
of extra time maybe to rest in the afternoon. We'll encourage them to do that,
but I don't think that's going to play a huge factor.  
I think when you get to this point, certainly we are excited to play, and I'm
sure Nebraska is, and things like that have not really bothered our team very
much this year. We're thrilled for the tip-off, and we're looking forward to
it.  
  
Q. Wondering about your reaction to what just happened on ESPN. I'm sure you
saw Baylor beat Tennessee, and how it may or may not affect your feelings
about this. One, you've got a Big 12 team that beats the SEC champ, but also a
No. 1 seed goes down in the Sweet 16, so just what are your thoughts about
seeing that and its relation to tomorrow night?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we were practicing, so I didn't see it. I feel bad for
Coach Summitt, who gave me a tremendous opportunity to be in this business,
and I feel bad for our conference to lose somebody out of the tournament.  
As it would relate to our game, I don't think it will have much impact. You
know, we have done a great job all year of trying to keep whatever challenge
we have next right in front of us and trying not to think a lot about external
things.  
So I don't think it'll impact our team at all, give us more confidence or less
confidence or more anticipation to play or less. I just think that we have a
pretty focused group, and I think they will put all of their energy into
getting ready to play Kentucky basketball and getting ready for a very, very
good Nebraska team.  
But it's funny, we haven't paid much attention to other people in the
tournament just because that's sort of what we've done all year, just stayed
focused on what we need to do, so I don't have much of a reaction other than I
hate it for Coach Summitt and hate it for the SEC.  
  
Q. Do you have any thoughts on the similarities between your program in this
situation right now and Nebraska's? Both of you are having school-record win
totals. You both have the conference player of the year. Both of you came from
way back from last year, disappointing years last year, to great years this
year. There seems to be a lot of similarities in the two programs right now.  
COACH MITCHELL: I think it makes for one of the most interesting match-ups
we've had in the tournament. I just -- I know how hard our team has worked
this year and how committed they've been, and so I know Nebraska could not be
where they are now had they not had something similar to that.  
So obviously I don't know much about their team or what happens inside their
program, but you just have to know that that's a committed group of young
women that have played very hard and probably didn't listen to a lot of people
outside of the program, and I think that's the great thing of what our kids
did. We were picked 11th, and all we ever told them is we'd never coach them
like they were going to finish 11th; we would coach them in anticipation of
finishing first. So I'm assuming Connie probably had the same type of message
to her group.  
I think it's great when young people can be rewarded for hard work and putting
everything they have into something and not listening to other people and
letting other people define who they are, so I think it's two teams that are a
good example of that.  
As far as on the basketball court, I think there are a lot of similarities.
You know, some of the places where -- I think they're a little bit better
three-point shooting team. We may cause a few turnovers. But other than that
the scoring is pretty close, the points allowed are pretty close. It seems
like it ought to be a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your regard for the Big 12, your level of respect
for the Big 12 as a women's basketball conference, and if there's any common
threads you see that run through those top teams in the league?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, first of all, we have tremendous respect for the Big 12
and think it's a great women's basketball conference. I'm impressed with the
commitment to all the -- that all the schools have made to women's basketball.
That's very impressive to me. It seems like everybody in the league is very
committed to women's basketball being excellent. A lot of great coaches,
similar to the SEC, and a lot of good athletes, real athletic league.  
So I think it's a tremendous test for us to play the champion from the Big 12.
Nebraska proved they were the best team in a great league this year, so we
have a lot of respect for the Big 12.  
  
Q. When you've taken a look at the UCLA game that Nebraska played, do you
see a lot of similarities in how UCLA tried to attack Nebraska with pressure,
tried to disrupt Nebraska with what you've tried to do all year? Are there
similarities or are you really a lot different than UCLA in the way you try to
trap and distract?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, conceptually we probably are similar as far as their
concept is trying to pressure and trying to get you to turn the ball over,
speed you up. We're very different in how we try to do that. They mix their
defenses a lot, and they run a lot of combinations, combination defenses, what
some people call junk defenses, triangle 2, things like that.  
We are a pretty straightforward team, man to man, very little zone. So I don't
think we pull a lot of punches. We're going to just try to play extremely hard
and pretty fundamentally sound man-to-man defense and try to extend that
sometimes, but I didn't see a lot of similarities between us and UCLA.  
  
Q. Just wondering where this team's psyche is right now, where they are
mentally, physically, and how they feel about coming into a big game like
this?  
COACH MITCHELL: I've been real impressed with them. They impressed the heck
out of me against Michigan State with how they handled that situation. I think
they got a lot of confidence from that. So I haven't seen anything that would
concern me. So disinterest, people acting like we've arrived at the place
where we're going to be and that's good enough for them, lack of focus, any of
those things that I might be trying to watch for and be concerned about,
haven't seen it. I've seen a real upbeat, energetic group, extremely focused.
The last three days of preparation have just been outstanding. We had a very
good practice this morning.  
So I'm going in with a lot of confidence, and you know, it's all about what
the players can do at this point mentally. I think the game is going to be won
with which team can execute and really work through adversity and all those
things you have to do in a basketball game.  
We have a tough, tough team to play. The only chance we have is to go out and
give it everything that we have, and from that standpoint, I think they are
there. I think they're mentally there, ready to go out and give a great
effort.  
  
Q. What's your biggest concern with Nebraska and with Kelsey Griffin? Is it
that amazing to see one player coming back and making this kind of impact for
a team?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, first of all, she is amazing. She is an amazing
basketball player. It would be hard for me to be more impressed with someone
than I am with Kelsey Griffin. She gets a lot done just with her physical
strength, her determination, just a really tough player.  
We put together personnel edits so our players can get familiar, and you watch
her, and she takes so much contact at the basket, and a lot of players can do
that, not a lot can finish the way she does with contact. She gets to the line
a ton. She's very, very physical and tough.  
And then you put that on top of a player coming back is extremely impressive.
So you see what a difference that she can make in this team, and basketball is
a funny game; one person can make a huge difference on a basketball team, and
by no means are they just Kelsey Griffin. They have a really good basketball
team. But concerning her, I'm just really, really impressed and would love to
coach someone like that. So that's the highest compliment I could pay her.  
And then the team, what concerns me about Nebraska is just their balance and
the weapons that they have offensively being able to score. When you average
the points that they average and you have four of your starters in double
figures and you have the ability to shoot the three and then a dominant inside
player, it's just an extremely difficult team to play against because a lot of
times you're looking for weaknesses, who can I play off of here, who can I
back off of, who can I -- how can we find a weakness there, and it's hard to
do with them on the offensive end.  
I think we'll have to do a very good job of playing as close to our identity
as we can, trying to make everything for them tough, and that's not going to
be easy to do. They're a fine basketball team.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if they remind you of any teams that you've played, and I'm
also wondering if you've seen other teams attempt to play the kind of ball
pressure that you guys apply.  
COACH MITCHELL: You know, they remind me of really no one specifically in our
conference. They have pieces of teams, but that's what makes them so good.
They just have a little bit of everything.  
So not anybody that just jumps right out at me, but I've watched a lot of
tape, and it's -- they've played obviously some really good teams. It's just a
little -- I'm interested to see what will happen here. This is a great team.
We're going to try to take out of their -- I'm not giving away any secrets
here. I'm sure they understand what we're going to try to do. We're just going
to try to make it really, really tough for them to run things.  
Now, they're so talented, they make us look pretty silly out there trying to
do that. I don't know. We have a lot of respect for them. They're very good.
But we'll certainly try to stick with what has us -- you know, dance with the
one who brung you I guess is what we'll do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow night.  
We're joined by our two student athletes from Kentucky, A'dia Mathies and
Victoria Dunlap.  
  
Q. Victoria, what are your thoughts on Kelsey Griffin? I'm sure you've seen
film. She's the Big 12 player of the year. You're the SEC player of the year.
What are your thoughts on her?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think she's a great player. She has a variety of ways to
score. She's very mobile at the post with her size, and just has a lot of
threats.  
  
Q. Victoria, would you figure on guarding her quite a bit? I know you
probably will switch around some, but it'll be you two for quite a bit of the
time, wouldn't you think?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Yes, Coach talked about who's going to be guarding her
starting the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, I'm wondering you're going in as the underdogs, I guess,
because you're the lower seed. Is that a role you're comfortable with and kind
of what's your thinking of being the underdog?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think all year we've been the underdog with a lot of games,
but our mentality is just to go in as we're the top dog and not worry about
what they're going to do but what we're going to do as a team. Coach is going
to make sure that our mentality is just go out there, play hard and strong and
not worry about anything else.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, I think the underdog role, it's less pressure actually. I
think when you just go out there and play Kentucky ball and just be aggressive
and play defense, I think that's going to help us out tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Victoria, have you noticed similarities between the two teams? You both
have made great strides from last year. You both were about .500 last year.
You both have the conference title of the year, you both have the conference
player of the year. You're both having the greatest season in school history
as far as total wins. There's a lot of similarities between you two it seems
like.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Yeah, I guess if you go back and look at all the different
things. But I think one thing that we'll definitely have is just our speed and
our transition play that we'll definitely get out and score a lot of buckets,
and that's just our maybe focus that Coach talked about, just getting out --
that's how we've beat a lot of teams, just getting out in transition and using
our quickness.  
  
Q. A'dia, was there a game this year in which you felt like after the game
in the locker room, the team felt like you had turned a corner and maybe you
were having a more special team than when the season first started?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think it first started at the Louisville game, especially
since they had lost like five years previous in a row, and made that
turnaround and just a good performance by everybody that game. That really
showed everybody else what kind of season we could have and the season that we
thought we could have.  
  
Q. Victoria, you said this team feeds off of crowd energy and you're not
necessarily going to have a blue crowd the way you did at Freedom Hall. Is
that a concern? And then also, the 10:00 start, Eastern Time start, a concern
when you're trying to play with a lot of energy?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It would be nice to have a lot of fans here, but whoever is
out there we're still going to feed off them. I know they're going to be loud
and really energetic. That's not something we can focus on as a team. We have
to concentrate on each other's energy and how everybody else is playing as a
team.  
And 10:00, it can be a factor, but we're not going to let it be. Coach says we
can't worry about when we're playing, whether we're playing at 10:00 at night
or 10:00 in the morning, no matter what we've got to come to play.  
  
Q. Victoria, in looking a little bit more at that match-up that you're going
to have with Griffin, can you compare any similarities in the way that the two
of you play? I know you both lead your teams in scoring and rebounding and
seem like pretty athletic post players. What kind of stuff when you watch her
play do you see that looks similar or maybe different to your game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think similar, we get the ball at the high post. We're both
drivers going to the basket. I've seen a couple times where she's done a
little turnaround jumper in the paint. I guess we just have the versatility of
both of us, just being able to go off the dribble or shoot a pull-up jumper or
outside shot and just having -- the team relies on both of us to score to play
well. That's it.  
  
Q. A'dia, there were a lot of question marks before that Michigan State game
about how you guys were going to handle the game and a bigger team and that
kind of stuff. Did that game give you guys a lot more confidence that you can
play on this national level with some of the best teams?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I believe it did. This showed that we can compete with the
best, and they was a big, physical team. I think the edge factor was our
speed, and we just use our speed to our advantage. That's just the way we
play, and I think that's how we're going to play the next game, too, and I
think that's going to hopefully come out with the same outcome.  
  
Q. Victoria and A'dia, do you guys ever remember starting a game as late as
10:00 Eastern Time?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: In AAU maybe. That's the last time I remember playing late is
in AAU.  
A'DIA MATHIES: We have curfew.  
  
Q. A'dia, you guys don't have any seniors in your starting lineup. You have
one who comes off the bench who played quite a bit or started early in the
year. As a freshman can you talk about your mentality in this NCAA Tournament
when you have not had any experience in this event and just how you think the
team with the experience factor handles this, as well?  
A'DIA MATHIES: We have one starter, Amani Franklin, in our lineup. She's a
senior. But I think just coming out and playing as hard as I can is basically
all I really try to do, because since I haven't been here before, there's
really no pressure or anything really to me. I just go out there and play and
be aggressive like Coach wants me to. I think that really helps us out because
when there's no pressure, you can basically do everything you want to do.  
  
Q. For both of you, Coach talked about he thought the biggest fear for him
because you guys had felt like you had arrived because you were at the Sweet
16. How do you ward off those feelings and those thoughts?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: We just come out from the beginning. First it starts off with
us in practice and then in shoot-around just showing that we are in tune and
mentally focused about what we have to do on offense and defense and then take
that into the game in the beginning and play hard and not let up and not have
any false efforts or anything.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, I think we just -- we realize that we can go even
farther, that we realize that we haven't just arrived. We're going to make
this year even special-er (laughing). So I think he's keeping our focus and
keeping us grounded and letting us know that even though we have had a good
season, we can be even better, so we're listening to that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck, have a great game tomorrow, and we'll see
you tomorrow.

CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+%26+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

### [Amanda Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19485)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Coale has joined us up here at the head table. Coach
Coale, welcome and congratulations on a great season and your comments.  
COACH COALE: Thank you so much. We're honored to be here and excited about the
opportunity that awaits us and excited to be back in Kansas City. It feels
like we just left a day or two ago. Excited to be back here and ready to get
it going.  
  
Q. The last time you played Notre Dame, Whitney had just been injured in the
game before and didn't play. People probably didn't know their roles. How
different are you this time going against Notre Dame?  
COACH COALE: Completely different. You know, I think every team progresses and
changes throughout the course of a season and grows their own identity, but
particularly a team that changes personnel as emphatically as we did at that
point, because Whitney was our -- she and Danielle are really our returning
leaders who had had such experience in the previous season in the Final Four
run.  
Whitney had really become our heartbeat. She had become our identity. Even
last year I thought down the stretch in the NCAA Tournament that we played in
her likeness as a team, took on her personality and her demeanor. So to lose
her and have basically less than 24 hours to recover and play, I'm not sure we
had any idea who we were when we played Notre Dame in the Virgin Islands.  
We're just obviously over the course of the season, we've figured out how to
win games. It's not always pretty, but it's been quite effective, and guys
know the roles and have accepted their responsibilities and have done a
phenomenal job, and I'm really proud of our team. I think the great thing
about it is we're still getting better. We're still learning and improving and
evolving.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, you don't see a lot of rematches at this point. Are
you happy you had the chance to play Notre Dame before or would you rather
come in with a little element of surprise to it?  
COACH COALE: Well, when you play the free conference schedule that we do, we
were bound to play somebody that we had already played before. I don't know
that it matters at all. I think Notre Dame is a different team, and I think
they're better.  
Skylar was so young and trying to figure out what her role was as a freshman
surrounded by all those seniors. Peters didn't play when we met in the Virgin
Islands. So I think we're both different teams than we were at that time.
Maybe a little bit of familiarity, and excited about the opportunity -- we are
anyway, about competing again.  
  
Q. Just trying to get an idea of what difficulties Danielle presents for the
defense. What match-ups are difficult to handle her?  
COACH COALE: Well, Danielle is difficult for a lot of people because of her
quickness, and it's one of those things that's very difficult to judge.
Obviously Notre Dame has seen her before so they understand how fast she is.
It's a combination, she's very fast and she's also very quick, and those two
things together can obviously wreak some havoc.  
Skylar is quick in her own way, too. She's got fantastic hands and is a good
ball handler, as well. I don't know that it'll be necessarily any different of
a challenge than what perhaps Notre Dame has seen from some teams along the
way.  
  
Q. You've got three senior starters. Notre Dame has got a bunch of seniors.
When you've got a bunch of seniors in a game with both teams, how does that
sort of stamp a game at this level?  
COACH COALE: I think it depends on the team and the kids, also. I've seen
seniors try to hard and press and get in their own way, and then I've seen
seniors be so hungry and so unrelenting that they become super human. So I
think it can be an either/or or maybe a combination of. I always think that
underclassmen play a key role down the stretch. I think it's how your younger
guys handle themselves. They tend to play a little truer to who they are and
what they've been throughout the entire year, and if they can maintain that
consistency, I think that's maybe the little slice that sets the team over the
top.  
  
Q. The first game I think Notre Dame had a big run in the second half. Is
their transition game a main point of concern for you?  
COACH COALE: Well, Notre Dame does a very nice job with the ball in
transition. They take opportunities and take full advantage of them. But what
happened in the second half in the Virgin Islands is Danielle got into foul
trouble and we didn't have any idea how to play without her on the floor at
that time. So I don't necessarily -- I just think that situation is completely
different than what we're seeing now. I hope so, anyway.  
  
Q. Going back to the seniors, just talk about how your three seniors have
played here down the stretch as a group. It's been solid these past few
weeks.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I could not be prouder of Abi, Ny and Amanda. They've been
phenomenal all season long, and the way they practice every day, their work
ethic, their continued willingness to learn, the glue that they've been for
the younger guys in teaching them how to be a team and how to work and how to
have high expectations. And interestingly enough, the three of them, or at
least a combination of two out of the three, have been really, really good
over the last month and a half, and in our game against Arkansas, Little Rock,
none of the three were very good offensively, anyway, against Arkansas, Little
Rock. And the other guys -- well, Abi was really good, I take that back. Abi
was really good in that game.  
When all three of those guys have really been sitting on all cylinders, then
some pretty magical things have happened for our team. I like the way our
three seniors' mindset is right now. I think they have a steadiness and
excitement about them that's really refreshing to see.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH COALE: You know, I assume you're referencing UConn. Okay. I understand
both sides of the argument, I really do. I get both sides of the argument. But
any time a team has done something as phenomenal as the University of
Connecticut has done, it takes not just the basketball world and the sporting
world but the world at large, it takes them by storm.  
And some people who maybe aren't even sports fans pay attention to the fact
that somebody has just done a phenomenal thing. I realize that I've heard Geno
talk about (inaudible), and I agree with that totally. But to a non-sporting
group of people, John Wooden's record has been surpassed, and that's
newsworthy. That's conversation at cocktail parties and at dinner. And if
they're talking about women's basketball, that has to be pretty good for
everybody involved.  
Yes, it's up to all of us to stop that streak and get right up there with them
and create streaks of our own. But at the same time, I think we'd be remiss if
we didn't piggyback on the audience that this is reaching and take advantage
of it.  
Back in the day, and I've said this many times, back in the day when we were
trying to build our program and trying to get a full house (inaudible), and
most of those people kept coming back when Connecticut left because they
wanted to watch Oklahoma. So for all of us to have this opportunity to share
in this broad light that Connecticut has brought on the sport of women's
basketball have an opportunity, and need to look at it as that.  
  
Q. In the game down in the Virgin Islands, you guys went something like
seven minutes without a basket. Do you chalk that up to Danielle not being on
the court?  
COACH COALE: I had no idea we did that. I'm not really surprised. A big reason
why would be Danielle not being on the floor. Again, being in the Virgin
Islands, the thing that was so disrupting was for the past entire year our
entire backcourt had been Whitney Hand and Danielle Robinson. Whitney and
Danielle were always on the floor. I can't think of a time when one of those
guys wasn't on the floor. So when you don't have Whitney in uniform and then
Danielle is in foul trouble so we don't have either one of them, we're just
trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B, so I'm not sure the
comparison is really relevant.  
  
Q. What do you expect out of the crowd in terms of support for each other?
Is there a chance if the Big Reds get together they can create a home court
advantage?  
COACH COALE: Well, I thought Nebraska fans were phenomenal. I remember
preparing for our game in the semifinal and being in the locker room, and I
could tell immediately, I didn't need to know the score and what was happening
because of the roar in the arena at Municipal. They turn out in record numbers
in Lincoln, and I expect they'll be here in record numbers, as well. What
we're hoping for is a little Big 12 love in the arena tomorrow night and we'll
figure it out on Tuesday if we're fortunate enough tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You made the comment prior to the Big 12 conference tournament that your
team would love -- maybe not you personally, but your team made the comment
that you'd love another crack at Nebraska, perhaps they might get one. You
also get another crack at Notre Dame here, and as you were just asked, playing
here in Kansas City where Oklahoma has had some success in the past, do you
see that as an advantage in your opening game with Notre Dame tomorrow?  
COACH COALE: You know, in a way I do, but I think we as coaches can look at
every situation, find an advantage in it if we try hard enough, and I think
the advantage here is the mindset.  
I think our kids feel comfortable here in Kansas City. I think we feel like we
left some business unfinished in the Big 12 tournament, and I'm sure Nebraska
shares that sentiment, as well. I think when you go through the NCAA
tournament, if you can find ways to get a mental edge, it doesn't even matter
if it's real. What matters is if your kids buy into it, and I think our guys
feel really comfortable about playing in the city.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the balance that Notre Dame has
and maybe the problems that Skylar Diggins presents?  
COACH COALE: As I mentioned earlier, very, very efficient basketball team.
They share the ball well. They pass the ball well. They move without the ball
very well. I think, too, that their big guys, the fact that they can rotate so
many in, they have a very deep bench and very capable players who come in and
spell one another with really very little dropoff; on the guard play, the same
way.  
I think Skylar has just continued to assert herself, and the complexion of
their team has changed as her confidence and her comfort level has improved. I
don't think there's any doubt about it when you watch them play, it's Skylar's
team.  
  
Q. For Danielle, Coach talked a lot about losing Whitney and right before
the last game and how you've since rediscovered your identity. How
specifically did you guys kind of figure out who you were through the course
of the season?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It started with her challenging us when we got back from
the Virgin Islands to step up that much more, each person individually, to
make up for the presence that Whitney had displayed on the floor.  
It was just about us maturing, though, night in and night out and every day in
practice.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the match-up with Skylar Diggins?
I'm sure that as a true freshman she's changed since you last played her. But
talk about what you see and how her game has changed but also how your game
has changed since then.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Skylar is a great player, and she's done some great things
at Notre Dame so far as a freshman. You can just tell that her confidence
level is so much greater now, especially on the defensive end. I mean, that
really creates a lot of easy points for her, a lot of transition lay-ups.  
I guess you can say being a junior also pays dividends just because you've had
the experience and you've been here a couple times before.  
  
Q. Just looking at Notre Dame, a guard-based team, Danielle, how do you
approach a team like that and deal with the -- between the Skylar and Barlow
and Schrader and that whole group?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We just have to play hard on the defensive end. Barlow is a
great shooter. Melissa does some great things at the point guard position, and
Skylar, of course, is pretty much all-around. So it's about guarding one-on-
one, really, and guarding as a unit on top of that.  
  
Q. Danielle, does Skylar remind you of yourself when you were a freshman?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, a little bit, except she's left-handed and I'm not.
But definitely. You can just tell over the course of a season how you've grown
and matured, and she's definitely done that.  
  
Q. I'm going to make Amanda talk. How exciting is it to have a chance to
settle some scores with some people, playing Notre Dame a second time, might
get a chance to play Nebraska again?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think it's exciting, and it's good for women's basketball
in general. We've played them several times. I mean, a couple years ago we
played them in the same kind of tournament, and it's kind of like payback.  
  
Q. This is a question actually for both of you, but I'll start with Amanda
since, Danielle, you've had the spotlight most of the time here. I believe
this is your fourth trip in the last five years to the Sweet 16, and of course
you've been even further than that over that time. All of that time, those
last four years, were with the Paris sisters and others. What's it going to be
like this time as you come into this tournament without Courtney and Ashley?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: You'll just see a different team. We won't rely so much on
the post, and we have strength in all positions. You'll see a little bit of
transition, a little bit of defense, a little bit of offensive execution, and
just playing basketball. When you can dominate all those parts of the game,
that's how you go far.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like Amanda talked about, we're just a different team. I
guess we're more guard-oriented this year than anything, but we have
experience, and that's what we're going to have to use to win some games here
in Kansas City.  
  
Q. For both players, when you look back at the game in the Virgin Islands,
what jumps out at you about either how you played or how they played?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: To be honest, we played horrible. I wasn't going to say --
yeah, it was pretty bad. We didn't have any kind of effort at all. I mean, you
can give some of it -- we were kind of in shock that Whitney wasn't out there,
I mean, on the first game back, but we just played with no life, really.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We just were a different team. I feel like we just -- she
said it earlier, we were in shock, and we didn't know how to make the
adjustment so quickly. We've learned a lot since then, and we took a lot more
pride in our effort and our toughness, and you can see that. We've seen that
over the last couple months.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about the defense in last weekend's games down in
Norman?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: You know, our defense was pretty good. Our defense was pretty
good. We made key stops and we took a little pride in getting scored on or
just playing together, not just one-on-one, you know, helping each other and
blocking out and doing all the little things that count. Now we just need to
make that on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Danielle, you mentioned that Notre Dame game after Whitney's injury, and
you had foul trouble. Was that you trying to find a place and sort of figure
out what you needed to do, or can you just talk a little bit about that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Some of it was just dumb decisions. I mean, one of the
fouls I guess I ran over Schrader trying to get through a screen. It just
wasn't smart plays. Some were fouling in transition. So I guess it could be
out of frustration, could have been out of frustration. But as far as that I
know I need to stay on the floor, and since that game I've made a ton of
adjustments.  
  
Q. Amanda, could you talk about how you and your two fellow seniors have
played here the last few weeks? It's almost as if you don't want your college
careers to end?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Not at all. We're trying to make it to the end, to the very
end. We've worked a lot over the past couple years just developing our game
altogether, and I think it would mean the world to us and our teammates if we
make it to the last game. It would just be fun. You work so hard all year to
be at this point, and it's always nice to go out with a bang.  
  
Q. Danielle, did you run into Skylar at all before you played here? Was
there any USA Basketball experiences where you guys might have crossed
paths?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I've never played against her. I've been in Colorado
Springs with her this past summer when she was trying out for the U19 team and
I was trying out for the World University Games team. Even then I didn't
really get a chance to watch her play because we were on two different
schedules, and when they were practicing we had free time to eat and take a
nap, so it was different things like that.  
The only time I really talked to her was in the Virgin Islands after the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we're going to let you go. Thank you very much.
Best of luck tomorrow, and we'll see you tomorrow evening.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the University of Notre Dame. Coach
Muffet McGraw is here, and, Coach, welcome to Kansas City and the second
round. You said you didn't care to make any comment; is that correct? We'll
just start with questions?  
COACH McGRAW: That's good.  
  
Q. There was a lot of talk with Oklahoma about how they have changed since
the last time you guys have faced each other. How have you guys changed since
late November?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, it was a long time ago, seems like a long time ago. You
know, I thought we played very well at the Paradise Jam. That was a great
tournament and great to see so many of those teams in the Sweet 16. I think
we've played a lot of people and at that time we were still trying different
combinations and we're still playing all those same people.  
I think we've gotten a little bit better just playing together all this time.
We've been tested a lot in a lot of different ways, seen a lot of different
things, and I'm really happy with the way we're playing right now.  
  
Q. How do you deal with the match-up with Danielle Robinson in terms of a
scouting report on what she does best, and how do you counteract that?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't know if you can counteract that. She's got incredible
speed. She is -- she played very well against us last time we played. She's
very hard to contain. You don't see people getting up in the backcourt and
trying to pressure her. I think people have just too much respect for her
speed. I think she's definitely a challenge for our defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how your bench will play a role in this game?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, our bench has been outstanding throughout the Big East
Tournament and the first two rounds. They've actually been leading us in
scoring on a couple of occasions, which is great to see. It's nice to have
that depth. We don't have to worry so much about foul trouble, and we can
really keep the pressure on defensively while we're resting some of our
starters.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how Skylar has improved even since the
last time you guys played Oklahoma, which was so early in her college
career?  
COACH McGRAW: She's had a great year. She has been -- done so many great
things for us. She's really changed our team probably defensively more than
anything. I think she sets the tone for our defense. She gets up and pressures
the ball really well. She's a great passer. She's had over 100 assists this
year. For a freshman that's not even playing the point, I think that's
outstanding.  
She does so many little things, intangible things. She's got the intensity,
the drive, the focus, the sense of urgency that you would think only your
seniors might have. So I think that she's really -- she's played well all year
long. She's been our leading scorer in almost every situation.  
You know, you look at our wins, losses, Big East Tournament, NCAA Tournament,
she's the leading scorer, something we didn't really expect from a freshman.
I'm so pleased with the way she's played all year long, and she's been very
consistent for us and continues to play well.  
  
Q. You didn't have Devereaux Peters the first time you faced Oklahoma. How
might she impact the game?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think rebounding is going to be a big key, and
that's something that we hope Devereaux can do for us. We as a team, we just
need to rebound a lot better, and we'd like her in there because she is
somebody that can really go get the ball.  
But I think overall, all of us need to rebound better. She can help us do
that.  
  
Q. During your time in South Bend, your program has had so many
transformative players I guess you could say. Oklahoma is playing its first
season without a couple pretty transformative ones in Courtney and Ashley
Paris. Can you talk about from your perspective that carryover you've seen
from year to year, you lose a Ruth Riley, for example, how that carries over
and just sort of what you've seen over the years with that?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think that your program develops an attitude of
winning, and no matter who you have in the program, somebody is going to pick
up that attitude. And it's just generated from your best players, but it
really does transcend down to everybody on the team.  
You go through stretches where -- we missed Ruth Riley for quite a few years
after she left. She was really probably the best player ever to play at Notre
Dame. But we have had some very good ones, and I think Skylar is that type of
player for us now.  
But I think every program you go through those stages, and I think Oklahoma,
just what a fantastic year after losing two great players, they have really --
and without Whitney Hand, they have had just a sensational season.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could, what advice would you offer to Nebraska or Kentucky,
their coaching staff? You just talked about developing that tradition of
winning. These two programs didn't have any transition, this year they're in
the Sweet 16. Just what kind of advice would you give them?  
COACH McGRAW: It sounds like she should be giving advice to me. She's the No.
1 seed. I think they've had a great year. You look at seniors, and it's all
about the seniors. They're the ones, every good team we've had in the Final
Four has been senior dominated, and they've been able to just take our program
to places we've never been before, and I think once you get that tradition
started, you hope that the younger players pick up on it and just continue to
understand what it took to get there, and there's so much hard work, and that
next year they can't rest because people are going to be coming after them
without those seniors on the floor.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the rivalry with Oklahoma? You've
played them a couple of times here, and they've been great games with a lot on
the line.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, they're a great team, and any time you play a great team,
it's going to be a big game. It's going to be an exciting game when you have
two guards like Danielle Robinson and Skylar Diggins on the same floor. It's a
lot of excitement every time they get the ball. I think the fans are going to
be on the edge of their seats, and hopefully it'll be a great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Robinson and the unique problems she
presents?  
COACH McGRAW: Just her speed I think is something that you just don't see very
often. She's so good with the ball. She can go either way. She's got a great
jumper. You don't want to foul her because she's a great free throw shooter.
She can get to the rim really easily, and she's a good passer. She's got a lot
of assists. She's got a lot of steals. She's aggressive defensively. She's
that kind of an electric player, and you can see how the team really feeds off
of her.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish
student athletes, Skylar Diggins, Ashley Barlow, and Becca Bruszewski. Ladies,
we're going to take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about Danielle Robinson and just how challenging of
a match-up she is?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, Danielle, she's a great point guard. She's very
athletic, very quick, and is definitely -- she poses as a problem for a lot of
defenders because she can get to the basket so well. She's great in
transition. She does a good job finding her teammates, and her mid-range can
also be dangerous.  
So I think just definitely trying to keep her in front, and it's going to be a
total team effort with that, and just kind of trying to slow them down in
transition.  
  
Q. For Ashley and Becca, for a team that's as veteran as you guys, what's it
like to have a freshman step in and play the way Skylar has played in
season?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: It's good for us. We need somebody to step up like that. It's
like our whole team, we've got people that can score, we've got people that
can defend. We've got a whole team of starters basically, so it's pretty good
that she can step in and pretty much do that.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: She came out with a lot of confidence, really stepped in,
knew her role. She came into the game giving exactly what we needed. I mean,
for her just to add everything that we have to the team already, it's great.  
  
Q. Becca, can you talk about how the post position has developed for this
team through the course of the season and how your depth can affect other
teams?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: Well, we're not the original post players like big presence
inside, but we're quick, we're mobile, we're agile, so we use that to our
strength. The first game against UConn we really didn't have a post presence
inside. So the second and third we tried to pick it up, take them off the
dribble, stuff like that, and that seemed to work pretty well for us, so we're
going to go with that same attack this game.  
  
Q. Ashley, when you're dealing with somebody that quick as Danielle, what's
the philosophy? What's the big picture guard approach to that type of match-
up?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: I guess it's just trying to keep her in front. You've got to
try and just stay with her and not get too close up on her because if you do,
she's good at getting around you and finding other people on the block, and
her other teammates on the wing and things like that. We've just got to keep
her in front and not let her get going. We can't let her get confidence early.
We've got to stay on her from the opening tip.  
  
Q. Ashley, when you look back at the Virgin Islands games, what are your
memories of that, and when you look at the tape of it, what jumps out at you
about either your team or Oklahoma?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: I guess it would be that we were -- we were both different
teams, so that was at the beginning of the season. They got out in transition
on us. We made some big shots in that game. And I guess it's just the whole
thing that we're different teams right now. We're playing better. We're in
tournament mode. We know that this could be our last game, so we're just going
to go out there and continue to play the way that we've been playing all
season, and hopefully we can get our defense going first and get some
offensive things going, as well.  
  
Q. Skylar, since you guys have played in Storrs and Hartford, does that help
when you step into Big 12 country to play in what might be a hostile
environment for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I believe so. Definitely the loudest atmosphere I've played in
would be Storrs and Hartford. But I think it's just a matter of just really
going in with the mindset that you're here with your team. You really try to
stay focused into the game and really not let the crowd get too involved or
affect you too much.  
  
Q. Becca, when you look at Oklahoma's post play now and recent game tapes
versus when they played you the first time, do you see a difference in
improvement there with Olajuwon and McFarland?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: Yeah, she's definitely more comfortable going with either
hand in the post, so before it was easy -- it was better just to jump out to
her left side, but she's more versatile now going right and left, so she's
definitely going to be a post presence inside.  
  
Q. Ashley, you guys played Oklahoma a couple of years ago down at Purdue,
played them in the Paradise Jam. Can you talk about how these two programs
have kind of created a nice rivalry between each other?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: Yeah, I guess it's -- other people putting us together in these
situations, I guess. But we're both taking care of business when we get in our
respective games. So I guess it's been a good rivalry, and we've tried to pick
up the slack a couple years and this year, and we're just going after it, and
I guess it's a good run to kind of be a part of.  
  
Q. For Skylar and for Ashley, everyone talks about Danielle Robinson as a
tough match-up, but Amanda Thompson has got a unique set of skills, as well.
Talk about how you defend her.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, she's a great offensive rebounder. She's a great
rebounder. She's a match-up problem for lots of people because she's just so
big and so athletic. I guess you've got to approach her with just staying in
front of her and keeping her in front of you, as well, and boxing her out
would be a big key for us.  
ASHLEY BARLOW: And I think she's also developed her skills offensively as far
as her mid-range shot and now she's backing up to the three-point line, and
she's definitely developed there over the years. She's definitely a threat,
not only back to the basket or crashing but also in the mid-range game now.  
  
Q. I've got a question for you, ladies. Ashley, you're a senior. What do you
tell Skylar about what to expect in this round of games?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: You've just got to tell her to go out there and do what she's
been doing the whole season. We can't change what we've been doing all year
just for this one game. We've just got to go out and continue to play our
game, and I think we've been doing that pretty well the first couple of
rounds.  
  
Q. Skylar, I've got a question for you. As a freshman, did you think you
were going to go this far?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: You know, I actually did. I think this team did. We've had
high expectations for ourselves since the first day of practice, so I mean,
just -- I knew it from the kind of heart that this team shows and how we push
each other in practice and really go after each other. I mean, it gets pretty
competitive in practice. We just all want to see each other do well. The fact
that we've come together and we know each other's games so well now, we're
playing -- we're kind of hitting on all cylinders now. We're playing some of
our best basketball, so hopefully that momentum just carries over into these
next couple rounds, particularly tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Ashley, you have a senior laden team. Oklahoma has three significant
seniors. When you get to this point in your career, one loss and it's over, do
you see this kind of being a battle of wills, who wants to keep their careers
going tomorrow night?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: Yeah, we've just got to know this could be our last game and
give 110 percent out there. It could be a battle of wills, who wants it more,
so we've just got to go out there and competing to the best of our abilities
like we've been doing the first couple rounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season, and we'll see you
tomorrow evening.
